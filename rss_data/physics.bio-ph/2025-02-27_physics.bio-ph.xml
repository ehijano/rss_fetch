      <title>The role of individual characteristics of human subjects on the radiation burden of the bronchial airways from radon progeny</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variability in radiation-related health risk and genetic susceptibility to radiation effects within a population is a key issue for radiation protection. Besides differences in the health and biological effects of the same radiation dose, individual variability may also affect dose distribution and its consequences for the same exposure. As exposure to radon progeny affects a large population and has a well-established dose-effect relationship, investigating individual variability upon radon exposure may be particularly important. Using the Stochastic Lung Model combined with mucociliary clearance and alpha-particle microdosimetry models, deposition rates and absorbed dose rates were determined for a healthy adult, a 5-year-old child, and an adult with severe asthma. The results show that children receive significantly higher absorbed dose rates in basal and secretory cell nuclei than healthy adults, despite lower deposition rates, due to smaller airways and thinner mucus layers. For individuals with severe asthma, both deposition rates and dose rates are higher due to airway contraction and slower mucus clearance, although increased mucus thickness reduces absorbed dose rates. These findings demonstrate that anatomical and physiological differences significantly influence absorbed doses in the lungs upon radon exposure and highlight the importance of accounting for individual variability in radiation protection and risk assessment.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear contractile response of actomyosin active gels to control signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biological systems tightly regulate their physiological state using control signals. This includes the actomyosin cytoskeleton, a contractile active gel that consumes chemical free energy to drive many examples of cellular mechanical behavior. Upstream regulatory pathways activate or inhibit actomyosin activity. However, the contractile response of the actomyosin cytoskeleton to control signals remains poorly characterized. Here we employ reconstituted actomyosin active gels and subject them to step and pulsatile activation inputs. We find evidence for a nonlinear impulse response, which we quantify via a transfer function $\delta \varepsilon / \delta g$ that relates input free-energy pulses $\delta g$ to output strain pulses $\delta \varepsilon$. We find a scaling relation $\delta \varepsilon / \delta g \sim g^{-0.3}$. The negative sign of the exponent represents a decreased effectiveness of a contracting gel in converting energy to strain. We ascribe nonlinearity in our system to a density-dependent mechanism, which contrasts strain-stiffening nonlinear responses to external stresses. Contractile response to control signals is an essential step toward understanding how information from mechanical signaling processes flow through actomyosin networks in living, and likely also synthetic, cells.</description>

      <title>Symmetries of Living Systems: Symmetry Fibrations and Synchronization in Biological Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A symmetry is a `change without change'. As simple as it sounds, this concept is the fundamental cornerstone that unifies all branches of theoretical physics. Virtually all physical laws -- ranging from classical mechanics and electrodynamics to relativity, quantum mechanics, and the standard model -- can be expressed in terms of symmetry invariances. In this book, we explore whether the same principle can also explain the emergent laws of biological systems. We introduce a new geometry for biological networks and AI architectures, drawing inspiration from the mystic genius of Grothendieck's fibrations in category theory. We attempt to bridge the gap between physics and biology using symmetries but with a twist. The traditional symmetry groups of physics are global and too rigid to describe biology. Instead, the novel notion of symmetry fibration is local, flexible, and adaptable to evolutionary pressures, providing the right framework for understanding biological complexity. In other words, this more general symmetry invariance is necessary and sufficient to ensure that a given biological network configuration can support a synchronized function. In this book, we review the theoretical progress over the last decades from mathematics, physics, computer science, dynamical systems, and graph theory that has led to the discovery of symmetry fibrations in biological networks. These symmetries act as organizing principles for biological networks. They serve as effective tools for describing the structure of these networks, blending geometry and topology. Fibrations explain how structure dictates function across various biological domains, including the transcriptome, proteome, metabolome, and connectome. Additionally, they facilitate a reduction in the dimensionality of the network, simplifying it into its fundamental building blocks for biological computation.</description>

      <title>Bridging Spectroscopy and Advanced Molecular Orientation Analysis with New 4+ Angle Polarization Toolbox in Quasar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Anisotropy plays a critical role in governing the mechanical, thermal, electrical, magnetic, and optical properties of materials, influencing their behavior across diverse applications. Probing and quantifying this directional dependence is crucial for advancing materials science and biomedical research, as it provides a deeper understanding of structural orientations at the molecular level, encompassing both scientific and industrial benefits. This study introduces the "4+ Angle Polarization" widget, an innovative extension to the open-source Quasar platform (https://quasar.codes/), tailored for advanced multiple-angle polarization analysis. This toolbox enables precise molecular orientation analysis of complex microspectroscopic datasets through a streamlined workflow. Using polarized Fourier transform infrared (p-FTIR) spectroscopy, we demonstrate its versatility across various sample types, including polylactic acid (PLA) organic crystals, murine cortical bone, and human osteons. By overcoming the limitations of traditional two-angle methods, the widget significantly enhances the accuracy of structural and orientational analysis. This novel analytical tool expands the potential of multiple-angle p-FTIR techniques into advanced characterization of structural anisotropy in heterogeneous systems, providing transformative insights for materials characterization, biomedical imaging and beyond.</description>

      <title>U-Net 3+ for Anomalous Diffusion Analysis enhanced with Mixture Estimates (U-AnD-ME) in particle-tracking data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biophysical processes within living systems rely on encounters and interactions between molecules in complex environments such as cells. They are often described by anomalous diffusion transport. Recent advances in single-molecule microscopy and particle-tracking techniques have yielded an abundance of data in the form of videos and trajectories that contain critical information about these biologically significant processes. However, standard approaches for characterizing anomalous diffusion from these measurements often struggle in cases of practical interest, e.g. due to short, noisy trajectories. Fully exploiting this data therefore requires the development of advanced analysis methods -- a core goal at the heart of the recent international Anomalous Diffusion Challenges. Here, we introduce a novel machine-learning framework, U-net 3+ for Anomalous Diffusion analysis enhanced with Mixture Estimates (U-AnD-ME), that applies a U-Net 3+ based neural network alongside Gaussian mixture models to enable highly accurate characterisation of single-particle tracking data. In the 2024 Anomalous Diffusion Challenge, U-AnD-ME outperformed all other participating methods for the analysis of two-dimensional anomalous diffusion trajectories at both single-trajectory and ensemble levels. Using a large dataset inspired by the Challenge, we further characterize the performance of U-AnD-ME in segmenting trajectories and inferring anomalous diffusion properties.</description>

      <title>Optimal COVID-19 vaccine prioritization by age depends critically on inter-group contacts and vaccination rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The limited availability of COVID-19 vaccines has prompted extensive research on optimal vaccination strategies. Previous studies have considered various non-pharmaceutical interventions, vaccine efficacy, and distribution strategies. In this work, we address the combined effects of inter-group contacts and vaccination rates under contact reduction, analyzing the Spanish population's demographic and age group contact patterns and incorporating reinfection dynamics. We conduct an exhaustive analysis, evaluating 362,880 permutations of 9 age groups across 6 vaccination rates and two distinct, empirically quantified scenarios for social contacts. Our results show that at intermediate-to-high vaccination rates with unrestricted social contacts, optimal age-based vaccination strategies only slightly deviate from older-to-younger prioritization, yielding marginal reductions in deaths and infections. However, when significant reductions in social contacts are enforced -similar to the lockdowns in 2020-, there are substantial improvements, particularly at moderate vaccination rates. These restrictions lead to a transition where infection propagation is halted, a scenario that became achievable during the pandemic with the observed vaccination rates. Our findings emphasize the importance of combining appropriate social contact reductions with vaccination to optimize age-based vaccination strategies, underscoring the complex, nonlinear dynamics involved in pandemic dynamics and the necessity for tailored, context-specific interventions.</description>

      <title>Differentiable Imaging Meets Adaptive Neural Dropout: An Advancing Method for Transparent Object Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Label-free tomographic microscopy offers a compelling means to visualize three-dimensional (3D) refractive index (RI) distributions from two-dimensional (2D) intensity measurements. However, limited forward-model accuracy and the ill-posed nature of the inverse problem hamper artifact-free reconstructions. Meanwhile, artificial neural networks excel at modeling nonlinearities. Here, we employ a Differentiable Imaging framework that represents the 3D sample as a multi-layer neural network embedding physical constraints of light propagation. Building on this formulation, we propose a physics-guided Adaptive Dropout Neural Network (ADNN) for optical diffraction tomography (ODT), focusing on network topology and voxel-wise RI fidelity rather than solely on input-output mappings. By exploiting prior knowledge of the sample's RI, the ADNN adaptively drops and reactivates neurons, enhancing reconstruction accuracy and stability. We validate this method with extensive simulations and experiments on weakly and multiple-scattering samples under different imaging setups. The ADNN significantly improves quantitative 3D RI reconstructions, providing superior optical-sectioning and effectively suppressing artifacts. Experimental results show that the ADNN reduces the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) by a factor of 3 to 5 and increases the Structural Similarity Index Metric (SSIM) by about 4 to 30 times compared to the state-of-the-art approach.</description>

      <title>Towards a robust approach to infer causality in molecular systems satisfying detailed balance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ability to distinguish between correlation and causation of variables in molecular systems remains an interesting and open area of investigation. In this work, we probe causality in a molecular system using two independent computational methods that infer the causal direction through the language of information transfer. Specifically, we demonstrate that a molecular dynamics simulation involving a single Tryptophan in liquid water displays asymmetric information transfer between specific collective variables, such as solute and solvent coordinates. Analyzing a discrete Markov-state and Langevin dynamics on a 2D free energy surface, we show that the same kind of asymmetries can emerge even in extremely simple systems, undergoing equilibrium and time-reversible dynamics. We use these model systems to rationalize the unidirectional information transfer in the molecular system in terms of asymmetries in the underlying free energy landscape and/or relaxation dynamics of the relevant coordinates. Finally, we propose a computational experiment that allows one to decide if an asymmetric information transfer between two variables corresponds to a genuine causal link.</description>

      <title>Brownian motion at various length scales with hydrodynamic and direct interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15017v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Brownian motion is essential for describing diffusion in systems ranging from simple to complex liquids. Unlike simple liquids, which consist of only a solvent, complex liquids, such as colloidal suspensions or the cytoplasm of a cell, are mixtures of various constituents with different shapes and sizes. Describing Brownian motion in such multiscale systems is extremely challenging because direct and many-body hydrodynamic interactions (and their interplay) play a pivotal role. Diffusion of small particles is mainly governed by a low viscous character of the solution, whereas large particles experience a highly viscous flow of the complex liquid on the macro scale. A quantity that encodes hydrodynamics on both length scales is the wave-vector-dependent viscosity. Assuming this quantity to be known -- in contrast to most studies in which the solvent shear viscosity is given -- provides a new perspective on studying the diffusivity of a tracer, especially in situations where the tracer size can vary by several orders of magnitude. Here, we start systematic studies of exact formal microscopic expressions for the short- and long-time self-diffusion coefficients of a single probe particle in a complex liquid in terms of short-ranged hydrodynamic response kernels. We study Brownian motion as a function of the probe size, contrasting most theories that focus on self-diffusion as a function of the crowder volume fraction. We discuss the limits of small and large probe sizes for various levels of approximations in our theory, and discuss the current successes and shortcomings of our approach.</description>

      <title>Extreme scaling of the metadynamics of paths algorithm on the pre-exascale JUWELS Booster supercomputer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11962v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Molecular dynamics (MD)-based path sampling algorithms are a very important class of methods used to study the energetics and kinetics of rare (bio)molecular events. They sample the highly informative but highly unlikely reactive trajectories connecting different metastable states of complex (bio)molecular systems. The metadynamics of paths (MoP) method proposed by Mandelli, Hirshberg, and Parrinello [Pys. Rev. Lett. 125 2, 026001 (2020)] is based on the Onsager-Machlup path integral formalism. This provides an analytical expression for the probability of sampling stochastic trajectories of given duration. In practice, the method samples reactive paths via metadynamics simulations performed directly in the phase space of all possible trajectories. Its parallel implementation is in principle infinitely scalable, allowing arbitrarily long trajectories to be simulated. Paving the way for future applications to study the thermodynamics and kinetics of protein-ligand (un)binding, a problem of great pharmaceutical interest, we present here the efficient implementation of MoP in the HPC-oriented biomolecular simulation software GROMACS. Our benchmarks on a membrane protein (150,000 atoms) show an unprecedented weak scaling parallel efficiency of over 70% up to 3200 GPUs on the pre-exascale JUWELS Booster machine at the J\"ulich Supercomputing Center.</description>
