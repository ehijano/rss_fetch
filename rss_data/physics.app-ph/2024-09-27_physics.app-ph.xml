      <title>NiOx/\b{eta}-Ga2O3 Heterojunction Diode Achieving Breakdown Voltage &gt;3 kV with Plasma Etch Field-Termination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work reports the fabrication and characterization of a NiOx/\b{eta}-Ga2O3 heterojunction diode (HJD) that uses a metallic nickel (Ni) target to deposit NiOx layers via reactive RF magnetron sputtering and lift-off processing with &gt;3 kV breakdown voltage, record-low reverse current leakage under high reverse bias, and high junction electric fields (&gt;3.34 MV/cm). The heterojunction diodes are fabricated via bilayer NiOx sputtering followed by self-aligned mesa-etching for field-termination on both large (1-mm2) and small area (100-{\mu}m diameter) devices. The HJD exhibits a ~135 A/cm2 forward current density at 5 V with a rectifying ratio of ~1010. The minimum differential specific on-resistance is measured to be 17.26 m{\Omega} cm2. The breakdown voltage on 100-{\mu}m diameter pads was measured to be greater than 3 kV with a noise floor-level reverse leakage current density (10-8~10-6 A/cm2) until 3 kV, accomplishing a parallel-plane junction electric field to be at least 3.34 MV/cm at 3 kV with a power figure of merit (PFOM) &gt;0.52 GW/cm2. Temperature-dependent forward current density-voltage (J-V) measurements are performed from room temperature (25 C) to 200 C which showed a temperature coefficient of resistance ({\alpha}) equaling 1.56, higher than that of \b{eta}-Ga2O3 Schottky barrier diodes (SBDs), indicating potential conductivity degradation within NiOx at elevated temperatures.</description>

      <title>Reconfigurable Manipulation of Sound with a Multi-material 3D-Printed Origami Metasurface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The challenge in reconfigurable manipulation of sound waves using metasurfaces lies in achieving precise control over acoustic behavior while developing efficient and practical tuning methods for structural configurations. However, most studies on reconfigurable acoustic metasurfaces rely on cumbersome and time-consuming control systems. These approaches often struggle with fabrication techniques, as conventional methods face limitations such as restricted material choices, challenges in achieving complex geometries, and difficulties in incorporating flexible components. This paper proposes a novel approach for developing a reconfigurable metasurface inspired by the Kresling origami pattern, designed for programmable manipulation of acoustic waves at an operating frequency of 2000 Hz. The origami unit cell is fabricated using multi-material 3D printing technology, allowing for the simultaneous printing of two materials with different mechanical properties, thus creating a bistable origami-based structure. Through optimization, two equilibrium states achieve a reflection phase difference of {\pi} through the application of small axial force, F, or torque, T. Various configurations of the metasurface, generated from different combinations of these two equilibria, enable distinct reflective behaviors with switchable and programmable functionalities. The principle of this work simplifies the shaping of acoustic waves through a straightforward mechanical mechanism, eliminating the need for complex control systems and time-consuming adjustments. This innovative approach paves a novel and effective perspective for developing on-demand switchable and tunable devices across diverse fields, including electromagnetics, mechanics, and elastics, leveraging multi-material printing technology.</description>

      <title>Physically Consistent RIS: From Reradiation Mode Optimization to Practical Realization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a practical framework for designing a physically consistent reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) to overcome the inefficiency of the conventional phase gradient approach. For a section of Cape Town and across three different coverage enhancement scenarios, we optimize the amplitude of the RIS reradiation modes using Sionna ray tracing and a gradient-based learning technique. We then determine the required RIS surface/sheet impedance given the desired amplitudes for the reradiation modes, design the corresponding unitcells, and validate the performance through full-wave numerical simulations using CST Microwave Studio. We further validate our approach by fabricating a RIS using the parallel plate waveguide technique and conducting experimental measurements that align with our theoretical predictions.</description>

      <title>Microwave interference from a spin ensemble and its mirror image in waveguide magnonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate microwave interference from a spin ensemble and its mirror image in a one-dimensional waveguide. Away from the mirror, the resonance frequencies of the Kittel mode (KM) inside a ferrimagnetic spin ensemble have sinusoidal shifts as the normalized distance between the spin ensemble and the mirror increases compared to the setup without the mirror. These shifts are a consequence of the KM's interaction with its own image. Furthermore, the variation of the magnon radiative decay into the waveguide shows a cosine squared oscillation and is enhanced twofold when the KM sits at the magnetic antinode of the corresponding eigenmode. We can finely tune the KM to achieve the maximum adsorption of the input photons at the critical coupling point. Moreover, by placing the KM in proximity to the node of the resonance field, its lifetime is extended to more than eight times compared to its positioning near the antinode.</description>

      <title>Performance of a radio-frequency two-photon atomic magnetometer in different magnetic induction measurement geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measurements monitoring the inductive coupling between oscillating radio-frequency magnetic fields and objects of interest create versatile platforms for non-destructive testing. The benefits of ultra low frequency measurements, i.e., below 3~kHz, are sometimes outweighed by the fundamental and technical difficulties related to operating pick-up coils or other field sensors in this frequency range. Inductive measurements with the detection based on a two-photon interaction in rf atomic magnetometers address some of these issues, as the sensor gains an uplift in its operational frequency. The developments reported here integrate the fundamental and applied aspects of the two-photon process in magnetic induction measurements. In this paper, all spectral components of the two-photon process are identified, which result from the non-linear interactions between the rf fields and atoms. A method for the retrieval of the two-photon phase information, which is critical for inductive measurements, is also demonstrated. Furthermore, a self-compensation configuration is introduced, whereby high contrast measurements of defects can be obtained due to the sensor's insensitivity to the primary field, including using simplified instrumentation for this configuration by producing two rf fields with a single rf coil.</description>

      <title>Manufacturing, processing, applications, and advancements of Fe-based shape memory alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fe-based shape memory alloys (Fe-SMAs) belong to smart metallic materials that can memorize or restore their preset shape after experiencing a substantial amount of deformation under heat, stress, or magnetic stimuli. Fe-SMAs have remarkable thermomechanical properties and have attracted significant interest because of their potential merits, such as cost-effective alloying elements, superior workability, weldability, a stable superelastic response, and low-temperature dependence of critical stress required for stress-induced martensitic transformation. Therefore, Fe-SMAs can be an intriguing and economical alternative to other SMAs. The recent advancements in fabrication methods of conventional metals and SMAs are helping the production of customized powder composition and then customized geometries by additive manufacturing (AM). The technology in these areas, i.e., fabrication techniques, experimental characterization, and theoretical formulations of Fe-SMAs for conventional and AM has been rapidly advancing and is lacking a comprehensive review. This paper provides a critical review of the recent developments in Fe-SMAs-related research. The conventional and AM-based methods of producing Fe-SMAs are discussed, and a detailed review of the current research trends on Fe-SMAs including 4-D printing of Fe-SMAs are comprehensively documented. The presented review provides a comprehensive review of experimental methods and processes used to determine the material characteristics and features of Fe-SMAs. In addition, the work provides a review of the reported computational modeling of Fe-SMAs to help design new Fe-SMA composition and geometry. Finally, different Fe-SMAs-based applications such as sensing and damping systems, tube coupling, and reinforced concrete are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Retinal arterial blood flow measured by real-time Doppler holography at 33,000 frames per second</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17180v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents a novel quantitative estimation method for total retinal arterial blood flow utilizing real-time Doppler holography at an unprecedented frame rate of 33,000 frames per second. This technique, leveraging high-speed digital holography, enables non-invasive angiographic imaging of the retina, providing detailed blood flow contrasts essential for assessing retinal health. The proposed quantitative analysis method consists of segmenting primary in-plane retinal arteries and calculating local blood velocity using Doppler frequency broadening. The analysis integrates a forward scattering model to achieve blood flow estimation. Our findings highlight the potential of Doppler holography as a powerful tool for diagnosing and monitoring the treatment of retinal vascular conditions, complementary to existing imaging methods.</description>

      <title>Characterizing and modeling the influence of geometry on the performance of superconducting nanowire cryotrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The scaling of superconducting nanowire-based devices to larger arrays is often limited by the cabling required to interface with each device. Cryogenic integrated circuits constructed from nanowire cryotrons, or nanocryotrons, can address this limitation by performing signal processing on chip. In this study, we characterize key performance metrics of the nanocryotron to elucidate its potential as a logical element in cryogenic integrated circuits and develop an electro-thermal model to connect material parameters with device performance. We find that the performance of the nanocryotron depends significantly on the device geometry, and trade-offs are associated with optimizing the gain, jitter, and energy dissipation. We demonstrate that nanocryotrons fabricated on niobium nitride can achieve a grey zone less than 210 nA wide for a 5 ns long input pulse corresponding to a maximum achievable gain of 48 dB, an energy dissipation of less than 20 aJ per operation, and a jitter of less than 60 ps.</description>

      <title>Sub-100 Hz Intrinsic Linewidth 852 nm Silicon Nitride External Cavity Laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate an external cavity laser with intrinsic linewidth below 100 Hz around an operating wavelength of 852 nm, selected for its relevance to laser cooling and manipulation of cesium atoms. This system achieves a maximum CW output power of 24 mW, wavelength tunability over 15 nm, and a side-mode suppression ratio exceeding 50 dB. This performance level is facilitated by careful design of a low-loss integrated silicon nitride photonic circuit serving as the external cavity combined with commercially available semiconductor gain chips. This approach demonstrates the feasibility of compact integrated lasers with sub-kHz linewidth centering on the needs of emerging sensor concepts based on ultracold atoms and can be further extended to shorter wavelengths via selection of suitable semiconductor gain media.</description>

      <title>Linear dichroism of the optical properties of SnS and SnSe van der Waals crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tin monochalcogendies SnS and SnSe, belonging to a familiy of van der Waals crystals isoelectronic to black phosphorus, are know as enivornmetally-friendly materials promisng for thermoelecric conversion applications. However, they exhibit other desired functionalities, such as intrisic linear dichroism of the optical and electronic properties originating from strongly anisotropic orthorhombic crystal structure. This property makes them perfect candidats for polarization-sensitive photodetectors working in near infrared spectral range. We present a comprehensive study of the SnS and SnSe crystals by means of optical spectroscopy and photoemission spectroscopy, supported by ab initio calcualtions. The studies revealed the high sensitivity of the optical response of both materials to the incident light polarization, which we interpret in terms of the electronic band dispersion and orbital composition of the electronic bands, dictating the selection rules. From the photoemission investigation we determine the ionization potential, electron affinity and work function, which are parameters crucial for the design of devices based on semiconductor heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Gate-controlled superconducting switch in GaSe/NbSe$_2$ van der Waals heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The demand for low-power devices is on the rise as semiconductor engineering approaches the quantum limit and quantum computing continues to advance. Two-dimensional (2D) superconductors, thanks to their rich physical properties, hold significant promise for both fundamental physics and potential applications in superconducting integrated circuits and quantum computation. Here, we report a gate-controlled superconducting switch in GaSe/NbSe$_2$ van der Waals (vdW) heterostructure. By injecting high-energy electrons into NbSe$_2$ under an electric field, a non-equilibrium state is induced, resulting in significant modulation of the superconducting properties. Owing to the intrinsic polarization of ferroelectric GaSe, a much steeper subthreshold slope and asymmetric modulation are achieved, which is beneficial to the device performance. Based on these results, a superconducting switch is realized that can reversibly and controllably switch between the superconducting and normal state under an electric field. Our findings highlight a significant high-energy injection effect from band engineering in 2D vdW heterostructures combining superconductors and ferroelectric semiconductors, and demonstrate the potential applications for superconducting integrated circuits.</description>

      <title>Entropy Scaling for Diffusion Coefficients in Mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17615v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entropy scaling is a powerful technique that has been used successfully for predicting transport properties of pure components over a wide range of states. However, modeling mixture diffusion coefficients by entropy scaling is an unresolved task. We have tackled this issue and present an entropy scaling framework for predicting mixture self-diffusion as well as mutual diffusion in a thermodynamically consistent way. The predictions of the mixture diffusion coefficients are made based on information on the self-diffusion coefficients of the pure components and the infinite dilution diffusion coefficients. This is accomplished using information on the entropy of the mixture, which is taken here from molecular-based equations of state. The framework is flexible and can be applied together with any equation of state. Examples for the application of the new entropy scaling framework for the prediction of diffusion coefficients in mixtures illustrate its impressive performance. It enables predictions a wide range of temperatures and pressures including gaseous, liquid, supercritical, and metastable states - also for strongly non-ideal mixtures.</description>

      <title>Multi-Wavelength DFB Laser Based on Sidewall Third Order Four Phase-Shifted Sampled Bragg Grating with Uniform Wavelength Spacing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first demonstration of a 1550 nm multi-wavelength distributed feedback (MW-DFB) laser employing a third-order, four-phase-shifted sampled sidewall grating. By utilizing linearly chirped sampled gratings and incorporating multiple true {\pi}-phase shifts within the cavity, we achieved and experimentally validated a four-wavelength laser with a channel spacing of 0.4 nm. The device operates stably and uniformly across a wide range of injection currents from 280 mA to 350 mA. The average wavelength spacing was measured at 0.401 nm with a standard deviation of 0.0081 nm. Additionally, we demonstrated a 0.3 nm MW-DFB laser with a seven-channel output, achieving a wavelength spacing of 0.274 nm and a standard deviation of 0.0055 nm. This MW-DFB laser features a ridge waveguide with sidewall gratings, requiring only one metalorganic vapor-phase epitaxy (MOVPE) step and a single III-V material etching process. This streamlined fabrication approach simplifies device manufacturing and is well-suited for dense wavelength division multiplexing (DWDM) systems.</description>

      <title>Leveraging both faces of polar semiconductor wafers for functional devices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03733v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unlike non-polar semiconductors such as silicon, the broken inversion symmetry of the wide bandgap semiconductor gallium nitride leads to a large electronic polarization along a unique crystal axis. This makes the two surfaces of the semiconductor wafer perpendicular to the polar axis dramatically different in their physical and chemical properties. In the last three decades, the cation (gallium) face of gallium nitride has been used for photonic devices such as LEDs and lasers. Though the cation face has also been predominantly used for electronic devices, the anion (nitrogen) face has recently shown promise for high electron mobility transistors due to favorable polarization discontinuities. In this work we introduce dualtronics, showing that it is possible to make photonic devices on the cation face, and electronic devices on the anion face, of the same semiconductor wafer. This opens the possibility for leveraging both faces of polar semiconductors in a single structure, where electronic, photonic, and acoustic properties can be implemented on opposite faces of the same wafer, dramatically enhancing the functional capabilities of this revolutionary semiconductor family.</description>

      <title>Efficient Combinatorial Optimization via Heat Diffusion</title>

Abstract: Combinatorial optimization problems are widespread but inherently challenging due to their discrete nature. The primary limitation of existing methods is that they can only access a small fraction of the solution space at each iteration, resulting in limited efficiency for searching the global optimal. To overcome this challenge, diverging from conventional efforts of expanding the solver's search scope, we focus on enabling information to actively propagate to the solver through heat diffusion. By transforming the target function while preserving its optima, heat diffusion facilitates information flow from distant regions to the solver, providing more efficient navigation. Utilizing heat diffusion, we propose a framework for solving general combinatorial optimization problems. The proposed methodology demonstrates superior performance across a range of the most challenging and widely encountered combinatorial optimizations. Echoing recent advancements in harnessing thermodynamics for generative artificial intelligence, our study further reveals its significant potential in advancing combinatorial optimization.</description>

      <title>2D hydrodynamic simulation of TeraFETs beyond the gradual-channel approximation for transient, large-signal or ultrahigh-frequency simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18764v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the past decade, detection of THz radiation by plasma-wave-assisted frequency mixing in antenna-coupled field-effect transistors (TeraFETs) -- implemented in various semiconductor material systems (Si CMOS, GaN/AlGaN, GaAs/AlGaAs, graphene, etc.) -- has matured and led to a practically applied detector technology. This has been supported by the development of powerful device simulation tools which take into account relevant collective carrier dynamics and mixing processes in various approximations. These tools mostly model carrier transport in 1D and they are usually geared towards continuous-wave illumination of the device and small-signal response. Depending on their implementation, it may not be possible readily to simulate large-signal and pulsed operation. Another approximation which may lead to unsatisfactory results is the 1D restriction to calculate only the longitudinal electric field components. Especially at the edges of the gate electrode, solving of the 2D Poisson equation promises better results. This contribution introduces a stable way to solve the 2D Poisson equation self-consistently with the hydrodynamic transport equations including the numerically challenging convection term. We employ a well-balanced approximate Harten-Lax-van-Leer-Contact Riemann solver. The approach is well suited for a future treatment of transient and large-signal cases as well as the Dyakonov-Shur instability. The 2D treatment also generically extends the model beyond the gradual-channel approximation and allows to calculate the FET's response at high THz frequencies where the gate-to-channel potential acquires a non-local character. Model calculations are performed for the exemplary case of a 65-nm Si CMOS TeraFET in the isothermal approximation.</description>
