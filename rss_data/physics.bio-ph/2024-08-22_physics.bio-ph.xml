      <title>Cold plasma with zirconia nanoparticles for lung cancer via TGF-\b{eta} signaling pathway</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite advancements in lung cancer therapy, the prognosis for advanced or metastatic patients remains poor, yet many patients eventually develop resistance to standard treatments leading to disease progression and poor survival. Here, we described a combination of CAP and nanoparticles (ZrO2 NPs (zirconium oxide nanoparticle) and 3Y-TZP NPs (3% mol Yttria Tetragonal Zirconia Polycrystal Nanoparticle)) for lung cancer therapy. We found that ZrO2 NPs caused obvious damage to the inside of the lung cancer cells. CAP and ZrO2 NPs mainly affected the mitochondria function, leading to a decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP levels, and causing endoplasmic reticulum stress and cell nucleus internal DNA damage, etc. CAP combined with ZrO2 NPs (CAP@ZrO2) induced lung cancer cell apoptosis by activating the TGF-\b{eta} pathway. CAP@ZrO2 offers a new therapy for the clinical treatment of lung cancer.</description>

      <title>Protein overabundance is driven by growth robustness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protein expression levels optimize cell fitness: Too low an expression level of essential proteins will slow growth by compromising essential processes; whereas overexpression slows growth by increasing the metabolic load. This trade-off naively predicts that cells maximize their fitness by sufficiency, expressing just enough of each essential protein for function. We test this prediction in the naturally-competent bacterium Acinetobacter baylyi by characterizing the proliferation dynamics of essential-gene knockouts at a single-cell scale (by imaging) as well as at a genome-wide scale (by TFNseq). In these experiments, cells proliferate for multiple generations as target protein levels are diluted from their endogenous levels. This approach facilitates a proteome-scale analysis of protein overabundance. As predicted by the Robustness-Load Trade-Off (RLTO) model, we find that roughly 70% of essential proteins are overabundant and that overabundance increases as the expression level decreases, the signature prediction of the model. These results reveal that robustness plays a fundamental role in determining the expression levels of essential genes and that overabundance is a key mechanism for ensuring robust growth.</description>

      <title>Searching for long time scales without fine tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.11674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2008.11674v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Most of animal and human behavior occurs on time scales much longer than the response times of individual neurons. In many cases, it is plausible that these long time scales emerge from the recurrent dynamics of electrical activity in networks of neurons. In linear models, time scales are set by the eigenvalues of a dynamical matrix whose elements measure the strengths of synaptic connections between neurons. It is not clear to what extent these matrix elements need to be tuned in order to generate long time scales; in some cases, one needs not just a single long time scale but a whole range. Starting from the simplest case of random symmetric connections, we combine maximum entropy and random matrix theory methods to construct ensembles of networks, exploring the constraints required for long time scales to become generic. We argue that a single long time scale can emerge generically from realistic constraints, but a full spectrum of slow modes requires more tuning. Langevin dynamics that generates patterns of synaptic connections drawn from these ensembles involves a combination of Hebbian learning and activity-dependent synaptic scaling.</description>

      <title>Tuning Colloidal Reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07798v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The precise control of complex reactions is critical for biological processes yet our inability to design for specific outcomes limits the development of synthetic analogues. Here, we leverage differentiable simulators to design nontrivial reaction pathways in colloidal assemblies. By optimizing over external structures, we achieve controlled disassembly and particle release from colloidal shells. Lastly, we characterize the role of configurational entropy in the structure via both forward calculations and optimization, inspiring new parameterizations of designed colloidal reactions.</description>

      <title>Harnessing quantum light for microscopic biomechanical imaging of cells and tissues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08160v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The biomechanical properties of cells and tissues play an important role in our fundamental understanding of the structures and functions of biological systems at both the cellular and subcellular levels. Recently, Brillouin microscopy, which offers a label-free spectroscopic means of assessing viscoelastic properties in vivo, has emerged as a powerful way to interrogate those properties on a microscopic level in living tissues. However, susceptibility to photo-damage and photo-bleaching, particularly when high-intensity laser beams are used to induce Brillouin scattering, poses a significant challenge. This article introduces a transformative approach designed to mitigate photo-damage in biological and biomedical studies, enabling non-destructive, label-free assessments of mechanical properties in live biological samples. By leveraging quantum-light-enhanced stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) imaging contrast, the signal-to-noise ratio is significantly elevated, thereby increasing sample viability and extending interrogation times without compromising the integrity of living samples. The tangible impact of this novel methodology is evidenced by a notable three-fold increase in sample viability observed after subjecting the samples to three hours of continuous squeezed-light illumination, surpassing the traditional coherent light-based approaches. The quantum-enhanced SBS imaging holds promise across diverse fields, such as cancer biology and neuroscience where preserving sample vitality is of paramount significance. By mitigating concerns regarding photo-damage and photo-bleaching associated with high-intensity lasers, this technological breakthrough expands our horizons for exploring the mechanical properties of live biological systems, paving the way for a new era of research and clinical applications.</description>
