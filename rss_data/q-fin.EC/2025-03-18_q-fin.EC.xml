      <title>The impact of artificial intelligence technology on cross-border trade in Southeast Asia: A meta-analytic approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) technology on cross-border trade using a qualitative content analysis approach. By synthesizing existing empirical studies, we aim to quantify the overall effect of AI on trade flows and identify the key moderating and mediating variables. Besides, our results show that AI adoption significantly increases trade volumes in Southeast Asia. Likewise, these effects are stronger in regions with advanced technological infrastructure and favorable regulatory frameworks. In addition, Trade firm size partially mediates the relationship between AI technology and trade performance. Furthermore, this study draws on several key theoretical frameworks that provide a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms through which AI technology is affecting cross-border trade in Southeast Asia. The primary theories used in this research include the technology, organization, and environment (TOE) framework, the diffuse innovation (DOI) theory, Dynamic Capabilities Theory, Comparative Advantage Theory, Network theory, Transaction Cost Economics (TCE), the resource-based view, and the institution theory. Consequently, this study contributes to the existing literature by providing a comprehensive analysis of the role of AI in international trade and highlighting the importance of contextual factors in maximizing the benefits of AI. Thus, our findings underscore the need for favorable policies and robust infrastructure to facilitate AI-driven trade growth. A discussion of limitations and future research directions will also be part of the report in Southeast Asia Trade.</description>

      <title>Is Crime Displacement Inevitable? Evidence from Police Crackdowns in Fortaleza, Brazil</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We evaluated one of the most common policing strategies in Brazil: the allocation of police blitzes. This place-based focused deterrence intervention has well-defined assignments, and 3,423 interventions were precisely recorded in Fortaleza-CE, Brazil, between 2012 and 2013. Our analysis takes advantage of the high spatiotemporal daily data resolution coming from an unprecedented longitudinal micro-Big Data (GPS and PING records) to make comparisons of small intervention areas, while controlling for common daily trends, deterrence (spatial and temporal), and diffusion; to show that an average police crackdown causes a 35% decrease in violent crime occurrences. There are diminishing returns of public safety to hours spent by police in a single area, corroborating what police officers know well from their own experience and discretionary behavior. Although crime increases by 6% immediately after the end of a blitz, we observe lasting deterrent effects (diffusion) after 2-3 days. The residual deterrence cancels the relocation of the crime, and the intervention does not generate significant temporal displacement. In addition, we do not find spatial displacement from crime in blocks up to 1.5 km from a blitz. This type of micropolicing tactics generates deterrence by being highly visible in a street segment for a short period and intermittently quasirandom in space-time, which produces uncertainty that might be crucial in minimizing the temporal and spatial displacement of crime. Of public policy interest, we show that the allocation of blitzes passes in an initial cost-benefit analysis.</description>

      <title>Is the distribution of resolvable uncertainty Type I extreme value? A Test for Random Coefficient Models using Choice Probabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stated choice probabilities are increasingly used in conjunction with the random-coefficient model (RCM) to describe individual preferences. They allow survey respondents to express uncertainty about the future or the incompleteness of a hypothetical scenario: the resolvable uncertainty. Parametric assumptions such as a Type I extreme value (EV1) distribution are almost always imposed on this uncertainty to identify and estimate the associated RCM. This paper proposes the first test for these parametric assumptions, based on a nonparametric identification result for the population distribution of the interquantile range of the resolvable uncertainty. In all four empirical applications considered, the test finds strong evidence against the EV1 assumption.</description>

      <title>Climate Risk and Corporate Value: Evidence from Temperature Bins and Panel Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In empirical research, this article uses daily climate data provided by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) of the United States to construct a temperature box with a range of 5\( ^\circ\text{C} \), focusing on analyzing the impact of extreme high temperatures (\( &gt;30^\circ\text{C} \)) and extreme low temperatures (\( \le -10^\circ\text{C} \)) on the asset value of enterprises. The results based on a panel regression model show that extreme high and low temperatures can significantly reduce the asset value of enterprises. In the robustness test, this article used lagged climate data for testing, and the results still showed that extreme high temperatures had a significant negative impact on the asset value of enterprises, verifying the reliability of the benchmark regression results. In-depth heterogeneity analysis shows that in the process of addressing climate risks, companies exhibit significant differentiation based on different ownership types and industry characteristics. According to research, state-owned enterprises are relatively less affected by extreme weather due to their resource advantages and policy preferences. In addition, foreign-funded enterprises demonstrate a high level of risk resistance due to their strong management efficiency and supply chain control capabilities. In the manufacturing sector, heavy industries such as steel and communication manufacturing are particularly affected by the negative effects of extreme weather, which fully demonstrates that these industries face more severe challenges when dealing with extreme weather conditions.</description>

      <title>Techno-Feudalism and the Rise of AGI: A Future Without Economic Rights?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rise of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) marks an existential rupture in economic and political order, dissolving the historic boundaries between labor and capital. Unlike past technological advancements, AGI is both a worker and an owner, producing economic value while concentrating power in those who control its infrastructure. Left unchecked, this shift risks exacerbating inequality, eroding democratic agency, and entrenching techno-feudalism. The classical Social Contract-rooted in human labor as the foundation of economic participation-must be renegotiated to prevent mass disenfranchisement. This paper calls for a redefined economic framework that ensures AGI-driven prosperity is equitably distributed through mechanisms such as universal AI dividends, progressive taxation, and decentralized governance. The time for intervention is now-before intelligence itself becomes the most exclusive form of capital.</description>

      <title>Towards a Formal Framework of the Ethereum Staking Market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies how different categories of Ethereum stakers respond to changes in the consensus issuance schedule and how such changes may impact the composition of the staking market. Our findings show that solo stakers are more sensitive to variations in staking rewards compared to ETH holders using centralized exchanges or liquid staking providers. This heightened sensitivity is not explained by the assumptions on cost structure, which would suggest the opposite, but is instead driven by market dynamics. Factors such as superior MEV access and DeFi yields available to other staking methods, as well as the potential presence of inattentive stakers, contribute to this effect. Consequently, a reduction in issuance is likely to crowd out solo stakers while increasing the market share of centralized entities, further concentrating validator power.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Knowledge Networks: Rethinking Technological Value Distribution in mRNA Vaccine Innovations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study examines the roles of public and private sector actors in the development of mRNA vaccines, a breakthrough innovation in modern medicine. Using a dataset of 151 core patent families and 2,416 antecedent (cited) patents, we analyze the structure and dynamics of the mRNA vaccine knowledge network through network theory. Our findings highlight the central role of biotechnology firms, such as Moderna and BioNTech, alongside the crucial contributions of universities and public research organizations (PROs) in providing foundational knowledge.We develop a novel credit allocation framework, showing that universities, PROs, government and research centers account for at least 27% of the external technological knowledge base behind mRNA vaccine breakthroughs - representing a minimum threshold of their overall contribution. Our study offers new insights into pharmaceutical and biotechnology innovation dynamics, emphasizing how Moderna and BioNTech's mRNA technologies have benefited from academic institutions, with notable differences in their institutional knowledge sources.</description>

      <title>Holding Periods: Measuring the Inverse of Money Velocity from Transaction Records</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.01512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.01512v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper defines the average holding period of money and proposes a methodology for fully disaggregated measurement. Our measure is shown to be the inverse of the transfer velocity of money under stationary conditions, which is implicitly assumed in conventional aggregate measurement. Our methodology does not require stationarity. We leverage a recent computational technique to extract empirical holding periods from micro-level transaction data as recorded by real-world payment systems. This enables novel empirical analyses of money velocity under non-stationarity conditions. We illustrate several such analyses on Sarafu, a small digital community currency in Kenya, where transaction data is available from 25 January 2020 to 15 June 2021. Our measure implies faster circulation than does the aggregate transfer velocity; we can say that 58% of Sarafu was effectively static. We also disaggregate by geography to study the heterogeneous impact of economic disruptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic on Sarafu. Finally, we consider an ad-hoc currency management operation that took place in October 2020. Measuring the average holding period of money makes it possible to track money velocity during ongoing monetary interventions and on other important occasions when conditions are not stationary.</description>

      <title>Retrieval Augmented Generation for Topic Modeling in Organizational Research: An Introduction with Empirical Demonstration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20963v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Analyzing textual data is the cornerstone of qualitative research. While traditional methods such as grounded theory and content analysis are widely used, they are labor-intensive and time-consuming. Topic modeling offers an automated complement. Yet, existing approaches, including LLM-based topic modeling, still struggle with issues such as high data preprocessing requirements, interpretability, and reliability. This paper introduces Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Agentic RAG) as a method for topic modeling with LLMs. It integrates three key components: (1) retrieval, enabling automatized access to external data beyond an LLM's pre-trained knowledge; (2) generation, leveraging LLM capabilities for text synthesis; and (3) agent-driven learning, iteratively refining retrieval and query formulation processes. To empirically validate Agentic RAG for topic modeling, we reanalyze a Twitter/X dataset, previously examined by Mu et al. (2024a). Our findings demonstrate that the approach is more efficient, interpretable and at the same time achieves higher reliability and validity in comparison to the standard machine learning approach but also in comparison to LLM prompting for topic modeling. These results highlight Agentic RAG's ability to generate semantically relevant and reproducible topics, positioning it as a robust, scalable, and transparent alternative for AI-driven qualitative research in leadership, managerial, and organizational research.</description>
