      <title>Using anomaly detection to search for technosignatures in Breakthrough Listen observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We implement a machine learning algorithm to search for extra-terrestrial technosignatures in radio observations of several hundred nearby stars, obtained with the Parkes and Green Bank Telescopes by the Breakthrough Listen collaboration. Advances in detection technology have led to an exponential growth in data, necessitating innovative and efficient analysis methods. This problem is exacerbated by the large variety of possible forms an extraterrestrial signal might take, and the size of the multidimensional parameter space that must be searched. It is then made markedly worse by the fact that our best guess at the properties of such a signal is that it might resemble the signals emitted by human technology and communications, the main (yet diverse) contaminant in radio observations. We address this challenge by using a combination of simulations and machine learning methods for anomaly detection. We rank candidates by how unusual they are in frequency, and how persistent they are in time, by measuring the similarity between consecutive spectrograms of the same star. We validate that our filters significantly improve the quality of the candidates that are selected for human vetting when compared to a random selection. Of the ~ 10^11 spectrograms that we analyzed, we visually inspected thousands of the most promising spectrograms, and thousands more for validation, about 20,000 in total, and report that no candidate survived basic scrutiny.</description>

      <title>dfreproject: A Python package for astronomical reprojection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep astronomical images are often constructed by digitially stacking many individual sub-exposures. Each sub-exposure is expected to show small differences in the positions of stars and other objects in the field, due to the movement of the celestial bodies, changes/imperfections in the opto-mechanical imaging train, and other factors. To maximize image quality, one must ensure that each sub-exposure is aligned to a common frame of reference prior to stacking. This is done by reprojecting each exposure onto a common target grid defined using a World Coordinate System (WCS) that is defined by mapping the known angular positions of reference objects to their observed spatial positions on each image. The transformations needed to reproject images involve complicated trigonometric expressions which can be slow to compute, so reprojection can be a major bottleneck in image processing pipelines.
  To make astronomical reprojections faster to implement in pipelines, we have written `dfreproject`, a Python package of GPU-optimized functions for this purpose. The package's functions break down coordinate transformations using Gnomonic projections to define pixel-by-pixel shifts from the source to the target plane. The package also provides tools for interpolating a source image onto a target plane with a single function call. This module follows the FITS and SIP formats laid out in the seminal papers. Compared to common alternatives, `dfreproject`'s routines result in speedups of up to 20X when run on a GPU and 10X when run on a CPU.</description>

      <title>High polarization lines of the second solar spectrum of the Solar limb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a dataset of high resolution spectra of the Sun of many strongly polarized lines belonging to the second solar spectrum, i.e. the spectrum near the limb in linear polarization (scattering polarization). These solar spectra were obtained in full Stokes polarimetry (I, Q/I, U/I, V/I) in the quiet Sun at various distances from the limb, and at disk centre for comparison, with the ground based CNRS THEMIS telescope. Polarization rates Q/I up to 7% are obtained in CaI 4227 {\AA} line at $\mu$ = cos$\theta$ = 0, while 2% is reached in SrI 4607 {\AA} line and 1.4% in BaII 4554 {\AA}. The spectra shown here are freely available in FITS format to the research community.</description>

      <title>Improved Dimensionality Reduction for Inverse Problems in Nuclear Fusion and High-Energy Astrophysics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many inverse problems in nuclear fusion and high-energy astrophysics research, such as the optimization of tokamak reactor geometries or the inference of black hole parameters from interferometric images, necessitate high-dimensional parameter scans and large ensembles of simulations to be performed. Such inverse problems typically involve large uncertainties, both in the measurement parameters being inverted and in the underlying physics models themselves. Monte Carlo sampling, when combined with modern non-linear dimensionality reduction techniques such as autoencoders and manifold learning, can be used to reduce the size of the parameter spaces considerably. However, there is no guarantee that the resulting combinations of parameters will be physically valid, or even mathematically consistent. In this position paper, we advocate adopting a hybrid approach that leverages our recent advances in the development of formal verification methods for numerical algorithms, with the goal of constructing parameter space restrictions with provable mathematical and physical correctness properties, whilst nevertheless respecting both experimental uncertainties and uncertainties in the underlying physical processes.</description>

      <title>Minimizing Star Spot Contamination of Exoplanet Transit Spectroscopy Using Alternate Normalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, Currie et al. simulated the detection of molecules in the atmospheres of temperate rocky exoplanets transiting nearby M-dwarf stars. They simulated detections via spectral cross-correlation applied to high resolution optical and near-IR transit spectroscopy using the ELTs. Currie et al. did not consider the effect of unocculted star spots, but we do that here for possible detections of molecular oxygen, carbon dioxide, methane, and water vapor. We find that confusion noise from unocculted star spots becomes significant for large programs that stack tens to hundreds of transits to detect these molecules. Noise from star spots increases with greater spot filling factors, and star spot temperature has less effect than filling factor. Nevertheless, molecular oxygen, carbon dioxide, and methane could be detected in temperate rocky planets transiting nearby M-dwarfs without correcting for star spots. Water vapor detections are the most affected, with star spots contaminating the exoplanet signal as well as producing extra noise. Unocculted spots only affect transit spectroscopy when normalizing by dividing by the total flux from the star. We describe an alternate normalization method that minimizes star spot effects by deriving and implementing an unspotted proxy spectrum for the normalization. We show that the method works in principle using realistic levels of random observational noise. Alternate normalization would be broadly applicable to all types of transit spectroscopy, and we discuss challenges to applying it in practice. We also outline a comprehensive approach that has the potential to overcome those challenges.</description>

      <title>nuGAN: Generative Adversarial Emulator for Cosmic Web with Neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the impact of neutrino masses on the evolution of Universe is a crucial aspect of modern cosmology. Due to their large free streaming lengths, neutrinos significantly influence the formation of cosmic structures at non-linear scales. To maximize the information yield from current and future galaxy surveys, it is essential to generate precise theoretical predictions of structure formation. One approach to achieve this is by running large sets of cosmological numerical simulations, which is a computationally intensive process. In this study, we propose a deep learning-based generative adversarial network (GAN) model to emulate the Universe for a variety of neutrino masses. Our model called $\nu$GAN (for neutrino GAN) is able to generate 2D cosmic webs of the Universe for a number of neutrino masses ranging from 0.0 eV to 0.4 eV. The generated maps exhibit statistical independence, lack correlations with training data, and very closely resemble the distribution of matter in true maps. We assess the accuracy of our results both visually and through key statistics used in cosmology and computer vision analyses. Our results indicate that samples generated by $\nu$GAN are accurate within a 5% error on power spectrum between k=0.01 to k=0.5 h/Mpc. Although this accuracy covers the mildly non-linear scales, consistent with other works and observations, achieving higher accuracy at fully non-linear scales requires more sophisticated models, such as diffusion models. Nevertheless, our work opens up new avenues for building emulators to generate fast and massive neutrino simulations, potentially revolutionizing cosmological predictions and analyses. This work serves as a proof-of-concept, paving the way for future extensions with higher-resolution 3D data and advanced generative models.</description>

      <title>The Sonora Substellar Atmosphere Models. V: A Correction to the Disequilibrium Abundance of CO$_2$ for Sonora Elf Owl</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To aid the interpretation of observations of substellar atmospheres, Mukherjee et al. (2024) created the Sonora Elf Owl grid of model atmospheres, simulations that accounted for disequilibrium quench chemistry. However, Sonora Elf Owl did not accurately estimate CO$_2$ quenching because the models quenched the gas with respect to the full atmosphere equilibrium, but CO$_2$ should have instead been quenched with respect to the disequilibrium (i.e., quenched) abundance of CO. As a result, Sonora Elf Owl under-predicted the CO$_2$ abundance by several order of magnitude in some instances, an amount that JWST is sensitive to. Here, we release version two of the Sonora Elf Owl grid which has corrected CO$_2$ concentrations. Additionally, in version two we remove PH$_3$ as a spectral contributor since our spectra consistently contained too much PH$_3$ absorption. The new spectra can be found as an update to the original Zenodo postings.</description>

      <title>Heartbeat Stars Recognition Based on Recurrent Neural Networks: Method and Validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since the variety of their light curve morphologies, the vast majority of the known heartbeat stars (HBSs) have been discovered by manual inspection. Machine learning, which has already been successfully applied to the classification of variable stars based on light curves, offers another possibility for the automatic detection of HBSs. We propose a novel feature extraction approach for HBSs. First, the light curve is transformed into the frequency domain via Fourier transform, then the amplitudes of the first 100 harmonics are extracted, and finally these harmonics are normalised as feature vectors of the light curve. A training data set of synthetic light curves is constructed using ELLC, and their features are fed into recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for supervised learning, with the expected output being the eccentricity of these light curves. The performance of RNNs is evaluated using a test data set of synthetic light curves, achieving 95$\%$ accuracy. When applied to known HBSs from OGLE, Kepler, and TESS surveys, the networks achieve an average accuracy of 88$\%$. This method successfully identify four new HBSs within the eclipsing binary catalog of Kirk et al. The use of orbital harmonics as features for HBSs proves to be an effective approach that significantly reduces the computational cost of neural networks. RNNs show excellent performance in recognising this type of time series data. This method not only allows efficient identification of HBSs, but can also be extended to recognise other types of periodic variable stars.</description>

      <title>Collisional Fragmentation Support in TRACE</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present improved collision support for TRACE, a state-of-the-art hybrid integrator in REBOUND. TRACE now supports collisional fragmentation and can handle both removing and adding particles mid-timestep. We describe the back-end logic implemented for robust collision support, and compare TRACE's performance to other integrators including MERCURIUS on a large-N protoplanetary disk simulation with various collision prescriptions, a system which TRACE previously could not handle. TRACE matches the behavior of these integrators, while offering potentially vast speedups of over 70x. All updates described in this Note are available with the most recent public release of REBOUND.</description>

      <title>A Detailed Investigation of HD 209458 b HST &amp; JWST Transmission Spectra with SANSAR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: HD 209458 b is the first exoplanet on which an atmosphere was detected. Since then, its atmosphere has been investigated using multiple telescopes and instruments. However, many of its atmospheric constraints remain debatable. While HST observations suggested a highly sub-solar metallicity, recent JWST NIRCam observations by Xue et al. 2024 constrained a super-solar metallicity with highly sub-solar C/O. In this work, we show a detailed investigation of HD 209458 b transmission spectra observations from JWST and HST using SANSAR, a newly developed planetary atmosphere modeling framework, with free, equilibrium chemistry and self-consistent grid retrievals. The overall best-fitting model with free retrievals ($\chi^2_{\rm{red}}$=1.21) constrains its metallicity and C/O to be highly sub-solar, while equilibrium chemistry and grid retrievals ($\chi^2_{\rm{red}}$=1.27 and 1.30, respectively) are consistent with solar values using STIS+WFC3+NIRCam observations. The retrieved abundances of H$_2$O and CO$_2$ are almost three orders of magnitude lower (highly sub-solar) with STIS+WFC3+NIRCam compared to just NIRCam, using free retrievals. NIRCam observations alone also result in misleading constraints on metallicity and C/O, with equilibrium chemistry and grid retrieval. We find that the model choice of varying C/H or O/H to vary the C/O in equilibrium chemistry retrievals leads to different metallicity constraints with NIRCam, but similar constraints with STIS+WFC3+NIRCam. We conclude that NIRCam observations alone can lead to overestimation of abundances for exoplanet atmospheres and, therefore, should be used in combination with UV/Optical and near-infrared observations to obtain robust constraints on abundances, C/O, and metallicity. Specifically, even though we can detect the CO$_2$ feature with just NIRCam, we cannot constrain its abundances robustly without the optical baseline.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Zeeman-Doppler imaging of stellar magnetic fields: I. Analysis of tau Scorpii in the weak-field limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Zeeman-Doppler imaging (ZDI) is used to study the surface magnetic field topology of stars, based on high-resolution spectropolarimetric time series observations. Multiple ZDI inversions have been conducted for the early B-type star tau Sco, which has been found to exhibit a weak but complex non-dipolar surface magnetic field. The classical ZDI framework suffers from a significant limitation in that it provides little to no reliable uncertainty quantification for the reconstructed magnetic field maps, with essentially all published results being confined to point estimates. To fill this gap, we propose a Bayesian framework for probabilistic ZDI. Here, the proposed framework is demonstrated on tau Sco in the weak-field limit. We propose three distinct statistical models, and use archival ESPaDOnS high-resolution Stokes V observations to carry out the probabilistic magnetic inversion in closed form. The surface magnetic field is parameterised by a high-dimensional spherical-harmonic expansion. By comparing three different prior distributions over the latent variables in the spherical-harmonic decomposition, our results showcase the ZDI sensitivity to various hyperparameters. The mean magnetic field maps are qualitatively similar to previously published point estimates, but analysis of the magnetic energy distribution indicates high uncertainty and higher energy content at low angular degrees l. Our results effectively demonstrate that, for stars in the weak-field regime, reliable uncertainty quantification of recovered magnetic field maps can be obtained in closed form with natural assumptions on the statistical model. Future work will explore extending this framework beyond the weak-field approximation and incorporating prior uncertainty over multiple stellar parameters in more complex magnetic inversion problems.</description>

      <title>An interference-based method for the detection of strongly lensed gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.06117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.06117v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The strongly lensed gravitational wave (SLGW) is a promising transient phenomenon. However, the long-wave nature of gravitational waves poses a significant challenge in identification of its host galaxy. To tackle this challenge, we propose a method triggered by the wave optics effect of microlensing. The microlensing interference introduce frequency-dependent fluctuations in the waveform. Our method consists of three steps. First, we reconstruct the waveforms by using the template-independent and template-dependent methods. The mismatch of two reconstructions serves as an indicator of SLGWs. This step can identify approximately $10\%$ SLGWs. Second, we pair the SLGWs' multiple-images by employing the sky localization overlapping. Because we have pre-identified at least one image through microlensing, the false alarm probability for pairing SLGWs is significantly reduced. Third, we search the host galaxy by requiring the consistency of time-delays between galaxy-galaxy lensing and SLGW. By combing the stage-IV galaxy survey and the third-generation gravitational wave detectors, we expect to find, on average, 1 quadruple-image system per 3 years. The merit of this method can significantly facilitate the pursuit of time-delay cosmography, discovery of compact objects and multi-messenger astronomy.</description>

      <title>On some pioneering Usenet newsgroups in astrophysics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15845v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The foundation of two very early Usenet newsgroups in astrophysics, still existent today, and some milestones in their history have been tracked from the origins at Princeton University in 1983 to 1994. They result to be pioneering experiences in this discipline, and among the earliest ones of this kind in academic disciplines at large. To the best of our knowledge, an account of their birth and evolution is given here for the first time. Following key recommendations from the recent discipline of web history, this research has combined multiple and different-type sources, building mainly on online archives of Usenet newsgroups and on human contributions from the concerned scholarly community. A final overview is proposed on how these early online communication tools have been perceived and used by the scholarly community involved. This research reconstructs computer mediated communication experiences which were at risk of being forgotten; provides a view of this environment's uptake of new communication technology; and contributes knowledge of some social dynamics of the astrophysics community in the last twenty years of the twentieth century.</description>

      <title>DAmodel: Hierarchical Bayesian Modelling of DA White Dwarfs for Spectrophotometric Calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08809v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use hierarchical Bayesian modelling to calibrate a network of 32 all-sky faint DA white dwarf (DA WD) spectrophotometric standards ($16.5 &lt; V &lt; 19.5$) alongside three CALSPEC standards, from 912 \r{A} to 32 $\mu$m. The framework is the first of its kind to jointly infer photometric zeropoints and WD parameters (surface gravity $\log g$, effective temperature $T_{\text{eff}}$, extinction $A_V$, dust relation parameter $R_V$) by simultaneously modelling both photometric and spectroscopic data. We model panchromatic Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera 3 (HST/WFC3) UVIS and IR photometry, HST/STIS UV spectroscopy and ground-based optical spectroscopy to sub-percent precision. Photometric residuals for the sample are the lowest yet yielding $&lt;0.004$ mag RMS on average from the UV to the NIR, achieved by jointly inferring time-dependent changes in system sensitivity and WFC3/IR count-rate nonlinearity. Our GPU-accelerated implementation enables efficient sampling via Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, critical for exploring the high-dimensional posterior space. The hierarchical nature of the model enables population analysis of intrinsic WD and dust parameters. Inferred spectral energy distributions from this model will be essential for calibrating the James Webb Space Telescope as well as next-generation surveys, including Vera Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time and the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope.</description>

      <title>A Novel Calibration and Imaging Method for ALMA Observations of SgrA*</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11258v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This document presents a novel method for the intra-field calibration and imaging of the radio source SgrA*, observed with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). SgrA* is a complex source comprising two components: the compact core (which exhibits high variability) and the extended minispiral (which is relatively stable over short timescales). The novel approach consists in a self-calibration method that employs the extended structure of the source (the minispiral) to calibrate the flux variability of the compact core. The algorithm involves several steps: (1) an initial CLEAN image is generated for the entire source; (2) the core is subtracted, leaving only the minispiral; (3) a two-component visibility model is constructed, comprising the minispiral and the core; (4) the model is fitted to the data, retrieving flux density parameters for each integration time; and (5) the data are scaled and calibrated, resulting in nearly constant brightness for the minispiral and variable flux for the core. The implementation of this algorithm through a script in the CASA package is described, detailing the configuration parameters and the steps involved. The success of the method is demonstrated through light curves of SgrA* observed on day 21 April 2018 in Band 6, as part of the 2018 EHT campaign. The light curves have been produced for Stokes I (total intensity), linear polarized intensity, EVPA (electric vector position angle), and Stokes V (circular polarization), providing valuable insights into the variability of this radio source.</description>

      <title>A Formalism for Calibrating the Instrumental Polarization of Radio Interferometric Arrays at Meter Wavelengths using Unpolarized Sky: A Demonstration using the MWA Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16675v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Calibration of instrumental polarization is critical for measuring polarized radio emissions from astrophysical sources to extract the magnetic field information in astrophysical, heliospheric, and terrestrial plasmas. At meter wavelengths, calibration of radio polarimetric observations is particularly challenging because of the scarcity of bright polarized sources due to significant Faraday depolarization. Here, we present a novel formalism for polarization calibration using an unpolarized sky model. The formalism is specifically designed for wide-field, low-frequency instruments like the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA), the LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR), New Extension in Nan\c{c}ay Upgrading LoFAR (NenuFAR), Owens Valley Radio Observatory - Long Wavelength Array (OVRO-LWA), low-frequency telescope of the Square Kilometre Array Observatory (SKAO-low), etc. By leveraging the apparent polarization of the unpolarized sky induced by the polarized primary beam of the radio telescope, this method avoids dependence on bright polarized calibrators. It is also immune to ionospheric Faraday rotation. The validation of the approach via MWA observations confirms the accuracy of the method. This formalism provides a robust framework for low-frequency polarization calibration. It addresses the longstanding calibration challenges and advances the field of low-frequency polarimetry by enabling polarization studies of astrophysical radio sources.</description>

      <title>Gamma-ray Bursts as Distance Indicators by a Statistical Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04551v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) can be probes of the early universe, but currently, only 26% of GRBs observed by the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory GRBs have known redshifts ($z$) due to observational limitations. To address this, we estimated the GRB redshift (distance) via a supervised statistical learning model that uses optical afterglow observed by Swift and ground-based telescopes. The inferred redshifts are strongly correlated (a Pearson coefficient of 0.93) with the observed redshifts, thus proving the reliability of this method. The inferred and observed redshifts allow us to estimate the number of GRBs occurring at a given redshift (GRB rate) to be 8.47-9 $yr^{-1} Gpc^{-1}$ for $1.9&lt;z&lt;2.3$. Since GRBs come from the collapse of massive stars, we compared this rate with the star formation rate highlighting a discrepancy of a factor of 3 at $z&lt;1$.</description>

      <title>Towards characterizing dark matter subhalo perturbations in stellar streams with graph neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03522v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The phase space of stellar streams is proposed to detect dark substructure in the Milky Way through the perturbations created by passing subhalos - and thus is a powerful test of the cold dark matter paradigm and its alternatives. Using graph convolutional neural network (GCNN) data compression and simulation-based inference (SBI) on a simulated GD-1-like stream, we improve the constraint on the mass of a [$10^8$, $10^7$, $10^6$] $M_\odot$ perturbing subhalo by factors of [11, 7, 3] with respect to the current state-of-the-art density power spectrum analysis. We find that the GCNN produces posteriors that are more accurate (better calibrated) than the power spectrum. We simulate the positions and velocities of stars in a GD-1-like stream and perturb the stream with subhalos of varying mass and velocity. Leveraging the feature encoding of the GCNN to compress the input phase space data, we then use SBI to estimate the joint posterior of the subhalo mass and velocity. We investigate how our results scale with the size of the GCNN, the coordinate system of the input and the effect of incomplete observations. Our results suggest that a survey with $10 \times$ fewer stars (300 stars) with complete 6-D phase space data performs about as well as a deeper survey (3000 stars) with only 3-D data (photometry, spectroscopy). The stronger constraining power and more accurate posterior estimation motivate further development of GCNNs in combining future photometric, spectroscopic and astrometric stream observations.</description>
