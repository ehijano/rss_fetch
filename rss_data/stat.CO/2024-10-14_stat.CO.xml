      <title>The Gibbs sampler revisited from the perspective of conditional modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Gibbs sampler (GS) is a crucial algorithm for approximating complex calculations, and it is justified by Markov chain theory, the alternating projection theorem, and $I$-projection, separately. We explore the equivalence between these three operators. Partially collapsed Gibbs sampler (PCGS) and pseudo-Gibbs sampler (PGS) are two generalizations of GS. For PCGS, the associated Markov chain is heterogeneous with varying state spaces, and we propose the iterative conditional replacement algorithm (ICR) to prove its convergence. In addition, ICR can approximate the multiple stationary distributions modeled by a PGS. Our approach highlights the benefit of using one operator for one conditional distribution, rather than lumping all the conditionals into one operator. Because no Markov chain theory is required, this approach simplifies the understanding of convergence.</description>

      <title>Exact MCMC for Intractable Proposals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accept-reject based Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods are the workhorse algorithm for Bayesian inference. These algorithms, like Metropolis-Hastings, require the choice of a proposal distribution which is typically informed by the desired target distribution. Surprisingly, proposal distributions with unknown normalizing constants are not uncommon, even though for such a choice of a proposal, the Metropolis-Hastings acceptance ratio cannot be evaluated exactly. Across the literature, authors resort to approximation methods that yield inexact MCMC or develop specialized algorithms to combat this problem. We show how Bernoulli factory MCMC algorithms, originally proposed for doubly intractable target distributions, can quite naturally be adapted to this situation. We present three diverse and relevant examples demonstrating the usefulness of the Bernoulli factory approach to this problem.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Transfer Learning for Artificially Intelligent Geospatial Systems: A Predictive Stacking Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Building artificially intelligent geospatial systems require rapid delivery of spatial data analysis at massive scales with minimal human intervention. Depending upon their intended use, data analysis may also entail model assessment and uncertainty quantification. This article devises transfer learning frameworks for deployment in artificially intelligent systems, where a massive data set is split into smaller data sets that stream into the analytical framework to propagate learning and assimilate inference for the entire data set. Specifically, we introduce Bayesian predictive stacking for multivariate spatial data and demonstrate its effectiveness in rapidly analyzing massive data sets. Furthermore, we make inference feasible in a reasonable amount of time, and without excessively demanding hardware settings. We illustrate the effectiveness of this approach in extensive simulation experiments and subsequently analyze massive data sets in climate science on sea surface temperatures and on vegetation index.</description>

      <title>Provable Convergence and Limitations of Geometric Tempering for Langevin Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Geometric tempering is a popular approach to sampling from challenging multi-modal probability distributions by instead sampling from a sequence of distributions which interpolate, using the geometric mean, between an easier proposal distribution and the target distribution. In this paper, we theoretically investigate the soundness of this approach when the sampling algorithm is Langevin dynamics, proving both upper and lower bounds. Our upper bounds are the first analysis in the literature under functional inequalities. They assert the convergence of tempered Langevin in continuous and discrete-time, and their minimization leads to closed-form optimal tempering schedules for some pairs of proposal and target distributions. Our lower bounds demonstrate a simple case where the geometric tempering takes exponential time, and further reveal that the geometric tempering can suffer from poor functional inequalities and slow convergence, even when the target distribution is well-conditioned. Overall, our results indicate that geometric tempering may not help, and can even be harmful for convergence.</description>

      <title>Detecting Structural Shifts and Estimating Change-Points in Interval-Based Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09884v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the open problem of conducting change-point analysis for interval-valued time series data using the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) framework. Motivated by financial time series, we analyze data that includes daily opening (O), up (U), low (L), and closing (C) values, rather than just a closing value as traditionally used. To tackle this, we propose a fundamental model based on stochastic differential equations, which also serves as a transformation of other widely used models, such as the log-transformed geometric Brownian motion model. We derive the joint distribution for these interval-valued observations using the reflection principle and Girsanov's theorem. The MLE is obtained by optimizing the log-likelihood function through first and second-order derivative calculations, utilizing the Newton-Raphson algorithm. We further propose a novel parametric bootstrap method to compute confidence intervals, addressing challenges related to temporal dependency and interval-based data relationships. The performance of the model is evaluated through extensive simulations and real data analysis using S&amp;P500 returns during the 2022 Russo-Ukrainian War. The results demonstrate that the proposed OULC model consistently outperforms the traditional OC model, offering more accurate and reliable change-point detection and parameter estimates.</description>

      <title>The Augmented Factorization Bound for Maximum-Entropy Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The maximum-entropy sampling problem (MESP) aims to select the most informative principal submatrix of a prespecified size from a given covariance matrix. This paper proposes an augmented factorization bound for MESP based on concave relaxation. By leveraging majorization and Schur-concavity theory, we demonstrate that this new bound dominates the classic factorization bound of Nikolov (2015) and a recent upper bound proposed by Li et al. (2024). Furthermore, we provide theoretical guarantees that quantify how much our proposed bound improves the two existing ones and establish sufficient conditions for when the improvement is strictly attained. These results allow us to refine the celebrated approximation bounds for the two approximation algorithms of MESP. Besides, motivated by the strength of this new bound, we develop a variable fixing logic for MESP from a primal perspective. Finally, our numerical experiments demonstrate that our proposed bound achieves smaller integrality gaps and fixes more variables than the tightest bounds in the MESP literature on most benchmark instances, with the improvement being particularly significant when the condition number of the covariance matrix is small.</description>

      <title>fastHDMI: Fast Mutual Information Estimation for High-Dimensional Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce fastHDMI, a Python package designed for efficient variable screening in high-dimensional datasets, particularly neuroimaging data. This work pioneers the application of three mutual information estimation methods for neuroimaging variable selection, a novel approach implemented via fastHDMI. These advancements enhance our ability to analyze the complex structures of neuroimaging datasets, providing improved tools for variable selection in high-dimensional spaces.
  Using the preprocessed ABIDE dataset, we evaluate the performance of these methods through extensive simulations. The tests cover a range of conditions, including linear and nonlinear associations, as well as continuous and binary outcomes. Our results highlight the superiority of the FFTKDE-based mutual information estimation for feature screening in continuous nonlinear outcomes, while binning-based methods outperform others for binary outcomes with nonlinear probability preimages. For linear simulations, both Pearson correlation and FFTKDE-based methods show comparable performance for continuous outcomes, while Pearson excels in binary outcomes with linear probability preimages.
  A comprehensive case study using the ABIDE dataset further demonstrates fastHDMI's practical utility, showcasing the predictive power of models built from variables selected using our screening techniques. This research affirms the computational efficiency and methodological strength of fastHDMI, significantly enriching the toolkit available for neuroimaging analysis.</description>

      <title>Variational autoencoders with latent high-dimensional steady geometric flows for dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop Riemannian approaches to variational autoencoders (VAEs) for PDE-type ambient data with regularizing geometric latent dynamics, which we refer to as VAE-DLM, or VAEs with dynamical latent manifolds. We redevelop the VAE framework such that manifold geometries, subject to a geometric flow, embedded in Euclidean space are learned in the intermediary latent space developed by encoders and decoders. We reformulate the traditional evidence lower bound (ELBO) loss with a considerate choice of prior. We develop a linear geometric flow with a steady-state regularizing term. This geometric flow requires only automatic differentiation of one time derivative, and can be solved in moderately high dimensions in a physics-informed approach, allowing more expressive latent representations. We discuss how this flow can be formulated as a gradient flow, and maintains entropy away from metric singularity. This, along with an eigenvalue penalization condition, helps ensure the manifold is sufficiently large in measure, nondegenerate, and a canonical geometry, which contribute to a robust representation. Our methods focus on the modified multi-layer perceptron architecture with tanh activations for the manifold encoder-decoder. We demonstrate, on our datasets of interest, our methods perform at least as well as the traditional VAE, and oftentimes better. Our methods can outperform a standard VAE and a VAE endowed with our proposed architecture by up to 25% reduction in out-of-distribution (OOD) error and potentially greater. We highlight our method on ambient PDEs whose solutions maintain minimal variation in late times over its solution. Our approaches are particularly favorable with severe OOD effect. We provide empirical justification towards how latent Riemannian manifolds improve robust learning for external dynamics with VAEs.</description>

      <title>Optimal lower bounds for logistic log-likelihoods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The logit transform is arguably the most widely-employed link function beyond linear settings. This transformation routinely appears in regression models for binary data and provides, either explicitly or implicitly, a core building-block within state-of-the-art methodologies for both classification and regression. Its widespread use, combined with the lack of analytical solutions for the optimization of general losses involving the logit transform, still motivates active research in computational statistics. Among the directions explored, a central one has focused on the design of tangent lower bounds for logistic log-likelihoods that can be tractably optimized, while providing a tight approximation of these log-likelihoods. Although progress along these lines has led to the development of effective minorize-maximize (MM) algorithms for point estimation and coordinate ascent variational inference schemes for approximate Bayesian inference under several logit models, the overarching focus in the literature has been on tangent quadratic minorizers. In fact, it is still unclear whether tangent lower bounds sharper than quadratic ones can be derived without undermining the tractability of the resulting minorizer. This article addresses such a challenging question through the design and study of a novel piece-wise quadratic lower bound that uniformly improves any tangent quadratic minorizer, including the sharpest ones, while admitting a direct interpretation in terms of the classical generalized lasso problem. As illustrated in a ridge logistic regression, this unique connection facilitates more effective implementations than those provided by available piece-wise bounds, while improving the convergence speed of quadratic ones.</description>

      <title>New Metrics for Assessing Projection Pursuit Indexes, and Guiding Optimisation Choices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13663v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The projection pursuit (PP) guided tour interactively optimises a criterion function known as the PP index, to explore high-dimensional data by revealing interesting projections. Optimisation of some PP indexes can be non-trivial, if they are non-smooth functions, or the optimum has a small "squint angle", detectable only from close proximity. To address these challenges, this study investigates the performance of a recently introduced swarm-based algorithm, Jellyfish Search Optimiser (JSO), for optimising PP indexes. The performance of JSO for visualising data is evaluated across various hyper-parameter settings and compared with existing optimisers. Additionally, methods for calculating the smoothness and squintability properties of the PP index are proposed. They are used to assess the optimiser performance in the presence of PP index complexities. A simulation study illustrates the use of these performance metrics to compare the JSO with existing optimisation methods available for the guided tour. The JSO algorithm has been implemented in the R package, `tourr`, and functions to calculate smoothness and squintability are available in the `ferrn` package.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty Quantification in Synthetic Controls with Staggered Treatment Adoption</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.05026v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose principled prediction intervals to quantify the uncertainty of a large class of synthetic control predictions (or estimators) in settings with staggered treatment adoption, offering precise non-asymptotic coverage probability guarantees. From a methodological perspective, we provide a detailed discussion of different causal quantities to be predicted, which we call causal predictands, allowing for multiple treated units with treatment adoption at possibly different points in time. From a theoretical perspective, our uncertainty quantification methods improve on prior literature by (i) covering a large class of causal predictands in staggered adoption settings, (ii) allowing for synthetic control methods with possibly nonlinear constraints, (iii) proposing scalable robust conic optimization methods and principled data-driven tuning parameter selection, and (iv) offering valid uniform inference across post-treatment periods. We illustrate our methodology with an empirical application studying the effects of economic liberalization on real GDP per capita for Sub-Saharan African countries. Companion general-purpose software packages are provided in Python, R, and Stata.</description>

      <title>Markov chain entropy games and the geometry of their Nash equilibria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.04115v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider the following two-person mixed strategy game of a probabilist against Nature with respect to the parameters $(f, \mathcal{B},\pi)$, where $f$ is a convex function satisfying certain regularity conditions, $\mathcal{B}$ is either the set $\{L_i\}_{i=1}^n$ or its convex hull with each $L_i$ being a Markov infinitesimal generator on a finite state space $\mathcal{X}$ and $\pi$ is a given positive discrete distribution on $\mathcal{X}$. The probabilist chooses a prior measure $\mu$ within the set of probability measures on $\mathcal{B}$ denoted by $\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{B})$ and picks a $L \in \mathcal{B}$ at random according to $\mu$, whereas Nature follows a pure strategy to select $M \in \mathcal{L}(\pi)$, the set of $\pi$-reversible Markov generators on $\mathcal{X}$. Nature pays an amount $D_f(M||L)$, the $f$-divergence from $L$ to $M$, to the probabilist. We prove that a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium always exists, and establish a minimax result on the expected payoff of the game. This also contrasts with the pure strategy version of the game where we show a Nash equilibrium may not exist. To find approximately a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium, we propose and develop a simple projected subgradient algorithm that provably converges with a rate of $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{t})$, where $t$ is the number of iterations. In addition, we elucidate the relationships of Nash equilibrium with other seemingly disparate notions such as weighted information centroid, Chebyshev center and Bayes risk. This article generalizes the two-person game of a statistician against Nature developed in the literature, and highlights the powerful interplay and synergy between modern Markov chains theory and geometry, information theory, game theory, optimization and mathematical statistics.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a novel Bayesian framework for estimating time-varying volatility by extending the Random Walk Stochastic Volatility (RWSV) model with a new Dynamic Shrinkage Process (DSP) in (log) variances. Unlike classical Stochastic Volatility or GARCH-type models with restrictive parametric stationarity assumptions, our proposed Adaptive Stochastic Volatility (ASV) model provides smooth yet dynamically adaptive estimates of evolving volatility and its uncertainty (vol of vol). We derive the theoretical properties of the proposed global-local shrinkage prior. Through simulation studies, we demonstrate that ASV exhibits remarkable misspecification resilience with low prediction error across various data generating scenarios in simulation. Furthermore, ASV's capacity to yield locally smooth and interpretable estimates facilitates a clearer understanding of underlying patterns and trends in volatility. Additionally, we propose and illustrate an extension for Bayesian Trend Filtering simultaneously in both mean and variance. Finally, we show that this attribute makes ASV a robust tool applicable across a wide range of disciplines, including in finance, environmental science, epidemiology, and medicine, among others.</description>

      <title>Localized Schr\"odinger Bridge Sampler</title>

Abstract: We consider the generative problem of sampling from an unknown distribution for which only a sufficiently large number of training samples are available. In this paper, we build on previous work combining Schr\"odinger bridges and Langevin dynamics. A key bottleneck of this approach is the exponential dependence of the required training samples on the dimension, $d$, of the ambient state space. We propose a localization strategy which exploits conditional independence of conditional expectation values. Localization thus replaces a single high-dimensional Schr\"odinger bridge problem by $d$ low-dimensional Schr\"odinger bridge problems over the available training samples. In this context, a connection to multi-head self attention transformer architectures is established. As for the original Schr\"odinger bridge sampling approach, the localized sampler is stable and geometric ergodic. The sampler also naturally extends to conditional sampling and to Bayesian inference. We demonstrate the performance of our proposed scheme through experiments on a Gaussian problem with increasing dimensions, on a temporal stochastic process, and on a stochastic subgrid-scale parametrization conditional sampling problem.</description>

      <title>A Functional Extension of Semi-Structured Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05430v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Semi-structured networks (SSNs) merge the structures familiar from additive models with deep neural networks, allowing the modeling of interpretable partial feature effects while capturing higher-order non-linearities at the same time. A significant challenge in this integration is maintaining the interpretability of the additive model component. Inspired by large-scale biomechanics datasets, this paper explores extending SSNs to functional data. Existing methods in functional data analysis are promising but often not expressive enough to account for all interactions and non-linearities and do not scale well to large datasets. Although the SSN approach presents a compelling potential solution, its adaptation to functional data remains complex. In this work, we propose a functional SSN method that retains the advantageous properties of classical functional regression approaches while also improving scalability. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that this approach accurately recovers underlying signals, enhances predictive performance, and performs favorably compared to competing methods.</description>
