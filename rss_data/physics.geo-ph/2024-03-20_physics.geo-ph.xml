      <title>Note on Using Singular Value Decomposition to Solve Diluted Pore Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diluted pore networks or networks that are obtained directly from image analysis (e.g., CT scans of rock samples) are commonly used to evaluate flow through multiphase and complex porous media. These networks are often subjected to singular points and regions, that is, isolated sub-networks that are not connecting the inlet and outlet. These regions impair the invertibility of the Laplacian matrix and affect the accuracy and robustness of the pore network models. Searching and eliminating these singularities is commonly done by preconditioning or searching algorithms like breadth-first search (BFS) or depth-first search (DFS), which are time-consuming and computationally expensive. Here, we suggest using the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to simultaneously locate and eliminate isolated regions and solve the flow equation. In this technical note, we briefly describe the SVD method and demonstrate its utility in solving the flow equation of different networks and dilution degrees. We show that the SVD is extremely robust, allowing exact solutions up to the percolation threshold. Moreover, we compare pore network solutions of images with and without singular regions to demonstrate how effective SVD is in locating and eliminating the singular regions while keeping the same solution in the relevant domain.</description>

      <title>Encoding the Subsurface in 3D with Seismic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article presents a self-supervised generative AI approach to seismic data processing and interpretation using a Masked AutoEncoder (MAE) with a Vision Transformer (ViT) backbone. We modified the MAE-ViT architecture to process 3D seismic mini-cubes to analyze post-stack seismic data. The MAE model can semantically categorize seismic features, demonstrated through t-SNE visualization, much like large language models (LLMs) understand text. After we fine-tune the model, its ability to interpolate seismic volumes in 3D showcases a downstream application. The study's use of an open-source dataset from the "Onward - Patch the Planet" competition ensures transparency and reproducibility of the results. The findings are significant as they represent a step towards utilizing state-of-the-art technology for seismic processing and interpretation tasks.</description>

      <title>Pore network models to determine flow statistics and structural controls in variably saturated porous media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conceptualizing a porous media as a network of conductors sets a compromise between the oversimplifying conceptualization of the media as a bundle of capillary tubes and the computationally expensive and unobtainable detailed description of the media's geometry needed for direct numerical simulations. These models are abundantly being used to evaluate single and multiphase flow characteristics. The different flow characteristics are valuable in evaluating phenomena that may or may not be relevant for different applications. Here, we evaluate how different information about the pore space affects the ability of the network model to evaluate different flow characteristics.</description>

      <title>Modeling the impact of thermal stresses induced by wellbore cooldown on the breakdown pressure and geometry of a hydraulic fracture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.06186v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wellbore cooldown is often employed before well stimulation and/or hydraulic fracture stress testing in EGS and high temperature petroleum reservoirs. The thermo-elastic stress resulting from heat conduction during the cooling activity can have important influence on the behavior of the hydraulic fractures. A coupled numerical model has been developed to study the thermo-mechanical effect associated with pre-injection wellbore cooldown on the wellbore pressure and geometry of the hydraulic fracture (either longitudinal or transverse to the wellbore axis). The main novelty of this numerical study is the consideration of significant near-wellbore thermal stresses in the coupled non-linear problem of hydraulic fracturing initiation and propagation, which enables investigation of the thermo-mechanical effect under different fracture propagation regimes. Simulation results show earlier fracture initiation and lower breakdown pressure caused by cooling circulation. Extensive wellbore cooling also significantly alters the evolution of wellbore pressure, as evidenced by the differences observed under various cooling conditions. Most importantly, cooling promotes the transverse initiation of hydraulic fractures in situations where the initiation would have been longitudinal in the absence of cooling. The cases most susceptible to the complete change of fracture initiation geometry are those horizontal wells drilled parallel to the minimum horizontal stress but also applicable to vertical wells in cases where the vertical stress is the lower in magnitude than either horizontal principal stress. These results combine to indicate a profound potential for cooling to impact hydraulic fracture initiation and early growth, and therefore needs to be considered in the planning and interpretation of stress testing and reservoir stimulation when cooling operations are necessary.</description>
