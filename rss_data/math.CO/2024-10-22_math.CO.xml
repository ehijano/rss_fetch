      <title>Ternary is Still Good for Parikh Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The focus of this work is the study of Parikh matrices with emphasis on two concrete problems. In the first part of our presentation we show that a conjecture by Dick at al. in 2021 only stands in the case of ternary alphabets, while providing counterexamples for larger alphabets. In particular, we show that the only type of distinguishability in the case of 3-letter alphabets is the trivial one. The second part of the paper builds on the notion of Parikh matrices for projections of words, discussed initially in this work, and answers, once more in the case of a ternary alphabet, a question posed by Atanasiu et al. in 2022 with regards to the minimal Hamming distance in between words sharing a congruency class.</description>

      <title>Star edge coloring of generalized Petersen graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The star chromatic index of a graph $G$, denoted by $\chi^\prime_s(G)$, is the smallest integer $k$ for which $G$ admits a proper edge coloring with $k$ colors such that every path and cycle of length four is not bicolored. Let $d$ be the greatest common divisor of $n$ and $k$. Zhu~et~al. (\footnotesize{Discussiones Mathematicae: Graph Theory, 41(2): 1265, 2021}) showed that for every integers $k$ and $n&gt; 2k$ with $d\geq 3$, generalized Petersen graph $GP(n,k)$ admits a 5-star edge coloring, with the exception of the case that $d = 3$, $k\neq d$ and $\frac{n}{3}= 1\pmod{3}$. Also, they conjectured that for every $n&gt;2k$, $\chi^\prime_s(GP(n,k))\leq 5$, except $GP(3,1)$. In this paper, we prove that for every $GP(n,k)$ with $n\geq 2k$ and $d\geq 3$ their conjecture is true. In fact, we provide a 5-star edge coloring of $GP(n,k)$, where $n\geq 2k$ and $d\geq 3$. We also obtain some results for 5-star edge coloring of $GP(n,k)$ with $d=2$. Moreover, Dvo{\v{r}}{\'a}k et al. ({\footnotesize Journal of Graph Theory, 72(3):313-326, 2013}) conjectured that the star of chromatic index of subcubic graphs is at most 6. Thus, our results also prove this conjecture for the generalized Petersen graphs, as a class of subcubic graphs.</description>

      <title>Hook length biases in $t$-regular and $t$-distinct partitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $t\geq2$ and $k\geq1$ be integers. A $t$-regular partition of a positive integer $n$ is a partition of $n$ such that none of its parts is divisible by $t$. A $t$-distinct partition of a positive integer $n$ is a partition of $n$ such that any of its parts can occur at most $t-1$ times. Let $b_{t,k}(n)$ (respectively, $d_{t,k}(n)$) denote the number of hooks of length $k$ in all the $t$-regular (respectively, $t$-distinct) partitions of $n$. In this article, we prove some biases for $b_{t,k}(n)$ for fixed values of $k$. We prove that for any $t\geq2$, $b_{t+1,1}(n)\geq b_{t,1}(n)$, for all $n\geq0$. We establish that $b_{3,2}(n)\geq b_{2,2}(n)$, for all $n&gt;3$ and $b_{3,3}(n)\geq b_{2,3}(n)$, for all $n\geq0$. We also prove a very general bias $d_{t+1,k}(n)\geq d_{t,k}(n)$ which holds for all $n\geq0$ and for any $t$ and $k$. Our methods of proofs are completely combinatorial. Finally, we state some problems for future works.</description>

      <title>Chordal bipartite graphs, biclique vertex partitions and Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity of $1$-subdivision graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A biclique in a graph $G$ is a complete bipartite subgraph (not necessarily induced), and the least positive integer $k$ for which the vertex set of $G$ can be partitioned into at most $k$ bicliques is the biclique vertex partition number $bp(G)$ of $G$. We prove that the inequality $reg(S(G))\geq |G|-bp(G)$ holds for every graph $G$, where $S(G)$ is the $1$-subdivision graph of $G$ and $reg(S(G))$ denotes the (Castelnuovo-Mumford) regularity of the graph $S(G)$. In particular, we show that the equality $reg(S(B))=|B|-bp(B)$ holds provided that $B$ is a chordal bipartite graph. Furthermore, for every chordal bipartite graph $B$, we prove that the independence complex of $S(B)$ is either contractible or homotopy equivalent to a sphere, and provide a polynomial time checkable criteria for when it is contractible, and describe the dimension of the sphere when it is not.</description>

      <title>Matroids with bases as minimal resolving sets of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define an independence system associated with simple graphs. We prove that the independence system is a matroid for certain families of graphs, including trees, with bases as minimal resolving sets. Consequently, the greedy algorithm on the matroid can be used to find the minimum-cost resolving set of weighted graphs, wherein the independent system is a matroid. We also characterize hyperplanes of the matroid for trees and prove that its dual matroid is loop-free.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the distribution and popularity of different parameters (such as the number of descents, runs, valleys, peaks, right-to-left minima, and more) on the sets of increasing and flattened permutations. For each parameter, we provide an exponential generating function for its corresponding distribution and popularity.Additionally, we present one-to-one correspondences between these permutations and some classes of simpler combinatorial objects.</description>

      <title>Attempting the impossible: enumerating extremal submodular functions for n=6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enumerating the extremal submodular functions defined on subsets of a fixed base set has only been done for base sets up to five elements. This paper reports the results of attempting to generate all such functions on a six-element base set. Using improved tools from polyhedral geometry, we have computed 360 billion of them, and provide the first reasonable estimate of their total number, which is expected to be between 1,000 and 10,000 times this number. The applied Double Description and Adjacency Decomposition methods require an insertion order of the defining inequalities. We introduce two novel orders, which speed up the computations significantly, and provide additional insight into the highly symmetric structure of submodular functions. We also present an improvement to the combinatorial test used as part of the Double Description method, and use statistical analyses to estimate the degeneracy of the polyhedral cone used to describe these functions. The statistical results also highlight the limitations of the applied methods.</description>

      <title>A charge monomial basis of the Garsia-Procesi ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a basis of the Garsia-Procesi ring using the catabolizability type of standard Young tableaux and the charge statistic. This basis turns out to be equal to the descent basis defined in Carlsson-Chou (2024+). Our new construction connects the combinatorics of the basis with the well-known combinatorial formula for the modified Hall-Littlewood polynomials $\tilde{H}_\mu[X;q]$, due to Lascoux, which expresses the polynomials as a sum over standard tableaux that satisfy a catabolizability condition. In addition, we prove that identifying a basis for the antisymmetric part of $R_{\mu}$ with respect to a Young subgroup $S_\gamma$ is equivalent to finding pairs of standard tableaux that satisfy conditions regarding catabolizability and descents. This gives an elementary proof of the fact that the graded Frobenius character of $R_{\mu}$ is given by the catabolizability formula for $\tilde{H}_\mu[X;q]$.</description>

      <title>On the Matching Problem in Random Hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a variant of the Erd\H{o}s Matching Problem in random hypergraphs. Let $\mathcal{K}_p(n,k)$ denote the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random $k$-uniform hypergraph on $n$ vertices where each possible edge is included with probability $p$. We show that when $n\gg k^{2}s$ and $p$ is not too small, with high probability, the maximum number of edges in a sub-hypergraph of $\mathcal{K}_p(n,k)$ with matching number $s$ is obtained by the trivial sub-hypergraphs, i.e. the sub-hypergraph consisting of all edges containing at least one vertex in a fixed set of $s$ vertices.</description>

      <title>Matching stability for 3-partite 3-uniform hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $n,k,s$ be three integers such that $k\geq 2$ and $n\geq s\geq 1$. Let $H$ be a $k$-partite $k$-uniform hypergraph with $n$ vertices in each class. Aharoni (2017) showed that if $e(H)&gt;(s-1)n^{k-1}$, then $H$ has a matching of size $s$.
  In this paper, we gave a stability result for 3-partite 3-uniform hypergraphs: if $G$ is a $3$-partite $3$-uniform hypergraph with $n\geq 162$ vertices in each class, $e(G)\geq (s-1)n^2+3n-s$ and $G$ contains no matching of size $s+1$, then $G$ has a vertex cover of size $s$. Our bound is also tight.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide special values of $K$-theoretic Schur $P$- and $Q$-functions. Using these special values, we show the odd property of the number of shifted set-valued tableaux. Additionally, we generalize these special values to skew cases. Based on these special values, we demonstrate the odd property of the number of shifted skew set-valued tableaux and that they form pairs.</description>

Abstract: Recently, Andrews and El Bachraoui (2024) proved three very interesting $q$-series identities, from which three simple looking identities involving certain restricted partitions into distinct even parts and $4$-regular partitions follow. In this short note, we give combinatorial proofs of these identities. We also prove the counterpart identities for the restricted partitions into distinct odd parts.</description>

      <title>On the two-colour Rado number for $\sum_{i=1}^m a_ix_i=c$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $a_1,\ldots,a_m$ be nonzero integers, $c \in \mathbb Z$ and $r \ge 2$. The Rado number for the equation \[ \sum_{i=1}^m a_ix_i = c \] in $r$ colours is the least positive integer $N$ such that any $r$-colouring of the integers in the interval $[1,N]$ admits a monochromatic solution to the given equation. We introduce the concept of $t$-distributability of sets of positive integers, and determine exact values whenever possible, and upper and lower bounds otherwise, for the Rado numbers when the set $\{a_1,\ldots,a_{m-1}\}$ is $2$-distributable or $3$-distributable, $a_m=-1$, and $r=2$. This generalizes previous works by several authors.</description>

      <title>Disjoint connected dominating sets in pseudorandom graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A connected dominating set (CDS) in a graph is a dominating set of vertices that induces a connected subgraph. Having many disjoint CDSs in a graph can be considered as a measure of its connectivity, and has various graph-theoretic and algorithmic implications. We show that $d$-regular (weakly) pseudoreandom graphs contain $(1+o(1))d/\ln d$ disjoint CDSs, which is asymptotically best possible. In particular, this implies that random $d$-regular graphs typically contain $(1+o(1))d/\ln d$ disjoint CDSs.</description>

      <title>Unique subgraphs are rare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A folklore result attributed to P\'olya states that there are $(1 + o(1))2^{\binom{n}{2}}/n!$ non-isomorphic graphs on $n$ vertices. Given two graphs $G$ and $H$, we say that $G$ is a unique subgraph of $H$ if $H$ contains exactly one subgraph isomorphic to $G$. For an $n$-vertex graph $H$, let $f(H)$ be the number of non-isomorphic unique subgraphs of $H$ divided by $2^{\binom{n}{2}}/n!$ and let $f(n)$ denote the maximum of $f(H)$ over all graphs $H$ on $n$ vertices. In 1975, Erd\H{o}s asked whether there exists $\delta&gt;0$ such that $f(n)&gt;\delta$ for all $n$ and offered $\$100$ for a proof and $\$25$ for a disproof, indicating he does not believe this to be true. We verify Erd\H{o}s' intuition by showing that $f(n)\rightarrow 0$ as $n$ tends to infinity, i.e. no graph on $n$ vertices contains a constant proportion of all graphs on $n$ vertices as unique subgraphs.</description>

  Leaning on these correspondences, we gather what is known about the number of maximal antichains in products of two finite linear orders and we establish some new results.</description>

      <title>Enumeration of rooted binary perfect phylogenies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rooted binary perfect phylogenies provide a generalization of rooted binary unlabeled trees in which each leaf is assigned a positive integer value that corresponds in a biological setting to the count of the number of indistinguishable lineages associated with the leaf. For the rooted binary unlabeled trees, these integers equal 1. We address a variety of enumerative problems concerning rooted binary perfect phylogenies with sample size $s$: the rooted binary unlabeled trees in which a sample of size $s$ lineages is distributed across the leaves of an unlabeled tree with $n$ leaves, $1 \leq n \leq s$. The enumerations further characterize the rooted binary perfect phylogenies, which include the rooted binary unlabeled trees, and which can provide a set of structures useful for various biological contexts.</description>

      <title>Seminorm estimates and joint ergodicity for pairwise independent Hardy sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a robust structure theory for multiple ergodic averages of commuting transformations along Hardy sequences of polynomial growth. We then apply it to derive a number of novel results on joint ergodicity, recurrence and convergence. Specifically, we construct a suitable generalization of Host-Kra and box seminorms that quantitatively controls the aforementioned averages subject to necessary nondegeneracy conditions on the Hardy sequences. Combining this with a variant of the seminorm smoothing argument, we obtain Host-Kra seminorm estimates for averages along all pairwise independent Hardy sequences. In conjunction with joint ergodicity criteria and classical equidistribution results, these estimates yield a number of novel joint ergodicity results that reach far beyond the state of the art. In particular, we prove joint ergodicity for (a) pairwise independent Hardy sequences and weakly mixing transformations, (b) strongly independent Hardy sequences and ergodic transformations, (c) irrationally strongly independent Hardy sequences and totally ergodic transformations. We also positively resolve the joint ergodicity classification problem for all pairwise independent Hardy sequences, of which the aforementioned three families are special cases. Lastly, we use these joint ergodicity results to provide new recurrence results for multidimensional patterns along strongly independent Hardy sequences.
  While building on recent technical advances (e.g. PET coefficient tracking schemes and joint ergodicity criteria), our work introduces a number of technical developments of its own, including the theory of generalized box seminorms, an ergodic version of the quantitative concatenation argument, improved simultaneous Taylor approximations for Hardy sequences, and a generalization of the seminorm smoothing argument.</description>

      <title>Action of free fermions on Symmetric Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Clifford algebra of the endomorphisms of the exterior algebra of a countably dimensional vector space induces natural bosonic shadows, i.e. families of linear maps between the cohomologies of complex grassmannians. The main result of this paper is to provide a determinantal formula expressing generating functions of such endomorphisms unifying several classical special cases. For example the action over a point recovers the Jacobi-Trudy formula in the theory of symmetric functions or the Giambelli's one in classical Schubert calculus, whereas the action of degree preserving endomorphisms take into account the finite type version of the Date-Jimbo-Kashiwara-Miwa bosonic vertex operator representation of the Lie algebra $gl(\infty)$. The fermionic actions on (finite type) bosonic spaces is described in terms of the classical theory of symmetric functions. The main guiding principle is the fact that the exterior algebra is a (non irreducible) representation of the ring of symmetric functions, which is the way we use to spell the ``finite type'' Boson-Fermion correspondence.</description>

Abstract: We study the theory of equations in one variable over polyhedral semirings. The article revolves around a notion of solution to a polynomial equation over a polyhedral semiring. Our main results are a characterisation of local solutions in terms of the coefficients, a local-global principle, and the basics of multiplicity and discriminants. Our primary sources of motivation are tropical geometry and the theory of exceptional points in non-Hermitian physics.</description>

      <title>Improved Explicit Near-Optimal Codes in the High-Noise Regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study uniquely decodable codes and list decodable codes in the high-noise regime, specifically codes that are uniquely decodable from $\frac{1-\varepsilon}{2}$ fraction of errors and list decodable from $1-\varepsilon$ fraction of errors. We present several improved explicit constructions that achieve near-optimal rates, as well as efficient or even linear-time decoding algorithms. Our contributions are as follows.
  1. Explicit Near-Optimal Linear Time Uniquely Decodable Codes: We construct a family of explicit $\mathbb{F}_2$-linear codes with rate $\Omega(\varepsilon)$ and alphabet size $2^{\mathrm{poly} \log(1/\varepsilon)}$, that are capable of correcting $e$ errors and $s$ erasures whenever $2e + s &lt; (1 - \varepsilon)n$ in linear-time.
  2. Explicit Near-Optimal List Decodable Codes: We construct a family of explicit list decodable codes with rate $\Omega(\varepsilon)$ and alphabet size $2^{\mathrm{poly} \log(1/\varepsilon)}$, that are capable of list decoding from $1-\varepsilon$ fraction of errors with a list size $L = \exp\exp\exp(\log^{\ast}n)$ in polynomial time.
  3. List Decodable Code with Near-Optimal List Size: We construct a family of explicit list decodable codes with an optimal list size of $O(1/\varepsilon)$, albeit with a suboptimal rate of $O(\varepsilon^2)$, capable of list decoding from $1-\varepsilon$ fraction of errors in polynomial time. Furthermore, we introduce a new combinatorial object called multi-set disperser, and use it to give a family of list decodable codes with near-optimal rate $\frac{\varepsilon}{\log^2(1/\varepsilon)}$ and list size $\frac{\log^2(1/\varepsilon)}{\varepsilon}$, that can be constructed in probabilistic polynomial time and decoded in deterministic polynomial time.
  We also introduce new decoding algorithms that may prove valuable for other graph-based codes.</description>

      <title>Semigroups of ideals and isomorphism problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $H$ be a monoid (written multiplicatively). We call $H$ Archimedean if, for all $a, b \in H$ such that $b$ is a non-unit, there is an integer $k \ge 1$ with $b^k \in HaH$; strongly Archimedean if, for each $a \in H$, there is an integer $k \ge 1$ such that $HaH$ contains any product of any $k$ non-units of $H$; and duo if $aH = Ha$ for all $a \in H$.
  We prove that the ideals of two strongly Archimedean, cancellative, duo monoids make up isomorphic semigroups under the induced operation of setwise multiplication if and only if the monoids themselves are isomorphic up to units; and the same holds upon restriction to finitely generated ideals in Archimedean, cancellative, duo monoids. Then we use the previous results to tackle a new case of a problem of Tamura and Shafer from the late 1960s.</description>

Abstract: We obtain Hanson-Wright inequalities for the quadratic form of a random vector with independent sparse random variables. Specifically, we consider cases where the components of the random vector are sparse $\alpha$-sub-exponential random variables with $\alpha&gt;0$. Our proof relies on a novel combinatorial approach to estimate the moments of the random quadratic form.</description>

      <title>Effects of graph operations on star pairwise compatibility graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A graph $G=(V,E)$ is defined as a star-$k$-PCG when it is possible to assign a positive real number weight $w$ to each vertex $V$, and define $k$ distinct intervals $I_1, I_2, \ldots I_k$, in such a way that there is an edge $uv$ in $E$ if and only if the sum of the weights of vertices $u$ and $v$ falls within the union of these intervals. The star-$k$-PCG class is connected to two significant categories of graphs, namely PCGs and multithreshold graphs. The star number of a graph $G$, is the smallest $k$ for which $G$ is a star-$k$-PCG. In this paper, we study the effects of various graph operations, such as the addition of twins, pendant vertices, universal vertices, or isolated vertices, on the star number of the graph resulting from these operations. As a direct application of our results, we determine the star number of lobster graphs and provide an upper bound for the star number of acyclic graphs.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Insights into Line Graph Transformation on Graph Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Line graph transformation has been widely studied in graph theory, where each node in a line graph corresponds to an edge in the original graph. This has inspired a series of graph neural networks (GNNs) applied to transformed line graphs, which have proven effective in various graph representation learning tasks. However, there is limited theoretical study on how line graph transformation affects the expressivity of GNN models. In this study, we focus on two types of graphs known to be challenging to the Weisfeiler-Leman (WL) tests: Cai-F\"urer-Immerman (CFI) graphs and strongly regular graphs, and show that applying line graph transformation helps exclude these challenging graph properties, thus potentially assist WL tests in distinguishing these graphs. We empirically validate our findings by conducting a series of experiments that compare the accuracy and efficiency of graph isomorphism tests and GNNs on both line-transformed and original graphs across these graph structure types.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a new family of oriented manifolds with boundaries called the forest biassociahedra and forest bimultiplihedra, generalizing the standard biassociahedra. They are defined as moduli spaces of ascending-descending biforests and are expected to act as parameter spaces for operations defined on Morse and Floer chains in the context of compact Lie group actions.
  We study the structure of their boundary, and derive some algebraic notions of ``$f$-bialgebras'', as well as related notions of bimodules, morphisms and categories. This allows us to state some conjectures describing compact Lie group actions on Morse and Floer chains, and on Fukaya categories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1907.08050v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a Fundamental Theorem of Finite Semidistributive Lattices (FTFSDL), modelled on Birkhoff's Fundamental Theorem of Finite Distributive Lattices. Our FTFSDL is of the form "A poset L is a finite semidistributive lattice if and only if there exists a set Sha with some additional structure, such that L is isomorphic to the admissible subsets of Sha ordered by inclusion; in this case, Sha and its additional structure are uniquely determined by L." The additional structure on Sha is a combinatorial abstraction of the notion of torsion pairs from representation theory and has geometric meaning in the case of posets of regions of hyperplane arrangements. We show how the FTFSDL clarifies many constructions in lattice theory, such as canonical join representations and passing to quotients, and how the semidistributive property interacts with other major classes of lattices. Many of our results also apply to infinite lattices.</description>

      <title>New bounds on the size of Nearly Perfect Matchings in almost regular hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.04183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2010.04183v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $H$ be a $k$-uniform $D$-regular simple hypergraph on $N$ vertices. Based on an analysis of the R\"odl nibble, Alon, Kim and Spencer (1997) proved that if $k \ge 3$, then $H$ contains a matching covering all but at most $ND^{-1/(k-1)+o(1)}$ vertices, and asked whether this bound is tight. In this paper we improve their bound by showing that for all $k &gt; 3$, $H$ contains a matching covering all but at most $ND^{-1/(k-1)-\eta}$ vertices for some $\eta = \Theta(k^{-3}) &gt; 0$, when $N$ and $D$ are sufficiently large. Our approach consists of showing that the R\"odl nibble process not only constructs a large matching but it also produces many well-distributed `augmenting stars' which can then be used to significantly improve the matching constructed by the R\"odl nibble process. Based on this, we also improve the results of Kostochka and R\"odl (1998) and Vu (2000) on the size of matchings in almost regular hypergraphs with small codegree. As a consequence, we improve the best known bounds on the size of large matchings in combinatorial designs with general parameters. Finally, we improve the bounds of Molloy and Reed (2000) on the chromatic index of hypergraphs with small codegree (which can be applied to improve the best known bounds on the chromatic index of Steiner triple systems and more general designs).</description>

      <title>Solution to a problem of Erd\H{o}s on the chromatic index of hypergraphs with bounded codegree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.06181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.06181v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1977, Erd\H{o}s asked the following question: for any integers $t,n \in \mathbb{N}$, if $G_1 , \dots , G_n$ are complete graphs such that each $G_i$ has at most $n$ vertices and every pair of them shares at most $t$ vertices, what is the largest possible chromatic number of the union $\bigcup_{i=1}^{n} G_i$? The equivalent dual formulation of this question asks for the largest chromatic index of an $n$-vertex hypergraph with maximum degree at most $n$ and maximum codegree at most $t$. For the case $t = 1$, Erd\H{o}s, Faber, and Lov\'{a}sz famously conjectured that the answer is $n$, which was recently proved by the authors for all sufficiently large $n$. In this paper, we answer this question of Erd\H{o}s for $t \geq 2$ in a strong sense, by proving that every $n$-vertex hypergraph with maximum degree at most $(1-o(1))tn$ and maximum codegree at most $t$ has chromatic index at most $tn$ for any $t,n \in \mathbb{N}$. Moreover, equality holds if and only if the hypergraph is a $t$-fold projective plane of order $k$, where $n = k^2 + k + 1$. Thus, for every $t \in \mathbb N$, this bound is best possible for infinitely many integers $n$. This result also holds for the list chromatic index.</description>

      <title>Symmetric properties and two variants of shuffle-cubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.13645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.13645v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Li et al. in [Inf. Process. Lett. 77 (2001) 35--41] proposed the shuffle cube $SQ_{n}$ as an attractive interconnection network topology for massive parallel and distributed systems. By far, symmetric properties of the shuffle cube remains unknown. In this paper, we show that $SQ_{n}$ is not vertex-transitive for all $n&gt;2$, which is not an appealing property in interconnection networks. To overcome this limitation, two novel vertex-transitive variants of the shuffle-cube, namely simplified shuffle-cube $SSQ_{n}$ and balanced shuffle cube $BSQ_{n}$ are introduced. Then, routing algorithms of $SSQ_{n}$ and $BSQ_{n}$ for all $n&gt;2$ are given respectively. Furthermore, we show that both $SSQ_{n}$ and $BSQ_{n}$ possess Hamiltonian cycle embedding for all $n&gt;2$. Finally, as a by-product, we mend a flaw in the Property 3 in [IEEE Trans. Comput. 46 (1997) 484--490].</description>

      <title>On the Asymptotics and the Non-Holonomic Character of First Returns in the Standard Euclidean Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.01702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.01702v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give precise asymptotics to the number of first time returning random walks in the standard orthogonal lattice in $\mathbb{R}$ and we prove that these numbers do not form a $P$-recursive sequence. In the process, the known asymptotics of the number of closed walks are obtained in an elementary way, by using a combinatorial and geometric multiplication principle together with the classical theory of Legendre polynomials. By showing that the relevant generating functions are $G$-functions, we use a form of the Hadamard convolution to find their singularities in all dimensions and give the ODEs that they satisfy for $d\leq 5$, some of which seem to be new. We use the Lucas property of the number of closed walks to prove that the corresponding generating function is not invertible as a $G$-function, which immediately implies that the generating function of the first time returning walks is not holonomic. We propose a few conjectures on the form of the asymptotic coefficients and of the ODEs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.06290v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this note we elaborate on some notions of surface area for discrete graphs which are closely related to the inverse degree. These notions then naturally lead to associated connectivity measures of graphs and to the definition of a special class of large graphs, called social graphs, that might prove interesting for applications. In addition, we derive spectral estimates involving the surface area and, as a main result, present an upper bound on the second eigenvalue for planar graphs which in some cases improves upon existing bounds from D. A. Spielman and S.-H. Teng, Spectral partitioning works: Planar graphs and finite element meshes, and M. Pl\"umer, Upper eigenvalue bounds for the Kirchhoff Laplacian on embedded metric graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.15206v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $r$-flip-width of a graph, for $r\in \mathbb{N}\cup \{\infty\}$, is a graph parameter defined in terms of a variant of the cops and robber game, called the flipper game, and it was introduced by Toru\'{n}czyk (FOCS 2023). We prove that for every $r\in (\mathbb{N}\setminus \{1\})\cup \{\infty\}$, the class of graphs of $r$-flip-width at most $2$ is exactly the class of ($C_5$, bull, gem, co-gem)-free graphs, which are known as totally decomposable graphs with respect to bi-joins.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.12693v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the methods of topological dynamics, H. Furstenberg introduced the notion of a central set and proved the famous Central Sets Theorem. D. De, N. Hindman, and D. Strauss introduced $C$-set, satisfying the strong central set theorem. Using the algebraic structure of the Stone-\v{C}ech compactification of a discrete semigroup, N. Hindman and D. Strauss proved that the Cartesian product of two $C$-sets is a $C$-set. S. Goswami has proved the same result using the elementary characterization of $C$-sets. In this article, we will prove that the product of two $C$-sets is a $C$-set, using the dynamical characterization of $C$-sets. Recently, S. Goswami has proved that the Cartesian product of two $CR$-sets is a $CR$-set, which was a question posed by N. Hindman, H. Hosseini, D. Strauss, and M. Tootkaboni in [Semigroup Forum 107 (2023)]. Here we also prove that the Cartesian product of two essential $CR$-sets is an essential $CR$-set.</description>

      <title>On colorings of hypergraphs embeddable in $\mathbb{R}^d$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.14195v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The (weak) chromatic number of a hypergraph $H$, denoted by $\chi(H)$, is the smallest number of colors required to color the vertices of $H$ so that no hyperedge of $H$ is monochromatic. For every $2\le k\le d+1$, denote by $\chi_L(k,d)$ (resp. $\chi_{PL}(k,d)$) the supremum $\sup_H \chi(H)$ where $H$ runs over all finite $k$-uniform hypergraphs such that $H$ forms the collection of maximal faces of a simplicial complex that is linearly (resp. PL) embeddable in $\mathbb{R}^d$.
  Following the program by Heise, Panagiotou, Pikhurko and Taraz, we improve their results as follows: For $d \geq 3$, we show that A. $\chi_L(k,d)=\infty$ for all $2\le k\le d$, B. $\chi_{PL}(d+1,d)=\infty$ and C. $\chi_L(d+1,d)\ge 3$ for all odd $d\ge 3$. As an application, we extend the results by Lutz and M\o ller on the weak chromatic number of the $s$-dimensional faces in the triangulations of a fixed triangulable $d$-manifold $M$: D. $\chi_s(M)=\infty$ for $1\leq s \leq d$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.15032v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Erd\H{o}s-Hajnal conjecture says that, for every graph $H$, there exists $c&gt;0$ such that every $H$-free graph on $n$ vertices has a clique or stable set of size at least $n^c$. In this paper we are concerned with the case when $H$ is a path. The conjecture has been proved for paths with at most five vertices, but not for longer paths. We prove that the conjecture is ``nearly'' true for all paths: for every path $H$, all $H$-free graphs with $n$ vertices have cliques or stable sets of size at least $2^{(\log n)^{1-o(1)}}$.</description>

Abstract: The clustered chromatic number of a graph class $\mathcal{G}$ is the minimum integer $c$ such that every graph $G\in\mathcal{G}$ has a $c$-colouring where each monochromatic component in $G$ has bounded size. We study the clustered chromatic number of graph classes $\mathcal{G}_H^{\text{odd}}$ defined by excluding a graph $H$ as an odd-minor. How does the structure of $H$ relate to the clustered chromatic number of $\mathcal{G}_H^{\text{odd}}$? We adapt a proof method of Norin, Scott, Seymour and Wood (2019) to show that the clustered chromatic number of $\mathcal{G}_H^{\text{odd}}$ is tied to the tree-depth of $H$.</description>

Abstract: We propose a graph theoretic approach to determine trace of product of two permutation matrices through a weighted digraph representation of the permutation matrices. Consequently, we derive trace-zero doubly stochastic (DS) matrices of order $5$ whose $k$-th power is also a trace-zero DS matrix for $k\in\{2,3,4,5\}$. Then, we determine necessary conditions for the coefficients of a generic polynomial of degree $5$ to be realizable as the characteristic polynomial of a trace-zero DS matrix of order $5$. Finally, we approximate the eigenvalue region of trace-zero DS matrices of order $5.$</description>

      <title>Orthogonal M\"obius Inversion and Grassmannian Persistence Diagrams</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.06870v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce Orthogonal M\"obius Inversion $\mathsf{OI}$, a concept analogous to M\"obius inversion on finite posets, which is applicable to order-preservings functions from a finite poset to the Grassmannian $\mathsf{Gr}(V)$ of an inner product space $V$. This notion critically relies on the inner product structure on $V$ enabling it to capture much finer information than standard integer-valued persistence diagrams.
  Orthogonal Inversion is a special case of the broader concept of Orthomodular Inversion, where the target space is any orthomodular lattice, which we also identify.
  We apply Orthogonal Inversion in order to construct a "non-negative" persistence diagram for any given multiparameter filtration $\mathsf{F}$ of a finite simplicial complex $K$, indexed over an arbitrary finite poset $P$. This is done by applying it to the birth-death spaces of $\mathsf{F}$. Analogously to $1$-parameter classical persistence diagrams, these multiparameter Grassmannian persistence diagrams offer straightforward interpretability. Specifically, to a segment $(b, d) \in \mathsf{Seg}(P)$, (1) the Grassmannian persistence diagram canonically assigns a vector subspace of $C_{\rho}^K$ consisting of cycles that are born at $b$ and become boundaries at $d$ and (2) this assignment is exhaustive at the homology level.
  In the case of 1-parameter filtrations, we also study a variant of Orthogonal Inversion that is applicable to persistent Laplacian kernels.</description>

      <title>The Nullstellensatz and Positivstellensatz for Sparse Tropical Polynomial Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.05859v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Grigoriev and Podolskii (2018) have established a tropical analogue of the effective Nullstellensatz, showing that a system of tropical polynomial equations is solvable if and only if a linearized system obtained from a truncated Macaulay matrix is solvable. They provided an upper bound of the minimal admissible truncation degree, as a function of the degrees of the tropical polynomials. We establish a tropical Nullstellensatz adapted to {\em sparse} tropical polynomial systems. Our approach is inspired by a construction of Canny-Emiris (1993), refined by Sturmfels (1994). This leads to an improved bound of the truncation degree, which coincides with the classical Macaulay degree in the case of $n+1$ equations in $n$ unknowns. We also establish a tropical Positivstellensatz, allowing one to decide the inclusion of tropical basic semialgebraic sets. This allows one to reduce decision problems for tropical semi-algebraic sets to the solution of systems of tropical linear equalities and inequalities.</description>

      <title>A Polynomial Method for Counting Colorings of Sparse Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.11744v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The notion of $S$-labeling of graphs, where $S$ is a subset of a symmetric group, was introduced in 2019 by Jin, Wong, and Zhu. This notion provides the framework for a common generalization of various well studied notions of graph coloring, including classical coloring, signed $k$-coloring, signed $\mathbb{Z}_k$-coloring, DP (or correspondence) coloring, group coloring, and coloring of gained graphs. In this paper, we present a unified and simple polynomial method for giving exponential lower bounds on the number of colorings of an $S$-labeled graph for all such $S$. This algebraic technique allows us to prove new lower bounds on the number of colorings of any $S$-labeling of graphs satisfying certain sparsity conditions. We also investigate how the structure of $S$ can be exploited to improve the applicability of these bounds. Our results give new lower bounds on the number of DP-colorings, and consequently the number of all types of colorings listed above. This includes the chromatic polynomial and the number of list colorings of families of planar graphs, and the number of colorings of signed graphs. These enumerative bounds improve previously known results or are the first such known results.</description>

Abstract: We introduce the notion of a categorical valuative invariant of polyhedra or matroids, in which alternating sums of numerical invariants are replaced by split exact sequences in an additive category. We provide categorical lifts of a number of valuative invariants of matroids, including the Poincare polynomial, the Chow and augmented Chow polynomials, and certain two-variable extensions of the Kazhdan--Lusztig polynomial and Z-polynomial. These lifts allow us to perform calculations equivariantly with respect to automorphism groups of matroids.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02256v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that any bounded degree regular graph with sufficiently strong spectral expansion contains an induced path of linear length. This is the first such result for expanders, strengthening an analogous result in the random setting by Dragani\'c, Glock and Krivelevich. More generally, we find long induced paths in sparse graphs that satisfy a mild upper-uniformity edge-distribution condition.</description>

      <title>The sandpile model on the complete split graph: $q,t$-Schr\"oder polynomials, sawtooth polyominoes, and a cyclic lemma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15372v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper builds on work initiated in Dukes (2021) that considered the classification of recurrent configurations of the Abelian sandpile model on the complete split graph. We introduce two statistics, wtopple$_{CTI}$ and wtopple$_{ITC}$, on sorted recurrent configurations. These statistics arise from two natural but different toppling conventions, CTI and ITC, for Dhar's burning algorithm as it is applied to the complete split graph. In addition, we introduce the bivariate $q,t$-CTI and $q,t$-ITC polynomials that are the generating functions of the bistatistics (height,wtopple$_{ITC}$) and (height,wtopple$_{CTI}$) on the sorted recurrent configurations.
  We prove that a modification of the bijection given in Dukes (2021) from sorted recurrent configurations to Schr\"oder paths maps the bistatistic (height,wtopple$_{ITC}$) to the bistatistic (area,bounce). The generating function of the bistatistic (area,bounce) on Schr\"oder paths is known in the literature as the $q,t$-Schr\"oder polynomial and was introduced by Egge, Haglund, Killpatrick and Kremer (2003). This connection allows us to relate the $q,t$-ITC polynomial to the theory of symmetric functions and also establishes symmetry of the $q,t$-ITC polynomials.
  We also give a characterization of the sorted recurrent configurations as a new class of polyominoes that we call $sawtooth$ $polyominoes$. The CTI and ITC topplings processes on sorted recurrent configurations are proven to correspond to two bounce paths from one side of the sawtooth polyomino to the other. Moreover, and building on the results of Aval et al. (2016), we present a cyclic lemma for a slight extension of stable configurations that allows for an enumeration of sorted recurrent configurations within the framework of the sandpile model. Finally, we conjecture equality of the $q,t$-CTI and $q,t$-ITC polynomials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03614v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a graph $G$ and an integer $k\geq 2$, a $\chi'_{k}$-coloring of $G$ is an edge coloring of $G$ such that the subgraph induced by the edges of each color has all degrees congruent to $1 ~ (\mod k)$, and $\chi'_{k}(G)$ is the minimum number of colors in a $\chi'_{k}$-coloring of $G$. In ["The mod $k$ chromatic index of graphs is $O(k)$", J. Graph Theory. 2023; 102: 197-200], Botler, Colucci and Kohayakawa proved that $\chi'_{k}(G)\leq 198k-101$ for every graph $G$. In this paper, we show that $\chi'_{k}(G) \leq 177k-93$.</description>

      <title>Positivity preservers over finite fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00222v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We resolve an algebraic version of Schoenberg's celebrated theorem [Duke Math.J., 1942] characterizing entrywise matrix transforms that preserve positive definiteness. Compared to the classical real and complex settings, we consider matrices with entries in a finite field and obtain a complete characterization of such preservers for matrices of a fixed dimension. When the dimension of the matrices is at least $3$, we prove that, surprisingly, the positivity preservers are precisely the positive multiples of the field's automorphisms. We also obtain characterizations of preservers for matrices of dimension $2$ over a finite field with $q$ elements, unless $q \equiv 1 \pmod 4$ and $q$ is not a square. Our proofs build on several novel connections between positivity preservers and field automorphisms via the works of Weil, Carlitz, and Muzychuk-Kov\'acs, and via the structure of cliques in Paley graphs.</description>

      <title>A classification of semi-equivelar gems of PL $d$-manifolds on the surface with Euler characteristic $-1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04005v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A semi-equivelar gem of a PL $d$-manifold is a regular colored graph that represents the PL $d$-manifold and regularly embeds on a surface, with the property that the cyclic sequence of degrees of faces in the embedding around each vertex is identical. In \cite{bb24}, the authors classified semi-equivelar gems of PL $d$-manifolds embedded on surfaces with Euler characteristics greater than or equal to zero. In this article, we focus on classifying semi-equivelar gems of PL $d$-manifolds embedded on the surface with Euler characteristic $-1$. We prove that if a semi-equivelar gem embeds regularly on the surface with Euler characteristic $-1$, then it belongs to one of the following types: $(8^3), (6^2,8), (6^2,12), (10^2,4), (12^2,4),$ $ (4,6,14), (4,6,16), (4,6,18), (4,6,24), (4,8,10), (4,8,12),$ or $(4,8,16)$. Furthermore, we provide constructions that demonstrate the existence of such gems for each of the aforementioned types.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01510v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a quasisymmetric analogue of the combinatorial theory of Schubert polynomials and the associated divided difference operators. Our counterparts are "forest polynomials", and a new family of linear operators, whose theory of compositions is governed by forests and the "Thompson monoid". Our approach extends naturally to $m$-colored quasisymmetric functions.
  We then give several applications of our theory to fundamental quasisymmetric functions, the study of quasisymmetric coinvariant rings and their associated harmonics, and positivity results for various expansions. In particular we resolve a conjecture of Aval-Bergeron-Li regarding quasisymmetric harmonics.</description>

      <title>On the maximum $F$-free induced subgraphs in $K_t$-free graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13780v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For graphs $F$ and $H$, let $f_{F,H}(n)$ be the minimum possible size of a maximum $F$-free induced subgraph in an $n$-vertex $H$-free graph. This notion generalizes the Ramsey function and the Erd\H{o}s--Rogers function. Establishing a container lemma for the $F$-free subgraphs, we give a general upper bound on $f_{F,H}(n)$, assuming the existence of certain locally dense $H$-free graphs. In particular, we prove that for every graph $F$ with $\mathrm{ex}(m,F) = O(m^{1+\alpha})$, where $\alpha \in [0,1/2)$, we have
  \[
  f_{F, K_3}(n) = O\left(n^{\frac{1}{2-\alpha}}\left(\log n\right)^{\frac{3}{2-
  \alpha}}\right)
  \quad
  \textrm{and}
  \quad
  f_{F, K_4}(n) = O\left(n^{\frac{1}{3-2\alpha}}\left(\log n\right)^{\frac{6}{3-2\alpha}}\right).
  \] For the cases where $F$ is a complete multipartite graph, letting $s = \sum_{i=1}^r s_i$, we prove that
  \[
  f_{K_{s_1,\ldots,s_r}, K_{r+2}}(n) = O \left( n^{\frac{2s -3}{4s -5}} (\log n)^{3} \right).
  \]
  We also make an observation which improves the bounds of $\mathrm{ex}(G(n,p),C_4)$ by a polylogarithmic factor.</description>

      <title>The finite products of shifted primes and Moreira's Theorem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15218v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $r\in\mathbb{N}$ and $\mathbb{N}=\bigcup_{i=1}^{r}C_{i}$. Do there exist $x,y\in\mathbb{N}$ and $i\in\left\{1,2,\ldots,r\right\}$ such that $\left\{x,y,xy,x+y\right\}\subseteq C_{i}$? This is still an unanswered question asked by N. Hindman. Joel Moreira in [Annals of Mathematics 185 (2017) 1069-1090] established a partial answer to this question and proved that for infinitely many $x,y\in\mathbb{N}$, $\left\{x,xy,x+y\right\}\subseteq C_{i}$ for some $i\in\left\{1,2,\ldots,r\right\}$, which is called Moreira's Theorem. Recently, H. Hindman and D. Strauss established a refinement of Moreira's Theorem and proved that for infinitely many $y$, $\left\{x\in\mathbb{N}:\left\{x,xy,x+y\right\}\subseteq C_{i}\right\}$ is a piecewise syndetic set. In this article, we will prove infinitely many $y\in FP\left(\mathbb{P}-1\right)$ such that $\left\{x\in\mathbb{N}:\left\{xy,x+f(y):f\in F\right\}\subseteq C_{i}\right\}$ is piecewise syndetic, where $F$ is a finite subset of $x\mathbb{Z}\left[x\right]$. We denote $\mathbb{P}$ is the set of prime numbers in $\mathbb{N}$ and $FP\left(\mathbb{P}-1\right)$ is the set of all finite products of distinct elements of $\mathbb{P}-1$.</description>

      <title>Limiting Moments of Autocorrelation Demerit Factors of Binary Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.14566v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Various problems in engineering and natural science demand binary sequences that do not resemble translates of themselves, that is, the sequences must have small aperiodic autocorrelation at every nonzero shift. If $f$ is a sequence, then the demerit factor of $f$ is the sum of the squared magnitudes of the autocorrelations at all nonzero shifts for the sequence obtained by normalizing $f$ to unit Euclidean norm. The demerit factor is the reciprocal of Golay's merit factor, and low demerit factor indicates low self-similarity of a sequence under translation. We endow the $2^\ell$ binary sequences of length $\ell$ with uniform probability measure and consider the distribution of their demerit factors. Earlier works used combinatorial techniques to find exact formulas for the mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis of the distribution as a function of $\ell$. These revealed that for $\ell \geq 4$, the $p$th central moment of this distribution is strictly positive for every $p \geq 2$. This article shows that for every $p$, the $p$th central moment is $\ell^{-2 p}$ times a quasi-polynomial function of $\ell$ with rational coefficients. It also shows that, in the limit as $\ell$ tends to infinity, the $p$th standardized moment is the same as that of the standard normal distribution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.12285v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The moduli space of stable rational curves with marked points has two distinguished families of maps: the forgetful maps, given by forgetting some of the markings, and the Kapranov maps, given by complete linear series of $\psi$-classes. The collection of all these maps embeds the moduli space into a product of projective spaces. We call the multidegrees of this embedding ``Kapranov degrees,'' which include as special cases the work of Witten, Silversmith, Gallet--Grasegger--Schicho, Castravet--Tevelev, Postnikov, Cavalieri--Gillespie--Monin, and Gillespie--Griffins--Levinson. We establish, in terms of a combinatorial matching condition, upper bounds for Kapranov degrees and a characterization of their positivity. The positivity characterization answers a question of Silversmith and gives a new proof of Laman's theorem characterizing generically rigid graphs in the plane. We achieve this by proving a recursive formula for Kapranov degrees and by using tools from the theory of error correcting codes.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12326v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the classical model of Diffusion Limited Aggregation (DLA), introduced by Witten and Sander, the process begins with a single particle cluster placed at the origin of a space, and then, one at a time, particles make a random walk from infinity until they collide with, and stick to, the existing cluster.
  We consider an analogous version of this process on large but finite graphs with a designated source and sink vertex. Initially the cluster of halted particles contains a single particle at the sink vertex. Starting one at a time from the source, each particle makes a random walk in the direction of the sink vertex. The particle halts at the last unoccupied vertex before the walk enters the cluster for the first time, thus increasing the size of the cluster. This continues until the source vertex becomes occupied, at which point the process ends. We study the DLA process on several classes of layered graphs, including Cayley trees of branching factor at least two with a sink vertex attached to the leaves. We determine the finish time of the process for a given class of graphs and show that the subcomponent of the final cluster linking source to sink is essentially a unique path.</description>

      <title>Homaloidal Polynomials and Gaussian Models of Maximum Likelihood Degree One</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06090v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the Gaussian statistical models whose log-likelihood function has a unique complex critical point, i.e., has maximum likelihood degree one. We exploit the connection developed by Am\'endola et. al. between the models having maximum likelihood degree one and homaloidal polynomials. We study the spanning tree generating function of a graph and show this polynomial is homaloidal when the graph is chordal. When the graph is a cycle on $n$ vertices, $n \geq 4$, we prove the polynomial is not homaloidal, and show that the maximum likelihood degree of the resulting model is the $n$th Eulerian number. These results support our conjecture that the spanning tree generating function is a homaloidal polynomial if and only if the graph is chordal. We also provide an algebraic formulation for the defining equations of these models. Using existing results, we provide a computational study on constructing new families of homaloidal polynomials. In the end, we analyze the symmetric determinantal representation of such polynomials and provide an upper bound on the size of the matrices involved.</description>

Abstract: Okounkov [Oko03] conjectured the log-concavity about the structure constants for many interesting basis from representation theory. For the cluster algebra, Gross, Hacking, Keel, Kontsevich [GHKK18] introduced the atomic theta basis. We prove that the coefficients of the exponents of any cluster variable of type $A_n$ are log-concave. We show that the structure constants for theta basis of type $A_2$ are log-concave. As for larger generality, we conjecture that the log-concavity of the structure constants for theta basis of the cluster algebra.</description>

      <title>The action of component groups on irreducible components of Springer fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04076v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a simple Lie group. Consider a nilpotent element $e\in \mathfrak{g}$. Let $Z_G(e)$ be the centralizer of $e$ in $G$, and let $A_e:= Z_G(e)/Z_G(e)^{o}$ be its component group. Write $\text{Irr}(\mathcal{B}_e)$ for the set of irreducible components of the Springer fiber $\mathcal{B}_e$. We have an action of $A_e$ on $\text{Irr}(\mathcal{B}_e)$. When $\mathfrak{g}$ is exceptional, we give an explicit description of $\text{Irr}(\mathcal{B}_e)$ as an $A_e$-set. For $\mathfrak{g}$ of classical type, we describe the stabilizers for the $A_e$-action. With this description, we prove a conjecture of Lusztig and Sommers. These results suggest highly nontrivial relations between Springer fibers and cells in Weyl groups.</description>

      <title>Permutation groups, partition lattices and block structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10461</link>

Abstract: Let $G$ be a transitive permutation group on $\Omega$. The $G$-invariant partitions form a sublattice of the lattice of all partitions of $\Omega$, having the further property that all its elements are uniform (that is, have all parts of the same size). If, in addition, all the equivalence relations defining the partitions commute, then the relations form an \emph{orthogonal block structure}, a concept from statistics; in this case the lattice is modular. If it is distributive, then we have a \emph{poset block structure}, whose automorphism group is a \emph{generalised wreath product}. We examine permutation groups with these properties, which we call the \emph{OB property} and \emph{PB property} respectively, and in particular investigate when direct and wreath products of groups with these properties also have these properties.
  A famous theorem on permutation groups asserts that a transitive imprimitive group $G$ is embeddable in the wreath product of two factors obtained from the group (the group induced on a block by its setwise stabiliser, and the group induced on the set of blocks by~$G$). We extend this theorem to groups with the PB property, embeddng them into generalised wreath products. We show that the map from posets to generalised wreath products preserves intersections and inclusions.
  We have included background and historical material on these concepts.</description>

      <title>Hikita conjecture for classical Lie algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13914v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be $Sp_{2n}$, $SO_{2n}$ or $SO_{2n+1}$ and let $G^\vee$ be its Langlands dual group. Barbasch and Vogan based on earlier work of Lusztig and Spaltenstein, define a duality map $D$ that sends nilpotent orbits $\mathbb{O}_{e^\vee} \subset \mathfrak{g}^\vee$ to special nilpotent orbits $\mathbb{O}_e\subset \mathfrak{g}$. In a work by Losev, Mason-Brown and Matvieievskyi, an upgraded version $\tilde{D}$ of this duality is considered, called the refined BVLS duality. $\tilde{D}(\mathbb{O}_{e^\vee})$ is a $G$-equivariant cover $\tilde{\mathbb{O}}_e$ of $\mathbb{O}_e$. Let $S_{{e^\vee}}$ be the nilpotent Slodowy slice of the orbit $\mathbb{O}_{e^\vee}$. The two varieties $X^\vee= S_{e^\vee}$ and $X=$ Spec$(\mathbb{C}[\tilde{\mathbb{O}}_e])$ are expected to be symplectic dual to each other. In this context, a version of the Hikita conjecture predicts an isomorphism between the cohomology ring of the Springer fiber $\mathcal{B}_{e^\vee}$ and the ring of regular functions on the scheme-theoretic fixed point $X^T$ for some torus $T$. This paper verifies the isomorphism for certain pairs $e$ and $e^\vee$. These cases are expected to cover almost all instances in which the Hikita conjecture holds when $e^\vee$ regular in a Levi $\mathfrak{l}^\vee\subset \mathfrak{g}^\vee$. Our results in these cases follow from the relations of three different types of objects: generalized coinvariant algebras, equivariant cohomology rings, and functions on scheme-theoretic intersections. We also give evidence for the Hikita conjecture when $e^\vee$ is distinguished.</description>

      <title>The geometry of quasisymmetric coinvariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12643v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a quasisymmetric analogue of the theory of Schubert cycles, building off of our previous work on a quasisymmetric analogue of Schubert polynomials and divided differences. Our constructions result in a natural geometric interpretation for the ring of quasisymmetric coinvariants.</description>
