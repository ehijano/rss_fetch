      <title>Recovery Techniques for Finite Element Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Post-processing techniques are essential tools for enhancing the accuracy of finite element approximations and achieving superconvergence. Among these, recovery techniques stand out as vital methods, playing significant roles in both post-processing and pre-processing. This paper provides an overview of recent developments in recovery techniques and their applications in adaptive computations. The discussion encompasses both gradient recovery and Hessian recovery methods. To establish the superconvergence properties of these techniques, two theoretical frameworks are introduced. Applications of these methods are demonstrated in constructing asymptotically exact {\it a posteriori} error estimators for second-order elliptic equations, fourth-order elliptic equations, and interface problems. Numerical experiments are performed to evaluate the asymptotic exactness of recovery type a posteriori error estimators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the pathwise uniform convergence in probability of fully discrete finite-element approximations for the two-dimensional stochastic Navier-Stokes equations with multiplicative noise, subject to no-slip boundary conditions. Assuming Lipschitz-continuous diffusion coefficients and under mild conditions on the initial data, we establish that the full discretization achieves linear convergence in space and nearly half-order convergence in time.</description>

      <title>A numerical method for solving the generalized tangent vector of hyperbolic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work is concerned with the computation of the first-order variation for one-dimensional hyperbolic partial differential equations. In the case of shock waves the main challenge is addressed by developing a numerical method to compute the evolution of the generalized tangent vector introduced by Bressan and Marson (1995). Our basic strategy is to combine the conservative numerical schemes and a novel expression of the interface conditions for the tangent vectors along the discontinuity. Based on this, we propose a simple numerical method to compute the tangent vectors for general hyperbolic systems. Numerical results are presented for Burgers' equation and a 2 x 2 hyperbolic system with two genuinely nonlinear fields.</description>

      <title>Stabilizing and Solving Inverse Problems using Data and Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider an inverse problem involving the reconstruction of the solution to a nonlinear partial differential equation (PDE) with unknown boundary conditions. Instead of direct boundary data, we are provided with a large dataset of boundary observations for typical solutions (collective data) and a bulk measurement of a specific realization. To leverage this collective data, we first compress the boundary data using proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) in a linear expansion. Next, we identify a possible nonlinear low-dimensional structure in the expansion coefficients using an auto-encoder, which provides a parametrization of the dataset in a lower-dimensional latent space. We then train a neural network to map the latent variables representing the boundary data to the solution of the PDE. Finally, we solve the inverse problem by optimizing a data-fitting term over the latent space.
  We analyze the underlying stabilized finite element method in the linear setting and establish optimal error estimates in the $H^1$ and $L^2$-norms. The nonlinear problem is then studied numerically, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <title>Quantum circuit and mapping algorithms for wavepacket dynamics: case study of anharmonic hydrogen bonds in protonated and hydroxide water clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The accurate computational study of wavepacket nuclear dynamics is considered to be a classically intractable problem, particularly with increasing dimensions. Here we present two algorithms that, in conjunction with other methods developed by us, will form the basis for performing quantum nuclear dynamics in arbitrary dimensions. For one algorithm, we present a direct map between the Born-Oppenheimer Hamiltonian describing the wavepacket time-evolution and the control parameters of a spin-lattice Hamiltonian that describes the dynamics of qubit states in an ion-trap quantum computer. This map is exact for three qubits, and when implemented, the dynamics of the spin states emulate those of the nuclear wavepacket. However, this map becomes approximate as the number of qubits grow. In a second algorithm we present a general quantum circuit decomposition formalism for such problems using a method called the Quantum Shannon Decomposition. This algorithm is more robust and is exact for any number of qubits, at the cost of increased circuit complexity. The resultant circuit is implemented on IBM's quantum simulator (QASM) for 3-7 qubits. In both cases the wavepacket dynamics is found to be in good agreement with the classical result and the corresponding vibrational frequencies obtained from the wavepacket density time-evolution, are in agreement to within a few tenths of a wavenumbers.</description>

      <title>Computing sessile droplet shapes on arbitrary surfaces with a new pairwise force smoothed particle hydrodynamics model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of the shape of droplets on surfaces is an important problem in the physics of fluids and has applications in multiple industries, from agrichemical spraying to microfluidic devices. Motivated by these real-world applications, computational predictions for droplet shapes on complex substrates -- rough and chemically heterogeneous surfaces -- are desired. Grid-based discretisations in axisymmetric coordinates form the basis of well-established numerical solution methods in this area, but when the problem is not axisymmetric, the shape of the contact line and the distribution of the contact angle around it are unknown. Recently, particle methods, such as pairwise force smoothed particle hydrodynamics (PF-SPH), have been used to conveniently forego explicit enforcement of the contact angle. The pairwise force model, however, is far from mature, and there is no consensus in the literature on the choice of pairwise force profile. We propose a new pair of polynomial force profiles with a simple motivation and validate the PF-SPH model in both static and dynamic tests. We demonstrate its capabilities by computing droplet shapes on a physically structured surface, a surface with a hydrophilic stripe, and a virtual wheat leaf with both micro-scale roughness and variable wettability. We anticipate that this model can be extended to dynamic scenarios, such as droplet spreading or impaction, in the future.</description>

      <title>An In-Depth Examination of Risk Assessment in Multi-Class Classification Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advanced classification algorithms are being increasingly used in safety-critical applications like health-care, engineering, etc. In such applications, miss-classifications made by ML algorithms can result in substantial financial or health-related losses. To better anticipate and prepare for such losses, the algorithm user seeks an estimate for the probability that the algorithm miss-classifies a sample. We refer to this task as the risk-assessment. For a variety of models and datasets, we numerically analyze the performance of different methods in solving the risk-assessment problem. We consider two solution strategies: a) calibration techniques that calibrate the output probabilities of classification models to provide accurate probability outputs; and b) a novel approach based upon the prediction interval generation technique of conformal prediction. Our conformal prediction based approach is model and data-distribution agnostic, simple to implement, and provides reasonable results for a variety of use-cases. We compare the different methods on a broad variety of models and datasets.</description>

      <title>Core-periphery detection in multilayer networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multilayer networks provide a powerful framework for modeling complex systems that capture different types of interactions between the same set of entities across multiple layers. Core-periphery detection involves partitioning the nodes of a network into core nodes, which are highly connected across the network, and peripheral nodes, which are densely connected to the core but sparsely connected among themselves. In this paper, we propose a new model of core-periphery in multilayer network and a nonlinear spectral method that simultaneously detects the corresponding core and periphery structures of both nodes and layers in weighted and directed multilayer networks. Our method reveals novel structural insights in three empirical multilayer networks from distinct application areas: the citation network of complex network scientists, the European airlines transport network, and the world trade network.</description>

      <title>Block Lanczos for lattice QCD spectroscopy and matrix elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent work introduced a new framework for analyzing correlation functions with improved convergence and signal-to-noise properties, as well as rigorous quantification of excited-state effects, based on the Lanczos algorithm and spurious eigenvalue filtering with the Cullum-Willoughby test. Here, we extend this framework to the analysis of correlation-function matrices built from multiple interpolating operators in lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD) by constructing an oblique generalization of the block Lanczos algorithm, as well as a new physically motivated reformulation of the Cullum-Willoughby test that generalizes to block Lanczos straightforwardly. The resulting block Lanczos method directly extends generalized eigenvalue problem (GEVP) methods, which can be viewed as applying a single iteration of block Lanczos. Block Lanczos provides qualitative and quantitative advantages over GEVP methods analogous to the benefits of Lanczos over the standard effective mass, including faster convergence to ground- and excited-state energies, explicitly computable two-sided error bounds, straightforward extraction of matrix elements of external currents, and asymptotically constant signal-to-noise. No fits or statistical inference are required. Proof-of-principle calculations are performed for noiseless mock-data examples as well as two-by-two proton correlation-function matrices in lattice QCD.</description>

      <title>ResQPASS: an algorithm for bounded variable linear least squares with asymptotic Krylov convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.13616v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the Residual Quadratic Programming Active-Set Subspace (ResQPASS) method that solves large-scale linear least-squares problems with bound constraints on the variables. The problem is solved by creating a series of small problems of increasing size by projecting onto the basis of residuals. Each projected problem is solved by the active-set method for convex quadratic programming, warm-started with a working set and solution from the previous problem. The method coincides with conjugate gradients (CG) or, equivalently, LSQR when none of the constraints is active. When only a few constraints are active the method converges, after a few initial iterations, like CG and LSQR. An analysis links the convergence to an asymptotic Krylov subspace. We also present an efficient implementation where QR factorizations of the projected problems are updated over the inner iterations and Cholesky or Gram-Schmidt over the outer iterations.</description>

      <title>A Fast Adaptive Method for the Heat Equation with Moving or Free Boundaries in One Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.15048v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a fast adaptive method for the evaluation of heat potentials, which plays a key role in the integral equation approach for the solution of the heat equation, especially in a non-stationary domain. The algorithm utilizes a sum-of-exponential based fast Gauss transform that evaluates the convolution of a Gaussian with either discrete or continuous volume distributions. The latest implementation of the algorithm allows for both periodic and free space boundary conditions. The history dependence is overcome by splitting the heat potentials into a smooth history part and a singular local part. We discuss the resolution of the history part on an adaptive volume grid in detail, providing sharp estimates that allow for the construction of an optimal grid, justifying the efficiency of the bootstrapping scheme. While the discussion in this paper is restricted to one spatial dimension, the generalization to two and three dimensions is straightforward. The performance of the algorithm is illustrated via several numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Mixed-Precision Paterson--Stockmeyer Method for Evaluating Polynomials of Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17396v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Paterson--Stockmeyer method is an evaluation scheme for matrix polynomials with scalar coefficients that arise in many state-of-the-art algorithms based on polynomial or rational approximation, for example, those for computing transcendental matrix functions. We derive a mixed-precision version of the Paterson--Stockmeyer method that is particularly useful for evaluating matrix polynomials with scalar coefficients of decaying magnitude. The new method is mainly of interest in the arbitrary precision arithmetic, and it is attractive for high-precision computations. The key idea is to perform computations on data of small magnitude in low precision, and rounding error analysis is provided for the use of lower-than-the-working precisions. We focus on the evaluation of the Taylor approximants of the matrix exponential and show the applicability of our method to the existing scaling and squaring algorithms. We also demonstrate through experiments the general applicability of our method to other problems, such as computing the polynomials from the Pad\'e approximant of the matrix exponential and the Taylor approximant of the matrix cosine. Numerical experiments show our mixed-precision Paterson--Stockmeyer algorithms can be more efficient than its fixed-precision counterpart while delivering the same level of accuracy.</description>

      <title>FIAT: improving performance and accuracy for high-order finite elements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03565v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: FIAT (the FInite element Automatic Tabulator) provides a powerful Python library for the generation and evaluation of finite element basis functions on a reference element. This release paper describes recent improvements to FIAT aimed at improving its run time and the accuracy and efficiency of code generated using FIAT-provided information. In the first category, we have greatly streamlined the implementation of orthogonal polynomials out of which finite element bases are built. The second category comprises several more advances. For one, we have built an interface to the $\texttt{recursivenodes}$ package to enable more accurate Lagrange bases at high order. We have also implemented integral-type degrees of freedom for $H(\mathrm{div})$ and $H(\mathrm{curl})$ elements, which match the mathematical definitions of the elements more closely and also avoid loss of accuracy in interpolation. More fundamentally, we have included families of simplicial quadrature rules that require many fewer quadrature points than the Stroud rules previously used in FIAT. Finally, FIAT now provides support for fast diagonalization methods, which enable fast solution algorithms at very high order. In each case, we describe the new features in FIAT and illustrate some of the gains obtained through simple numerical tests.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.02068v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The elapsed time equation is an age-structured model that describes the dynamics of interconnected spiking neurons through the elapsed time since the last discharge, leading to many interesting questions on the evolution of the system from a mathematical and biological point of view. In this work, we first deal with the case when transmission after a spike is instantaneous and the case when there exists a distributed delay that depends on the previous history of the system, which is a more realistic assumption. Then we revisit the well-posedness in order to make a numerical analysis by adapting the classical upwind scheme through a fixed-point approach. We improve the previous results on well-posedness by relaxing some hypotheses on the non-linearity for instantaneous transmission, including the strongly excitatory case, while for the numerical analysis we prove that the approximation given by the explicit upwind scheme converges to the solution of the non-linear problem through BV-estimates. We also show some numerical simulations to compare the behavior of the system in the case of instantaneous transmission with the case of distributed delay under different parameters, leading to solutions with different asymptotic profiles.</description>

      <title>Quantum Circuits for partial differential equations via Schr\"odingerisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10032v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing has emerged as a promising avenue for achieving significant speedup, particularly in large-scale PDE simulations, compared to classical computing. One of the main quantum approaches involves utilizing Hamiltonian simulation, which is directly applicable only to Schr\"odinger-type equations. To address this limitation, Schr\"odingerisation techniques have been developed, employing the warped transformation to convert general linear PDEs into Schr\"odinger-type equations. However, despite the development of Schr\"odingerisation techniques, the explicit implementation of the corresponding quantum circuit for solving general PDEs remains to be designed. In this paper, we present detailed implementation of a quantum algorithm for general PDEs using Schr\"odingerisation techniques. We provide examples of the heat equation, and the advection equation approximated by the upwind scheme, to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Complexity analysis is also carried out to demonstrate the quantum advantages of these algorithms in high dimensions over their classical counterparts.</description>

      <title>Greedy Learning to Optimize with Convergence Guarantees</title>

Abstract: Learning to optimize is an approach that leverages training data to accelerate the solution of optimization problems. Many approaches use unrolling to parametrize the update step and learn optimal parameters. Although L2O has shown empirical advantages over classical optimization algorithms, memory restrictions often greatly limit the unroll length and learned algorithms usually do not provide convergence guarantees. In contrast, we introduce a novel method employing a greedy strategy that learns iteration-specific parameters by minimizing the function value at the next iteration. This enables training over significantly more iterations while maintaining constant GPU memory usage. We parameterize the update such that parameter learning corresponds to solving a convex optimization problem at each iteration. In particular, we explore preconditioned gradient descent with multiple parametrizations including a novel convolutional preconditioner. With our learned algorithm, convergence in the training set is proved even when the preconditioner is neither symmetric nor positive definite. Convergence on a class of unseen functions is also obtained, ensuring robust performance and generalization beyond the training data. We test our learned algorithms on two inverse problems, image deblurring and Computed Tomography, on which learned convolutional preconditioners demonstrate improved empirical performance over classical optimization algorithms such as Nesterov's Accelerated Gradient Method and the quasi-Newton method L-BFGS.</description>

      <title>Modeling and simulations of high-density two-phase flows using projection-based Cahn-Hilliard Navier-Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17933v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurately modeling the dynamics of high-density ratio (on the order of 100,000) two-phase flows is important for many material science and manufacturing applications. This work considers numerical simulations of molten metal oscillations in microgravity to analyze the interplay between surface tension and density ratio, a critical factor for terrestrial manufacturing applications. We present a projection-based computational framework for solving a thermodynamically-consistent Cahn-Hilliard Navier-Stokes equations for two-phase flows with large density ratios. The framework employs a modified version of the pressure-decoupled solver based on the Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition presented in Khanwale et al. ("A projection-based, semi-implicit time-stepping approach for the Cahn-Hilliard Navier-Stokes equations on adaptive octree meshes," Journal of Computational Physics 475 (2023): 111874). We validate our numerical method on several canonical problems, including the capillary wave and single bubble rise problems. We also present a comprehensive convergence study to investigate the effect of mesh resolution, time-step, and interfacial thickness on droplet-shape oscillations. We further demonstrate the robustness of our framework by successfully simulating three distinct physical systems with extremely large density ratios (10,000-100,000:1), achieving results that have not been previously reported in the literature.</description>

      <title>Sinkhorn Algorithm for Sequentially Composed Optimal Transports</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03120v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sinkhorn algorithm is the de-facto standard approximation algorithm for optimal transport, which has been applied to a variety of applications, including image processing and natural language processing. In theory, the proof of its convergence follows from the convergence of the Sinkhorn--Knopp algorithm for the matrix scaling problem, and Altschuler et al. show that its worst-case time complexity is in near-linear time. Very recently, sequentially composed optimal transports were proposed by Watanabe and Isobe as a hierarchical extension of optimal transports. In this paper, we present an efficient approximation algorithm, namely Sinkhorn algorithm for sequentially composed optimal transports, for its entropic regularization. Furthermore, we present a theoretical analysis of the Sinkhorn algorithm, namely (i) its exponential convergence to the optimal solution with respect to the Hilbert pseudometric, and (ii) a worst-case complexity analysis for the case of one sequential composition.</description>
