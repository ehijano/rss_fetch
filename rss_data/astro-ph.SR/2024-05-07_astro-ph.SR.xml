      <title>White dwarf eccentricity fluctuation and dissipation by AGB convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Millisecond pulsars with white dwarf companions have typical eccentricities $e\sim 10^{-6}-10^{-3}$. The eccentricities of helium white dwarfs are explained well by applying the fluctuation-dissipation theorem to convective eddies in their red giant progenitors. We extend this theory to more massive carbon-oxygen (CO) white dwarfs with asymptotic giant branch (AGB) progenitors. Due to the radiation pressure in AGB stars, the dominant factor in determining the remnant white dwarf's eccentricity is the critical residual hydrogen envelope mass $m_{\rm env}$ required to inflate the star to giant proportions. Using a suite of MESA stellar evolution simulations with $\Delta m_{\rm c}=10^{-3}\,{\rm M}_\odot$ core-mass intervals, we resolved the AGB thermal pulses and found that the critical $m_{\rm env}\propto m_{\rm c}^{-6}$. This steep dependence causes the $e(m_{\rm c})$ relation to turn over, such that $e\sim 3\times 10^{-3}$ almost independently of the remnant CO white dwarf's mass $m_{\rm c}$. Nearly all of the measured eccentricities lie below this robust theoretical limit, indicating that the eccentricity is damped during the common-envelope inspiral that follows the unstable Roche-lobe overflow of the AGB star. Specifically, we focused on white dwarfs with median masses $m_{\rm c}&gt;0.6\,{\rm M}_\odot$. These massive white dwarfs begin their inspiral with practically identical orbital periods and eccentricities, eliminating any dependence on the initial conditions. For this sub-sample, we find an empirical relation $e\propto P^{3/2}$ between the final period and eccentricity that is much tighter than previous studies - motivating theoretical work on the eccentricity evolution during the common envelope phase.</description>

      <title>Discovery of the Remarkably Red L/T Transition Object VHS J183135.58-551355.9</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the discovery of VHS J183135.58$-$551355.9 (hereafter VHS J1831$-$5513), an L/T transition dwarf identified as a result of its unusually red near-infrared colors ($J-K_{\rm S}=3.633\pm0.277$ mag; $J-W2=6.249\pm0.245$ mag) from the VISTA Hemisphere Survey and CatWISE2020 surveys. We obtain low resolution near-infrared spectroscopy of VHS J1831$-$5513 using Magellan/FIRE to confirm its extremely red nature and assess features sensitive to surface gravity (i.e., youth). Its near-infrared spectrum shows multiple CH$_{\rm 4}$ absorption features, indicating an exceptionally low effective temperature for its spectral type. Based on proper motion measurements from CatWISE2020 and a photometric distance derived from its $K_{\rm S}$-band magnitude, we find that VHS J1831$-$5513 is a likely ($\sim$85$\%$ probability) kinematic member of the $\beta$ Pictoris moving group. Future radial velocity and trigonometric parallax measurements will clarify such membership. Follow-up mid-infrared or higher resolution near-infrared spectroscopy of this object will allow for further investigation as to the cause(s) of its redness, such as youth, clouds, and viewing geometry.</description>

      <title>A variable star population in the open cluster NGC\,6819 observed by the Kepler spacecraft</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the list of variable stars we found in the \kep\ superstamp data covering approximately nine arcminutes from the central region of NGC6819. This is a continuation of our work presented by Sanjayan et al.(2022a). We classified the variable stars based on the variability type and we established their cluster membership based on the available Gaia Data Release 3 astrometry. Our search revealed 385 variable stars but only 128 were found to be cluster members. In the case of eclipsing and contact binaries we calculated the mid-times of eclipses and derived ephemerides. We searched for eclipse timing variation using the observed minus calculated diagrams. Only five objects show significant orbital period variation. We used isochrones calculated within the MESA Isochrones and Stellar Tracks project and derived the average age (2.54 Gyr), average distance (2.3 kpc) and iron content [Fe/H] = -0.01(2), of NGC6819. We confirm this distance by the one derived from Gaia astrometry of the cluster members with membership probabilities greater than 0.9.</description>

      <title>Interacting supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern photometric surveys of the sky suggest that many, perhaps most supernovae (SNe) associated with the explosion of massive stars are influenced at an appreciable level by their interaction with circumstellar material (CSM). The photometric and spectroscopic diversity of these transients point to a wide range of CSM properties in terms of mass, extent, composition, and location relative to the exploding star, suggesting progenitors that cover from standard to the most extreme mass loss rates. Surveys at high-cadence catch massive stars at shock breakout and inform us on the immediate mass loss history before core collapse. In contrast, long-term monitoring of these SNe cover the transition to the birth of a SN remnant and document the progenitor mass loss that took place centuries to millennia before explosion. Interacting SNe are therefore not just extraordinary astrophysical laboratories to study radiation-dominated shocks and probe the distant Universe, they also open the path to novel and fundamental studies on stellar evolution, stellar stability, or mass loss in single and binary massive stars.</description>

      <title>Double white dwarf binary population in MOCCA star clusters -- Comparisons with observations of close and wide binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There could be a significant population of double white dwarf binaries (DWDs) inside globular clusters (GCs), however, these are often too faint to be individually observed. We have utilized a large number GC models evolved with the Monte Carlo Cluster Simulator (MOCCA) code, to create a large statistical dataset of DWDs. These models include multiple-stellar populations, resulting in two distinct initial populations: one dense and another less dense. Due to the lower density of one population, a large number of objects escape during the early GC evolution, leading to a high mass-loss rate. In this dataset we have analysed three main groups of DWDs, namely in-cluster binaries, escaped binaries, and isolated evolution of primordial binaries. We compared the properties of these groups to observations of close and wide binaries. We find that the number of escaping DWDs is significantly larger than the number of in-cluster binaries and those that form via the isolated evolution of all promiridial binaries in our GC models. This suggests that dynamics play an important role in the formation of DWDs. For close binaries, we found a good agreement in the separations of escaped binaries and isolated binaries, but in-cluster binaries showed slight differences. We could not reproduce the observed extremely low mass WDs due to the limitations of our stellar and binary evolution prescriptions. For wide binaries, we also found a good agreement in the separations and masses, after accounting for observational selection effects. We conclude that, even though the current observational samples of DWDs are extremely biased and incomplete, our results compare reasonably well with observations.</description>

      <title>Study of Particle Acceleration using Fine Structures and Oscillations in Microwaves from Electron Cyclotron Maser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accelerated electrons during solar flares produce radio bursts and nonthermal X-ray signatures. The quasi-periodic pulsations (QPPs) and fine structures in spatial-spectral-temporal space in radio bursts depend on the emission mechanism and the local conditions, such as magnetic fields, electron density, and pitch angle distribution. Radio burst observations with high frequency-time resolution imaging provide excellent diagnostics. In converging magnetic field geometries, the radio bursts can be produced via the electron-cyclotron maser (ECM). Recently, using observations made by the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) at 1--2 GHz, \cite{Yu2023} reported a discovery of long-lasting auroral-like radio bursts persistent over a sunspot and interpreted them as ECM-generated emission. Here, we investigate the detailed second and sub-second temporal variability of this continuous ECM source. We study the association of 5-second period QPPs with a concurrent GOES C1.5-class flare, utilizing VLA's imaging spectroscopy capability with an extremely high temporal resolution (50 ms). We use the density and magnetic field extrapolation model to constrain the ECM emission to the second harmonic o-mode. Using the delay of QPPs from X-ray emission times, combined with X-ray spectroscopy and magnetic extrapolation, we constrain the energies and pitch angles of the ECM-emitting electrons to $\approx$4-8 keV and $&gt;26^{\circ}$. Our analysis shows that the loss-cone diffusion continuously fuels the ECM via Coulomb collisions and magnetic turbulence between a 5 Mm--100 Mm length scale. We conclude that the QPP occurs via the Lotka-Volterra system, where the electron from solar flares saturates the continuously operating ECM and causes temporary oscillations.</description>

      <title>SPIRou spectropolarimetry of the T Tauri star TW Hydrae: magnetic fields, accretion and planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we report near-infrared observations of the classical T Tauri star TW Hya with the SPIRou high-resolution spectropolarimeter and velocimeter at the 3.6-m Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope in 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022. By applying Least-Squares Deconvolution (LSD) to our circularly polarized spectra, we derived longitudinal fields that vary from year to year from -200 to +100 G, and exhibit low-level modulation on the 3.6 d rotation period of TW Hya, despite the star being viewed almost pole-on. We then used Zeeman-Doppler Imaging to invert our sets of unpolarized and circularly-polarized LSD profiles into brightness and magnetic maps of TW Hya in all 4 seasons, and obtain that the large-scale field of this T Tauri star mainly consists of a 1.0-1.2 kG dipole tilted at about 20{\deg} to the rotation axis, whereas the small-scale field reaches strengths of up to 3-4 kG. We find that the large-scale field is strong enough to allow TW Hya to accrete material from the disc on the polar regions at the stellar surface in a more or less geometrically stable accretion pattern, but not to succeed in spinning down the star. We also report the discovery of a radial velocity signal of semi-amplitude $11.1^{+3.3}_{-2.6}$ m/s (detected at 4.3$\sigma$ at a period of 8.3 d in the spectrum of TW Hya, whose origin may be attributed to either a non-axisymmetric density structure in the inner accretion disc, or to a $0.55^{+0.17}_{-0.13}$ Jupiter mass candidate close-in planet (if orbiting in the disc plane), at an orbital distance of $0.075\pm0.001$ au.</description>

      <title>Star Proper Motions Based on Two-epoch Observations from the SDSS and DESI Imaging Surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we present the construction of a new proper motion catalog utilizing the photometric data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) imaging surveys, with a median time baseline of about 13 years. To mitigate systematic errors, the DESI galaxy positions are employed to establish a reference frame and to correct the position-, magnitude-, and color-dependent discrepancies between SDSS and DESI imaging datasets. Spanning 12,589 square degrees, the catalog encompasses about 206.6 million non-Gaia objects down to $m_r \sim$ 23. Based on 734k quasars, the assessment of the global systematic errors in DESI-SDSS proper motion catalog yields values of 0.14 mas yr$^{-1}$ for $\mu_{\alpha *}$ and 0.11 mas yr$^{-1}$ for $\mu_{\delta}$. The catalog exhibits a precision surpassing 3.7 mas yr$^{-1}$, albeit varying with position, color, and magnitude. An additional evaluation employing approximately 5,300 distant star samples yields an overall precision of approximately 3.0 and 2.9 mas yr$^{-1}$ for $\mu_{\alpha *}$ and $\mu_{\delta}$, respectively. Further comparisons with proper motions from SDSS Stripe 82 reveal a strong consistency between the two datasets. As a practical application, we utilize fainter non-Gaia objects in our catalog to update the proper motions of 17 star clusters. The resulting proper motions for these clusters exhibit excellent consistency with those derived from Gaia data. Our proper motion measurements, characterized by a deeper limiting magnitude, stands as a valuable complement to the Gaia dataset. The catalog is publicly available at \url{https://www.scidb.cn/s/YzaIv2}.</description>

      <title>Stellar Population near NGC 2021: Procession of Star Formation in the South Rim of Supergiant Shell LMC 4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supergiant shells (SGSs) are the largest interstellar structures where heated and enriched gas flows into the host galaxy's halo. The SGSs in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) are so close that their stars can be resolved with ground-based telescopes to allow studies of star formation history. Aiming to study the star formation history and energy budget of LMC 4, we have conducted a pilot study of the cluster NGC 2021 and the OB associations in its vicinity near the south rim of LMC 4. We use the Magellanic Cloud Photometric Survey data of the LMC to establish a methodology to examine the stellar population and assess the massive star formation history. We find a radial procession of massive star formation from the northwest part of the OB association LH79 through NGC 2021 to the OB association LH78 in the south. Using the stellar content of NGC 2021 and the assumption of Salpeter's initial mass function, we estimate that $\sim$4 supernovae have occurred in NGC 2021, injecting at least $4\times10^{51}$ ergs of kinetic energy into the interior of LMC 4.</description>

      <title>SCExAO/CHARIS Multi-Wavelength, High-Contrast Imaging of the BD+45$^\circ$598 Debris Disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a multi-wavelength (1.16$\mu$m-2.37$\mu$m) view of the debris disk around BD+45$^\circ$598, using the Subaru Coronagraphic Extreme Adaptive Optics system paired with the Coronagraphic High Angular Resolution Imaging Spectrograph. With an assumed age of 23 Myr, this source allows us to study the early evolution of debris disks and search for forming planets. We fit a scattered light model to our disk using a differential evolution algorithm, and constrain its geometry. We find the disk to have a peak density radius of $R_0 = 109.6$ au, an inclination of $i = 88.1^\circ$, and position angle $PA = 111.0^\circ$. While we do not detect a substellar companion in the disk, our calculated contrast limits indicate sensitivity to planets as small as $\sim 10 M_{\rm Jup}$ at a projected separation of 12 au of the star, and as small as $\sim 4 M_{\rm Jup}$ beyond 38 au. When measuring intensity as a function of wavelength, the disk color constrains the minimum dust grain size within a range of $\sim0.13$ to 1.01$\mu$m.</description>

      <title>The Random Hivemind: An Ensemble Deep Learner Application to Solar Energetic Particle Prediction Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.08092v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The application of machine learning and deep learning, including the wide use of non-ensemble, conventional neural networks (CoNN), for predicting various phenomena has become very popular in recent years thanks to the efficiencies and the abilities of these techniques to find relationships in data without human intervention. However, certain CoNN setups may not work on some datasets, especially if the parameters passed to it, including model parameters and hyperparameters, are arguably arbitrary in nature and need to continuously be updated with the need to retrain the model. This concern can be partially alleviated by employing committees of neural networks that are identical in terms of input features and architectures, initialized randomly, and "vote" on the decisions made by the committees as a whole. Yet, it is possible for the committee members to "agree" on identical sets of weights and biases for all nodes and edges. Members of these committees also cannot be expanded to accommodate new features and entire committees must therefore be retrained in order to do so. We propose the Random Hivemind (RH) approach, which helps to alleviate this concern by having multiple neural network estimators make decisions based on random permutations of features and prescribing a method to determine the weight of the decision of each individual estimator. The effectiveness of RH is demonstrated through experimentation in the predictions of hazardous Solar Energetic Particle (SEP) events by comparing it to that of using both CoNNs and the aforementioned setup of committees. Our results demonstrate that RH, while having a comparable or better performance than the CoNN and a Committee-based approach, demonstrates a lesser score spread for the individual experiments, and shows promising results with respect to capturing almost every single flare instance leading to SEPs.</description>

      <title>Impact of Anomalous Active Regions on the Large-scale Magnetic Field of the Sun</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.13145v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the major sources of perturbation in the solar cycle amplitude is believed to be the emergence of anomalous active regions which do not obey Hale's polarity law and Joy's law of tilt angles. Anomalous regions containing high magnetic flux that disproportionately impact the polar field are sometimes referred to as ``rogue regions". In this study -- utilizing a surface flux transport model -- we analyze the large-scale dipole moment build-up due to the emergence of anomalous active regions on the solar surface. Although these active regions comprise a small fraction of the total sunspot number, they can substantially influence the magnetic dipole moment build-up and subsequent solar cycle amplitude. Our numerical simulations demonstrate that the impact of ``Anti-Joy'' regions on the solar cycle is similar to those of ``Anti-Hale'' regions. We also find that the emergence time, emergence latitude, relative number and flux distribution of anomalous regions influence the large-scale magnetic field dynamics in diverse ways. We establish that the results of our numerical study are consistent with the algebraic (analytic) approach to explaining the Sun's dipole moment evolution. Our results are relevant for understanding how anomalous active regions modulate the Sun's large-scale dipole moment build-up and its reversal timing within the framework of the Babcock-Leighton dynamo mechanism -- now believed to be the primary source of solar cycle variations.</description>

Abstract: We compile a catalog of 578 highly probable and 62 likely red supergiants (RSGs) of the Milky Way, which represents the largest list of Galactic RSG candidates designed for continuous follow-up to date. We match distances measured by Gaia DR3, 2MASS photometry, and a 3D Galactic dust map to obtain luminous bright late-type stars. Determining the stars' bolometric luminosities and effective temperatures, we compare to Geneva stellar evolution tracks to determine likely RSG candidates, and quantify contamination using a catalog of Galactic AGB in the same luminosity-temperature space. We add details for common or interesting characteristics of RSG, such as multi-star system membership, variability, and classification as a runaway. As potential future core-collapse supernova (SN) progenitors, we study the ability of the catalog to inform the Supernova Early Warning System (SNEWS) coincidence network made to automate pointing, and show that for 3D position estimates made possible by neutrinos, the number of progenitor candidates can be significantly reduced, improving our ability to observe the progenitor pre-explosion and the early phases of the core-collapse supernova.</description>

      <title>Algebraic Quantification of the Contribution of Active Regions to the Sun's Dipole Moment: Applications to Century-scale Polar Field Estimates and Solar Cycle Forecasting</title>

Abstract: The solar cycle is generated by a magnetohydrodynamic dynamo mechanism which involves the induction and recycling of the toroidal and poloidal components of the Sun's magnetic field. Recent observations indicate that the Babcock-Leighton mechanism -- mediated via the emergence and evolution of tilted bipolar active regions -- is the primary contributor to the Sun's large-scale dipolar field. Surface flux transport models and dynamo models have been employed to simulate this mechanism, which also allows for physics-based solar cycle forecasts. Recently, an alternative analytic method has been proposed to quantify the contribution of individual active regions to the Sun's dipole moment. Utilizing solar cycle observations spanning a century, here, we test the efficacy of this algebraic approach. Our results demonstrate that the algebraic quantification approach is reasonably successful in estimating dipole moments at solar minima over the past century -- providing a verification of the Babcock-Leighton mechanism as the primary contributor to the Sun's dipole field variations. We highlight that this algebraic methodology serves as an independent approach for estimating dipole moments at the minima of solar cycles, relying on characteristics of bipolar solar active regions. We also show how this method may be utilized for solar cycle predictions; our estimate of the Sun's dipole field at the end of cycle 24 using this approach indicates that solar cycle 25 would be a moderately weak cycle, ranging between solar cycle 20 and cycle 24.</description>

      <title>Dynamo action driven by precessional turbulence</title>

Abstract: We reveal and analyze an efficient magnetic dynamo action due to precession-driven hydrodynamic turbulence in the local model of a precessional flow, focusing on the kinematic stage of this dynamo. The growth rate of magnetic field monotonically increases with Poincar\'{e} number, $\rm Po$, characterizing precession strength, and magnetic Prandtl number, $\rm Pm$, equal to the ratio of viscosity to resistivity, for the considered ranges of these parameters. The critical ${\rm Po}_c$ for the dynamo onset decreases with increasing $\rm Pm$. To understand the scale-by-scale evolution (growth) of the precession dynamo and its driving processes, we perform spectral analysis by calculating the spectra of magnetic energy and of different terms in the induction equation in Fourier space. To this end, we decompose the velocity field of precession-driven turbulence into 2D vortical and 3D inertial wave modes. It is shown that the dynamo operates across a broad range of scales and exhibits a remarkable transition from a primarily vortex-driven regime at lower $\rm Po$ to a more complex regime at higher $\rm Po$ where it is driven jointly by vortices, inertial waves and the shear of the background precessional flow. The vortices and shear drive the dynamo mostly at large scales, comparable to the flow system size, and at intermediate scales, while at smaller scales it is mainly driven by inertial waves. This study can be important not only for understanding the magnetic dynamo action in precession-driven flows, but also in a general context of flows where vortices emerge and govern the flow dynamics and evolution.</description>

      <title>On the X-ray efficiency of the white dwarf pulsar candidate ZTF J190132.9+145808.7</title>

Abstract: Strongly magnetized, rapidly rotating massive white dwarfs (WDs) emerge as potential outcomes of double degenerate mergers. These WDs can act as sources of non-thermal emission and cosmic rays, gethering attention as WD pulsars. In this context, we studied the X-ray emissions from ZTF J190132.9+145808.7 (hereafter ZTF J1901+14), a notable massive isolated WD in the Galaxy, using the Chandra X-ray observatory. Our results showed 3.5sigma level evidence of X-ray signals, although it is marginal. Under the assumption of a photon index of 2, we derived its intrinsic flux to be 2.3 (0.9--4.7) $\times 10^{-15}$~erg~cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ and luminosity 4.6 (2.0--9.5) $\times 10^{26}$~erg~s$^{-1}$ for a 0.5--7 keV band in the 90% confidence range, given its distance of 41 pc. We derived an X-ray efficiency (eta) concerning the spin-down luminosity to be 0.012 (0.0022--0.074), a value comparable to that of ordnary neutron star pulsars. The inferred X-ray luminosity may be compatible with curvature radiation from sub-TeV electrons accelerated within open magnetic fields in the magnetosphere of ZTF J1901+14. Conducting more extensive X-ray observations is crucial to confirm whether ZTF J1901+14-like isolated WDs are also significant sources of X-rays and sub-TeV electron cosmic rays, similar to other WD pulsars in accreting systems.</description>

      <title>Planetary Nebulae of the Large Magellanic Cloud I: A multiwavelength analysis</title>

Abstract: Planetary nebulae (PNe) have three main components: a central star (CS), ionised gas and dust in the nebula. Each of them contains critical chemical fingerprints of their evolution, serving as tracers of the evolution, nucleosynthesis and dust production that occurred during the preceding asymptotic giant branch (AGB) phase. We aim to build a bridge to link the PN phase to the evolution of their progenitors, trying to better understand the dust production and mass-loss mechanism during the final AGB phase. Here, we present a comprehensive study of nine Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) spherical or elliptical PNe whose observations from the ultraviolet (UV) through the infrared (IR) are available in the literature. We characterize nebulae and CSs, finding information as the amount of gas that makes up the nebula and the dust that surrounds the CS, necessary to reconstruct the evolutionary history of mass-loss and dust production. We compare the observed energy distribution of the selected PNe to that obtained from photoionization modeling, taking into account the presence of dust. The physical and chemical parameters of the central stars are then compared with the predictions from the evolutionary tracks. We characterized the source, assigning to each CS a progenitor, early-AGB mass. We estimated the mass of the nebula and the dust-to-gas ratio. For 5 objects, we find evidence for the presence of a near-IR bump, which would be connected to the presence of hot dust.</description>
