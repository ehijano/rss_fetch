      <title>Very fast general Electromagnetic Analysis with computational conformal geometry via Conformal Energy Minimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We recently found that the electromagnetic scattering problem can be very fast in an approach expressing the fields in terms of orthonormal basis functions. In this paper we apply computational conformal geometry with the conformal energy minimization (CEM) algorithm to make possible fast solution of finite-frequency electromagnetic problems involving arbitrarily shaped, simply-connected metallic surfaces. The CEM algorithm computes conformal maps with minimal angular distortion, enabling the transformation of arbitrary simply-connected surfaces into a disk, where orthogonal basis functions can be defined and electromagnetic analysis can be significantly simplified. We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method by investigating the resonance characteristics of two metallic surfaces: a square plate and a four-petal plate. Compared to traditional finite element methods (e.g., COMSOL), our approach achieves a three-order-of-magnitude improvement in computational efficiency, requiring only seconds to extract resonant frequencies and fields. Moreover, it reveals low-energy, doubly degenerate resonance modes that are elusive to conventional methods. These findings not only provide a powerful tool for analyzing electromagnetic fields on complex geometries but also pave the way for the design of high-performance electromagnetic devices.</description>

      <title>Polariton cascade phonon laser</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.17336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phonon lasers, as their photon counterparts, rely on the physics of stimulated emission. Arguably, because light does not require a material substrate to propagate, while sound does, the impact of the two technologies has however been highly contrasting, with "sasers" (for sound amplification by stimulated emission of radiation) mostly remaining as an academic curiosity. This might be changing due to the possibility to use coherent sound generation for on-chip processing of information at ultra-high frequencies, and in the quantum realm, in integrated photonic and optomechanical devices. Inspired by the concept of unipolar lasers based on the quantum engineering of states in semiconductor heterostructures, we propose and implement a quantum cascade phonon laser (QCPL). A condensate of exciton-photon quasiparticles (polaritons) is optically induced in a microstructured semiconductor device to jump down a ladder of engineered levels. This down-cascade is accompanied by the efficient stimulated emission of phonons of $\sim 20$, $\sim 60$, and $\sim 100$~GHz, which are designed to strongly interact with the polaritons on the same chip. The proposed concept opens the path for the design of integrated high-frequency optomechanical devices, as for example for non-reciprocal photon transport and multi-wavelength Brillouin lasers.</description>

      <title>Internal dynamics and fission of pure-quartic soliton molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the weak interaction of a pair of well-separated pure-quartic solitons (PQSs), which are solutions to a generalized nonlinear Schrodinger equation (NLSE) with the quartic-only dispersion. An asymptotic technique is applied to derive equations for the slow evolution of the temporal separation and phase difference of the PQSs interacting through the overlapping of their exponentially decaying oscillating tails. Based on this approach, various stationary states of bound PQS (soliton molecules) with distinct phase differences are predicted. Their stability is addressed via the numerical calculation of the eigenvalue spectrum of small perturbations, showing instability of the bound states. A systematic numerical analysis demonstrates that the parameter space of the PQS bound states is organized as a self-similar fractal structure, composed of regions populated by robustly oscillating or splitting two-soliton states. The analytical method and results reported here can be extended for bound states of two or several weakly interacting modes in other conservative and dissipative systems.</description>

      <title>Programmable Photonic Unitary Processor Enables Parametrized Differentiable Long-Haul Spatial Division Multiplexed Transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The explosive growth of global data traffic demands scalable and energy-efficient optical communication systems. Spatial division multiplexing (SDM) using multicore or multimode fibers is a promising solution to overcome the capacity limit of single-mode fibers. However, long-haul SDM transmission faces significant challenges due to modal dispersion, which imposes heavy computational loads on digital signal processing (DSP) for signal equalization. Here, we propose parameterized SDM transmission, where programmable photonic unitary processors are installed at intermediate nodes. Instead of relying on conventional digital equalization only on the receiver side, our approach enables direct optimization of the SDM transmission channel itself by the programmable unitary processor, which reduces digital post-processing loads. We introduce a gradient-based optimization algorithm using a differentiable SDM transmission model to determine the optimal unitary transformation. As a key enabler, we first implemented telecom-grade programmable photonic unitary processor, achieving a low-loss (2.1 dB fiber-to-fiber), wideband (full C-band), polarization-independent, and high-fidelity (R2&gt;96% across the C-band) operation. We experimentally demonstrate 1300-km transmission using a three-mode fiber, achieving strong agreement between simulation and experiment. The optimized photonic processor significantly reduces modal dispersion and post-processing complexity. Our results establish a scalable framework for integrating photonic computation into the optical layer, enabling more efficient, high-capacity optical networks.</description>

      <title>Pulse duration dependence of material response in ultrafast laser-induced surface-penetrating nanovoids in fused silica</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The focused ultrafast laser, with its ability to initiate nonlinear absorption in transparent materials, has emerged as one of the most effective approaches for micro-nano processing. In this study, we carried out research on the processing of high-aspect-ratio nanovoids on fused silica by using the single-pulse ultrafast Bessel beam. The thermodynamic response behaviors of the materials on surface and deep inside are found to exhibit pronounced disparities with the variation in laser pulse duration. As the pulse duration increases from 0.2 ps to 9.0 ps, the intensity of material ablation on silica surface exhibits a gradually decreasing trend, while for the void formation deep inside silica, the void diameter exhibits a trend of initial increase followed by decrease. In particular, no nanovoids are even induced deep inside when the pulse duration is 0.2 ps. The mechanism causing such differences is discussed and considered to be related to the peak intensity, group velocity dispersion, and plasma defocusing. By covering a polymer film on silica surface to influence the energy deposition, the thermomechanical response behaviors of the materials to laser pulse duration are modulated, and the material sputtering on nanovoid opening is suppressed. On this basis, surface-penetrating nanovoid arrays are fabricated on a 2-mm-thick silica sample using 2 ps Bessel beam. Given the nanovoid diameter of approximately 150 nm, the aspect ratio of the nanovoids on fused silica sample exceeds 13000:1. This outcome creates significant possibilities for the stealth dicing and processing of 3D photonic crystals, optical integrated devices, and nanofluidics.</description>

      <title>Experimental Study of Fabry-Perot BICs in a Microwave Waveguide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Fabry-Perot bound states in the continuum (FP-BIC) in the GHz frequency range, formed by two ceramic discs placed inside a metallic-walled rectangular waveguide, that act as perfect reflectors at the resonant frequency. The energy becomes perfectly trapped between the discs, forming a FP-BIC, when the distance between them matches the Fabry-Perot quantization condition. We present both theoretical and experimental analyses to investigate how the total and radiative quality factors (Q factors) depend on the inter-disk distance. We gain valuable insights into the Fano features observed in the transmission spectra using the quasi-normal mode technique and temporal coupled mode theory. Notably, we find that as the system approaches the BICs, the Fano asymmetry parameters diverge, resulting in a Lorentzian transmission profile. Experimentally, we measure a radiative Q factor on the order of $10^5$, while the total Q factor, limited by material losses, remains around $10^3$. These results offer new opportunities for the application of BICs in microwave technology, significantly advancing the potential for high-performance devices.</description>

      <title>HiLAB: A Hybrid Inverse-Design Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: HiLAB (Hybrid inverse-design with Latent-space learning, Adjoint-based partial optimizations, and Bayesian optimization) is a new paradigm for inverse design of nanophotonic structures. Combining early-terminated topological optimization (TO) with a Vision Transformer-based variational autoencoder (VAE) and a Bayesian search, HiLAB addresses multi-functional device design by generating diverse freeform configurations at reduced simulation costs. Shortened adjoint-driven TO runs, coupled with randomized physical parameters, produce robust initial structures. These structures are compressed into a compact latent space by the VAE, enabling Bayesian optimization to co-optimize geometry and physical hyperparameters. Crucially, the trained VAE can be reused for alternative objectives or constraints by adjusting only the acquisition function. Compared to conventional TO pipelines prone to local optima, HiLAB systematically explores near-global optima with considerably fewer electromagnetic simulations. Even after accounting for training overhead, the total number of full simulations decreases by over an order of magnitude, accelerating the discovery of fabrication-friendly devices. Demonstrating its efficacy, HiLAB is used to design an achromatic beam deflector for red, green, and blue wavelengths, achieving balanced diffraction efficiencies of ~25% while mitigating chromatic aberrations-a performance surpassing existing demonstrations. Overall, HiLAB provides a flexible platform for robust, multi-parameter photonic designs and rapid adaptation to next-generation nanophotonic challenges.</description>

      <title>Shaping freeform nanophotonic devices with geometric neural parameterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanophotonic freeform design has the potential to push the performance of optical components to new limits, but there remains a challenge to effectively perform optimization while reliably enforcing design and manufacturing constraints. We present Neuroshaper, a framework for freeform geometric parameterization in which nanophotonic device layouts are defined using an analytic neural network representation. Neuroshaper serves as a qualitatively new way to perform shape optimization by capturing multi-scalar, freeform geometries in an overparameterized representation scheme, enabling effective optimization in a smoothened, high dimensional geometric design space. We show that Neuroshaper can enforce constraints and topology manipulation in a manner where local constraints lead to global changes in device morphology. We further show numerically and experimentally that Neuroshaper can apply to a diversity of nanophotonic devices. The versatility and capabilities of Neuroshaper reflect the ability of neural representation to augment concepts in topological design.</description>

      <title>A Framework for Spontaneous Brillouin Noise: Unveiling Fundamental Limits in Brillouin Metrology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spontaneous Brillouin scattering (SpBS) provides a non-contact tool for probing the mechanical and thermodynamic properties of materials, enabling important applications such as distributed optical fiber sensing and high-resolution Brillouin microscopy. Achieving metrological precision in these systems relies critically on identifying fundamental noise sources. While a pioneering study three decades ago numerically investigated an intrinsic SpBS noise mechanism, this phenomenon has remained largely unexplored, particularly in the context of Brillouin metrological systems. Here, by revisiting its physical formation process and rethinking its stochastic behaviors, we develop and experimentally validate a comprehensive analytical framework on this long-overlooked noise source. Importantly, we theoretically predict, for the first time, the SpBS noise is a universal and fundamental limit that can dominate over conventional limits such as shot noise in Brillouin metrological systems like imaging, microscopy and sensing. Specifically, we experimentally demonstrate the SpBS-noise-limited regime in Brillouin imaging and sensing scenarios. This framework establishes a critical foundation for understanding and optimizing the performance bounds of current and future Brillouin-based technologies across diverse applications.</description>

      <title>Guided polariton condensate in perovskite microwires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Perovskite microwires are promising candidates for integrated photonic systems due to their strong nonlinear optical response and inherent waveguiding capabilities. In this study, we focus on the directional emission properties of exciton-polariton condensates formed within perovskite microwires, with emphasis on emission collected from the microwire end. We constructed a multi-angle optical detection setup that allows us to identify the exciton-polariton condensation threshold and track the evolution of the condensate for different excitation position along and across the microwire. We observe spectrally narrow exciton-polariton condensate emission from the microwire end even when the condensate is generated tens of micrometers away, which demonstrates the ability of the exciton-polariton condensate to propagate over long distances within the microwire. Furthermore, we find that the presence of structural defects near the condensate location can significantly enhance the emission from the microwire end due to aligning the condensate's momentum with the waveguide direction, thereby facilitating more efficient propagation.</description>

      <title>Surface-Encoded Partial Coherence Transformation: Modeling Source Coherence Effects in Wave Optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new mathematical framework for incorporating partial coherence effects into wave optics simulations through a comprehensive surface-to-detector approach. Unlike traditional ensemble averaging methods, our dual-component framework models partial coherence through: (1) a surface-encoded transformation implemented via a linear integral operator with a spatially-dependent kernel that modifies coherence properties at the reflection interface, followed by (2) a propagation component that evolves these coherence properties to the detection plane. This approach differs fundamentally from conventional models by explicitly separating surface interactions from propagation effects, while maintaining a unified mathematical structure. We derive the mathematical foundation based on the coherence function formalism, establish the connection to the Van Cittert-Zernike theorem, and prove the equivalence of our framework to conventional partial coherence theory. The method reduces the dimensional complexity of coherence calculations and offers potential computational advantages, particularly for systems involving multiple surfaces and propagation steps. Applications include optical testing and astronomical instrumentation. We provide rigorous mathematical proofs, demonstrate the convergence properties, and analyze the relative importance of surface and propagation effects across different optical scenarios.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneous Transmission of Analog Radio and Digital Coherent Signals Over Multi-Span Metro and PON for Bandwidth-Efficient Fronthaul in mmWave Centralized RAN Networks [Invited]</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We experimentally investigate the transparent coexistence of heterogeneous Analog Radio-over-Fiber (ARoF) and Digital Coherent Optical (DCO) signals in a converged metro/PON network. Our streamlined setup employs RF generation via optical heterodyning, so that both carrier and modulated signals can be generated centrally and transmitted to the antenna site, across a metro network and Passive Optical Network (PON). The experiment includes the transmission of 8.8 Gbps mmWave signals and 400 Gbps coherent optical signals within a 68.75 GHz ROADM channel bandwidth and a 1:32 to 1:128 split PON. We also analyze the impact of varying ROADM channel bandwidth, PON split ratios, metro network distance and number of ROADMs traversed, on the performance of DCO and ARoF signals. The results reveal that the error vector magnitude (EVM) of the ARoF signal is significantly influenced by the allocated bandwidth, the number of ROADMs, and the overall network loss, providing insights into optimizations necessary to achieve target EVM levels.</description>

      <title>Hybrid SiO2/Si Pillar-Based Optomechanical Crystals for On-Chip Photonic Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One-dimensional photonic crystal (1D-PhC) pillar cavities allow transducing mechanical pillar vibrations to the optical domain, thereby relaxing the requirements typically associated with mechanical motion detection. In this study, we integrate these geometries into a silicon-on-insulator photonics platform and explore their optical and mechanical properties. The 1D-PhC structures consist of a linear array of high aspect ratio nanopillars with nanometer-sized diameters, designed to enhance the interaction between transverse-magnetic (TM) polarized optical fields and mechanical vibrations and to minimize optical leaking to the substrate. Integrated waveguides are engineered to support TM-like modes, which enable optimized coupling to the 1D-PhC optical cavity modes via evanescent wave interaction. Finite element method simulations and experimental analyses reveal that these cavities achieve relatively high optical quality factors (Q = 4x10^3). In addition, both simulated and experimentally measured mechanical vibrational frequencies show large optomechanical coupling rates exceeding 1 MHz for the fundamental cantilever-like modes. By tuning the separation between the 1D-PhC and the waveguide, we achieve optimal optical coupling conditions that enable the transduction of thermally activated mechanical modes across a broad frequency range (from tens to several hundreds of MHz). This enhanced accessibility and efficiency in mechanical motion transduction significantly strengthens the viability of established microelectromechanical (MEMS) and nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS) technologies based on nanowires, nanorods, and related structures, particularly in applications such as force sensing and biosensing.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous amplification and shaping of excimer lasers using Stimulated Brillouin Scattering in the strongly damped limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Attaining practical Inertial Fusion Energy (IFE) depends on how efficiently one can couple the driver energy to the nuclear fusion fuel for compression and ignition. While the excimer lasers provide an efficient alternative compared to existing laser technology, it is unclear how the lasers can be harnessed to form a pulse with desired pulse shape and intensity. Stimulated Brillouin Scattering (SBS) provides a path to compressing long, energetic pulses to short intense ones. We consider the equations governing SBS in the Strongly Damped Limit (SDL) and find that it is possible to almost completely specify the final pulse shape by providing an appropriate initial seed pulse. We provide analytic expressions for reverse-engineering the initial seed shape and delineate physical limits concerning the prepulse level.</description>

      <title>Light-matter interaction between templated molecular layers and surface lattice resonances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We couple a templated layer of merocyanine molecules with surface lattice resonances in a plasmonic grating. The templating of the molecular layer is achieved using a layer of aligned graphene nanoribbons, resulting in anisotropic optical properties. The anisotropy manifests itself in polarization-dependent coupling between excitons in the organic layer and lattice plasmons in the grating. We study the influence of the templating on the coupling and find that surprisingly the more orientational ordered templated layer displays a lower coupling strength than an identical amorphous merocyanine layer. Our work demonstrates the use of molecular templating in controlling the interaction of excitons with excitations in optical nanostructures.</description>

      <title>AI-Driven Robotics for Free-Space Optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tabletop optical experiments are foundational to research in many areas of science, including photonics, quantum optics, materials science, metrology, and biomedical imaging. However these experiments remain fundamentally reliant on manual design, assembly, and alignment, limiting throughput and reproducibility. Optics currently lacks generalizable robotic systems capable of operating across a diverse range of setups in realistic laboratory environments. Here we present OptoMate, an autonomous platform that integrates generative AI, computer vision, and precision robotics to enable automation of free-space optics experiments. Our platform interprets user-defined goals to generate valid optical setups using a fine-tuned large language model (LLM), assembles the setup via robotic pick-and-place with sub-millimeter accuracy, and performs fine alignment using a robot-deployable tool. The system then executes a range of automated measurements, including laser beam characterization, polarization mapping, and spectroscopy tasks. This work demonstrates the first flexible, AI-driven automation platform for optics, offering a path toward remote operation, cloud labs, and high-throughput discovery in the optical sciences.</description>

      <title>Tunable photogating in a molecular aggregate coupled graphene phototransistor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a graphene photodetector coupled to a layer of aggregated organic semiconductor. A graphene phototransistor is covered with a thin film of merocyanine molecules. The aggregation of the molecular layer can be controlled by the deposition parameters and post-deposition annealing to obtain films ranging from amorphous to a highly aggregated state. The molecular layer has a uniaxial structure with excitonic transitions whose transition dipole moments are well defined. The presence of the molecular layer results in an enormous increase in the response of the phototransistor. We further demonstrate that the signal-enhancement is due to p-photodoping of the graphene. The spectroscopic photoresponse suggests that the photodoping via monomers and molecular aggregates takes place differently. Our photodetector is a platform to study the influence of molecular aggregation and order on charge transport processes between aggregated organic semiconductors and two-dimensional materials.</description>

      <title>LiDAR 2.0: Hierarchical Curvy Waveguide Detailed Routing for Large-Scale Photonic Integrated Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Driven by innovations in photonic computing and interconnects, photonic integrated circuit (PIC) designs advance and grow in complexity. Traditional manual physical design processes have become increasingly cumbersome. Available PIC layout tools are mostly schematic-driven, which has not alleviated the burden of manual waveguide planning and layout drawing. Previous research in PIC automated routing is largely adapted from electronic design, focusing on high-level planning and overlooking photonic-specific constraints such as curvy waveguides, bending, and port alignment. As a result, they fail to scale and cannot generate DRV-free layouts, highlighting the need for dedicated electronic-photonic design automation tools to streamline PIC physical design. In this work, we present LiDAR, the first automated PIC detailed router for large-scale designs. It features a grid-based, curvy-aware A* engine with adaptive crossing insertion, congestion-aware net ordering, and insertion-loss optimization. To enable routing in more compact and complex designs, we further extend our router to hierarchical routing as LiDAR 2.0. It introduces redundant-bend elimination, crossing space preservation, and routing order refinement for improved conflict resilience. We also develop and open-source a YAML-based PIC intermediate representation and diverse benchmarks, including TeMPO, GWOR, and Bennes, which feature hierarchical structures and high crossing densities. Evaluations across various benchmarks show that LiDAR 2.0 consistently produces DRV-free layouts, achieving up to 16% lower insertion loss and 7.69x speedup over prior methods on spacious cases, and 9% lower insertion loss with 6.95x speedup over LiDAR 1.0 on compact cases. Our codes are open-sourced at https://github.com/ScopeX-ASU/LiDAR.</description>

      <title>Image rotation in plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Because of the speed of light compared to material motion, the dragging of light is difficult to observe under laboratory conditions. Here we report on the first observation of image rotation, i. e. a dragging by the medium of the wave's transverse structure, of Alfv\'en waves in plasmas. Exploiting the naturally slow group velocity of these waves, significant wave rotation is achieved for modest angular frequency. Control over the rotation of the wave's structure is demonstrated through the plasma rotation imposed by biased electrodes. Remarkably, experimental results are well reproduced by light dragging theory derived for isotropic media, even if magnetized plasmas are anisotropic. In addition to offering new insights into the fundamental issue of angular momentum coupling between waves and media, these findings also open possibilities for new remote rotation sensing tools.</description>

      <title>Optimal beam displacement measurements using high-order structured light modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09065v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a novel technique to measure small angular and lateral displacements of structured light beams. The technique relies on using high-order Hermite-Gaussian (HG) and Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) modes, which have well-defined symmetry under inversion. We show that the displacements of such fields lead to a crosstalk with modes with opposite parity under inversion, which we measure optimally with an interferometric parity sorter. Using this technique, we achieve improvement factors of up 41 in the signal-to-noise ratio using Hermite-Gaussian modes and 21 using Laguerre-Gaussian modes with order up to 20, as compared to the fundamental Gaussian mode. Our results present a viable way of using structured light for metrology that does not demand quantum light or homodyne detection.</description>

      <title>In vacuum metasurface for optical microtrap array</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05918v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optical tweezer arrays of laser-cooled and individual controlled particles have revolutionized the atomic, molecular and optical physics, and they afford exquisite capabilities for applications in quantum simulation of many-body physics, quantum computation and quantum sensing. Underlying this development is the technical maturity of generating scalable optical beams, enabled by active components and high numerical aperture objective. However, such a complex combination of bulk optics outside the vacuum chamber is very sensitive to any vibration and drift. Here we demonstrate the generation of 3*3 static tweezer array with a single chip-scale multifunctional metasurface element in vacuum, replacing the meter-long free space optics. Fluorescence counts on the camera validates the successfully trapping of the atomic ensemble array. Further, we discuss the strategy to achieve low scattering and crosstalk, where a metasurface design featuring dual-wavelength independent control is included. Our results, together with other recent development in integrated photonics for cold atoms, could pave the way for compact and portable quantum sensors and simulators in platforms of neutral atom arrays.</description>

      <title>Markov chain Monte Carlo Detector Tomography applied to a NbTiN nanobridge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11430v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate the use of a flexible and highly accurate Markov chain Monte Carlo Quantum Detector Tomography method as a minimization algorithm to best describe the response of an efficient $120 nm$ wide NbTiN superconducting nanobridge single photon detector. Separation of the internal quantum efficiency and external quantum efficiency is possible due to the difference in saturation behavior of an ideal 1-photon threshold detector as compared to a detector with non-unity 1-photon internal quantum efficiency. From a statistical analysis of our measurements (at $T=4.23\pm0.01K$, $I=29.4\pm0.1\mu A$, $I/I_\text{switch}=0.90\pm0.01$) we find an external quantum efficiency $\eta=(1.60\pm0.05)\cdot10^{-6}$, a 1-photon internal quantum efficiency $p_1=0.568\pm0.008$ and unity multi-photon (2 or more) internal quantum efficiency.</description>

      <title>Nanoscale Mirrorless Superradiant Lasing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04025v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We predict collective 'free-space' lasing in a dense nanoscopic emitter arrangement where dipole-dipole coupled atomic emitters synchronize their emission and exhibit lasing behavior without the need for an optical resonator. At the example of a subwavelength-spaced linear emitter chain with varying fractions of pumped and unpumped emitters, we present a comprehensive study of this mirrorless lasing phenomenon. The total radiated power transitions from subradiant suppression under weak pumping to superradiant enhancement at stronger pumping, while exhibiting directional emission confined to a narrow spatial angle. At the same time multiple independent spectral emission lines below the lasing threshold merge towards a single narrow spectral line at high pump power. The most substantial enhancement and line narrowing occur when a fraction of unpumped atoms is present. We show that this leads to superradiant lasing near the bare atomic frequency, making the system a promising candidate for a minimalist active optical frequency reference.</description>
