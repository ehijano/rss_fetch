      <title>An Implicit Function Method for Computing the Stability Boundaries of Hill's Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hill's equation is a common model of a time-periodic system that can undergo parametric resonance for certain choices of system parameters. For most kinds of parametric forcing, stable regions in its two-dimensional parameter space need to be identified numerically, typically by applying a matrix trace criterion. By integrating ODEs derived from the stability criterion, we present an alternative, more accurate and computationally efficient numerical method for determining the stability boundaries of Hill's equation in parameter space. This method works similarly to determine stability boundaries for the closely related problem of vibrational stabilization of the linearized Katpiza pendulum. Additionally, we derive a stability criterion for the damped Hill's equation in terms of a matrix trace criterion on an equivalent undamped system. In doing so we generalize the method of this paper to compute stability boundaries for parametric resonance in the presence of damping.</description>

      <title>Model free data assimilation with Takens embedding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In many practical scenarios, the dynamical system is not available and standard data assimilation methods are not applicable. Our objective is to construct a data-driven model for state estimation without the underlying dynamics. Instead of directly modeling the observation operator with noisy observation, we establish the state space model of the denoised observation. Through data assimilation techniques, the denoised observation information could be used to recover the original model state. Takens' theorem shows that an embedding of the partial and denoised observation is diffeomorphic to the attractor. This gives a theoretical base for estimating the model state using the reconstruction map. To realize the idea, the procedure consists of offline stage and online stage. In the offline stage, we construct the surrogate dynamics using dynamic mode decomposition with noisy snapshots to learn the transition operator for the denoised observation. The filtering distribution of the denoised observation can be estimated using adaptive ensemble Kalman filter, without knowledge of the model error and observation noise covariances. Then the reconstruction map can be established using the posterior mean of the embedding and its corresponding state. In the online stage, the observation is filtered with the surrogate dynamics. Then the online state estimation can be performed utilizing the reconstruction map and the filtered observation. Furthermore, the idea can be generalized to the nonparametric framework with nonparametric time series prediction methods for chaotic problems. The numerical results show the proposed method can estimate the state distribution without the physical dynamical system.</description>

      <title>Stability of Fixed Points for Nonlinear Selfconsistent Transfer Operators via Cone Contractions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the action of self-consistent transfer operators (STOs) on Birkhoff cones and give sufficient conditions for stability of their fixed points. Our approach relies on the order preservation properties of STOs that can be established via the study of their differential. We focus on the study of STOs arising from strongly coupled maps both deterministic and noisy. Our approach allows for explicit estimates that we use to give examples of STOs with multiple stable fixed points some of which are shown to be far from the asymptotic behaviour of the corresponding system of finite coupled maps and give information only on long transients for the finite dimensional system.</description>

      <title>When invariance implies exchangeability (and applications to invariant Keisler measures)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of when, given a homogeneous structure $M$ and a space $S$ of expansions of $M$, every $\mathrm{Aut}(M)$-invariant probability measure on $S$ is exchangeable (i.e. $S_\infty$-invariant). We define a condition of $k$-overlap closedness on $M$ which implies exchangeability of random expansions by a class of structures whose finite substructures are all contained in a hereditary class with labelled growth-rate $O(e^{n^{k+\delta}})$ for all $\delta&gt;0$. For example, the generic tetrahedron-free $3$-hypergraph is $2$-overlap closed and so all of its random expansions by graphs are exchangeable. Our more general results on $k$-overlap closedness for homogeneous structures imply the same for every finitely bounded homogeneous $3$-hypergraph with free amalgamation. Our results extend and recover both the work of Angel, Kechris and Lyons on invariant random orderings of homogeneous structures and some of the work of Crane and Towsner, and Ackerman on relatively exchangeable structures. We also study conditions under which there are non-exchangeable invariant random expansions looking at the universal homogeneous kay-graphs.
  In the second part of the paper we apply our results to study invariant Keisler measures in homogeneous structures. We prove that invariant Keisler measures can be viewed as a particular kind of invariant random expansion. Thus, we describe the spaces of invariant Keisler measures of various homogeneous structures, obtaining the first results of this kind since the work of Albert and Ensley. We also show there are $2^{\aleph_0}$ supersimple homogeneous ternary structures for which there are non-forking formulas which are universally measure zero.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Spectral Clustering on Quantum and Analog Platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel hybrid quantum-analog algorithm to perform graph clustering that exploits connections between the evolution of dynamical systems on graphs and the underlying graph spectra. This approach constitutes a new class of algorithms that combine emerging quantum and analog platforms to accelerate computations. Our hybrid algorithm is equivalent to spectral clustering and has a computational complexity of $O(N)$, where $N$ is the number of nodes in the graph, compared to $O(N^3)$ scaling on classical computing platforms. The proposed method employs the dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) framework on data generated by Schr\"{o}dinger dynamics embedded into the manifold generated by the graph Laplacian. We prove and demonstrate that one can extract the eigenvalues and scaled eigenvectors of the normalized graph Laplacian from quantum evolution on the graph by using DMD computations.</description>

      <title>Navigating Uncertainties in Machine Learning for Structural Dynamics: A Comprehensive Review of Probabilistic and Non-Probabilistic Approaches in Forward and Inverse Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the era of big data, machine learning (ML) has become a powerful tool in various fields, notably impacting structural dynamics. ML algorithms offer advantages by modeling physical phenomena based on data, even in the absence of underlying mechanisms. However, uncertainties such as measurement noise and modeling errors can compromise the reliability of ML predictions, highlighting the need for effective uncertainty awareness to enhance prediction robustness. This paper presents a comprehensive review on navigating uncertainties in ML, categorizing uncertainty-aware approaches into probabilistic methods (including Bayesian and frequentist perspectives) and non-probabilistic methods (such as interval learning and fuzzy learning). Bayesian neural networks, known for their uncertainty quantification and nonlinear mapping capabilities, are emphasized for their superior performance and potential. The review covers various techniques and methodologies for addressing uncertainties in ML, discussing fundamentals and implementation procedures of each method. While providing a concise overview of fundamental concepts, the paper refrains from in-depth critical explanations. Strengths and limitations of each approach are examined, along with their applications in structural dynamic forward problems like response prediction, sensitivity assessment, and reliability analysis, and inverse problems like system identification, model updating, and damage identification. Additionally, the review identifies research gaps and suggests future directions for investigations, aiming to provide comprehensive insights to the research community. By offering an extensive overview of both probabilistic and non-probabilistic approaches, this review aims to assist researchers and practitioners in making informed decisions when utilizing ML techniques to address uncertainties in structural dynamic problems.</description>

      <title>Splitting of Tensor Products and Intermediate Factor Theorem: Continuous Version</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08635v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a discrete group. Given unital $G$-$C^*$-algebras $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{B}$, we give an abstract condition under which every $G$-subalgebra $\mathcal{C}$ of the form $\mathcal{A}\subset \mathcal{C}\subset \mathcal{A}\otimes_{\text{min}}\mathcal{B}$ is a tensor product. This generalizes the well-known splitting results in the context of $C^*$-algebras by Zacharias and Zsido. As an application, we prove a topological version of the Intermediate Factor theorem. When a product group $G=\Gamma_1\times\Gamma_2$ acts (by a product action) on the product of corresponding $\Gamma_i$-boundaries $\partial\Gamma_i$, using the abstract condition, we show that every intermediate subalgebra $C(X)\subset\mathcal{C}\subset C(X)\otimes_{\text{min}}C(\partial\Gamma_1\times \partial\Gamma_2)$ is a tensor product (under some additional assumptions on $X$). This can be considered as a topological version of the Intermediate Factor theorem. We prove that our assumptions are necessary and cannot generally be relaxed. We also introduce the notion of a uniformly rigid action for $C^*$-algebras and use it to give various classes of inclusions $\mathcal{A}\subset \mathcal{A}\otimes_{\text{min}}\mathcal{B}$ for which every invariant intermediate algebra is a tensor product.</description>

      <title>A dichotomy for the Hofer growth of area preserving maps on the sphere via symmetrization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that autonomous Hamiltonian flows on the two-sphere exhibit the following dichotomy: the Hofer norm either grows linearly or is bounded in time by a universal constant C. Our approach involves a new technique, Hamiltonian symmetrization. Essentially, we prove that every autonomous Hamiltonian diffeomorphism is conjugate to an element C-close in the Hofer metric to one generated by a function of the height.</description>

Abstract: We study the dimension of the attractor and quasi-Bernoulli measures of parametrized families of iterated function systems of non-conformal and non-affine maps. We introduce a transversality condition under which, relying on a weak Ledrappier-Young formula, we show that the dimensions equal to the root of the subadditive pressure and the Lyapunov dimension, respectively, for almost every choice of parameters. We also exhibit concrete examples satisfying the transversality condition with respect to the translation parameters.</description>

      <title>Radial amplitude equations for fully localised planar patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02949v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Isolated patches of spatially oscillating pattern have been found to emerge near a pattern-forming instability in a wide variety of experiments and mathematical models. However, there is currently no mathematical theory to explain this emergence or characterise the structure of these patches. We provide a method for formally deriving radial amplitude equations to planar patterns via non-autonomous multiple-scale analysis and convolutional sums of products of Bessel functions. Our novel approach introduces nonautonomous differential operators, which allow for the systematic manipulation of Bessel functions, as well as previously unseen identities involving infinite sums of Bessel functions. Solutions of the amplitude equations describe fully localised patterns with non-trivial angular dependence, where localisation occurs in a purely radial direction. Amplitude equations are derived for multiple examples of patterns with dihedral symmetry, including fully localised hexagons and quasipatterns with twelve-fold rotational symmetry. In particular, we show how to apply the asymptotic method to the Swift--Hohenberg equation and general reaction-diffusion systems.</description>

      <title>Data-driven identification of latent port-Hamiltonian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08185v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conventional physics-based modeling techniques involve high effort, e.g., time and expert knowledge, while data-driven methods often lack interpretability, structure, and sometimes reliability. To mitigate this, we present a data-driven system identification framework that derives models in the port-Hamiltonian (pH) formulation. This formulation is suitable for multi-physical systems while guaranteeing the useful system theoretical properties of passivity and stability. Our framework combines linear and nonlinear reduction with structured, physics-motivated system identification. In this process, high-dimensional state data obtained from possibly nonlinear systems serves as input for an autoencoder, which then performs two tasks: (i) nonlinearly transforming and (ii) reducing this data onto a low-dimensional latent space. In this space, a linear pH system, that satisfies the pH properties per construction, is parameterized by the weights of a neural network. The mathematical requirements are met by defining the pH matrices through Cholesky factorizations. The neural networks that define the coordinate transformation and the pH system are identified in a joint optimization process to match the dynamics observed in the data while defining a linear pH system in the latent space. The learned, low-dimensional pH system can describe even nonlinear systems and is rapidly computable due to its small size. The method is exemplified by a parametric mass-spring-damper and a nonlinear pendulum example, as well as the high-dimensional model of a disc brake with linear thermoelastic behavior.</description>

      <title>Geodesic planes in a geometrically finite end and the halo of a measured lamination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.03937v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent works [MMO1, arXiv:1802.03853, arXiv:1802.04423, arXiv:2101.08956] have shed light on the topological behavior of geodesic planes in the convex core of a geometrically finite hyperbolic 3-manifolds $M$ of infinite volume. In this paper, we focus on the remaining case of geodesic planes outside the convex core of $M$, giving a complete classification of their closures in $M$.
  In particular, we show that the behavior is different depending on whether exotic roofs exist or not. Here an exotic roof is a geodesic plane contained in an end $E$ of $M$, which limits on the convex core boundary $\partial E$, but cannot be separated from the core by a support plane of $\partial E$.
  A necessary condition for the existence of exotic roofs is the existence of exotic rays for the bending lamination. Here an exotic ray is a geodesic ray that has finite intersection number with a measured lamination $\mathcal{L}$ but is not asymptotic to any leaf nor eventually disjoint from $\mathcal{L}$. We establish that exotic rays exist if and only if $\mathcal{L}$ is not a multicurve. The proof is constructive, and the ideas involved are important in the construction of exotic roofs.
  We also show that the existence of geodesic rays satisfying a stronger condition than being exotic, phrased in terms of only the hyperbolic surface $\partial E$ and the bending lamination, is sufficient for the existence of exotic roofs. As a result, we show that geometrically finite ends with exotic roofs exist in every genus. Moreover, in genus $1$, when the end is homotopic to a punctured torus, a generic one (in the sense of Baire category) contains uncountably many exotic roofs.</description>
