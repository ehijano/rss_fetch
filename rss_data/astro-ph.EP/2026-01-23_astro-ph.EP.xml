      <title>Perihelion Asymmetry in the Water Production Rate of the Interstellar Object 3I/ATLAS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3I/ATLAS is an interstellar object whose activity provides critical insights into its composition and origin. However, due to its orbital geometry, the object is too close to the Sun near perihelion to be observed from the ground, and space-based measurements are therefore required. Here we characterize the water production rate of 3I/ATLAS using SOHO/SWAN Lyman-$\alpha$ observations from 2025 November to December (heliocentric distances 1.4 to 2.2 au) with 3D Monte Carlo modeling. We report a peak post-perihelion water production rate of $Q_{\mathrm{H_2O}} \approx 4 \times 10^{28}$ mol s$^{-1}$, corresponding to a minimum active fraction of $\sim$30\% (assuming a maximum nucleus radius of 2.8 km). Comparison of our post-perihelion measurements with published pre-perihelion results reveals a heliocentric asymmetry, with an $r_h^{-5.9 \pm 0.8}$ scaling for the inbound rise, followed by a shallower $r_h^{-3.3 \pm 0.3}$ scaling during the outbound decline, where $r_h$ is heliocentric distance. The post-perihelion behavior indicates that the water production of 3I/ATLAS was driven primarily by the varying solar insolation acting on a stable active area. Combined with other evidence, including comparison with the hyperactive comet 103P/Hartley 2, our findings suggest that its water production is likely dominated by a distributed source of icy grains. Furthermore, it displayed remarkable stability in the activity with no signs of outbursts or rapid depletion of water production.</description>

      <title>Evidence for stellar contamination and water absorption in NGTS-5b's transmission spectra with GTC/OSIRIS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transmission spectroscopy serves as a valuable tool for probing atmospheric absorption features in the terminator regions of exoplanets. Stellar surface heterogeneity can introduce wavelength-dependent contamination that complicates the interpretation of planetary spectra. We aim to investigate the atmosphere of the warm sub-Saturn NGTS-5b through optical transmission spectroscopy. Two transits were observed with the low-resolution Optical System for Imaging and low-Intermediate-Resolution Integrated Spectroscopy (OSIRIS) on the 10.4 m Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC). Chromatic transit light curves were modeled to derive optical transmission spectra and multiple Bayesian spectral retrievals were performed to characterize the atmospheric properties. Model comparisons provide strong evidence for contamination from unocculted stellar spots. A joint retrieval of the transmission spectra, assuming equilibrium chemistry, indicates a relatively clear atmosphere with a sub-solar C/O ratio of $&lt;$0.22 (90% upper limit) and a low metallicity of $0.10^{+0.34}_{-0.05} \times$ solar. Retrievals assuming free chemistry yield strong evidence for the presence of $\rm H_2O$, with its abundance constrained to $\log X_{\mathrm{H_2O}} = -0.79^{+0.14}_{-0.17}$. However, the abundances of other species remain unconstrained due to the limited optical wavelength coverage. The discrepancies between the two NGTS-5b transit spectra can be attributed to varying levels of stellar contamination. NGTS-5b thus appears to host a relatively clear, water-rich atmosphere, pending confirmation from additional observations of molecular bands in the infrared.</description>

      <title>Hot and cloudy: High temperature clouds in super-Earths and sub-Neptunes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: JWST observations provide for the first time evidence for an atmosphere on a rocky exoplanet - 55 Cnc e. The atmosphere of 55 Cnc e is hot with $\text{T}_{\text{eq}}&gt;2000$K and shows strong variability, for which cloud formation above a molten crust could be one possible explanation. The composition of the atmosphere of 55 Cnc e is still unknown but suggests the presence of volatiles. We have run cloud formation models on a grid of N-dominated, O-dominated, C-dominated and H-dominated atmospheres to investigate which type of cloud we could expect on hot super-Earths and hot sub-Neptunes ($1000$K $&lt;$ T $&lt;$ $3000$K). Our models combine radiative transfer with equilibrium chemistry of the gaseous and condensed phases, vertical mixing of condensable species, sedimentation, nucleation and coagulation. We find that the condensability of species is highly dependent on the oxygen abundance of an atmosphere. Oxygen poor atmospheres can be heated by UV and optical absorbers PS, TiO and CN which create temperature inversions. These inhibit condensation. Oxygen rich atmospheres are colder without temperature inversions, and are therefore more favourable environments for cloud formation. The major expected cloud component in O-dominated atmospheres with solar refractory abundance is TiO$_2$(s). Spectral features of clouds in these worlds are stronger in transmission than in emission, in particular at short wavelengths. We find a lack of optical data of solid species in comparison to the variety of stable cloud components which can form on hot, rocky planets.</description>

      <title>A 2 au resolution view by ALMA of the planet-hosting WISPIT 2 disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present deep, high spatial resolution interferometric observations of 0.88 mm continuum emission from the TYC 5709-354-1 system, hereafter WISPIT 2, obtained with the goal of detecting circumplanetary emission in the vicinity of the newly discovered WISPIT 2b planet. Observations with the most extended baseline configuration offered by ALMA, achieving an angular resolution of $25 \times 17$ mas ($3.3 \times 2.2$ au), revealed a single, narrow ring with a deprojected radius of 144.4 au and width of 7.2 au, and no evidence of circumplanetary emission within the cavity. Injection and recovery tests demonstrate that these observations can rule out point-like emission at the location of WISPIT 2b brighter than $\approx 45$ $\mu$Jy at the $3\sigma$ level. While these data can rule out PDS 70c like circumplanetary emission, the upper limit is consistent with empirical mass-flux relationships extrapolated from the stellar regime. Visibility modeling of the continuum ring confirms that WISPIT 2b lies significantly interior to the mm dust ring, raising doubts about the ability of WISPIT 2b to be the only driver of the dust structure. Possible solutions include either another lower mass companion, residing between WISPIT 2b and the cavity edge, likely in the gap seen by SPHERE at $\sim130$ au, or that WISPIT 2b is either substantially more massive than IR-photometry based estimates ($\sim15$ $M_{\rm Jup}$) or on a moderately eccentric orbit. The combination of observations sensitive to the gas and dust distributions on larger spatial scales and dedicated hydrodynamical modeling will help differentiate between scenarios.</description>

      <title>Modeling the Impact of Unresolved Stellar Companions on Detection Sensitivity in Kepler's Small Planet Occurrence Rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unresolved stellar companions can cause both under-estimations in the radii of transiting planets and over-estimations of their detectability, affecting our ability to reliably measure planet occurrence rates. To quantify the latter, we identified a control sample of 198 Kepler stars with sensitivity to Earth-like planets if they were single stars, and imaged them with adaptive optics. In 20% of systems, we detected stellar companions that were close enough to go unresolved in Kepler observations. We calculated the distribution of planet radius correction factors needed to adjust for these observed companions, along with simulations of undetected companions to which our observations were not sensitive. We then used these correction factors to optimize an occurrence rate model for small close-in planets while correcting Kepler's detection efficiency for the presence of unresolved companions, and quantified how this correction affects occurrence estimates. Median occurrence rates for small planets between $2-100$ days increased by an average factor of $1.08-1.19$ (depending on statistical treatments), with the largest differences found for smaller planets at larger orbital periods. We found that the frequency of Earth-sized planets in the habitable zone ($\eta_\oplus$) increased by a factor of ${1.18}_{-0.66}^{+0.43}-{1.46}_{-0.83}^{+0.53}$ when accounting for the effect of unresolved companions on Kepler's detection sensitivity.</description>

      <title>Distance-Independent Atmospheric Refraction Correction for Accurate Retrieval of Fireball Trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate determination of fireball direction is essential for retrieving trajectories and velocities. Errors in these measurements have significant implications, affecting the calculated pre-impact orbit, influencing mass estimates, and impacting the accuracy of dark flight simulations, where applicable. Here we implement a new atmospheric refraction correction technique that addresses a significant aspect previously overlooked in the field of meteor science. Traditional refraction correction techniques, originally designed for objects positioned at infinite distances, tend to overcompensate when applied to objects within the Earth's atmosphere. To rectify this issue, our study introduces the concept of the atmospheric refraction delta z correction technique, involving the artificial elevation of the observer site height above sea level. We utilize analytically derived formulas for the delta z correction in conjunction with commonly used refraction models, validating these results against a numerical solution that traces light rays through the atmosphere. This ray-tracing model is applied to finely meshed atmospheric layers, yielding precise correction values. We evaluate multiple sources of error in order to quantify the achievable accuracy of the proposed method. Our approach (1) enables the determination of fireball positions with improved astrometric accuracy, (2) removes the explicit dependence on the fireball distance from the observer or its height above Earth's surface within the limits imposed by realistic atmospheric variability, and (3) simplifies meteor data processing by providing a robust framework for analyzing low-elevation fireball observations, for which atmospheric refraction is significant and is automatically corrected by the method. As a result of this work, we provide open, publicly accessible software for calculating the delta z correction.</description>

      <title>A multiwavelength ALMA view of gas and dust in binary protoplanetary system AS 205: Evidence of dust asymmetric distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16202v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array observations of multi-wavelength dust emissions at 3.1\,mm and 1.3\,mm; along with molecular line emissions of CO(2--1), CO(3--2), \mbox{$^{13}$CO(3--2)}, and C$^{18}$O(3--2) at spatial resolutions of 7--45 AU towards the protoplanetary system AS 205. The dust emissions exhibit two distinct components of AS 205 N and AS 205 S, separated by 1.3 arcsec. While gas kinematics within the dust disk regions are dominated by Keplerian rotation, the more extended gas emission displays complex morphology and kinematics strongly affected by the binary gravitational interaction in the outer regions. The stellar masses of AS 205 N and AS 205 S are estimated at $0.78\pm0.19$\,M$_\odot$ and $1.93\pm0.86$\,M$_\odot$, respectively. Azimuthal variation is observed in the spectral index distribution of both disks. In AS 205 N, the spectral index minimum in the southwest is coincident with the peaks of CO($2-1$), CO($3-2$), and $^{13}$CO($3-2$) integrated intensity and the relative position of its southern counterpart. On the other hand, the spectral index distribution in \ass~exhibits two prominent maxima, with the one in the northeast aligning with the peak of $^{13}$CO($3-2$), and the peak in the south coinciding with local maxima in CO($2-1$) and CO($3-2$) azimuthal profiles. These results suggest a correlation between dust grain size and/or optical depth with the gas distributions. Dust-trapping along the spiral arms possibly contributes to the spectral index minima in AS 205 N; however, the observed asymmetry across both disks suggests the involvement of additional mechanisms.</description>

      <title>NEOForCE: Near-Earth Objects' Forecast of Collisional Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25923v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Robust impact monitoring of near-Earth objects is an essential task of planetary defense. Current systems such as NASA's Sentry-II, the University of Pisa's CLOMON2, and ESA's Aegis have been highly successful, but independent approaches are essential to ensure reliability and to cross-validate predictions of possible impacts. We present NEOForCE (Near-Earth Objects' Forecast of Collisional Events), a new independent monitoring system for asteroid impact prediction. By relying on orbital solutions from DynAstVO at Paris Observatory and using an original methodology for uncertainty propagation, NEOForCE provides an alternative line of verification for impact assessments and strengthens the overall robustness of planetary defense. As other monitoring systems, NEOForCE samples several thousand virtual asteroids from the uncertainty region and integrates their orbits up to 100 years into the future. Instead of searching for close approaches of the virtual asteroids with the Earth, our system looks for times when the Earth comes close to the realistic uncertainty regions around them, which are mostly stretched along their osculating orbits. We also estimate the maximal impact probability, and only if this value is large enough do we continue to the next step. In this second step, we compute how the original asteroid orbit should be modified so that the new trajectory leads to an Earth impact, which allows us to confirm the possible collision and estimate the impact probability. We tested NEOForCE against NASA's Sentry-II system on five representative asteroids: 2000 SG344, 2005 QK76, 2008 JL3, 2023 DO and 2008 EX5. NEOForCE successfully recovered mostly all possible collisions reported by Sentry-II with impact probabilities above e-7, demonstrating the robustness of our approach. In addition, NEOForCE identified several potential impacts at the e-7 - e-6 level that Sentry-II did not report.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics of spherical dynamos exhibiting a small-scale MAC balance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21348v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the asymptotic behaviour of numerical dynamo models is critical for extrapolating results to the physical conditions that characterise terrestrial planetary cores. Here we investigate the behaviour of convection-driven dynamos reaching a MAC (magnetic-Archimedes-Coriolis) balance on the convective length scale and compare the results with non-magnetic convection cases. In particular, the dependence of physical quantities on the Ekman number, $Ek$, is studied in detail. The scaling of velocity dependent quantities is observed to be independent of the force balance and in agreement with quasi-geostrophic theory. The primary difference between dynamo and non-magnetic cases is that the fluctuating temperature is order unity in the former such that the buoyancy force scales with the Coriolis force. The MAC state yields a scaling for the flow speeds that is identical to the so-called CIA (Coriolis-inertia-Archimedes) scaling. There is an $O(Ek^{1/3})$ length scale present within the velocity field irrespective of the leading order force balance. This length scale is consistent with the asymptotic scaling of the terms of the governing equations and is not an indication that viscosity plays a dominant role. The peak of the kinetic energy spectrum and the ohmic dissipation length scale both exhibit an Ekman number dependence of approximately $Ek^{1/6}$, which is consistent with a scaling of $Rm^{-1/2}$, where $Rm$ is the magnetic Reynolds number. For the dynamos, advection remains comparable to, and scales similarly with, both inertia and viscosity, implying that nonlinear convective Rossby waves play an important role in the dynamics even in a MAC regime.</description>
