      <title>A Pointcloud Registration Framework for Relocalization in Subterranean Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relocalization, the process of re-establishing a robot's position within an environment, is crucial for ensuring accurate navigation and task execution when external positioning information, such as GPS, is unavailable or has been lost. Subterranean environments present significant challenges for relocalization due to limited external positioning information, poor lighting that affects camera localization, irregular and often non-distinct surfaces, and dust, which can introduce noise and occlusion in sensor data. In this work, we propose a robust, computationally friendly framework for relocalization through point cloud registration utilizing a prior point cloud map. The framework employs Intrinsic Shape Signatures (ISS) to select feature points in both the target and prior point clouds. The Fast Point Feature Histogram (FPFH) algorithm is utilized to create descriptors for these feature points, and matching these descriptors yields correspondences between the point clouds. A 3D transformation is estimated using the matched points, which initializes a Normal Distribution Transform (NDT) registration. The transformation result from NDT is further refined using the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) registration algorithm. This framework enhances registration accuracy even in challenging conditions, such as dust interference and significant initial transformations between the target and source, making it suitable for autonomous robots operating in underground mines and tunnels. This framework was validated with experiments in simulated and real-world mine datasets, demonstrating its potential for improving relocalization.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the Unscented Transform for Cooperative Localization with Ranging-Only Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cooperative localization in multi-agent robotic systems is challenging, especially when agents rely on limited information, such as only peer-to-peer range measurements. Two key challenges arise: utilizing this limited information to improve position estimation; handling uncertainties from sensor noise, nonlinearity, and unknown correlations between agents measurements; and avoiding information reuse. This paper examines the use of the Unscented Transform (UT) for state estimation for a case in which range measurement between agents and covariance intersection (CI) is used to handle unknown correlations. Unlike Kalman Filter approaches, CI methods fuse complete state and covariance estimates. This makes formulating a CI approach with ranging-only measurements a challenge. To overcome this, UT is used to handle uncertainties and formulate a cooperative state update using range measurements and current cooperative state estimates. This introduces information reuse in the measurement update. Therefore, this work aims to evaluate the limitations and utility of this formulation when faced with various levels of state measurement uncertainty and errors.</description>

      <title>Expectations, Explanations, and Embodiment: Attempts at Robot Failure Recovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Expectations critically shape how people form judgments about robots, influencing whether they view failures as minor technical glitches or deal-breaking flaws. This work explores how high and low expectations, induced through brief video priming, affect user perceptions of robot failures and the utility of explanations in HRI. We conducted two online studies ($N=600$ total participants); each replicated two robots with different embodiments, Furhat and Pepper. In our first study, grounded in expectation theory, participants were divided into two groups, one primed with positive and the other with negative expectations regarding the robot's performance, establishing distinct expectation frameworks. This validation study aimed to verify whether the videos could reliably establish low and high-expectation profiles. In the second study, participants were primed using the validated videos and then viewed a new scenario in which the robot failed at a task. Half viewed a version where the robot explained its failure, while the other half received no explanation. We found that explanations significantly improved user perceptions of Furhat, especially when participants were primed to have lower expectations. Explanations boosted satisfaction and enhanced the robot's perceived expressiveness, indicating that effectively communicating the cause of errors can help repair user trust. By contrast, Pepper's explanations produced minimal impact on user attitudes, suggesting that a robot's embodiment and style of interaction could determine whether explanations can successfully offset negative impressions. Together, these findings underscore the need to consider users' expectations when tailoring explanation strategies in HRI. When expectations are initially low, a cogent explanation can make the difference between dismissing a failure and appreciating the robot's transparency and effort to communicate.</description>

      <title>Bridging Deep Reinforcement Learning and Motion Planning for Model-Free Navigation in Cluttered Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has emerged as a powerful model-free paradigm for learning optimal policies. However, in real-world navigation tasks, DRL methods often suffer from insufficient exploration, particularly in cluttered environments with sparse rewards or complex dynamics under system disturbances. To address this challenge, we bridge general graph-based motion planning with DRL, enabling agents to explore cluttered spaces more effectively and achieve desired navigation performance. Specifically, we design a dense reward function grounded in a graph structure that spans the entire state space. This graph provides rich guidance, steering the agent toward optimal strategies. We validate our approach in challenging environments, demonstrating substantial improvements in exploration efficiency and task success rates.

      <title>Data-Enabled Neighboring Extremal: Case Study on Model-Free Trajectory Tracking for Robotic Arm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data-enabled predictive control (DeePC) has recently emerged as a powerful data-driven approach for efficient system controls with constraints handling capabilities. It performs optimal controls by directly harnessing input-output (I/O) data, bypassing the process of explicit model identification that can be costly and time-consuming. However, its high computational complexity, driven by a large-scale optimization problem (typically in a higher dimension than its model-based counterpart--Model Predictive Control), hinders real-time applications. To overcome this limitation, we propose the data-enabled neighboring extremal (DeeNE) framework, which significantly reduces computational cost while preserving control performance. DeeNE leverages first-order optimality perturbation analysis to efficiently update a precomputed nominal DeePC solution in response to changes in initial conditions and reference trajectories. We validate its effectiveness on a 7-DoF KINOVA Gen3 robotic arm, demonstrating substantial computational savings and robust, data-driven control performance.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Vision-Guided Robotic Arm Control for Precision Pruning in Dynamic Orchard Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a vision-guided robotic control system for automated fruit tree pruning applications. Traditional agricultural practices rely on labor-intensive tasks and processes that lack scalability and efficiency, creating a pressing need for automation research to address growing demands for higher crop yields, scalable operations, and reduced manual labor. To this end, this paper proposes a novel algorithm for robust and automated fruit pruning in dense orchards. The proposed algorithm utilizes CoTracker, that is designed to track 2D feature points in video sequences with significant robustness and accuracy, while leveraging joint attention mechanisms to account for inter-point dependencies, enabling robust and precise tracking under challenging and sophisticated conditions. To validate the efficacy of CoTracker, a Universal Robots manipulator UR5e is employed in a Gazebo simulation environment mounted on ClearPath Robotics Warthog robot featuring an Intel RealSense D435 camera. The system achieved a 93% success rate in pruning trials and with an average end trajectory error of 0.23 mm. The vision controller demonstrated robust performance in handling occlusions and maintaining stable trajectories as the arm move towards the target point. The results validate the effectiveness of integrating vision-based tracking with kinematic control for precision agricultural tasks. Future work will focus on real-world implementation and the integration of 3D reconstruction techniques for enhanced adaptability in dynamic environments.</description>

      <title>Drive in Corridors: Enhancing the Safety of End-to-end Autonomous Driving via Corridor Learning and Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Safety remains one of the most critical challenges in autonomous driving systems. In recent years, the end-to-end driving has shown great promise in advancing vehicle autonomy in a scalable manner. However, existing approaches often face safety risks due to the lack of explicit behavior constraints. To address this issue, we uncover a new paradigm by introducing the corridor as the intermediate representation. Widely adopted in robotics planning, the corridors represents spatio-temporal obstacle-free zones for the vehicle to traverse. To ensure accurate corridor prediction in diverse traffic scenarios, we develop a comprehensive learning pipeline including data annotation, architecture refinement and loss formulation. The predicted corridor is further integrated as the constraint in a trajectory optimization process. By extending the differentiability of the optimization, we enable the optimized trajectory to be seamlessly trained within the end-to-end learning framework, improving both safety and interpretability. Experimental results on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate state-of-the-art performance of our approach, showing a 66.7% reduction in collisions with agents and a 46.5% reduction with curbs, significantly enhancing the safety of end-to-end driving. Additionally, incorporating the corridor contributes to higher success rates in closed-loop evaluations.</description>

      <title>Efficient Swept Volume-Based Trajectory Generation for Arbitrary-Shaped Ground Robot Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Navigating an arbitrary-shaped ground robot safely in cluttered environments remains a challenging problem. The existing trajectory planners that account for the robot's physical geometry severely suffer from the intractable runtime. To achieve both computational efficiency and Continuous Collision Avoidance (CCA) of arbitrary-shaped ground robot planning, we proposed a novel coarse-to-fine navigation framework that significantly accelerates planning. In the first stage, a sampling-based method selectively generates distinct topological paths that guarantee a minimum inflated margin. In the second stage, a geometry-aware front-end strategy is designed to discretize these topologies into full-state robot motion sequences while concurrently partitioning the paths into SE(2) sub-problems and simpler R2 sub-problems for back-end optimization. In the final stage, an SVSDF-based optimizer generates trajectories tailored to these sub-problems and seamlessly splices them into a continuous final motion plan. Extensive benchmark comparisons show that the proposed method is one to several orders of magnitude faster than the cutting-edge methods in runtime while maintaining a high planning success rate and ensuring CCA.</description>

      <title>Learning Long Short-Term Intention within Human Daily Behaviors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the domain of autonomous household robots, it is of utmost importance for robots to understand human behaviors and provide appropriate services. This requires the robots to possess the capability to analyze complex human behaviors and predict the true intentions of humans. Traditionally, humans are perceived as flawless, with their decisions acting as the standards that robots should strive to align with. However, this raises a pertinent question: What if humans make mistakes? In this research, we present a unique task, termed "long short-term intention prediction". This task requires robots can predict the long-term intention of humans, which aligns with human values, and the short term intention of humans, which reflects the immediate action intention. Meanwhile, the robots need to detect the potential non-consistency between the short-term and long-term intentions, and provide necessary warnings and suggestions. To facilitate this task, we propose a long short-term intention model to represent the complex intention states, and build a dataset to train this intention model. Then we propose a two-stage method to integrate the intention model for robots: i) predicting human intentions of both value-based long-term intentions and action-based short-term intentions; and 2) analyzing the consistency between the long-term and short-term intentions. Experimental results indicate that the proposed long short-term intention model can assist robots in comprehending human behavioral patterns over both long-term and short-term durations, which helps determine the consistency between long-term and short-term intentions of humans.</description>

      <title>UWB Anchor Based Localization of a Planetary Rover</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Localization of an autonomous mobile robot during planetary exploration is challenging due to the unknown terrain, the difficult lighting conditions and the lack of any global reference such as satellite navigation systems. We present a novel approach for robot localization based on ultra-wideband (UWB) technology. The robot sets up its own reference coordinate system by distributing UWB anchor nodes in the environment via a rocket-propelled launcher system. This allows the creation of a localization space in which UWB measurements are employed to supplement traditional SLAM-based techniques. The system was developed for our involvement in the ESA-ESRIC challenge 2021 and the AMADEE-24, an analog Mars simulation in Armenia by the Austrian Space Forum (\"OWF).</description>

      <title>Localization Meets Uncertainty: Uncertainty-Aware Multi-Modal Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reliable localization is critical for robot navigation in complex indoor environments. In this paper, we propose an uncertainty-aware localization method that enhances the reliability of localization outputs without modifying the prediction model itself. This study introduces a percentile-based rejection strategy that filters out unreliable 3-DoF pose predictions based on aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties the network estimates. We apply this approach to a multi-modal end-to-end localization that fuses RGB images and 2D LiDAR data, and we evaluate it across three real-world datasets collected using a commercialized serving robot. Experimental results show that applying stricter uncertainty thresholds consistently improves pose accuracy. Specifically, the mean position error is reduced by 41.0%, 56.7%, and 69.4%, and the mean orientation error by 55.6%, 65.7%, and 73.3%, when applying 90%, 80%, and 70% thresholds, respectively. Furthermore, the rejection strategy effectively removes extreme outliers, resulting in better alignment with ground truth trajectories. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to quantitatively demonstrate the benefits of percentile-based uncertainty rejection in multi-modal end-to-end localization tasks. Our approach provides a practical means to enhance the reliability and accuracy of localization systems in real-world deployments.</description>

      <title>Sim-to-Real Transfer in Reinforcement Learning for Maneuver Control of a Variable-Pitch MAV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms can enable high-maneuverability in unmanned aerial vehicles (MAVs), but transferring them from simulation to real-world use is challenging. Variable-pitch propeller (VPP) MAVs offer greater agility, yet their complex dynamics complicate the sim-to-real transfer. This paper introduces a novel RL framework to overcome these challenges, enabling VPP MAVs to perform advanced aerial maneuvers in real-world settings. Our approach includes real-to-sim transfer techniques-such as system identification, domain randomization, and curriculum learning to create robust training simulations and a sim-to-real transfer strategy combining a cascade control system with a fast-response low-level controller for reliable deployment. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework in achieving zero-shot deployment, enabling MAVs to perform complex maneuvers such as flips and wall-backtracking.</description>

      <title>Transformer-Based Robust Underwater Inertial Navigation in Prolonged Doppler Velocity Log Outages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV) have a wide variety of applications in the marine domain, including exploration, surveying, and mapping. Their navigation systems rely heavily on fusing data from inertial sensors and a Doppler velocity log (DVL), typically via nonlinear filtering. The DVL estimates the AUV's velocity vector by transmitting acoustic beams to the seabed and analyzing the Doppler shift from the reflected signals. However, due to environmental challenges, DVL beams can deflect or fail in real-world settings, causing signal outages. In such cases, the AUV relies solely on inertial data, leading to accumulated navigation errors and mission terminations. To cope with these outages, we adopted ST-BeamsNet, a deep learning approach that uses inertial readings and prior DVL data to estimate AUV velocity during isolated outages. In this work, we extend ST-BeamsNet to address prolonged DVL outages and evaluate its impact within an extended Kalman filter framework. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework improves velocity RMSE by up to 63% and reduces final position error by up to 95% compared to pure inertial navigation. This is in scenarios involving up to 50 seconds of complete DVL outage.</description>

      <title>TOCALib: Optimal control library with interpolation for bimanual manipulation and obstacles avoidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper presents a new approach for constructing a library of optimal trajectories for two robotic manipulators, Two-Arm Optimal Control and Avoidance Library (TOCALib). The optimisation takes into account kinodynamic and other constraints within the FROST framework. The novelty of the method lies in the consideration of collisions using the DCOL method, which allows obtaining symbolic expressions for assessing the presence of collisions and using them in gradient-based optimization control methods. The proposed approach allowed the implementation of complex bimanual manipulations. In this paper we used Mobile Aloha as an example of TOCALib application. The approach can be extended to other bimanual robots, as well as to gait control of bipedal robots. It can also be used to construct training data for machine learning tasks for manipulation.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The flight time of multirotor unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is typically constrained by their high power consumption. Tethered power systems present a viable solution to extend flight times while maintaining the advantages of multirotor UAVs, such as hover capability and agility. This paper addresses the critical aspect of cable selection for tether-powered multirotor UAVs, considering both hover and forward flight. Existing research often overlooks the trade-offs between cable mass, power losses, and system constraints. We propose a novel methodology to optimize cable selection, accounting for thrust requirements and power efficiency across various flight conditions. The approach combines physics-informed modeling with system identification to combine hover and forward flight dynamics, incorporating factors such as motor efficiency, tether resistance, and aerodynamic drag. This work provides an intuitive and practical framework for optimizing tethered UAV designs, ensuring efficient power transmission and flight performance. Thus allowing for better, safer, and more efficient tethered drones.</description>

      <title>Experimental Analysis of Quadcopter Drone Hover Constraints for Localization Improvements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we evaluate the use of aerial drone hover constraints in a multisensor fusion of ground robot and drone data to improve the localization performance of a drone. In particular, we build upon our prior work on cooperative localization between an aerial drone and ground robot that fuses data from LiDAR, inertial navigation, peer-to-peer ranging, altimeter, and stereo-vision and evaluate the incorporation knowledge from the autopilot regarding when the drone is hovering. This control command data is leveraged to add constraints on the velocity state. Hover constraints can be considered important dynamic model information, such as the exploitation of zero-velocity updates in pedestrian navigation. We analyze the benefits of these constraints using an incremental factor graph optimization. Experimental data collected in a motion capture faculty is used to provide performance insights and assess the benefits of hover constraints.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we propose Echo, a novel joint-matching teleoperation system designed to enhance the collection of datasets for manual and bimanual tasks. Our system is specifically tailored for controlling the UR manipulator and features a custom controller with force feedback and adjustable sensitivity modes, enabling precise and intuitive operation. Additionally, Echo integrates a user-friendly dataset recording interface, simplifying the process of collecting high-quality training data for imitation learning. The system is designed to be reliable, cost-effective, and easily reproducible, making it an accessible tool for researchers, laboratories, and startups passionate about advancing robotics through imitation learning. Although the current implementation focuses on the UR manipulator, Echo architecture is reconfigurable and can be adapted to other manipulators and humanoid systems. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Echo through a series of experiments, showcasing its ability to perform complex bimanual tasks and its potential to accelerate research in the field.

      <description>arXiv:2504.07163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper deals with the multi-object detection and tracking problem, within the scope of open Radio Access Network (RAN), for collision avoidance in vehicular scenarios. To this end, a set of distributed intelligent agents collocated with cameras are considered. The fusion of detected objects is done at an edge service, considering Open RAN connectivity. Then, the edge service predicts the objects trajectories for collision avoidance. Compared to the related work a more realistic Open RAN network is implemented and multiple cameras are used.</description>

      <title>Personalized and Demand-Based Education Concept: Practical Tools for Control Engineers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a personalized lecture concept using educational blocks and its demonstrative application in a new university lecture. Higher education faces daily challenges: deep and specialized knowledge is available from everywhere and accessible to almost everyone. University lecturers of specialized master courses confront the problem that their lectures are either too boring or too complex for the attending students. Additionally, curricula are changing more rapidly than they have in the past 10-30 years. The German education system comprises different educational forms, with universities providing less practical content. Consequently, many university students do not obtain the practical skills they should ideally gain through university lectures. Therefore, in this work, a new lecture concept is proposed based on the extension of the just-in-time teaching paradigm: Personalized and Demand-Based Education. This concept includes: 1) an initial assessment of students' backgrounds, 2) selecting the appropriate educational blocks, and 3) collecting ongoing feedback during the semester. The feedback was gathered via Pingo, ensuring anonymity for the students. Our concept was exemplarily tested in the new lecture "Practical Tools for Control Engineers" at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology. The initial results indicate that our proposed concept could be beneficial in addressing the current challenges in higher education.</description>

      <title>Joint Travel Route Optimization Framework for Platooning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07623v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Platooning represents an advanced driving technology designed to assist drivers in traffic convoys of varying lengths, enhancing road safety, reducing driver fatigue, and improving fuel efficiency. Sophisticated automated driving assistance systems have facilitated this innovation. Recent advancements in platooning emphasize cooperative mechanisms within both centralized and decentralized architectures enabled by vehicular communication technologies. This study introduces a cooperative route planning optimization framework aimed at promoting the adoption of platooning through a centralized platoon formation strategy at the system level. This approach is envisioned as a transitional phase from individual (ego) driving to fully collaborative driving. Additionally, this research formulates and incorporates travel cost metrics related to fuel consumption, driver fatigue, and travel time, considering regulatory constraints on consecutive driving durations. The performance of these cost metrics has been evaluated using Dijkstra's and A* shortest path algorithms within a network graph framework. The results indicate that the proposed architecture achieves an average cost improvement of 14 % compared to individual route planning for long road trips.</description>

      <title>Fast Adaptation with Behavioral Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07896v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unsupervised zero-shot reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for pretraining behavioral foundation models (BFMs), enabling agents to solve a wide range of downstream tasks specified via reward functions in a zero-shot fashion, i.e., without additional test-time learning or planning. This is achieved by learning self-supervised task embeddings alongside corresponding near-optimal behaviors and incorporating an inference procedure to directly retrieve the latent task embedding and associated policy for any given reward function. Despite promising results, zero-shot policies are often suboptimal due to errors induced by the unsupervised training process, the embedding, and the inference procedure. In this paper, we focus on devising fast adaptation strategies to improve the zero-shot performance of BFMs in a few steps of online interaction with the environment while avoiding any performance drop during the adaptation process. Notably, we demonstrate that existing BFMs learn a set of skills containing more performant policies than those identified by their inference procedure, making them well-suited for fast adaptation. Motivated by this observation, we propose both actor-critic and actor-only fast adaptation strategies that search in the low-dimensional task-embedding space of the pre-trained BFM to rapidly improve the performance of its zero-shot policies on any downstream task. Notably, our approach mitigates the initial "unlearning" phase commonly observed when fine-tuning pre-trained RL models. We evaluate our fast adaptation strategies on top of four state-of-the-art zero-shot RL methods in multiple navigation and locomotion domains. Our results show that they achieve 10-40% improvement over their zero-shot performance in a few tens of episodes, outperforming existing baselines.</description>

      <title>Optimal Robot Formations: Balancing Range-Based Observability and User-Defined Configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00988v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a set of customizable and novel cost functions that enable the user to easily specify desirable robot formations, such as a ``high-coverage'' infrastructure-inspection formation, while maintaining high relative pose estimation accuracy. The overall cost function balances the need for the robots to be close together for good ranging-based relative localization accuracy and the need for the robots to achieve specific tasks, such as minimizing the time taken to inspect a given area. The formations found by minimizing the aggregated cost function are evaluated in a coverage path planning task in simulation and experiment, where the robots localize themselves and unknown landmarks using a simultaneous localization and mapping algorithm based on the extended Kalman filter. Compared to an optimal formation that maximizes ranging-based relative localization accuracy, these formations significantly reduce the time to cover a given area with minimal impact on relative pose estimation accuracy.</description>

      <title>ChatEMG: Synthetic Data Generation to Control a Robotic Hand Orthosis for Stroke</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12123v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Intent inferral on a hand orthosis for stroke patients is challenging due to the difficulty of data collection. Additionally, EMG signals exhibit significant variations across different conditions, sessions, and subjects, making it hard for classifiers to generalize. Traditional approaches require a large labeled dataset from the new condition, session, or subject to train intent classifiers; however, this data collection process is burdensome and time-consuming. In this paper, we propose ChatEMG, an autoregressive generative model that can generate synthetic EMG signals conditioned on prompts (i.e., a given sequence of EMG signals). ChatEMG enables us to collect only a small dataset from the new condition, session, or subject and expand it with synthetic samples conditioned on prompts from this new context. ChatEMG leverages a vast repository of previous data via generative training while still remaining context-specific via prompting. Our experiments show that these synthetic samples are classifier-agnostic and can improve intent inferral accuracy for different types of classifiers. We demonstrate that our complete approach can be integrated into a single patient session, including the use of the classifier for functional orthosis-assisted tasks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time an intent classifier trained partially on synthetic data has been deployed for functional control of an orthosis by a stroke survivor.

      <title>Execution Semantics of Behavior Trees in Robotic Applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00090v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Behavior Trees (BTs) have found a widespread adoption in robotics due to appealing features, their ease of use as a conceptual model of control policies and the availability of software tooling for BT-based design of control software. However, BTs don't have formal execution semantics and, furthermore, subtle differences among implementations can make the same model behave differently depending on the underlying software. This paper aims at defining the execution semantics of behavior trees (BTs) as used in robotics applications. To this purpose, we present an abstract data type that formalizes the structure and execution of BTs. While our formalization is inspired by existing contributions in the scientific literature and state-of-the art implementations, we strive to provide an unambiguous treatment of most features that find incomplete or inconsistent treatment across other works.</description>

      <title>SigmaRL: A Sample-Efficient and Generalizable Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Framework for Motion Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07644v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces an open-source, decentralized framework named SigmaRL, designed to enhance both sample efficiency and generalization of multi-agent Reinforcement Learning (RL) for motion planning of connected and automated vehicles. Most RL agents exhibit a limited capacity to generalize, often focusing narrowly on specific scenarios, and are usually evaluated in similar or even the same scenarios seen during training. Various methods have been proposed to address these challenges, including experience replay and regularization. However, how observation design in RL affects sample efficiency and generalization remains an under-explored area. We address this gap by proposing five strategies to design information-dense observations, focusing on general features that are applicable to most traffic scenarios. We train our RL agents using these strategies on an intersection and evaluate their generalization through numerical experiments across completely unseen traffic scenarios, including a new intersection, an on-ramp, and a roundabout. Incorporating these information-dense observations reduces training times to under one hour on a single CPU, and the evaluation results reveal that our RL agents can effectively zero-shot generalize.

      <title>A Fast and Model Based Approach for Evaluating Task-Competence of Antagonistic Continuum Arms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00241v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Soft robot arms have made significant progress towards completing human-scale tasks, but designing arms for tasks with specific load and workspace requirements remains difficult. A key challenge is the lack of model-based design tools, forcing advancement to occur through empirical iteration and observation. Existing models are focused on control and rely on parameter fits, which means they cannot provide general conclusions about the mapping between design and performance or the influence of factors outside the fitting data.As a first step toward model-based design tools, we introduce a novel method of analyzing whether a proposed arm design can complete desired tasks. Our method is informative, interpretable, and fast; it provides novel metrics for quantifying a proposed arm design's ability to perform a task, it yields a graphical interpretation of performance through segment forces, and computing it is over 80x faster than optimization based methods.Our formulation focuses on antagonistic, pneumatically-driven soft arms. We demonstrate our approach through example analysis, and also through consideration of antagonistic vs non-antagonistic designs. Our method enables fast, direct and task-specific comparison of these two architectures, and provides a new visualization of the comparative mechanics. While only a first step, the proposed approach will support advancement of model-based design tools, leading to highly capable soft arms.</description>

      <title>SuperQ-GRASP: Superquadrics-based Grasp Pose Estimation on Larger Objects for Mobile-Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04386v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Grasp planning and estimation have been a longstanding research problem in robotics, with two main approaches to find graspable poses on the objects: 1) geometric approach, which relies on 3D models of objects and the gripper to estimate valid grasp poses, and 2) data-driven, learning-based approach, with models trained to identify grasp poses from raw sensor observations. The latter assumes comprehensive geometric coverage during the training phase. However, the data-driven approach is typically biased toward tabletop scenarios and struggle to generalize to out-of-distribution scenarios with larger objects (e.g. chair). Additionally, raw sensor data (e.g. RGB-D data) from a single view of these larger objects is often incomplete and necessitates additional observations. In this paper, we take a geometric approach, leveraging advancements in object modeling (e.g. NeRF) to build an implicit model by taking RGB images from views around the target object. This model enables the extraction of explicit mesh model while also capturing the visual appearance from novel viewpoints that is useful for perception tasks like object detection and pose estimation. We further decompose the NeRF-reconstructed 3D mesh into superquadrics (SQs) -- parametric geometric primitives, each mapped to a set of precomputed grasp poses, allowing grasp composition on the target object based on these primitives. Our proposed pipeline overcomes the problems: a) noisy depth and incomplete view of the object, with a modeling step, and b) generalization to objects of any size.

      <title>Trajectory Optimization Under Stochastic Dynamics Leveraging Maximum Mean Discrepancy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19045v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses sampling-based trajectory optimization for risk-aware navigation under stochastic dynamics. Typically such approaches operate by computing $\tilde{N}$ perturbed rollouts around the nominal dynamics to estimate the collision risk associated with a sequence of control commands. We consider a setting where it is expensive to estimate risk using perturbed rollouts, for example, due to expensive collision-checks. We put forward two key contributions. First, we develop an algorithm that distills the statistical information from a larger set of rollouts to a reduced-set with sample size $N&lt;&lt;\tilde{N}$. Consequently, we estimate collision risk using just $N$ rollouts instead of $\tilde{N}$. Second, we formulate a novel surrogate for the collision risk that can leverage the distilled statistical information contained in the reduced-set. We formalize both algorithmic contributions using distribution embedding in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) and Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD). We perform extensive benchmarking to demonstrate that our MMD-based approach leads to safer trajectories at low sample regime than existing baselines using Conditional Value-at Risk (CVaR) based collision risk estimate.</description>

Abstract: Intercepting dynamic objects in uncertain environments involves a significant unresolved challenge in modern robotic systems. Current control approaches rely solely on estimated information, and results lack guarantees of robustness and feasibility. In this work, we introduce a novel method to tackle the interception of targets whose motion is affected by known and bounded uncertainty. Our approach introduces new techniques of reachability analysis for rigid bodies, leveraged to guarantee feasibility of interception under uncertain conditions. We then propose a Reachability-Guaranteed Optimal Control Problem, ensuring robustness and guaranteed reachability to a target set of configurations. We demonstrate the methodology in the case study of an interception maneuver of a tumbling target in space.</description>

Abstract: Motion Cueing Algorithms (MCAs) encode the movement of simulated vehicles into movement that can be reproduced with a motion simulator to provide a realistic driving experience within the capabilities of the machine. This paper introduces a novel learning-based MCA for serial robot-based motion simulators. Building on the differentiable predictive control framework, the proposed method merges the advantages of Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) - notably nonlinear constraint handling and accurate kinematic modeling - with the computational efficiency of machine learning. By shifting the computational burden to offline training, the new algorithm enables real-time operation at high control rates, thus overcoming the key challenge associated with NMPC-based motion cueing. The proposed MCA incorporates a nonlinear joint-space plant model and a policy network trained to mimic NMPC behavior while accounting for joint acceleration, velocity, and position limits. Simulation experiments across multiple motion cueing scenarios showed that the proposed algorithm performed on par with a state-of-the-art NMPC-based alternative in terms of motion cueing quality as quantified by the RMSE and correlation coefficient with respect to reference signals. However, the proposed algorithm was on average 400 times faster than the NMPC baseline. In addition, the algorithm successfully generalized to unseen operating conditions, including motion cueing scenarios on a different vehicle and real-time physics-based simulations.</description>

      <title>Information Gain Is Not All You Need</title>

Abstract: Autonomous exploration in mobile robotics is driven by two competing objectives: coverage, to exhaustively observe the environment; and path length, to do so with the shortest path possible. Though it is difficult to evaluate the best course of action without knowing the unknown, the unknown can often be understood through models, maps, or common sense. However, previous work has shown that improving estimates of information gain through such prior knowledge leads to greedy behavior and ultimately causes backtracking, which degrades coverage performance. In fact, any information gain maximization will exhibit this behavior, even without prior knowledge. Information gained at task completion is constant, and cannot be maximized for. It is therefore an unsuitable choice as an optimization objective. Instead, information gain is a decision criterion for determining which candidate states should still be considered for exploration. The task therefore becomes to reach completion with the shortest total path. Since determining the shortest path is typically intractable, it is necessary to rely on a heuristic or estimate to identify candidate states that minimize the total path length. To address this, we propose a heuristic that reduces backtracking by preferring candidate states that are close to the robot, but far away from other candidate states. We evaluate the performance of the proposed heuristic in simulation against an information gain-based approach and frontier exploration, and show that our method significantly decreases total path length, both with and without prior knowledge of the environment.</description>

      <title>CORTEX-AVD: A Framework for CORner Case Testing and EXploration in Autonomous Vehicle Development</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03989v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) aim to improve traffic safety and efficiency by reducing human error. However, ensuring AVs reliability and safety is a challenging task when rare, high-risk traffic scenarios are considered. These 'Corner Cases' (CC) scenarios, such as unexpected vehicle maneuvers or sudden pedestrian crossings, must be safely and reliable dealt by AVs during their operations. But they arehard to be efficiently generated. Traditional CC generation relies on costly and risky real-world data acquisition, limiting scalability, and slowing research and development progress. Simulation-based techniques also face challenges, as modeling diverse scenarios and capturing all possible CCs is complex and time-consuming. To address these limitations in CC generation, this research introduces CORTEX-AVD, CORner Case Testing &amp; EXploration for Autonomous Vehicles Development, an open-source framework that integrates the CARLA Simulator and Scenic to automatically generate CC from textual descriptions, increasing the diversity and automation of scenario modeling. Genetic Algorithms (GA) are used to optimize the scenario parameters in six case study scenarios, increasing the occurrence of high-risk events. Unlike previous methods, CORTEX-AVD incorporates a multi-factor fitness function that considers variables such as distance, time, speed, and collision likelihood. Additionally, the study provides a benchmark for comparing GA-based CC generation methods, contributing to a more standardized evaluation of synthetic data generation and scenario assessment. Experimental results demonstrate that the CORTEX-AVD framework significantly increases CC incidence while reducing the proportion of wasted simulations.</description>

      <title>A Convex and Global Solution for the P$n$P Problem in 2D Forward-Looking Sonar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04445v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The perspective-$n$-point (P$n$P) problem is important for robotic pose estimation. It is well studied for optical cameras, but research is lacking for 2D forward-looking sonar (FLS) in underwater scenarios due to the vastly different imaging principles. In this paper, we demonstrate that, despite the nonlinearity inherent in sonar image formation, the P$n$P problem for 2D FLS can still be effectively addressed within a point-to-line (PtL) 3D registration paradigm through orthographic approximation. The registration is then resolved by a duality-based optimal solver, ensuring the global optimality. For coplanar cases, a null space analysis is conducted to retrieve the solutions from the dual formulation, enabling the methods to be applied to more general cases. Extensive simulations have been conducted to systematically evaluate the performance under different settings. Compared to non-reprojection-optimized state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, the proposed approach achieves significantly higher precision. When both methods are optimized, ours demonstrates comparable or slightly superior precision.</description>

      <title>Extended URDF: Accounting for parallel mechanism in robot description</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04767v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Robotic designs played an important role in recent advances by providing powerful robots with complex mechanics. Many recent systems rely on parallel actuation to provide lighter limbs and allow more complex motion. However, these emerging architectures fall outside the scope of most used description formats, leading to difficulties when designing, storing, and sharing the models of these systems. This paper introduces an extension to the widely used Unified Robot Description Format (URDF) to support closed-loop kinematic structures. Our approach relies on augmenting URDF with minimal additional information to allow more efficient modeling of complex robotic systems while maintaining compatibility with existing design and simulation frameworks. This method sets the basic requirement for a description format to handle parallel mechanisms efficiently. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach by providing an open-source collection of parallel robots, along with tools for generating and parsing this extended description format. The proposed extension simplifies robot modeling, reduces redundancy, and improves usability for advanced robotic applications.</description>

      <title>ASHiTA: Automatic Scene-grounded HIerarchical Task Analysis</title>

Abstract: While recent work in scene reconstruction and understanding has made strides in grounding natural language to physical 3D environments, it is still challenging to ground abstract, high-level instructions to a 3D scene. High-level instructions might not explicitly invoke semantic elements in the scene, and even the process of breaking a high-level task into a set of more concrete subtasks, a process called hierarchical task analysis, is environment-dependent. In this work, we propose ASHiTA, the first framework that generates a task hierarchy grounded to a 3D scene graph by breaking down high-level tasks into grounded subtasks. ASHiTA alternates LLM-assisted hierarchical task analysis, to generate the task breakdown, with task-driven 3D scene graph construction to generate a suitable representation of the environment. Our experiments show that ASHiTA performs significantly better than LLM baselines in breaking down high-level tasks into environment-dependent subtasks and is additionally able to achieve grounding performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Drama: Mamba-Enabled Model-Based Reinforcement Learning Is Sample and Parameter Efficient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08893v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Model-based reinforcement learning (RL) offers a solution to the data inefficiency that plagues most model-free RL algorithms. However, learning a robust world model often requires complex and deep architectures, which are computationally expensive and challenging to train. Within the world model, sequence models play a critical role in accurate predictions, and various architectures have been explored, each with its own challenges. Currently, recurrent neural network (RNN)-based world models struggle with vanishing gradients and capturing long-term dependencies. Transformers, on the other hand, suffer from the quadratic memory and computational complexity of self-attention mechanisms, scaling as $O(n^2)$, where $n$ is the sequence length.
  To address these challenges, we propose a state space model (SSM)-based world model, Drama, specifically leveraging Mamba, that achieves $O(n)$ memory and computational complexity while effectively capturing long-term dependencies and enabling efficient training with longer sequences. We also introduce a novel sampling method to mitigate the suboptimality caused by an incorrect world model in the early training stages. Combining these techniques, Drama achieves a normalised score on the Atari100k benchmark that is competitive with other state-of-the-art (SOTA) model-based RL algorithms, using only a 7 million-parameter world model. Drama is accessible and trainable on off-the-shelf hardware, such as a standard laptop. Our code is available at https://github.com/realwenlongwang/Drama.git.</description>

      <title>DiffusionDrive: Truncated Diffusion Model for End-to-End Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15139v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, the diffusion model has emerged as a powerful generative technique for robotic policy learning, capable of modeling multi-mode action distributions. Leveraging its capability for end-to-end autonomous driving is a promising direction. However, the numerous denoising steps in the robotic diffusion policy and the more dynamic, open-world nature of traffic scenes pose substantial challenges for generating diverse driving actions at a real-time speed. To address these challenges, we propose a novel truncated diffusion policy that incorporates prior multi-mode anchors and truncates the diffusion schedule, enabling the model to learn denoising from anchored Gaussian distribution to the multi-mode driving action distribution. Additionally, we design an efficient cascade diffusion decoder for enhanced interaction with conditional scene context. The proposed model, DiffusionDrive, demonstrates 10$\times$ reduction in denoising steps compared to vanilla diffusion policy, delivering superior diversity and quality in just 2 steps. On the planning-oriented NAVSIM dataset, with the aligned ResNet-34 backbone, DiffusionDrive achieves 88.1 PDMS without bells and whistles, setting a new record, while running at a real-time speed of 45 FPS on an NVIDIA 4090. Qualitative results on challenging scenarios further confirm that DiffusionDrive can robustly generate diverse plausible driving actions. Code and model will be available at https://github.com/hustvl/DiffusionDrive.</description>

      <title>Geometry-aware RL for Manipulation of Varying Shapes and Deformable Objects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07005v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Manipulating objects with varying geometries and deformable objects is a major challenge in robotics. Tasks such as insertion with different objects or cloth hanging require precise control and effective modelling of complex dynamics. In this work, we frame this problem through the lens of a heterogeneous graph that comprises smaller sub-graphs, such as actuators and objects, accompanied by different edge types describing their interactions. This graph representation serves as a unified structure for both rigid and deformable objects tasks, and can be extended further to tasks comprising multiple actuators. To evaluate this setup, we present a novel and challenging reinforcement learning benchmark, including rigid insertion of diverse objects, as well as rope and cloth manipulation with multiple end-effectors. These tasks present a large search space, as both the initial and target configurations are uniformly sampled in 3D space. To address this issue, we propose a novel graph-based policy model, dubbed Heterogeneous Equivariant Policy (HEPi), utilizing $SE(3)$ equivariant message passing networks as the main backbone to exploit the geometric symmetry. In addition, by modeling explicit heterogeneity, HEPi can outperform Transformer-based and non-heterogeneous equivariant policies in terms of average returns, sample efficiency, and generalization to unseen objects. Our project page is available at https://thobotics.github.io/hepi.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Human-Robot Interaction in Healthcare: A Study on Nonverbal Communication Cues and Trust Dynamics with NAO Robot Caregivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16469v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As the population of older adults increases, so will the need for both human and robot care providers. While traditional practices involve hiring human caregivers to serve meals and attend to basic needs, older adults often require continuous companionship and health monitoring. However, hiring human caregivers for this job costs a lot of money. However, using a robot like Nao could be cheaper and still helpful. This study explores the integration of humanoid robots, particularly Nao, in health monitoring and caregiving for older adults. Using a mixed-methods approach with a within-subject factorial design, we investigated the effectiveness of nonverbal communication modalities, including touch, gestures, and LED patterns, in enhancing human-robot interactions. Our results indicate that Nao's touch-based health monitoring was well-received by participants, with positive ratings across various dimensions. LED patterns were perceived as more effective and accurate compared to hand and head gestures. Moreover, longer interactions were associated with higher trust levels and perceived empathy, highlighting the importance of prolonged engagement in fostering trust in human-robot interactions. Despite limitations, our study contributes valuable insights into the potential of humanoid robots to improve health monitoring and caregiving for older adults.</description>

      <title>SGFormer: Satellite-Ground Fusion for 3D Semantic Scene Completion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16825v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, camera-based solutions have been extensively explored for scene semantic completion (SSC). Despite their success in visible areas, existing methods struggle to capture complete scene semantics due to frequent visual occlusions. To address this limitation, this paper presents the first satellite-ground cooperative SSC framework, i.e., SGFormer, exploring the potential of satellite-ground image pairs in the SSC task. Specifically, we propose a dual-branch architecture that encodes orthogonal satellite and ground views in parallel, unifying them into a common domain. Additionally, we design a ground-view guidance strategy that corrects satellite image biases during feature encoding, addressing misalignment between satellite and ground views. Moreover, we develop an adaptive weighting strategy that balances contributions from satellite and ground views. Experiments demonstrate that SGFormer outperforms the state of the art on SemanticKITTI and SSCBench-KITTI-360 datasets. Our code is available on https://github.com/gxytcrc/SGFormer.</description>
