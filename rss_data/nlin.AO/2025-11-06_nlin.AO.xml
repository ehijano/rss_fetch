      <title>Symmetry-induced activity patterns of active-inactive clusters in complex networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present activity patterns consisting of active and inactive clusters of synchronized nodes in networks. We call a cluster active if nodes in it have nonzero velocity and inactive vice versa. The simultaneous invariance of active and inactive clusters poses a challenge because fluctuations from active clusters must cancel out for a desired cluster to be inactive. With the help of permutation symmetries in network topology and selecting dynamics on top such that internal dynamics and coupling functions are odd functions in the phase space, we demonstrate that such a combination of structure and dynamics exhibits (stable) invariant patterns consisting of active and inactive clusters. Symmetry breaking of synchronized clusters creates active clusters that are in antisynchrony with each other, resulting in the cancellation of fluctuations for clusters connected with these antisynchronous clusters. Furthermore, as the coupling between nodes changes, active clusters lose their activity at different coupling values, and the network transitions from one activity pattern to another. Numerical simulations have been presented for networks of Van der Pol and Stuart-Landau oscillators. We extend the master stability approach to these patterns and provide stability conditions for their existence.</description>

      <title>Mean-field approach to finite-size fluctuations in the Kuramoto-Sakaguchi model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop an ab initio approach to describe the statistical behavior of finite-size fluctuations in the Kuramoto-Sakaguchi model. We obtain explicit expressions for the covariance function of fluctuations of the complex order parameter and determine the variance of its magnitude entirely in terms of the equation parameters. Our results rely on an explicit complex-valued formula for solutions of the Adler equation. We present analytical results for both the sub- and the super-critical case. Moreover, our framework does not require any prior knowledge about the structure of the partially synchronized state. We corroborate our results with numerical simulations of the full Kuramoto-Sakaguchi model. The proposed methodology is sufficiently general such that it can be applied to other interacting particle systems.</description>

      <title>Emergent Topology of Optimal Networks for Synchrony</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18279v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Real-world networks, whether shaped by evolution or intelligent design, are typically optimized for functionality while adhering to physical, geometric, or budget constraints. Yet tools to identify such structures remain limited. We develop a gradient-based optimization framework to identify synchrony-optimal weighted networks under a constrained coupling budget. The resulting networks exhibit counterintuitive features: they are sparse, bipartite, elongated, and extremely monophilic (i.e., the neighbors of any node are similar to one another while differing from the node itself). These findings are matched by "constructive" theory: a nonlinear differential equation identifies which pairs of nodes are coupled, while a variational principle prescribes the budget allocated to each node. Dynamics unfolding over optimal networks provably lack a synchronization threshold; instead, as the budget exceeds a calculable critical value, the system globally phase-locks, exhibiting critical scaling at the transition. Our results have implications for power grids, neuromorphic computing, and other coupled oscillator technologies.</description>

      <title>Untapped Potential in Self-Optimization of Hopfield Networks: The Creativity of Unsupervised Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04007v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Self-Optimization (SO) model can be considered as the third operational mode of the classical Hopfield Network, leveraging the power of associative memory to enhance optimization performance. Moreover, it has been argued to express characteristics of minimal agency, which renders it useful for the study of artificial life. In this article, we draw attention to another facet of the SO model: its capacity for creativity. Drawing on creativity studies, we argue that the model satisfies the necessary and sufficient conditions of a creative process. Moreover, we show that learning is needed to find creative outcomes above chance probability. Furthermore, we demonstrate that modifying the learning parameters in the SO model gives rise to four different regimes that can account for both creative products and inconclusive outcomes, thus providing a framework for studying and understanding the emergence of creative behaviors in artificial systems that learn.</description>

      <title>Quantization of nonlinear non-Hamiltonian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06939v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Several important dynamical systems are in $\mathbb{R}^2$, defined by the pair of differential equations $(x',y')=(f(x,y),g(x,y))$. A question of fundamental importance is how such systems might behave quantum mechanically. In developing quantum theory, Dirac and others realized that classical Hamiltonian systems can be mapped to their quantum counterparts via canonical quantization. The resulting quantum dynamics is always physical, characterized by completely-positive and trace-preserving evolutions in the Schr\"{o}dinger picture. However, whether non-Hamiltonian systems can be quantized systematically while respecting the same physical requirements has remained a long-standing problem. Here we resolve this question when $f(x,y)$ and $g(x,y)$ are arbitrary polynomials. By leveraging open-systems theory, we prove constructively that every polynomial system admits a physical generator of time evolution in the form of a Lindbladian. We call our method cascade quantization, and demonstrate its power by analyzing several paradigmatic examples of nonlinear dynamics such as bifurcations, noise-activated spiking, and Li\'{e}nard systems. In effect, our method can quantize any classical system whose $f(x,y)$ and $g(x,y)$ are analytic with arbitrary precision. More importantly, cascade quantization is exact. This means restrictive system properties usually assumed in the literature to facilitate quantization, such as weak nonlinearity, rotational symmetry, or semiclassical dynamics, can all be dispensed with by cascade quantization. We also highlight the advantages of cascade quantization over existing proposals, by weighing it against examples from the variational paradigm using Lagrangians, as well as non-variational approaches.</description>

      <title>Anomalous grain dynamics and grain locomotion of odd crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03957v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Crystalline or polycrystalline systems governed by odd elastic responses are known to exhibit complex dynamical behaviors involving self-propelled dynamics of topological defects with spontaneous self-rotation of chiral crystallites. Unveiling and controlling the underlying mechanisms require studies across multiple scales. We develop such a type of approach that bridges between microscopic and mesoscopic scales, in the form of a phase field crystal model incorporating transverse interactions. This continuum density field theory features two-dimensional parity symmetry breaking and odd elasticity, and generates a variety of interesting phenomena that agree well with recent experiments and particle-based simulations of active and living chiral crystals, including self-rotating crystallites, dislocation self-propulsion and proliferation, and fragmentation in polycrystals. We identify a distinct type of surface cusp instability induced by self-generated surface odd stress that results in self-fission of single-crystalline grains. This mechanism is pivotal for the occurrence of various anomalous grain dynamics for odd crystals, particularly the predictions of a transition from normal to reverse Ostwald ripening for self-rotating odd grains, and a transition from grain coarsening to grain self-fragmentation in the dynamical polycrystalline state with an increase of transverse interaction strength. We also demonstrate that the single-grain dynamics can be maneuvered through the variation of interparticle transverse interactions. This allows to steer the desired pathway of grain locomotion and to control the transition between grain self-rotation, self-rolling, and self-translation. Our results provide insights for the design and control of structural and dynamical properties of active odd elastic materials.</description>
