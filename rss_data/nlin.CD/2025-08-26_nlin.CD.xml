      <title>Causal Dynamic Resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Natural dynamical systems, including the brain and climate, are highly nonlinear and complex. Determining information flow among the components that make up these dynamical systems is challenging. If the components are the result of a common process or become synchronized, causality measures typically fail, including Cross-Dynamical Delay Differential Analysis (CD-DDA). We previously introduced Dynamical Ergodicity Delay Differential Analysis (DE-DDA) to assess dynamical similarity. Here, we further increase the detection of false positives in causality by adding white noise to the signals, but not the dynamical system. Causal Dynamic Resonance (CDR) is applied to coupled R\"ossler systems where the ground truth is known and also to invasive intracranial electroencephalographic (iEEG) data from drug-resistant epilepsy patients undergoing presurgical monitoring.</description>

      <title>Complex dynamic transformations and strange attractors in a tri-trophic predator-prey system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding predator-prey interactions is a fundamental issue in ecology, and the complex dynamics they induce are highly significant for maintaining community stability and self-organising biodiversity. Here, we investigate complex dynamical behaviors and bifurcation structures in a tri-trophic food web comprising a basal prey, an intermediate predator, and an omnivorous top predator. By combining Jacobian analysis with Hopf bifurcation theory, we derive explicit stability conditions and identify thresholds for oscillatory onset at the coexistence equilibrium. Further, we employ Shilnikov's theorem to establish criteria for the emergence of homoclinic orbit. Numerical simulations uncover a rich repertoire of dynamics, including stable limit cycles, Shilnikov homoclinic attractors, strange attractors, period-doubling cascades (with period-2 and 3 windows), chaotic bursts, and crisis-induced intermittency. These regimes are highly sensitive to the omnivore's foraging strategy: minor parameter shifts can destabilize oscillations or precipitate full system collapse. Our results highlight how omnivory and interaction structure critically modulate ecosystem complexity and resilience, offering new insights into the mechanisms that govern stability in multitrophic systems.</description>

      <title>Dimensional dependence of synchronisation in turbulence: insights from data assimilation and Lyapunov analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In Navier-Stokes (NS) turbulence, large-scale turbulent flows inevitably determine small-scale flows. Previous studies using data assimilation with the three-dimensional NS equations indicate that employing observational data resolved down to a specific length scale, $\ell^{3D}_{\ast}$, enables the successful reconstruction of small-scale flows. Such a length scale of `essential resolution of observation' for reconstruction $\ell^{3D}_{\ast}$ is close to the dissipation scale in three-dimensional NS turbulence. Here we study the equivalent length scale in two-dimensional NS turbulence, $\ell^{2D}_{\ast}$, and compare with the three-dimensional case. Our numerical studies using data assimilation and conditional Lyapunov exponents reveal that, for Kolmogorov flows with Ekman drag, the length scale $\ell^{2D}_{\ast}$ is actually close to the forcing scale, substantially larger than the dissipation scale. Furthermore, we discuss the origin of the significant relative difference between the length scales, $\ell^{2D}_{\ast}$ and $\ell^{3D}_{\ast}$, based on inter-scale interactions and orbital instabilities in turbulence dynamics.</description>

      <title>Harnessing the edge of chaos for combinatorial optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17655v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear dynamical systems with continuous variables can be used for solving combinatorial optimization problems with discrete variables. In particular, numerical simulations of them can be used as heuristic algorithms with a desirable property, namely, parallelizability, which allows us to execute them in a massively parallel manner using cutting-edge many-core processors, leading to ultrafast performance. However, the dynamical-system approaches with continuous variables are usually less accurate than conventional approaches with discrete variables such as simulated annealing. To improve the solution accuracy of a representative dynamical system-based algorithm called simulated bifurcation (SB), which was found from classical simulation of a quantum nonlinear oscillator network exhibiting quantum bifurcation, here we generalize it by introducing nonlinear control of individual bifurcation parameters and show that the generalized SB (GSB) can achieve almost 100% success probabilities for some large-scale problems. As a result, the time to solution for a 2,000-variable problem is shortened to 10 ms by a GSB-based machine, which is two orders of magnitude shorter than the best known value, 1.3 s, previously obtained by an SB-based machine. To examine the reason for the ultrahigh performance, we investigated chaos in the GSB changing the nonlinear-control strength and found that the dramatic increase of success probabilities happens near the edge of chaos. That is, the GSB can find a solution with high probability by harnessing the edge of chaos. This finding suggests that dynamical-system approaches to combinatorial optimization will be enhanced by harnessing the edge of chaos, opening a broad possibility to tackle intractable combinatorial optimization problems by nature-inspired approaches.</description>

      <title>Bypassing eigenstate thermalization with experimentally accessible quantum dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07729v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Eigenstate thermalization has played a prominent role as a determiner of the validity of quantum statistical mechanics since von Neumann's early works on quantum ergodicity. However, its connection to the dynamical process of quantum thermalization relies sensitively on nondegeneracy properties of the energy spectrum, as well as detailed features of individual eigenstates that are effective only over correspondingly large timescales, rendering it generically inaccessible given practical timescales and finite experimental resources. Here, we introduce the notion of energy-band thermalization to address these limitations, which coarse-grains over energy level spacings with a finite energy resolution. We show that energy-band thermalization implies the thermalization of an observable in almost all physical states over accessible timescales without relying on microscopic properties of the energy eigenvalues or eigenstates, and conversely, can be efficiently accessed in experiments via the dynamics of a single initial state (for a given observable) with only polynomially many resources in the system size. This allows us to directly determine thermalization, including in the presence of conserved charges, from this state: Most strikingly, if an observable thermalizes in this initial state over a finite range of times, then it must thermalize in almost all physical initial states over all longer timescales. As applications, we derive a finite-time Mazur-Suzuki inequality for quantum transport with approximately conserved charges, and establish the thermalization of local observables over finite timescales in almost all accessible states in (generally inhomogeneous) dual-unitary quantum circuits. We also propose measurement protocols for general many-qubit systems. This work initiates a rigorous treatment of quantum thermalization in terms of experimentally accessible quantities.</description>
