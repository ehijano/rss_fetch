      <title>Cohomology and automorphisms of Com-PreLie algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces the concept of representations for Com-PreLie algebras and develops corresponding cohomology theories, examining how cohomology groups can be applied in the context of Com-PreLie algebras. Initially, we utilize the cohomology theory to investigate abelian extensions of Com-PreLie algebras. Next, given an abelian extension of Com-PreLie algebras and its representation, we explore the inducibility of Com-PreLie automorphisms, deriving both necessary and sufficient conditions for the inducibility problem. Lastly, we delve deeper into the inducibility of Com-PreLie automorphisms using the Wells exact sequences, offering a clear framework for studying the inducibility of Com-PreLie automorphisms.</description>

      <title>Non-abelian extensions and Wells exact sequences of Bol algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23612v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to explore non-abelian extensions of Bol algebras and to study the extensibility of a pair of automorphisms within these non-abelian extensions. We begin by researching non-abelian extensions of Bol algebras and categorizing them based on non-abelian cohomology groups. Additionally, we discuss the conditions under which a pair of automorphisms can be extended in the context of non-abelian extensions of Bol algebras and derive the corresponding Wells exact sequences.</description>

      <title>On Derivations of Tensor Products of Perm Algebras and Associative Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of derivations and their generalizations on non-associative algebras has proven to be fundamental in understanding the internal symmetries and algebraic dynamics of such structures. In this paper, we investigate derivations and diderivations of tensor product dialgebras arising from the combination of a perm algebra and a unital associative algebra. We provide decomposition theorems that characterize these operators in terms of derivations of the individual factors and suitable multiplication maps. Explicit coordinate formulas are also derived, allowing concrete descriptions of the action of derivations and diderivations with respect to natural bases. These results extend classical decomposition theorems for tensor products beyond the associative setting, highlighting the interplay between perm algebras and non-associative algebraic frameworks.</description>

      <title>Coherent Conditions: Algebraic Geometry for Arbitrary Classes of Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Universal algebraic geometry is generalised from solutions of equations in a single algebra to the study of $\varphi$- or $K$-spectra, akin to the prime spectrum of a ring. We explore their basic properties and constructions, give a correspondence between certain quantifier-free propositions and closed sets in the Zariski topology of a free algebra, and show the connection with current UAG. Lastly, equationally Noetherian classes and irreducible spectra are explored.</description>

      <title>On infinite dimensional algebras with regular gradings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite abelian group and let $K$ be an algebraically closed field of characteristic 0. We consider associative unital algebras $A$ over $K$ graded by $G$, that is $A=\oplus_{g\in G} A_g$, where the vector subspaces $A_g$ satisfy $A_gA_h\subseteq A_{g+h}$ for every $g$, $h\in G$. Such a $G$-grading is called regular whenever for every $n$-tuple $(g_1,\ldots,g_n)\in G^n$ there exist homogeneous elements $a_i\in A_{g_i}$ such that $a_1\cdots a_n\ne 0$ in $A$; furthermore, for every $g$, $h\in G$ and every $a_g\in A_g$, $a_h\in A_h$ one has $a_ga_h=\beta(g,h)a_ha_g$ for some $\beta(g,h)\in K^*$. Here $\beta(g,h)$ depends only on the choice of $g$ and $h$ but not on the elements $a_g$ and $a_h$. It is immediate that $\beta$ is a bicharacter on $G$. The regular decomposition above is minimal if for every $g\in G$ with $\beta(g,h)=\beta(g,k)$ one has $h=k$. In this paper we prove that if $G=\mathbb{Z}_2$ then every $G$-graded regular algebra whose regular decomposition is minimal, contains a copy of the infinite dimensional Grassmann algebra. By applying this result we are able to describe the generating algebras of the variety of $\mathbb{Z}_2$-graded algebras defined by the Grassmann algebra. Furthermore we describe the finitely generated subalgebras of a $\mathbb{Z}_2$-graded regular algebra having a minimal regular decomposition.</description>

      <title>Prime and Semiprime Ideals in Commutative Ternary $\Gamma$-Semirings: Quotients, Radicals, Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The theory of ternary $\Gamma$-semirings extends classical ring and semiring frameworks by introducing a ternary product controlled by a parameter set $\Gamma$. Building on the foundational axioms recently established by Rao, Rani, and Kiran (2025), this paper develops the first systematic ideal-theoretic study within this setting. We define and characterize prime and semiprime ideals for commutative ternary $\Gamma$-semirings and prove a quotient characterization: an ideal $P$ is prime if and only if $T/P$ is free of nonzero zero-divisors under the induced ternary $\Gamma$-operation. Semiprime ideals are shown to be stable under arbitrary intersections and coincide with their radicals, providing a natural bridge to radical and Jacobson-type structures. A correspondence between prime ideals and prime congruences is established, leading to a Zariski-like spectral topology on $\mathrm{Spec}(T)$. Computational classification of all commutative ternary $\Gamma$-semirings of order $\leq 4$ confirms the theoretical predictions and reveals novel structural phenomena absent in binary semiring theory. The results lay a rigorous algebraic and computational foundation for subsequent categorical, geometric, and fuzzy extensions of ternary $\Gamma$-algebras.</description>

      <title>Dagger categories of orthosets and the complex Hilbert spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An orthoset is a non-empty set $X$ together with a symmetric binary relation $\perp$ and a constant $0$ such that $x \not\perp x$ for any $x \neq 0$, and $0 \perp x$ for any $x$. Maps $f \colon X \to Y$ and $g \colon Y \to X$ between orthosets are said to form an adjoint pair if, for any $x \in X$ and $y \in Y$, $f(x) \perp g$ if and only if $x \perp g(x)$. Hilbert spaces, equipped with the usual orthogonality relation and the zero vector, provide the motivating examples of orthosets. The usual adjoints of bounded linear maps between Hilbert spaces are adjoints also in our sense.
  We investigate dagger categories of orthosets and maps between them, requiring that any morphism and its dagger form an adjoint pair. We indicate conditions under which such a category is unitarily dagger equivalent to the dagger category of complex Hilbert spaces and bounded linear maps.</description>

      <title>Projective simplicity and Bergman's property for unit groups of continuous rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the projective unit group $\mathrm{PGL}(R)$, i.e., the quotient of the unit group $\mathrm{GL}(R)$ modulo its center, of any non-discrete irreducible, continuous ring $R$ is simple. Moreover, we show that $\mathrm{GL}(R)$ has uncountable strong cofinality, that is, it is not the union of a countable chain of proper subgroups and it has finite width with respect to any generating set. Equivalently, every isometric action of $\mathrm{GL}(R)$ on a metric space has bounded orbits. It follows that every action of $\mathrm{GL}(R)$ by isometries on a non-empty complete $\mathrm{CAT}(0)$ space admits a fixed point. In particular, $\mathrm{GL}(R)$ possesses Serre's properties $(FH)$ and $(FA)$. Furthermore, our results entail that $\mathrm{PGL}(R)$ has bounded normal generation. In turn, we answer two questions by Carderi and Thom.</description>

      <title>Commuting graphs of completely 0-simple semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to study commuting graphs of completely $0$-simple semigroups, using the characterization of these semigroups as $0$-Rees matrix semigroups over a groups. We establish a method to decide whether the commuting graph of this semigroup construction is connected or not. If it is not connected, we also supply a way to identify the connected components of the commuting graph. We show how to obtain the diameter of the commuting graph (when it is connected) and the diameters of the connected components of the commuting graph (when it is not connected). Moreover, we obtain the clique number and girth of the commuting graph of such a semigroup, as well as two upper bounds (either of which can be the best in different situations) for its chromatic number. We also determine the knit degree of such a semigroup.
  Finally, we use the results regarding the properties of the commuting graph of a $0$-Rees matrix semigroup over a group to determine the set of possible values for the diameter, clique number, girth, chromatic number and knit degree of the commuting graph of a completely $0$-simple semigroup.</description>

      <title>Characterisation of quadratic spaces over the Hilbert field by means of the orthogonality relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19563v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An orthoset is a set equipped with a symmetric, irreflexive binary relation. With any (anisotropic) Hermitian space $H$, we may associate the orthoset $(P(H),\perp)$, consisting of the set of one-dimensional subspaces of $H$ and the usual orthogonality relation. $(P(H),\perp)$ determines $H$ essentially uniquely.
  We characterise in this paper certain kinds of Hermitian spaces by imposing transitivity and minimality conditions on their associated orthosets. By gradually considering stricter conditions, we restrict the discussion to a more and more narrow class of Hermitian spaces. We are eventually interested in quadratic spaces over countable subfields of $\mathbb R$.
  A line of an orthoset is the orthoclosure of two distinct element. For an orthoset to be line-symmetric means roughly that its automorphism group acts transitively both on the collection of all lines as well as on each single line. Line-symmetric orthosets turn out to be in correspondence with transitive Hermitian spaces. Furthermore, quadratic orthosets are defined similarly, but are required to possess, for each line $\ell$, a group of automorphisms acting on $\ell$ transitively and commutatively. We show the correspondence of quadratic orthosets with transitive quadratic spaces over ordered fields. We finally specify those quadratic orthosets that are, in a natural sense, minimal: for a finite $n \geq 4$, the orthoset $(P(R^n),\perp)$, where $R$ is the Hilbert field, has the property of being embeddable into any other quadratic orthoset of rank $n$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15727v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The present paper is devoted to the study of dimonoids, algebraic structures with two associative binary operations that satisfy a prescribed system of axioms. We investigate the properties of dual dimonoids. In the class of noncommutative dimonoids, we construct a number of abelian, nonabelian, and rectangular dimonoids. The structure of these objects is analyzed, their automorphism groups and halos are computed.</description>
