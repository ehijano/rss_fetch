      <title>Constrained mean-variance investment-reinsurance under the Cram\'er-Lundberg model with random coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study an optimal mean-variance investment-reinsurance problem for an insurer (she) under a Cram\'er-Lundberg model with random coefficients. At any time, the insurer can purchase reinsurance or acquire new business and invest her surplus in a security market consisting of a risk-free asset and multiple risky assets, subject to a general convex cone investment constraint. We reduce the problem to a constrained stochastic linear-quadratic control problem with jumps whose solution is related to a system of partially coupled stochastic Riccati equations (SREs). Then we devote ourselves to establishing the existence and uniqueness of solutions to the SREs by pure backward stochastic differential equation (BSDE) techniques. We achieve this with the help of approximation procedure, comparison theorems for BSDEs with jumps, log transformation and BMO martingales. The efficient investment-reinsurance strategy and efficient mean-variance frontier are explicitly given through the solutions of the SREs, which are shown to be a linear feedback form of the wealth process and a half-line, respectively.</description>

      <title>Statistical arbitrage in multi-pair trading strategy based on graph clustering algorithms in US equities market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study seeks to develop an effective strategy based on the novel framework of statistical arbitrage based on graph clustering algorithms. Amalgamation of quantitative and machine learning methods, including the Kelly criterion, and an ensemble of machine learning classifiers have been used to improve risk-adjusted returns and increase immunity to transaction costs over existing approaches. The study seeks to provide an integrated approach to optimal signal detection and risk management. As a part of this approach, innovative ways of optimizing take profit and stop loss functions for daily frequency trading strategies have been proposed and tested. All of the tested approaches outperformed appropriate benchmarks. The best combinations of the techniques and parameters demonstrated significantly better performance metrics than the relevant benchmarks. The results have been obtained under the assumption of realistic transaction costs, but are sensitive to changes in some key parameters.</description>

      <title>Volatility Depends on Market Trades and Macro Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.07907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2008.07907v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the randomness of market trade as the origin of price and return stochasticity. We look at time series of trade values and volumes as random variables during the averaging interval {\Delta} and describe the dependences of market-based volatilities of price and return on the volatilities and correlations of market trade values and volumes. We describe the market-based origin of the lower boundaries of the accuracy of macroeconomic variables and consider, as an example, the accuracy of macroeconomic investments. We highlight that current macroeconomic models describe relations between the 1st order variables determined by sums of trade values or volumes. To predict market-based volatilities of price, return, and volatilities of macroeconomic variables, one should develop econometric methodologies, collect data, and elaborate macroeconomic theories of the 2nd order that model the mutual dependence of the 1st and 2nd order economic variables. The absence of macroeconomic theories of the 2nd order means no economic basis for predictions of market-based volatilities of price and return, as well as volatilities of any macroeconomic variables. In turn, that limits the accuracy of forecasting probabilities of price, return, and the accuracy of macroeconomic variables in the best case by Gaussian distributions.</description>
