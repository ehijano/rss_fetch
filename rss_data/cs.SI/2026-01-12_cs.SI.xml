      <title>Optimizing Digital Adjudication through Social Network Analysis: An Empirical Study of Credit Card Disputes in Beijing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Amid the rapid digitalization of judicial systems, the integration of big data into adjudication remains underexplored, particularly in uncovering the structural logic of legal applications. This study bridges this gap by employing social network analysis (SNA) to examine credit card disputes involving personal information protection adjudicated in Beijing. By constructing a legal citation network, we reveal the latent patterns of substantive and procedural law application. The findings demonstrate that SNA can effectively identify core legal norms and typify cases, offering a robust methodological framework for optimizing 'Digital Court' systems. These insights provide practical pathways for enhancing judicial efficiency and consistency through data-driven case retrieval and holistic judicial information networks.</description>

      <title>Mobility Trajectories from Network-Driven Markov Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a generative model of human mobility in which trajectories arise as realizations of a prescribed, time-dependent Markov dynamics defined on a spatial interaction network. The model constructs a hierarchical routing structure with hubs, corridors, feeder paths, and metro links, and specifies transition matrices using gravity-type distance decay combined with externally imposed temporal schedules and directional biases. Population mass evolves as indistinguishable, memoryless movers performing a single transition per time step.
  When aggregated, the resulting trajectories reproduce structured origin-destination flows that reflect network geometry, temporal modulation, and connectivity constraints. By applying the Perron-Frobenius theorem to the daily evolution operator, we identify a unique periodic invariant population distribution that serves as a natural non-transient reference state. We verify consistency between trajectory-level realizations and multi-step Markov dynamics, showing that discrepancies are entirely attributable to finite-population sampling. The framework provides a network-centric, privacy-preserving approach to generating mobility trajectories and studying time-elapsed flow structure without invoking individual-level behavioral assumptions.</description>

      <title>When the Server Steps In: Calibrated Updates for Fair Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a transformative distributed learning paradigm, enabling multiple clients to collaboratively train a global model under the coordination of a central server without sharing their raw training data. While FL offers notable advantages, it faces critical challenges in ensuring fairness across diverse demographic groups. To address these fairness concerns, various fairness-aware debiasing methods have been proposed. However, many of these approaches either require modifications to clients' training protocols or lack flexibility in their aggregation strategies. In this work, we address these limitations by introducing EquFL, a novel server-side debiasing method designed to mitigate bias in FL systems. EquFL operates by allowing the server to generate a single calibrated update after receiving model updates from the clients. This calibrated update is then integrated with the aggregated client updates to produce an adjusted global model that reduces bias. Theoretically, we establish that EquFL converges to the optimal global model achieved by FedAvg and effectively reduces fairness loss over training rounds. Empirically, we demonstrate that EquFL significantly mitigates bias within the system, showcasing its practical effectiveness.</description>

      <title>What's Left Unsaid? Detecting and Correcting Misleading Omissions in Multimodal News Previews</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Even when factually correct, social-media news previews (image-headline pairs) can induce interpretation drift: by selectively omitting crucial context, they lead readers to form judgments that diverge from what the full article conveys. This covert harm is harder to detect than explicit misinformation yet remains underexplored. To address this gap, we develop a multi-stage pipeline that disentangles and simulates preview-based versus context-based understanding, enabling construction of the MM-Misleading benchmark. Using this benchmark, we systematically evaluate open-source LVLMs and uncover pronounced blind spots to omission-based misleadingness detection. We further propose OMGuard, which integrates (1) Interpretation-Aware Fine-Tuning, which used to improve multimodal misleadingness detection and (2) Rationale-Guided Misleading Content Correction, which uses explicit rationales to guide headline rewriting and reduce misleading impressions. Experiments show that OMGuard lifts an 8B model's detection accuracy to match a 235B LVLM and delivers markedly stronger end-to-end correction. Further analysis reveals that misleadingness typically stems from local narrative shifts (e.g., missing background) rather than global frame changes, and identifies image-driven scenarios where text-only correction fails, highlighting the necessity of visual interventions.</description>

      <title>Adaptive behaviors neutralize bistable explosive transitions in higher-order contagion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: During contagion phenomena, individuals perceiving a risk of infection commonly adapt their behavior and reduce their exposure. The effects of such adaptive mechanisms have been studied for processes in which pairwise interactions drive contagion. However, contagion and the perception of infection risk can also involve ("higher-order") group interactions, leading potentially to new phenomenology. How adaptive behavior resulting from risk perception affects higher-order processes remains an open question. Here, we consider the impact of several risk-based adaptive behaviors on pairwise and higher-order contagion processes, using numerical simulations and an analytical mean-field approach. For pairwise contagion, adaptive mechanisms based on local (pairwise or group-based) risk perception impact only the endemic state, without affecting the epidemic phase transition. For higher-order contagion processes, instead, the adaptivity defuses the impact of non-linear group interactions: this reduces or even completely suppresses the parameter range in which bistability is possible, effectively transforming a higher-order contagion process into a pairwise one.</description>

      <title>Note on edge expansion and modularity in preferential attachment graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Edge expansion is a parameter indicating how well-connected a graph is. It is useful for designing robust networks, analysing random walks or information flow through a network and is an important notion in theoretical computer science. Modularity is a measure of how well a graph can be partitioned into communities and is widely used in clustering applications. We study these two parameters in two commonly considered models of random preferential attachment graphs, with $h \geq 2$ edges added per step. We establish new bounds for the likely edge expansion for both random models. Using bounds for edge expansion of small subsets of vertices, we derive new upper bounds also for the modularity values for small $h$.</description>

      <title>Age of Gossip With Cellular Drone Mobility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a cellular network containing $n$ nodes where nodes within a cell gossip with each other in a fully-connected fashion and a source shares updates with these nodes via a mobile drone. The mobile drone receives updates directly from the source and shares them with nodes in the cell where it currently resides. The drone moves between cells according to an underlying continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC). In this work, we evaluate the impact of the number of cells $f(n)$, drone speed $\lambda_m(n)$ and drone dissemination rate $\lambda_d(n)$ on the freshness of information of nodes in the network. We utilize the version age of information metric to quantify the freshness of information. We observe that the expected duration between two drone-to-cell service times depends on the stationary distribution of the underlying CTMC and $\lambda_d(n)$, but not on $\lambda_m(n)$. However, the version age instability in slow moving CTMCs makes high probability analysis for a general underlying CTMC difficult. Therefore, next we focus on the fully-connected drone mobility model. Under this model, we uncover a dual-bottleneck between drone mobility and drone dissemination speed: the version age is constrained by the slower of these two processes. If $\lambda_d(n) \gg \lambda_m(n)$, then the version age scaling of nodes is dominated by the inverse of $\lambda_m(n)$ and is independent of $\lambda_d(n)$. If $\lambda_m(n) \gg \lambda_d(n)$, then the version age scaling of nodes is dominated by the inverse of $\lambda_d(n)$ and is independent of $\lambda_m(n)$.</description>

      <title>Toward a Healthier Social Media Experience: Designing 'Inspiration' and 'Reality' Modes to Enhance Digital Well-Being for Generation Z</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21195v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study presents a dual-mode interface design concept for social media platforms aimed at reducing social comparison in health-related content among Korean MZ (Millennials and Gen-Z) users. The proposed "Inspiration" and "Reality" modes allow users to toggle between curated, idealized posts and more realistic, candid content. This approach aims to alleviate negative psychological effects, such as decreased self-esteem and body dissatisfaction. The pre-study outlines the design framework and discusses potential implications for user satisfaction, perceived authenticity, and mental well-being.</description>

      <title>RumorSphere: A Framework for Million-scale Agent-based Dynamic Simulation of Rumor Propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02172v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rumor propagation modeling is critical for understanding and mitigating misinformation. Existing approaches combining rule-based regular agents with LLM-driven core agents provide a promising paradigm for large-scale rumor simulation. However, overlooking the dynamic nature of core agents and the importance of network topology on rumor spread significantly undermines the simulation performance. To address these issues, we present RumorSphere, a dynamic and hierarchical resonance framework for effective rumor simulation at the million-agent scale. Considering the dynamic role of core agents in rumor evolution, we propose a multi-agent dynamic interaction strategy based on the information cocoon theory, which adaptively identifies and activates critical core agents at conflict boundaries using LLMs, effectively supporting simulations with millions of agents. In addition, we design a hierarchical resonance network that integrates opinion leaders and localized community structures, enabling more realistic modeling of explosive rumor spread in real-world scenarios. Experiments on real-world datasets show that RumorSphere outperforms state-of-the-art methods, reducing simulation bias by an average of 26.5%.</description>

      <title>Leader-driven or Leaderless: How Participation Structure Sustains Engagement and Shapes Narratives in Online Hate Communities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12441v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extremist communities increasingly rely on social media to sustain and amplify divisive discourse. However, the relationship between their internal participation structures, audience engagement, and narrative expression remains underexplored. This study analyzes ten years of Facebook activity by hate groups related to the Israel-Palestine conflict, focusing on anti-Semitic and Islamophobic ideologies. Consistent with prior work, we find that higher participation centralization in online hate groups is associated with greater user engagement across hate ideologies, suggesting the role of key actors in sustaining group activity over time. Conversely, our narrative frame detection models - based on an eight-frame extremist taxonomy (e.g., dehumanization, violence justification) - reveal a clear contrast across hate ideologies, offering new insight into how discursive strategies vary despite similar structural dynamics. Analysis of the inter-group network indicates that, although centralization and homophily are not clearly linked, ideological distinctions emerge: Islamophobic groups cluster tightly, whereas anti-Semitic groups remain more evenly connected. Overall, these findings clarify how participation structure may shape the dissemination pattern and resonance of extremist narratives online and provide a foundation for tailored strategies to disrupt or mitigate online extremist discourse.</description>

      <title>Mapping bipartite networks into multidimensional hyperbolic spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04316v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bipartite networks appear in many real-world contexts, linking entities across two distinct sets. They are often analyzed via one-mode projections, but such projections can introduce artificial correlations and inflated clustering, obscuring the true underlying structure. In this paper, we propose a geometric model for bipartite networks that leverages the high levels of bipartite four-cycles as a measure of clustering to place both node types in the same similarity space, where link probabilities decrease with distance. Additionally, we introduce B-Mercator, an algorithm that infers node positions from the bipartite structure. We evaluate its performance on diverse datasets, illustrating how the resulting embeddings improve downstream tasks such as node classification and distance-based link prediction in machine learning. These hyperbolic embeddings also enable the generation of synthetic networks with node features closely resembling real-world ones, thereby safeguarding sensitive information while allowing secure data sharing. In addition, we show how preserving bipartite structure avoids the pitfalls of projection-based techniques, yielding more accurate descriptions and better performance. Our method provides a robust framework for uncovering hidden geometry in complex bipartite systems.</description>
