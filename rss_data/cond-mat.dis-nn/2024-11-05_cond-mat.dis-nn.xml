      <title>Is the Harris criterion valid in the case of geometric disorders?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Harris criterion imposes a constraint on the critical behavior of a system upon introduction of new disorder, based on its dimension $d$ and localization length exponent $\nu$. It states that the new disorder can be relevant only if $d \nu &lt; 2$. We analyze the applicability of the Harris criterion to the network disorder formulated in the paper [I. A. Gruzberg, A. Kl\"umper, W. Nuding, and A. Sedrakyan, Phys. Rev. B 95, 125414 (2017)] and show that the fluctuations of the geometry are relevant despite $d \nu&gt; 2$, implying that Harris criterion should be modified. We have observed that the fluctuations of the critical point in different quenched configurations of disordered network blocks is of order $L^0$, i.e.~it does not depend on block size $L$ in contrast to the expectation based on the Harris criterion that they should decrease as $L^{-d/2}$ according to the central limit theorem. Since $L^0 &gt; (x-x_c)$ is always satisfied near the critical point, the mentioned network disorder is relevant and the critical indices of the system can be changed. We have also shown that our disordered network is fundamentally different from Voronoi-Delaunay and dynamically triangulated random lattices: the probability of higher connectivity in our network decreases in a power law as opposed to an exponential, indicating that we are dealing with a ``scale free" network, such as the Internet, protein-protein interactions, etc.</description>

      <title>On the phase diagram of extensive-rank symmetric matrix denoising beyond rotational invariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Matrix denoising is central to signal processing and machine learning. Its analysis when the matrix to infer has a factorised structure with a rank growing proportionally to its dimension remains a challenge, except when it is rotationally invariant. In this case the information theoretic limits and a Bayes-optimal denoising algorithm, called rotational invariant estimator [1,2], are known. Beyond this setting few results can be found. The reason is that the model is not a usual spin system because of the growing rank dimension, nor a matrix model due to the lack of rotation symmetry, but rather a hybrid between the two. In this paper we make progress towards the understanding of Bayesian matrix denoising when the hidden signal is a factored matrix $XX^\intercal$ that is not rotationally invariant. Monte Carlo simulations suggest the existence of a denoising-factorisation transition separating a phase where denoising using the rotational invariant estimator remains Bayes-optimal due to universality properties of the same nature as in random matrix theory, from one where universality breaks down and better denoising is possible by exploiting the signal's prior and factorised structure, though algorithmically hard. We also argue that it is only beyond the transition that factorisation, i.e., estimating $X$ itself, becomes possible up to sign and permutation ambiguities. On the theoretical side, we combine mean-field techniques in an interpretable multiscale fashion in order to access the minimum mean-square error and mutual information. Interestingly, our alternative method yields equations which can be reproduced using the replica approach of [3]. Using numerical insights, we then delimit the portion of the phase diagram where this mean-field theory is reliable, and correct it using universality when it is not. Our ansatz matches well the numerics when accounting for finite size effects.</description>

      <title>Complex Vector Gain-Based Annealer for Minimizing XY Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the Complex Vector Gain-Based Annealer (CoVeGA), an analog computing platform designed to overcome energy barriers in XY Hamiltonians through a higher-dimensional representation. Traditional gain-based solvers utilizing optical or photonic hardware typically represent each XY spin with a single complex field. These solvers often struggle with large energy barriers in complex landscapes, leading to relaxation into excited states. CoVeGA addresses these limitations by employing two complex fields to represent each XY spin and dynamically evolving the energy landscape through time-dependent annealing. Operating in a higher-dimensional space, CoVeGA bridges energy barriers in this expanded space during the continuous phase evolution, thus avoiding entrapment in local minima. We introduce several graph structures that pose challenges for XY minimization and use them to benchmark CoVeGA against single-dimension XY solvers, highlighting the benefits of higher-dimensional operation.</description>

      <title>Exact Replica Symmetric solution for transverse field Hopfield model under finite Trotter size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the quantum Hopfield model in which an extensive number of patterns are embedded in the presence of a uniform transverse field. This analysis employs the replica method under the replica symmetric ansatz on the Suzuki-Trotter representation of the model, while keeping the number of Trotter slices $M$ finite. The statistical properties of the quantum Hopfield model in imaginary time are reduced to an effective $M$-spin long-range classical Ising model, which can be extensively studied using a dedicated Monte Carlo algorithm. This approach contrasts with the commonly applied static approximation, which ignores the imaginary time dependency of the order parameters, but allows $M \to \infty$ to be taken analytically. During the analysis, we introduce an exact but fundamentally weaker static relation, referred to as the quasi-static relation. We present the phase diagram of the model with respect to the transverse field strength and the number of embedded patterns, indicating a small but quantitative difference from previous results obtained using the static approximation.</description>

      <title>Finite-size scaling and dynamics in a two-dimensional lattice of identical oscillators with frustrated couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A two-dimensional lattice of oscillators with identical (zero) intrinsic frequencies and Kuramoto type of interactions with randomly frustrated couplings is considered. Starting the time evolution from slightly perturbed synchronized states, we study numerically the relaxation properties, as well as properties at the stable fixed point which can also be viewed as a metastable state of the closely related XY spin glass model. According to our results, the order parameter at the stable fixed point shows generally a slow, reciprocal logarithmic convergence to its limiting value with the system size. The infinite-size limit is found to be close to zero for zero-centered Gaussian couplings, whereas, for a binary $\pm 1$ distribution with a sufficiently high concentration of positive couplings, it is significantly above zero. Besides, the relaxation time is found to grow algebraically with the system size. Thus, the order parameter in an infinite system approaches its limiting value inversely proportionally to $\ln t$ at late times $t$, similarly to that found in the model with all-to-all couplings [Daido, Chaos {\bf 28}, 045102 (2018)]. As opposed to the order parameter, the energy of the corresponding XY model is found to converge algebraically to its infinite-size limit.</description>

      <title>Graph Neural Networks Based Deep Learning for Predicting Structural and Electronic Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a deep learning approach to predicting structural and electronic properties of materials using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Leveraging data from the Materials Project database, we construct graph representations of crystal structures and employ GNNs to predict multiple properties simultaneously. All crystal structures are from the Materials Project database, with a total of 158,874 structures used. Our model achieves high predictive accuracy across various properties, as indicated by \( R^2 \) values: 0.96 for density, 0.97 for formation energy, 0.54 for energy above hull, 0.47 for structural stability (is\_S), 0.76 for band gap, 0.86 for valence band maximum, 0.78 for conduction band minimum, and 0.82 for Fermi energy. These results demonstrate the potential of GNNs in materials science, offering a powerful tool for rapid screening and discovery of materials with desired properties.</description>

      <title>Modal complexity as a metric for Anderson localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a thorough study of the complexity of optical localized modes in two-dimensional disordered photonic crystals. Direct experimental measurements of complexity were made using an interferometric setup that allowed for extraction of phases and, hence, complex-valued wavefunctions. The comparison of experimental and theoretical results allows us to propose a metric for Anderson localization based on the average value and statistical distribution of complexity. Being an alternative to other known criteria of localization, the proposed metric exploits the openness of the disordered medium and provides a quantitative characterization of the degree of localization allowing for determining the localization length.</description>

      <title>Speak so a physicist can understand you! TetrisCNN for detecting phase transitions and order parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, neural networks (NNs) have become a powerful tool for detecting quantum phases of matter. Unfortunately, NNs are black boxes and only identify phases without elucidating their properties. Novel physics benefits most from insights about phases, traditionally extracted in spin systems using spin correlators. Here, we combine two approaches and design TetrisCNN, a convolutional NN with parallel branches using different kernels that detects the phases of spin systems and expresses their essential descriptors, called order parameters, in a symbolic form based on spin correlators. We demonstrate this on the example of snapshots of the one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model taken in various bases. We show also that TetrisCNN can detect more complex order parameters using the example of two-dimensional Ising gauge theory. This work can lead to the integration of NNs with quantum simulators to study new exotic phases of matter.</description>

      <title>Conductivity scaling and absence of localization in disordered nodal line semimetals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.07906v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transport plays a key role in characterizing topological insulators and semimetals. Understanding the effect of disorder is crucial to assess the robustness of experimental signatures for topology. In this work, we find the absence of localization in nodal line semimetals for long-range scalar disorder and a large range of disorder strengths. Using a continuum transfer matrix approach, we find that the conductivity in the plane and out of the plane of the nodal line increases with system size and disorder strength. We substantiate these findings by a perturbative calculation and show that the conductivity increases with disorder strength using the Kubo formula in the self-consistent Born approximation. We also find that the system remains metallic for vector disorder and that vector disorder can drive a transition from an insulating to a metallic regime. Our results demonstrate the absence of localization in a three-dimensional bulk system.</description>

Abstract: Here we outline some new results for the GHWS model which points to a discretization of parameter space into well differentiated collective dynamic states.

      <description>arXiv:2410.13444v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a spin-1 version of the random energy model with crystal field. Crystal field controls the density of 0 spins in the system. We solve the model in the micro-canonincal ensemble. The model has a spin-glass transition at a finite temperature for all strengths of the crystal field. By introducing the magnetic field we also obtain the de Almeida Thouless line for the model. The spin-glass transition persists in the presence of external field. We also find that the magnetisation shows non-monotonic behaviour for high positive crystal field strengths. The zero magnetic field specific heat and magnetic susceptibility also exhibit a cusp beyond a threshold value of the crystal field.</description>

      <title>Scaling Whole-Chip QAOA for Higher-Order Ising Spin Glass Models on Heavy-Hex Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00997v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show through numerical simulation that the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) for higher-order, random-coefficient, heavy-hex compatible spin glass Ising models has strong parameter concentration across problem sizes from $16$ up to $127$ qubits for $p=1$ up to $p=5$, which allows for straight-forward transfer learning of QAOA angles on instance sizes where exhaustive grid-search is prohibitive even for $p&gt;1$. We use Matrix Product State (MPS) simulation at different bond dimensions to obtain confidence in these results, and we obtain the optimal solutions to these combinatorial optimization problems using CPLEX. In order to assess the ability of current noisy quantum hardware to exploit such parameter concentration, we execute short-depth QAOA circuits (with a CNOT depth of 6 per $p$, resulting in circuits which contain $1420$ two qubit gates for $127$ qubit $p=5$ QAOA) on $100$ higher-order (cubic term) Ising models on IBM quantum superconducting processors with $16, 27, 127$ qubits using QAOA angles learned from a single $16$-qubit instance. We show that (i) the best quantum processors generally find lower energy solutions up to $p=3$ for 27 qubit systems and up to $p=2$ for 127 qubit systems and are overcome by noise at higher values of $p$, (ii) the best quantum processors find mean energies that are about a factor of two off from the noise-free numerical simulation results. Additional insights from our experiments are that large performance differences exist among different quantum processors even of the same generation and that dynamical decoupling significantly improve performance for some, but decrease performance for other quantum processors. Lastly we show $p=1$ QAOA angle mean energy landscapes computed using up to a $414$ qubit quantum computer, showing that the mean QAOA energy landscapes remain very similar as the problem size changes.</description>

      <title>Learning to grok: Emergence of in-context learning and skill composition in modular arithmetic tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02550v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models can solve tasks that were not present in the training set. This capability is believed to be due to in-context learning and skill composition. In this work, we study the emergence of in-context learning and skill composition in a collection of modular arithmetic tasks. Specifically, we consider a finite collection of linear modular functions $z = a \, x + b \, y \;\mathrm{mod}\; p$ labeled by the vector $(a, b) \in \mathbb{Z}_p^2$. We use some of these tasks for pre-training and the rest for out-of-distribution testing. We empirically show that a GPT-style transformer exhibits a transition from in-distribution to out-of-distribution generalization as the number of pre-training tasks increases. We find that the smallest model capable of out-of-distribution generalization requires two transformer blocks, while for deeper models, the out-of-distribution generalization phase is \emph{transient}, necessitating early stopping. Finally, we perform an interpretability study of the pre-trained models, revealing highly structured representations in both attention heads and MLPs; and discuss the learned algorithms. Notably, we find an algorithmic shift in deeper models, as we go from few to many in-context examples.</description>

      <title>Critical Filaments and Superconductivity in Quasiperiodic Twisted Bilayer Graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06676v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multilayer moir\'e materials can exhibit topological electronic features yet are inherently quasiperiodic -- leading to wave function interference whose Anderson-localizing tendency can be mitigated by topology. We consider a quasiperiodic variant of the chiral Bistritzer-MacDonald model for twisted bilayer graphene with two incommensurate moir\'e potentials that serves as a toy model for twisted trilayer. We observe "filaments" linking magic angles with enhanced density of states and fractal wave functions that evade localization; states away from the filaments mimic fractal surface states of dirty topological superconductors. We demonstrate that topological quasiperiodicity can broadly enhance superconductivity without magic-angle fine-tuning.</description>

Abstract: It is common in deep learning to warm up the learning rate $\eta$, often by a linear schedule between $\eta_{\text{init}} = 0$ and a predetermined target $\eta_{\text{trgt}}$. In this paper, we show through systematic experiments using SGD and Adam that the overwhelming benefit of warmup arises from allowing the network to tolerate larger $\eta_{\text{trgt}}$ {by forcing the network to more well-conditioned areas of the loss landscape}. The ability to handle larger $\eta_{\text{trgt}}$ makes hyperparameter tuning more robust while improving the final performance. We uncover different regimes of operation during the warmup period, depending on whether training starts off in a progressive sharpening or sharpness reduction phase, which in turn depends on the initialization and parameterization. Using these insights, we show how $\eta_{\text{init}}$ can be properly chosen by utilizing the loss catapult mechanism, which saves on the number of warmup steps, in some cases completely eliminating the need for warmup. We also suggest an initialization for the variance in Adam which provides benefits similar to warmup.</description>

      <title>Deep Unfolded Local Quantum Annealing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03026v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Local quantum annealing (LQA), an iterative algorithm, is designed to solve combinatorial optimization problems. It draws inspiration from QA, which utilizes adiabatic time evolution to determine the global minimum of a given objective function. In the original LQA, the classical Hamiltonian is minimized via gradient descent. The performance of LQA depends on the choice of the parameters. Owing to the non-convex nature of the original cost function, LQA often becomes trapped in local minima, limiting its effectiveness. To address this challenge, we combine LQA with a deep unfolding scheme, which enables us to tune the parameters from the training data via back-propagation. {As a demonstration, we apply the deep unfolded LQA to the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model, which is a fundamental {model} in statistical physics.} Our findings exhibit that deep unfolded LQA outperforms the original LQA, exhibiting remarkable convergence speed and performance improvement. As the trained parameters can be generalized to unknown instances and different system sizes, our results have significant practical implications and provide valuable insights for real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Dynamically generated concatenated codes and their phase diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13801v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We formulate code concatenation as the action of a unitary quantum circuit on an expanding tree geometry and find that for certain classes of gates, applied identically at each node, a binary tree circuit encodes a single logical qubit with code distance that grows exponentially in the depth of the tree. When there is noise in the bulk or at the end of this encoding circuit, the system undergoes a phase transition between a coding phase, where an optimal decoder can successfully recover logical information, and a non-coding phase. Leveraging the tree structure, we combine the formalism of "tensor enumerators" from quantum coding theory with standard recursive techniques for classical spin models on the Bethe lattice to explore these phases. In the presence of bulk errors, the coding phase is a type of spin glass, characterized by a distribution of failure probabilities. When the errors are heralded, the recursion relation is exactly solvable, giving us an analytic handle on the phase diagram.</description>

      <title>Field theory for monitored Brownian SYK clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08079v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the time evolution of multiple clusters of Brownian Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK), i.e. systems of N Majorana fermions with a noisy interaction term. In addition to the unitary evolution, we introduce two-fermion monitorings. We construct a coherent states path integral of the dynamics by generalizing spin coherent states for higher symmetry groups. We then demonstrate that the evolution of the replicated density matrix can be described by an effective field theory for the "light" degrees of freedom, i.e. the quantum fluctuations generated by the unitary evolution. This method is applied to both quadratic, where the field theory reduces to the nonlinear sigma model (NLSM), and also to interacting SYK clusters. We show that in the stationary regime, two monitored clusters exhibit linear-in-N entanglement, with a proportionality factor dependent on the strength of the unitary coupling.</description>

      <title>Latent heat estimation with machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00733v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We set out to explore the possibility of investigating the critical behavior of systems with first-order phase transition using deep machine learning. We propose a machine learning protocol with ternary classification of instantaneous spin configurations using known values of disordered phase energy and ordered phase energy. The trained neural network is used to predict whether a given sample belong to one or the other phase of matter. This allows us to estimate the probability that configurations with a certain energy belong to the ordered phase, mixed phase and, disordered phase. From these probabilities, we obtained estimates of the values of the critical energies and the latent heat for the Potts model with 10 and 20 components, which undergoes a strong discontinuous transition. We also find that the probabilities can reflect geometric transitions in the mixed phase.</description>
