      <title>Lumped-Element Model of THz HEB Mixer Based on Sputtered MgB2 Thin Film</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14463v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis and experimental study of THz hot-electron bolometer (HEB) mixers made from 40-nm-thick sputtered magnesium diboride (MgB2) thin films on high-resistivity silicon substrates. Using a lumped-element bolometric model, we achieve strong quantitative agreement with measurements of conversion gain, noise temperature, and local-oscillator (LO) coupling to the HEB devices. Our analysis shows that the sensitivity of current HEB devices is primarily limited by on-chip optical losses, with both Johnson and thermal-fluctuation noise contributing significantly to the overall noise temperature. Simulations of an optimized device with near-ideal optical coupling suggest that Johnson noise remains a substantial factor even with improved coupling. Further reduction of the noise temperature may require additional suppression of Johnson noise (via improved intrinsic conversion gain) beyond optimizing optical coupling efficiency. We emphasize the importance of accurate modeling to achieve good numerical agreement with experiments, thereby enabling understanding of the causes of sensitivity loss.</description>

      <title>A Modulated Electron Lattice (MEL) Criterion for Metallic Superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A central unresolved question in the theory of superconductivity is why only a small subset of metallic elements exhibit a superconducting state, whereas many others remain strictly normal. Neither the conventional Bardeen Cooper Schrieffer (BCS) framework nor its extensions involving charge density wave (CDW) or pair density wave (PDW) order provide a predictive or material-selective criterion capable of distinguishing superconducting metals from non-superconducting ones. In particular, the persistent absence of superconductivity in simple noble metals with well-defined Fermi surfaces poses a challenge for all traditional approaches. Here we address this problem using the Modulated Electron Lattice (MEL) Ginzburg Landau (GL) framework introduced in our previous work. In this formulation, a coarse-grained MEL charge field $\rho_{\mathrm{MEL}}(\mathbf{r})$ with momentum dependent stiffness $\alpha(q)$ is coupled to the superconducting (SC) order parameter $\psi(\mathbf{r})$. We show that metallic superconductivity emerges only when the system satisfies a specific ``MEL enhancement window,'' characterized by a negative minimum of $\alpha(q)$ at either a finite modulation wave vector $q^{\ast}$ or at $q=0$, together with sufficiently strong coupling between $\rho_{\mathrm{MEL}}$ and $\psi$. This unified criterion naturally partitions metallic elements into three universal classes: (i) MEL-enhanced superconductors with a finite-$q^{\ast}$ charge mode, (ii) conventional BCS superconductors as the homogeneous $q^{\ast}=0$ limit of the MEL framework, and (iii) metals for which $\alpha(q)$ remains positive for all $q$, suppressing all MEL modes and preventing any superconducting instability. By applying this criterion to simple metallic elements, we identify why some metals develop superconductivity while others do not, possibly resolving a selection problem long open within the BCS paradigm.</description>

      <title>Transient Pauli blocking in a InN film as a mechanism for broadband ultrafast optical switching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14656v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The transient Pauli blocking effect offers a promising route for achieving ultrafast optical switching in semiconductors, enabling a rapid switching from an initially opaque state to a relatively transparent state upon photoexcitation. Herein, we demonstrate broadband ultrafast optical switching in degenerate InN thin films, spanning the visible to near-infrared spectral range, using pump-probe transient transmittance measurements. To elucidate the underlying physical mechanism, we perform probe-energy-resolved analysis for ultrafast dynamics, and develop a theoretical model based on a quasi-equilibrium Fermi-Dirac distribution. The model successfully captures the experimental transients and yields an electron-phonon coupling constant of $1.0\times10^{17}\,\mathrm{W\,m^{-3}\,K^{-1}}$, along with an electronic specific heat coefficient ranging from 1.52 to 2.02 $\mathrm{mJ\,mol^{-1}\,K^{-2}}$, which allow direct prediction of the spectral switching window. Notably, we demonstrate that the Pauli blocking effect can be induced solely by a laser-excitation driven rise in electronic temperature, without requiring significant carrier injection into the conduction band in degenerate semiconductors. These findings offer new insights for designing ultrafast optical modulators, shutters, and photonic devices for next-generation communication and computing technologies.</description>

      <title>In-Situ Inverse Design of a Plasma Metamaterial Beam Steering Device</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inverse design is a commonly used methodology for creating devices that manipulate electromagnetic (EM) waves by algorithmically modifying device parameters to achieve a desired functionality. Utilizing plasma, a dynamically tunable medium, allows the optimization of the design process to be conducted directly on the experimental hardware (in-situ). A key advantage of this method is the creation of devices that are inherently switchable and dynamically reconfigurable. Bayesian optimization is used to tune the plasma density of 91 independent discharges that make up a plasma metamaterial (PMM) device to steer incoming EM waves to desired exit waveguides. Measurements were conducted in an automated loop where a vector network analyzer records the PMM transmission characteristics for each device setting. By relying only on measured scattering parameters, this gradient-free approach is robust to experimental drift and noise and does not require complex full-wave models. Significant performance improvements over traditional simulation-based (in-silico) inverse design are demonstrated, with in-situ Bayesian optimization achieving up to 10,000x higher isolation between ports than the best in-silico design at the same target frequency. This work also presents guidelines for applying Bayesian optimization to noisy, high-dimensional physical systems.</description>

      <title>Kerr-enhanced amplification of three-wave mixing and emergent masing regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrated optical microresonators exploiting either second-order ($\chi^{(2)}$) or third-order ($\chi^{(3)}$) nonlinearities have become key platforms for frequency conversion, low-noise microwave photonics, and quantum entanglement generation. Here, we present an analytic theory of Kerr-enhanced three-wave mixing amplification in an electro-optic microresonator with both $\chi^{(2)}$ and $\chi^{(3)}$ nonlinearities. We demonstrate that Kerr dressing hybridizes the optical sidebands, renormalizing the $\chi^{(2)}$ couplings and detunings. As a result the system exhibits gain in regions where analogous bare $\chi^{(2)}$ or $\chi^{(3)}$ amplifiers are subthreshold. Time-domain Langevin simulations confirm this threshold reduction, mapping a practical design window for experiments.</description>

      <title>Modeling the Thermal Behavior of Photopolymers for In-Space Fabrication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Future long-duration space missions will require in-situ, on-demand manufacturing of tools and components. Photopolymer-based processes are attractive for this purpose due to their low energy requirements, volume efficiency, and precise control of curing. However, photopolymerization generates significant heat, which is difficult to regulate in microgravity where natural convection is absent, leading to defects such as surface blistering and deformation. In this work, we combine experimental studies and modeling to address these thermal challenges. We report results from International Space Station (ISS) experiments and a dedicated parabolic flight campaign, which confirm that suppressed convective heat transfer in microgravity exacerbates thermal buildup and defect formation. Building on these observations, we present a predictive thermal model that couples heat transfer, light absorption, and evolving material properties to simulate polymerization and temperature evolution under terrestrial and microgravity conditions. Laboratory validation demonstrates strong agreement between model predictions and measured temperature profiles. Applying the model to the ISS experiments, we show that the model accurately reproduces experimentally observed blistering in TJ-3704A, a commercial acrylate-based polymer resin, while also predicting defect-free outcomes for Norland optical adhesives. The model functions as a design tool for defect-free in-space manufacturing, enabling selection of polymer properties, exposure strategies, and environmental conditions that together inhibit excess thermal buildup, paving the way for scalable, reliable in-situ manufacturing during future missions.</description>

      <title>Solution-derived barium titanate waveguides for integrated electro-optic modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metal oxides with strong nonlinear optical properties and wide transparency window are key materials for the development of compact and efficient photonic integrated circuits used for electro-optic modulators and entangled photon sources. Among them, barium titanate (BaTiO$_{3}$) is particularly attractive due to its large Pockels coefficient. However, its use has been limited by challenges in material synthesis and in nanopatterning, owing to its chemical stability and inertness. Here, we demonstrate a monolithic electro-optic modulator entirely based on solution-deposited BaTiO$_{3}$, fabricated through a bottom-up soft nanoimprinting lithography process. Fine-tuning the synthesis and nanofabrication enhances the optical properties of the polycrystalline material. By optimizing the process parameters, we achieve a reduction in propagation losses of two orders of magnitude, enabling efficient electro-optic modulation. This scalable, etch-free approach enables direct patterning of high-quality BaTiO$_{3}$ structures, establishing a new route for low-cost, large-scale integrated electro-optic devices entirely based on oxide material compatible with a wide range of substrates.</description>

      <title>Resolving the band alignment of InAs/InAsSb mid-wave-infrared type-II superlattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.15053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, three InAs/InAs$_{0.65}$Sb$_{0.35}$ superlattices with different periods were investigated using photoluminescence and photoreflectance measurements and their band structure was simulated using a 14 bulk-band kp model. The structures were studied by analyzing the evolution of the spectral features in temperature and excitation power to determine the origin of optical transitions. After identifying which of these are related to the superlattice mini-bands, a rich collection of observed higher-order optical transitions was compared with refractive-index calculations. This procedure was used to adjust the parameters of the theoretical model, namely the bowing parameters of the InAsSb valence band offset and bandgap. It was also shown that the spectroscopy of the higher-order states combined with numerical modeling of the refractive index is a powerful tool for improvement of the material parameters, presenting a new approach to material studies of advanced semiconductor heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional FrBD friction models for rolling contact</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.06811v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper develops a comprehensive two-dimensional generalisation of the recently introduced Friction with Bristle Dynamics (FrBD) framework for rolling contact problems. The proposed formulation extends the one-dimensional FrBD model to accommodate simultaneous longitudinal and lateral slips, spin, and arbitrary transport kinematics over a finite contact region. The derivation combines a rheological representation of the bristle element with an analytical local sliding-friction law. By relying on an application of the Implicit Function Theorem, the notion of sliding velocity is then eliminated, and a fully dynamic friction model, driven solely by the rigid relative velocity, is obtained. Building upon this local model, three distributed formulations of increasing complexity are introduced, covering standard linear rolling contact, as well as linear and semilinear rolling in the presence of large spin slips. For the linear formulations, well-posedness, stability, and passivity properties are investigated under standard assumptions. In particular, the analysis reveals that the model preserves passivity under almost any parametrisation of practical interest. Numerical simulations illustrate steady-state action surfaces, transient relaxation phenomena, and the effect of time-varying normal loads. The results provide a unified and mathematically tractable friction model applicable to a broad class of rolling contact systems.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional FrBD friction models for rolling contact: extension to linear viscoelasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13818v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper extends the distributed rolling contact FrBD framework to linear viscoelasticity by considering classic derivative Generalised Maxwell and Kelvin-Voigt rheological representations of the bristle element. With this modelling approach, the dynamics of the bristle, generated friction forces, and internal deformation states are described by a system of 2(n+1) hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs), which can capture complex relaxation phenomena originating from viscoelastic behaviours. By appropriately specifying the analytical expressions for the transport and rigid relative velocity, three distributed formulations of increasing complexity are introduced, which account for different levels of spin excitation. For the linear variants, well-posedness and passivity are analysed rigorously, showing that these properties hold for any physically meaningful parametrisation. Numerical experiments complement the theoretical results by illustrating steady-state characteristics and transient relaxation effects. The findings of this paper substantially advance the FrBD paradigm by enabling a unified and systematic treatment of linear viscoelasticity.</description>

      <title>A Fast Algorithm for the Finite Expression Method in Learning Dynamics on Complex Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.03092v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Complex network data is prevalent in various real-world domains, including physical, technological, and biological systems. Despite this prevalence, predicting trends and understanding behavioral patterns in complex systems remain challenging due to poorly understood underlying mechanisms. While data-driven methods have advanced in uncovering governing equations from time series data, efforts to extract physical laws from network data are limited and often struggle with incomplete or noisy data. Additionally, they suffer from computational costs on network data, making it difficult to scale to real-world networks. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel approach called the Finite Expression Method (FEX) and its fast algorithm for learning dynamics on complex networks. FEX represents dynamics on complex networks using binary trees composed of finite mathematical operators. The nodes within these trees are trained through a combinatorial optimization process guided by reinforcement learning techniques. This unique configuration allows FEX to capture complex dynamics with minimal prior knowledge of the system and a small dictionary of mathematical operators. We also integrate a fast, stochastic algorithm into FEX, reducing the computational complexity from $O(N^2)$ to $O(N)$. Our extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that FEX excels in accurately identifying dynamics across diverse network topologies and dynamic behaviors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06167v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Synthetic antiferromagnets offer rich magnon energy spectra in which optical and acoustic magnon branches can hybridize. Here, we demonstrate a broken intrinsic symmetry induced coupling of acoustic and optical magnons in a synthetic ferrimagnet consisting of two dissimilar antiferromagnetically interacting ferromagnetic metals. Two distinct magnon modes hybridize at degeneracy points, as indicated by an avoided level-crossing. The avoided level-crossing gap depends on the interlayer exchange interaction between the magnetic layers, which can be controlled by adjusting the non-magnetic interlayer thickness. A large avoided level crossing gap of 3.9 GHz is revealed, exceeding the coupling strength that is typically found in other magnonic hybrid systems based on a coupling of magnons with photons or magnons with phonons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.13221v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A disordered quasi-liquid layer of water is thought to cover the ice surface, but many issues, such as its onset temperature, its thickness, or its actual relation to bulk liquid water have been a matter of unsettled controversy for more than a century. In this perspective article, current computer simulations and experimental results are discussed under the light of a suitable theoretical framework. It is found that using a combination of wetting physics, the theory of intermolecular forces, statistical mechanics and out of equilibrium physics a large number of conflicting results can be reconciled and collected into a consistent description of the ice surface. This helps understand the crucial role of surface properties in a range of important applications, from the enigmatic structure of snow crystals to the slipperiness of ice.</description>

Abstract: Air entrapment during mold filling critically affects porosity and overall casting quality in High Pressure Die Casting. This study assesses the feasibility of applying the vof method within OpenFOAM to simulate compressible, turbulent mold filling in a thin-walled geometry. Three-dimensional simulations with the "compressibleInterFoam" solver were carried out under ambient initial cavity conditions, using both laminar flow and the k-e turbulence model. The free surface dynamics were examined across a range of inlet velocities to evaluate their influence on interface morphology, cavity pressurization, and gas entrapment. To quantify these effects, three evaluation criteria were introduced: the TIFSA as a measure of oxidation risk, the TMVF as an indicator of filling continuity and air entrapment, and the TIVF as a proxy for surface loading. Results show that turbulence modeling accelerates pressurization and limits the persistence of entrapped gas, with velocity governing the balance between smooth filling, turbulent breakup, and exposure duration. Comparison with experimental casting trials, including CT based porosity analysis and photogrammetric surface evaluation, validated that the model captures key defect mechanisms and provides quantitative guidance for process optimization.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of a novel phase space painting method in a coupled lattice to mitigate space charge in high-intensity hadron beams</title>

Abstract: Multi-turn charge-exchange injection is the primary method of creating high-intensity hadron beams in circular accelerators, and phase space painting during injection enables tailoring of the accumulated phase space distribution. A technique we call eigenpainting allows injection of particles into a single mode of a coupled ring, providing full four-dimensional control of the phase space distribution. Under ideal conditions, uniform eigenpainting generates a linear-force equilibrium distribution in the transverse plane, with zero volume in four-dimensional transverse phase space, even including space charge. We have implemented eigenpainting for the first time in the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) Accumulator Ring. Injecting 8.8 $\mu$C of 800 MeV beam, we obtain a final ratio of intrinsic transverse emittances of $\approx$2.4. We analyze the effect of space charge on the final distribution through comparison of the reconstructed phase space to particle-in-cell simulations.</description>
