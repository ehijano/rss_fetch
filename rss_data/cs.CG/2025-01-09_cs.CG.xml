      <title>Multivariate Exploration of Metric Dilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a weighted graph embedded in a metric space $(M, d_M )$. The vertices of $G$ correspond to the points in $M$ , with the weight of each edge $uv$ being the distance $d_M (u, v)$ between their respective points in $M$ . The dilation (or stretch) of $G$ is defined as the minimum factor $t$ such that, for any pair of vertices $u, v$, the distance between $u$ and $v$-represented by the weight of a shortest $u$, $v$-path is at most $ t \cdot d_M (u, v)$. We study Dilation t-Augmentation, where the objective is, given a metric $M $, a graph $G$, and numerical values $k$ and $t$, to determine whether $G$ can be transformed into a graph with dilation $t$ by adding at most $k$ edges.
  Our primary focus is on the scenario where the metric $M$ is the shortest path metric of an unweighted graph $\Gamma$. Even in this specific case, Dilation $t$-Augmentation remains computationally challenging. In particular, the problem is W[2]-hard parameterized by $k$ when $\Gamma$ is a complete graph, already for $t=2$. Our main contribution lies in providing new insights into the impact of combinations of various parameters on the computational complexity of the problem. We establish the following.
  -- The parameterized dichotomy of the problem with respect to dilation $t$, when the graph $G$ is sparse: Parameterized by $k$, the problem is FPT for graphs excluding a biclique $K_{d,d}$ as a subgraph for $t\leq 2$ and the problem is W[1]-hard for $t\geq 3$ even if $G$ is a forest consisting of disjoint stars.
  -- The problem is FPT parameterized by the combined parameter $k+t+\Delta$, where $\Delta$ is the maximum degree of the graph $G$ or $\Gamma$.</description>

      <title>Pattern Formation for Fat Robots with Lights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.14440v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a set of $n\geq 1$ unit disk robots in the Euclidean plane, we consider the Pattern Formation problem, i.e., the robots must reposition themselves to form a given target pattern. This problem arises under obstructed visibility, where a robot cannot see another robot if there is a third robot on the straight line segment between the two robots. Recently, this problem was solved in the asynchonous model for fat robots that agree on at least one axis in the robots with lights model where each robot is equipped with an externally visible persistent light that can assume colors from a fixed set of colors [K. Bose, R. Adhikary, M. K. Kundu, and B. Sau. Arbitrary pattern formation by opaque fat robots with lights. CALDAM, pages 347-359, 2020]. In this work, we reduce the number of colors needed and remove the axis-agreement requirement in the fully synchronous model. In particular, we present an algorithm requiring 7 colors when scaling the target pattern is allowed and an 8-color algorithm if scaling is not allowed. Our algorithms run in $O(n) + O(q \log n)$ rounds with probability at least $1 - n^{-q}$.</description>

      <title>$O(k)$-Equivariant Dimensionality Reduction on Stiefel Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.10775v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many real-world datasets live on high-dimensional Stiefel and Grassmannian manifolds, $V_k(\mathbb{R}^N)$ and $Gr(k, \mathbb{R}^N)$ respectively, and benefit from projection onto lower-dimensional Stiefel and Grassmannian manifolds. In this work, we propose an algorithm called \textit{Principal Stiefel Coordinates (PSC)} to reduce data dimensionality from $ V_k(\mathbb{R}^N)$ to $V_k(\mathbb{R}^n)$ in an \textit{$O(k)$-equivariant} manner ($k \leq n \ll N$). We begin by observing that each element $\alpha \in V_n(\mathbb{R}^N)$ defines an isometric embedding of $V_k(\mathbb{R}^n)$ into $V_k(\mathbb{R}^N)$. Next, we describe two ways of finding a suitable embedding map $\alpha$: one via an extension of principal component analysis ($\alpha_{PCA}$), and one that further minimizes data fit error using gradient descent ($\alpha_{GD}$). Then, we define a continuous and $O(k)$-equivariant map $\pi_\alpha$ that acts as a "closest point operator" to project the data onto the image of $V_k(\mathbb{R}^n)$ in $V_k(\mathbb{R}^N)$ under the embedding determined by $\alpha$, while minimizing distortion. Because this dimensionality reduction is $O(k)$-equivariant, these results extend to Grassmannian manifolds as well. Lastly, we show that $\pi_{\alpha_{PCA}}$ globally minimizes projection error in a noiseless setting, while $\pi_{\alpha_{GD}}$ achieves a meaningfully different and improved outcome when the data does not lie exactly on the image of a linearly embedded lower-dimensional Stiefel manifold as above. Multiple numerical experiments using synthetic and real-world data are performed.</description>
