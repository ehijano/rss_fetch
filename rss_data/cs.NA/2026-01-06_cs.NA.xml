      <description>arXiv:2601.00986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article introduces a simple weak Galerkin (WG) finite element method for solving convection-diffusion-reaction equation. The proposed method offers significant flexibility by supporting discontinuous approximating functions on general nonconvex polytopal meshes. We establish rigorous error estimates within a suitable norm. Finally, numerical experiments are presented to validate the theoretical convergence rates and demonstrate the computational efficiency of the approach.</description>

      <title>On solving nonlinear simultaneous equations arising from the double-exponential Sinc-collocation method for initial value problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The double-exponential Sinc-collocation method is known as a super-accurate method for solving initial value problems of ordinary differential equations, for which the error decreases almost exponentially as a function of the number of sample points in the temporal direction, $N$. However, this method requires solving nonlinear simultaneous equations in $nN$ variables when the problem dimension is $n$. Recently, Ogata pointed out that Gauss-Seidel type fixed-point iteration works surprisingly well for solving these equations, typically reducing the error by one or two orders of magnitude at each iteration. In this paper, we analyze the convergence of this iteration and give a sufficient condition for its global convergence. We also provide an upper bound on its convergence factor, which explains the efficiency of this iteration. Some numerical examples that illustrate the validity of our analysis are also provided.</description>

      <title>Flow Matching Transport for Quasi-Monte Carlo Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-dimensional integration with respect to complex target measures remains a fundamental challenge in computational science. While Flow Matching (FM) offers a powerful paradigm for constructing continuous-time transport maps, its deployment in high-precision integration is severely limited by the discretization bias inherent to numerical ODE solvers and the lack of rigorous convergence guarantees when coupled with Quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) methods. This paper addresses these critical gaps by proposing Flow Matching Importance Sampling Quasi-Monte Carlo (FM-ISQMC), a framework designed to transform biased generative flows into unbiased, high-order integration schemes. Methodologically, we construct a transport map by composing a logistic base transformation with an Euler-discretized neural ODE field and employ importance sampling to correct for residual transport errors. Our central contribution is twofold. First, we establish a general convergence analysis for QMC importance sampling with arbitrary transport maps, identifying sufficient growth conditions for the $\mathcal{O}(N^{-1+\varepsilon})$ root-mean-square error rate. Second, we rigorously prove that the specific transport architecture of Flow Matching satisfies these conditions. Consequently, we establish a $\mathcal{O}(N^{-1+\varepsilon})$ root-mean-square error for the unbiased FM-ISQMC estimator, extending classical QMC theory to the realm of generative models. Numerical experiments validate that FM-ISQMC consistently breaks through the error floor observed in direct transport methods, delivering superior precision. This work thus bridges the divide between deep generative modeling and numerical integration.</description>

      <title>SaddleScape V1.0: A Python Package for Constructing Solution Landscapes via High-index Saddle Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present SaddleScape V1.0, a Python software package designed for the exploration and construction of solution landscapes in complex systems. The package implements the High-index Saddle Dynamics (HiSD) framework and its variants, including the Generalized HiSD for non-gradient systems and the Accelerated HiSD. SaddleScape V1.0 enables the systematic identification of critical points, including both local minima and high-index saddle points, by dynamically updating both the state estimate and an associated subspace characterizing the saddle's local manifold. It supports both gradient systems, defined by energy functions/functionals, and general non-gradient autonomous dynamical systems. Key features include automatic differentiation for symbolic inputs, numerical approximation techniques for Hessian-vector products, diverse eigenvalue solvers, and algorithms for constructing solution landscapes. The software offers a user-friendly interface with flexible parameter configuration, tools for trajectory and landscape visualization, and data export capabilities. By providing an efficient and accessible implementation of advanced saddle dynamics, SaddleScape V1.0 facilitates the construction of solution landscapes, empowering researchers in various scientific disciplines to gain deeper insights into the hierarchical structure of complex systems. The source code is available at the repository https://github.com/HiSDpackage/saddlescape. The package's introductory website is available at https://hisdpackage.github.io/saddlescape.</description>

      <title>Adaptive finite difference methods for the Willmore flow: mesh redistribution algorithm and tangential velocity approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop two adaptive finite difference methods for the numerical simulation of the Willmore flow, employing the kth-order backward differentiation formula (BDFk) for time discretization, together with monitor functions for dynamic mesh adaptation along evolving interfaces. The first approach is based on a weighted arc-length equidistribution strategy driven by a monitor function to adaptively redistribute grid points. An adaptive monitor selection mechanism, constructed from the curvature and its variation, enhances spatial resolution in regions of strong geometric complexity while preserving mesh regularity. The second approach eliminates explicit reparameterization by incorporating a tangential velocity into the Willmore flow, with mesh redistribution inherently embedded in the geometric evolution. We further develop an energy-stable correction algorithm for the second method to guarantee discrete energy stability at the theoretical level. In both approaches, the monitor function serves as the core component of the adaptive framework, encoding essential geometric information -- such as curvature and curvature variation -- to guide mesh refinement and redistribution. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed BDFk-based adaptive schemes accurately capture the geometric evolution of the Willmore flow and exhibit excellent robustness and computational efficiency for problems involving complex interface geometries.</description>

      <title>Convergence Analysis of PINNs for Fractional Diffusion Equations in Bounded Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the convergence of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for time-dependent fractional diffusion equations posed on bounded domains. The presence of fractional Laplacian operators introduces nonlocal behavior and regularity constraints, and standard neural network approximations do not naturally enforce the associated spectral boundary conditions. To address this challenge, we introduce a spectrally-defined mollification strategy that preserves the structure of the nonlocal operator while ensuring boundary compatibility. This enables the derivation of rigorous energy estimates in Sobolev spaces. Our results rely on analytical tools from PDE theory, highlighting the compatibility of PINN approximations with classical energy estimates for nonlocal equations. We prove convergence of the PINN approximation in any space-time Sobolev norm $H^k$ (with $k \in \N)$. The analysis highlights the role of mollified residuals in enabling theoretical guarantees for neural-network-based solvers of nonlocal PDEs.</description>

      <title>A parametric Keldysh decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contour integral algorithms seek to compute a small number of eigenvalues located within a bounded region of the complex plane. These methods can be applied to both linear and nonlinear matrix eigenvalue problems. In the latter case, the foundation of these methods comes from the Keldysh decomposition, which breaks the nonlinear matrix-valued function into two parts: a rational function whose poles match the desired eigenvalues, and a remainder term that is analytic within the target region. Under contour integration this analytic part vanishes (via Cauchy's theorem), leaving only the component containing the desired eigenvalues. We propose an extension of the Keldysh decomposition for matrix-valued functions that depend analytically on an additional parameter. We establish key properties of this parametric Keldysh decomposition, and introduce an algorithm for solving parametric nonlinear eigenvalue problems that is based upon it.</description>

      <title>A Unified Equilibrated Flux Recovery Framework with Robust A Posteriori Error Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the Equilibrated Averaging Residual Method (EARM), a unified equilibrated flux-recovery framework for elliptic interface problems that applies to a broad class of finite element discretizations. The method is applicable in both two and three dimensions and for arbitrary polynomial orders, and it enables the construction of computationally efficient recovered fluxes. We develop EARM for both discontinuous Galerkin (DG) and conforming finite element discretizations. For DG methods, EARM can be applied directly and yields an explicit recovered flux that coincides with state-of-the-art conservative flux reconstructions.
  For conforming discretizations, we further propose the Orthogonal Null-space--Eliminated EARM (ON-EARM), which ensures uniqueness by restricting the correction flux to the orthogonal complement of the divergence-free null space. We prove local conservation and establish a robust a~posteriori error estimator for the recovered flux in two dimensions, with robustness measured with respect to jumps in the diffusion coefficient. Numerical results in two and three dimensions confirm the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>A generalized Scharfetter-Gummel scheme for nonlocal cross-diffusion systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An implicit Euler finite-volume scheme for a nonlocal cross-diffusion system on the multidimensional torus is analyzed. The equations describe the dynamics of population species with repulsive or attractive interactions. The numerical scheme is based on a generalized Scharfetter-Gummel discretization of the nonlocal flux term. For merely integrable kernel functions, the scheme preserves the positivity, total mass, and entropy structure. The existence of a discrete solution and its convergence to a solution to the continuous problem, as the mesh size tends to zero, are shown. A key difficulty is the degeneracy of the generalized Bernoulli function in the Scharfetter-Gummel approximation. This issue is overcome by proving a uniform estimate for the discrete Fisher information, which requires both the Boltzmann and Rao entropy inequalities. Numerical simulations illustrate the features of the scheme in one and two space dimensions.</description>

      <title>Implicit and implicit--explicit high-order BDF methods for coupled elliptic--parabolic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: First-order fully implicit as well as implicit--explicit schemes for coupled elliptic-parabolic systems are discussed in [Ern and Meunier, ESAIM: M2AN, 2009] and [Altmann et al., Math.\ Comp., 2021], respectively. The extension of the analysis to higher-order (third-, fourth-, fifth-, and sixth-order) schemes is not straightforward since explicitly constructing $G$ matrices (G-stability) is often tricky. In this article, we develop fully implicit as well as implicit--explicit backward difference formula (BDF) schemes of order up to six. The implicit--explicit variants are decoupled, thereby enhancing computational efficiency; their convergence analysis requires a weak coupling condition on the poroelastic parameters. In contrast, no coupling conditions are needed for the fully implicit, coupled schemes. We determine novel and suitable multipliers for the two proposed classes and establish error estimates via the energy technique. A prominent advantage of these higher-order schemes is that, with almost the computational cost of first-order schemes, they greatly improve the accuracy.</description>

      <title>A Wachspress-based transfinite formulation for exactly enforcing Dirichlet boundary conditions on convex polygonal domains in physics-informed neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a Wachspress-based transfinite formulation on convex polygonal domains for exact enforcement of Dirichlet boundary conditions in physics-informed neural networks. This approach leverages prior advances in geometric design such as blending functions and transfinite interpolation over convex domains. For prescribed Dirichlet boundary function $\mathcal{B}$, the transfinite interpolant of $\mathcal{B}$, $g : \bar P \to C^0(\bar P)$, $\textit{lifts}$ functions from the boundary of a two-dimensional polygonal domain to its interior. The trial function is expressed as the difference between the neural network's output and the extension of its boundary restriction into the interior of the domain, with $g$ added to it. This ensures kinematic admissibility of the trial function in the deep Ritz method. Wachspress coordinates for an $n$-gon are used in the transfinite formula, which generalizes bilinear Coons transfinite interpolation on rectangles to convex polygons. The neural network trial function has a bounded Laplacian, thereby overcoming a limitation in a previous contribution where approximate distance functions were used to exactly enforce Dirichlet boundary conditions. For a point $\boldsymbol{x} \in \bar{P}$, Wachspress coordinates, $\boldsymbol{\lambda} : \bar P \to [0,1]^n$, serve as a geometric feature map for the neural network: $\boldsymbol{\lambda}$ encodes the boundary edges of the polygonal domain. This offers a framework for solving problems on parametrized convex geometries using neural networks. The accuracy of physics-informed neural networks and deep Ritz is assessed on forward, inverse, and parametrized geometric Poisson boundary-value problems.</description>

      <title>Sharp inverse statements for kernel approximation: Superconvergence and saturation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article establishes sharp inverse and saturation statements for kernel-based approximation using finitely smooth Sobolev kernels on bounded Lipschitz regions. The analysis focuses on the superconvergence regime, for which direct statements have only recently been obtained. The resulting theory yields a one-to-one correspondence between the smoothness of a target function - quantified in terms of power spaces - and the achievable approximation rates by kernel-based approximation. In this way, we extend existing results beyond the escaping-the-native-space regime and provide a unified characterization covering the full scale of admissible smoothness spaces.</description>

      <title>Approximation for stochastic time-space fractional cable equations driven by rough noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The time-space fractional cable equation arises from extending the generalized fractional Ohm's law to model anomalous diffusion processes. In this paper, we develop and analyze a numerical approximation for stochastic nonlinear time-space fractional cable equation driven by rough noise. The model involves both two nonlocal terms in time and one in space. By an operator theoretic approach, we establish the existence, uniqueness, and regularities of solutions. We also obtain a convergence result for the regularized equation via Wong-Zakai approximation to regularize the rough noise. The numerical scheme approximates the model in space by the standard spectral Galerkin method and in time by the backward Euler convolution quadrature method. After that, error estimates are established.</description>

      <title>An explicit scheme for stochastic Allen-Cahn equations with space-time white noise near the sharp interface limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article investigates time-discrete approximations of Allen-Cahn type SPDEs driven by space-time white noise near the sharp interface limit $\epsilon\to 0$, where the small parameter $\epsilon$ is the diffuse interface thickness. We propose an explicit and easily implementable exponential integrator with a modified nonlinearity for the considered problem. Uniform-in-time and uniform-in-$\epsilon$ moment bounds of the scheme are established and the convergence in total variation distance of order $O(T\cdot\text{Poly}(\epsilon^{-1})\tau^\gamma),\gamma&lt;\tfrac12$ is established, between the law of the numerical scheme and that of the SPDE over $[0,T]$. In contrast to the exponential dependence due to standard arguments, the obtained error bound depends on $\epsilon^{-1}$ and $T$ polynomially. By incorporating carefully chosen method parameters, we only require a mild and $\epsilon$-independent restriction on the time step-size $\tau$, getting rid of the severe restriction $\tau =O(\epsilon^\sigma),\sigma\geq1$ in the literature. Also, a uniform-in-time error bound of order $O(\tau^\gamma),\gamma&lt;\tfrac12$, is obtained for a fixed $\epsilon=1$, which improves the existing ones in the literature and matches the classical weak convergence rate in the globally Lipschitz setting. The error analysis is highly nontrivial due to the low regularity of the considered problem, the super-linear growth of the drift, the non-smooth observables inherent in the total variation metric and the presence of the small interface parameter $\epsilon\to0$. These difficulties are addressed by introducing a new strategy of nonlinearity modification and establishing refined regularity estimates for the associated Kolmogorov equation to an auxiliary process with non-smooth test functions. Numerical experiments confirm the theoretical convergence and the ability of interface-capturing for the proposed scheme.</description>

      <title>An unstructured second-order subgrid method for the shallow water equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new unstructured numerical subgrid method for solving the shallow water equations using a finite volume method with enhanced bathymetry resolution. The method employs an unstructured triangular mesh with support for triangulation of elements to form finer subgrids locally. The bathymetry is represented on the fine mesh, allowing the incorporation of small-scale features, while velocities are defined on the coarse mesh. The governing equations are solved numerically on the coarse mesh, making the method computationally cheaper compared to a traditional fine mesh computation. To accurately represent the velocities, we employ a second-order accurate WENO method and for temporal integration an explicit second-order accurate Runge-Kutta method. Furthermore, we present a novel subgrid face value reconstruction that accounts for partially wet cells, where only some of the subgrid cells are wet. Together with a newly developed gravity source term discretization, we demonstrate that the scheme is well-balanced on the subgrid level. Finally, the subgrid method is validated on several test cases to show: i) that the scheme is well-balanced, ii) confirm the order of the accuracy of the scheme, and iii) demonstrate the capability of handling moving flood and dry boundaries. We also highlight when it is beneficial to increase the number of subgrid cells to improve the results of the finite volume method.</description>

      <title>Energy Conserving Data Driven Discretizations for Maxwells Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study data-driven construction of spatial discretizations for the one-dimensional Maxwell system. Given high-fidelity training data generated by a spectral discretization, we learn a linear convolution stencil that approximates the spatial derivative operator appearing in Maxwell's equations. The stencil is obtained by solving a convex quadratic optimization problem, subject to linear constraints that enforce skew-adjointness of the discrete derivative. These constraints guarantee a semi-discrete energy identity for the resulting Maxwell system. We prove that our constraints characterize the class of skew-symmetric convolution operators and express the associated numerical wave speed and CFL restriction for the classical leapfrog scheme in terms of the learned stencil's Fourier symbol. We then compare several convex solvers for the resulting quadratic program -- projected gradient, Nesterov-accelerated gradient, ADMM, and an interior-point reference implemented in CVXPY -- and evaluate the learned schemes in time-dependent one-dimensional Maxwell simulations using a Crank--Nicolson (CN) time discretization. Our numerical experiments show that (i) energy-constrained learned stencils achieve accuracy comparable to standard central differences while exactly preserving the discrete electromagnetic energy under CN time-stepping, and (ii) ADMM and interior-point methods produce nearly identical operators, with ADMM offering a favorable tradeoff between accuracy, constraint satisfaction, and runtime.</description>

      <title>Multigoal-oriented adaptive finite element method with convergence rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formulate and analyze a goal-oriented adaptive finite element method for a symmetric linear elliptic partial differential equation (PDE) that can simultaneously deal with multiple linear goal functionals. In each step of the algorithm, only two linear finite element systems have to be solved. Moreover, all finite element solutions are computed with respect to the same discrete space, while the underlying triangulations are adapted to resolve all inherent singularities simultaneously. Unlike available results for such a setting in the literature, we give a thorough convergence analysis and verify that our algorithm guarantees, in an appropriate sense, even optimal convergence rates. Numerical experiments underline the derived theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Locally-averaged McCormick relaxations for discretization-regularized inverse problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, by means of a standard model problem, we devise an approach to computing approximate dual bounds for use in global optimization of coefficient identification in partial differential equations (PDEs) by, e.g., (spatial) branch-and-bound methods. Linearization is achieved by a McCormick relaxation (that is, replacing the bilinear PDE term by a linear one and adding inequality constraints), combined with local averaging to reduce the number of inequalities. Optimization-based bound tightening allows us to tighten the relaxation and thus reduce the induced error. Combining this with a quantification of the discretization error and the propagated noise, we prove that the resulting discretization regularizes the inverse problem, thus leading to an overall convergent scheme. Numerical experiments illustrate the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic condition numbers for linear ordinary differential equations: the generic real case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper \cite{M0} studied, for a \emph{complex} linear ordinary differential equation $y^\prime(t)=Ay(t)$, the long-time propagation to the solution $y(t)$ of a perturbation of the initial value. By measuring the perturbations with relative errors, this paper introduced a directional pointwise condition number, defined for a specific initial value and for a specific direction of perturbation of this initial value, and a pointwise condition number, defined for a specific initial value and the worst-case scenario for the direction of perturbation. The asymptotic (long-time) behaviors of these two condition numbers were determined. The present paper analyzes such asymptotic behaviors in depth, for a \emph{real} linear ordinary differential equation in a generic case.</description>

      <title>A quasi-orthogonal iterative method for eigenvalue problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.02108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For large-scale eigenvalue problems requiring many mutually orthogonal eigenvectors, traditional numerical methods suffer substantial computational and communication costs with limited parallel scalability, primarily due to explicit orthogonalization. To address these challenges, we propose a quasi-orthogonal iterative method that dispenses with explicit orthogonalization and orthogonal initial data. It inherently preserves quasi-orthogonality (the iterates asymptotically tend to be orthogonal) and enhances robustness against numerical perturbations. Rigorous analysis confirms its energy-decay property and convergence of energy, gradient, and iterate. Numerical experiments validate the theoretical results, demonstrate key advantages of strong robustness and high-precision numerical orthogonality preservation, and thereby position our iterative method as an efficient, stable alternative for large-scale eigenvalue computations.</description>

      <title>HyDRA: Hybrid Denoising Regularization for Measurement-Only DEQ Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solving image reconstruction problems of the form \(\mathbf{A} \mathbf{x} = \mathbf{y}\) remains challenging due to ill-posedness and the lack of large-scale supervised datasets. Deep Equilibrium (DEQ) models have been used successfully but typically require supervised pairs \((\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})\). In many practical settings, only measurements \(\mathbf{y}\) are available. We introduce HyDRA (Hybrid Denoising Regularization Adaptation), a measurement-only framework for DEQ training that combines measurement consistency with an adaptive denoising regularization term, together with a data-driven early stopping criterion. Experiments on sparse-view CT demonstrate competitive reconstruction quality and fast inference.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Control Methods for Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.01248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate a stochastic control framework for global optimization over both finite-dimensional Euclidean spaces and the Wasserstein space of probability measures. In the Euclidean setting, the original minimization problem is approximated by a family of regularized stochastic control problems; using dynamic programming, we analyze the associated Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman equations and obtain tractable representations via the Cole--Hopf transform and the Feynman--Kac formula. For optimization over probability measures, we formulate a regularized mean-field control problem characterized by a master equation, and further approximate it by controlled $N$-particle systems. We establish that, as the regularization parameter tends to zero (and as the particle number tends to infinity for the optimization over probability measures), the value of the control problem converges to the global minimum of the original objective. Building on the resulting probabilistic representations, Monte Carlo-based numerical schemes are proposed and numerical experiments are reported to illustrate the practical performance of the methods and to support the theoretical convergence rates.</description>

      <title>Sobolev Approximation of Deep ReLU Network in Log-weighted Barron Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Universal approximation theorems show that neural networks can approximate any continuous function; however, the number of parameters may grow exponentially with the ambient dimension, so these results do not fully explain the practical success of deep models on high-dimensional data. Barron space theory addresses this: if a target function belongs to a Barron space, a two-layer network with $n$ parameters achieves an $O(n^{-1/2})$ approximation error in $L^2$. Yet classical Barron spaces $\mathscr{B}^{s+1}$ still require stronger regularity than Sobolev spaces $H^s$, and existing depth-sensitive results often assume constraints such as $sL \le 1/2$. In this paper, we introduce a log-weighted Barron space $\mathscr{B}^{\log}$, which requires a strictly weaker assumption than $\mathscr{B}^s$ for any $s&gt;0$. For this new function space, we first study embedding properties and carry out a statistical analysis via the Rademacher complexity. Then we prove that functions in $\mathscr{B}^{\log}$ can be approximated by deep ReLU networks with explicit depth dependence. We then define a family $\mathscr{B}^{s,\log}$, establish approximation bounds in the $H^1$ norm, and identify maximal depth scales under which these rates are preserved. Our results clarify how depth reduces regularity requirements for efficient representation, offering a more precise explanation for the performance of deep architectures beyond the classical Barron setting, and for their stable use in high-dimensional problems used today.</description>

      <title>Latent Space Element Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How can we build surrogate solvers that train on small domains but scale to larger ones without intrusive access to PDE operators? Inspired by the Data-Driven Finite Element Method (DD-FEM) framework for modular data-driven solvers, we propose the Latent Space Element Method (LSEM), an element-based latent surrogate assembly approach in which a learned subdomain ("element") model can be tiled and coupled to form a larger computational domain. Each element is a LaSDI latent ODE surrogate trained from snapshots on a local patch, and neighboring elements are coupled through learned directional interaction terms in latent space, avoiding Schwarz iterations and interface residual evaluations. A smooth window-based blending reconstructs a global field from overlapping element predictions, yielding a scalable assembled latent dynamical system. Experiments on the 1D Burgers and Korteweg-de Vries equations show that LSEM maintains predictive accuracy while scaling to spatial domains larger than those seen in training. LSEM offers an interpretable and extensible route toward foundation-model surrogate solvers built from reusable local models.</description>

      <title>Can Large Language Models Solve Engineering Equations? A Systematic Comparison of Direct Prediction and Solver-Assisted Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01774v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transcendental equations requiring iterative numerical solution pervade engineering practice, from fluid mechanics friction factor calculations to orbital position determination. We systematically evaluate whether Large Language Models can solve these equations through direct numerical prediction or whether a hybrid architecture combining LLM symbolic manipulation with classical iterative solvers proves more effective. Testing six state-of-the-art models (GPT-5.1, GPT-5.2, Gemini-3-Flash, Gemini-2.5-Lite, Claude-Sonnet-4.5, Claude-Opus-4.5) on 100 problems spanning seven engineering domains, we compare direct prediction against solver-assisted computation where LLMs formulate governing equations and provide initial conditions while Newton-Raphson iteration performs numerical solution. Direct prediction yields mean relative errors of 0.765 to 1.262 across models, while solver-assisted computation achieves 0.225 to 0.301, representing error reductions of 67.9% to 81.8%. Domain-specific analysis reveals dramatic improvements in Electronics (93.1%) due to exponential equation sensitivity, contrasted with modest gains in Fluid Mechanics (7.2%) where LLMs exhibit effective pattern recognition. These findings establish that contemporary LLMs excel at symbolic manipulation and domain knowledge retrieval but struggle with precision-critical iterative arithmetic, suggesting their optimal deployment as intelligent interfaces to classical numerical solvers rather than standalone computational engines.</description>

      <title>Self-Similar Solutions and Global Existence for Nonlinear Reaction-Diffusion Systems in Industrial Ammonia Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates a system of nonlinear reaction-diffusion equations modeling the industrial synthesis of ammonia. By applying Lie group analysis, we construct self-similar solutions and derive a reduced system of ordinary differential equations. Using comparison principles and barrier techniques, we establish sufficient conditions for the existence of global-in-time solutions in both slow-diffusion ($\gamma_i &gt; 0$) and fast-diffusion ($\gamma_i &lt; 0$) regimes. Detailed asymptotic analysis near the diffusion front reveals power-law behavior of concentration profiles, with explicit expressions for the decay exponents. The theoretical results are illustrated by numerical simulations, demonstrating the spatio-temporal evolution of reactant concentrations under realistic parameter values. The study provides rigorous mathematical foundations for predicting and optimizing ammonia production in catalytic reactors, with potential extensions to other chemically reacting systems.</description>

      <title>A stable and accurate X-FFT solver for linear elastic homogenization problems in 3D</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.02172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although FFT-based methods are renowned for their numerical efficiency and stability, traditional discretizations fail to capture material interfaces that are not aligned with the grid, resulting in suboptimal accuracy. To address this issue, the work at hand introduces a novel FFT-based solver that achieves interface-conforming accuracy for three-dimensional mechanical problems. More precisely, we integrate the extended finite element (X-FEM) discretization into the FFT-based framework, leveraging its ability to resolve discontinuities via additional shape functions. We employ the modified abs(olute) enrichment and develop a preconditioner based on the concept of strongly stable GFEM, which mitigates the conditioning issues observed in traditional X-FEM implementations. Our computational studies demonstrate that the developed X-FFT solver achieves interface-conforming accuracy, numerical efficiency, and stability when solving three-dimensional linear elastic homogenization problems with smooth material interfaces.</description>

      <title>Computing exponential of tridiagonal Toeplitz matrices with applications to numerical solution of the heat equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.02295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2011.02295v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The computation of the exponential of a tridiagonal matrix and its applications have always been of interest. One application considered here is when the method of lines is used to solve the heat equation, where the equation is transformed into a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs), and this system has a solution that depends on the exponential of a tridiagonal Toeplitz matrix. Strang and MacNamara presented an approximate method for computing the exponential of a symmetric tridiagonal Toeplitz matrix that appears in the solution of ODEs. Their method is based on approximating the entries of the exponential matrix with modified Bessel functions of the first kind at certain values, and accordingly, the exponential matrix is decomposed as the difference of a Toeplitz matrix and a Hankel matrix. Here, we aim to extend this idea to the general case of tridiagonal Toeplitz matrices and stabilize the method by approximating the matrix exponential with a banded matrix, which makes the complexity of computing the exponential matrix independent of the matrix size. Additionally, we provide an error analysis for these methods and a bound for the entries of the exponential of the tridiagonal Toeplitz matrices. As a main contribution of this work, the idea is implemented to solve the heat equation, and the uniform stability of the method is proved. By using a splitting approach, the method is generalized for two-dimensional problems. Numerical illustrations demonstrate the efficiency of the new methods and bounds.</description>

      <title>Fast Numerical Approximation of Parabolic Problems Using Model Order Reduction and the Laplace Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02847v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a method for the fast numerical approximation of linear, second-order parabolic partial differential equations (PDEs for short) with time-independent coefficients based on model order reduction techniques and the Laplace transform. We start by applying this transform to the evolution problem, thus yielding a time-independent boundary value problem solely depending on the complex Laplace variable. In an offline stage, we judiciously sample the Laplace variable and numerically solve the corresponding collection of high-fidelity or full-order problems. Next, we apply a proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) to this collection of solutions in order to obtain a reduced basis in the Laplace domain. We project the linear parabolic problem onto this basis and then, using any suitable time-stepping method, we solve the evolution problem. A key insight to justify the implementation and analysis of the proposed method consists of using Hardy spaces of analytic functions and establishing, through the Paley--Wiener theorem, an isometry between the solution of the time-dependent problem and its Laplace transform. As a result, one may conclude that computing a POD with samples taken in the Laplace domain produces an exponentially accurate reduced basis for the time-dependent problem. Numerical experiments illustrate the performance of the method in terms of accuracy and, in particular, speed-up when compared to the solution obtained by solving the full-order model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05809v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We point out that (continuous or discontinuous) piecewise linear functions on a convex polytope mesh can be represented by two-hidden-layer ReLU neural networks in a weak sense. In addition, the numbers of neurons of the two hidden layers required to weakly represent are accurately given based on the numbers of polytopes and hyperplanes involved in this mesh. The results naturally hold for constant and linear finite element functions. Such weak representation establishes a bridge between two-hidden-layer ReLU neural networks and finite element functions, and leads to a perspective for analyzing approximation capability of ReLU neural networks in $L^p$ norm via finite element functions. Moreover, we discuss the strict representation for tensor finite element functions via the recent tensor neural networks.</description>

      <title>On the Continuity of Schur-Horn Mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00701v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Schur-Horn theorem is a well-known result that characterizes the relationship between the diagonal elements and eigenvalues of a symmetric (Hermitian) matrix. In this paper, we extend this theorem by exploring the eigenvalue perturbation of a symmetric (Hermitian) matrix with fixed diagonals, which is referred to as the continuity of the Schur-Horn mapping. We introduce a concept called strong Schur-Horn continuity, characterized by minimal constraints on the perturbation. We demonstrate that several categories of matrices exhibit strong Schur-Horn continuity. Leveraging this notion, along with a majorization constraint on the perturbation, we prove the Schur-Horn continuity for general symmetric (Hermitian) matrices. The Schur-Horn continuity finds applications in oblique manifold optimization related to quantum computing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09442v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two-grid theory plays a fundamental role in the design and analysis of multigrid methods. This paper is devoted to a new convergence analysis of two-grid methods for singular and symmetric positive semidefinite systems. Specifically, we derive a concise identity for characterizing the convergence factor of two-grid methods, with the Moore--Penrose inverse of coarse-grid matrix being used as a coarse solver. Furthermore, we present a convergence estimate for two-grid methods with approximate coarse solvers. Our new theory does not require any additional assumptions on the coefficient matrix, especially on its null space.</description>

      <title>Weighted approximate sampling recovery and integration based on B-spline interpolation and quasi-interpolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01167v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose novel methods for approximate sampling recovery and integration of functions in the Freud-weighted Sobolev space $W^r_{p,w}(\mathbb{R})$. The approximation error of sampling recovery is measured in the norm of the Freud-weighted Lebesgue space $L_{q,w}(\mathbb{R})$. Namely, we construct equidistant compact-supported B-spline quasi-interpolation and interpolation sampling algorithms $Q_{\rho,m}$ and $P_{\rho,m}$ which are asymptotically optimal in terms of the sampling $n$-widths $\varrho_n(\boldsymbol{W}^r_{p,w}(\mathbb{R}), L_{q,w}(\mathbb{R}))$ for every pair $p,q \in [1,\infty]$, and prove the right convergence rate of these sampling $n$-widths, where $\boldsymbol{W}^r_{p,w}(\mathbb{R})$ denotes the unit ball in $W^r_{p,w}(\mathbb{R})$. The algorithms $Q_{\rho,m}$ and $P_{\rho,m}$ are based on truncated scaled B-spline quasi-interpolation and interpolation, respectively. We also prove the asymptotical optimality and right convergence rate of the equidistant quadratures generated from $Q_{\rho,m}$ and $P_{\rho,m}$, for Freud-weighted numerical integration of functions in $W^r_{p,w}(\mathbb{R})$.</description>

      <title>Vectorized Parallel in Time methods for low-order discretizations with application to Porous Media problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02117v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High order methods have shown great potential to overcome performance issues of simulations of partial differential equations (PDEs) on modern hardware, still many users stick to low-order, matrix-based simulations, in particular in porous media applications. Heterogeneous coefficients and low regularity of the solution are reasons not to employ high order discretizations. We present a new approach for the simulation of instationary PDEs that allows to partially mitigate the performance problems. By reformulating the original problem we derive a parallel in time time integrator that increases the arithmetic intensity and introduces additional structure into the problem. By this it helps accelerate matrix-based simulations on modern hardware architectures. Based on a system for multiple time steps we will formulate a matrix equation that can be solved using vectorized solvers like Block Krylov methods. The structure of this approach makes it applicable for a wide range of linear and nonlinear problems. In our numerical experiments we present some first results for three different PDEs, a linear convection-diffusion equation, a nonlinear diffusion-reaction equation and a realistic example based on the Richards' equation.</description>

      <title>Energy-based modeling for field-circuit coupling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13036v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a generalized energy-based modeling framework extending recent formulations tailored for differential-algebraic equations. The proposed structure, inspired by the port-Hamiltonian formalism, ensures passivity, preserves the power balance, and facilitates the consistent interconnection of subsystems. A particular focus is put on low-frequency power applications in electrical engineering. Stranded, solid, and foil conductor models are investigated in the context of the eddy current problem. Each conductor model is shown to fit into the generalized energy-based structure, which allows their structure-preserving coupling with electrical circuits described by modified nodal analysis. Theoretical developments are validated through a numerical simulation of an oscillator circuit, demonstrating energy conservation in lossless scenarios and controlled dissipation when eddy currents are present. The applicability of the methodology towards engineering applications is studied through a numerical simulation of a nonlinear three-phase transformer.</description>

      <title>Local spectral approximation of unbounded operators: non-asymptotic and unified error quantification for subspace methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07513v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a framework for subspace methods which approximate the spectra of self-adjoint, unbounded operators in a local region. Using the projection-valued measure, we derive integrated spectral inequalities that also apply to unbounded operators. Our framework is non-asymptotic, gap-independent, and enables a unified error quantification of numerical routines subject to multiple error sources. Furthermore, we formalize the class of methods applicable to our framework, and establish a rigorous foundation for dimension detection in the presence of noise as solution to frequent numerical artifacts such as spectral pollution. The practical relevance of this non-asymptotic analysis is substantiated by its recent application to sampled prolate filter diagonalization, where it successfully predicted a sharp accuracy transition linking spectral density to the minimal observation time required to decompose a signal.</description>

      <title>Surface stability of a layered magnetoelastic half-space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10660v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We evaluate the conditions for surface stability of a layered magnetoelastic half-space subjected to large deformations and a magnetic field. After reviewing the fundamental measures of deformation and summarizing the magnetostatic equations in Eulerian and Lagrangian forms, we derive the constitutive relations from a total energy function dependent on the deformation gradient and Lagrangian magnetic induction. Energy principles yield the equilibrium equations, magnetic field equations, and boundary conditions. The second variation of the energy functional provides the incremental equations and conditions for stability analysis. Surface instability is studied by linearizing increments of deformation and magnetic induction about a finitely deformed state under a magnetic field normal to the surface. Four illustrative cases are considered: (i) a layered non-magnetizable half-space with varying stiffness contrast; (ii) the critical stretch of a magnetoelastic half-space as a function of magnetic induction; (iii) surface stability of a magneto-sensitive layer atop a non-magnetizable substrate; and (iv) bifurcation conditions in a two-layered magnetoelastic solid with different stiffness ratios. Graphical results are provided throughout.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18649v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a parametrix approach for constructing solutions and establishing grid-size independent estimates for semi-discrete heat equations with variable coefficients. While the classical continuous setting benefits from Gaussian estimates of the constant coefficient heat kernel, such estimates are not available in the semi-discrete context. To address this complication, we derive estimates involving products of heavy-tailed Lorentz (also known as Cauchy) probability densities. These Lorentzian estimates provide a sufficient handle on certain iterated convolutions involving Bessel functions, enabling us to achieve convergence of the parametrix approach.</description>

      <title>Parallel-in-Time Preconditioning for Time-Dependent Variational Mean Field Games</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01958v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the numerical approximation of a time-dependent variational mean field game system with local couplings and either periodic or Neumann boundary conditions. Following a variational approach, we employ a finite difference discretization and solve the resulting finite-dimensional optimization problem using the Chambolle--Pock primal--dual algorithm. As this involves computing proximal operators and solving ill-conditioned linear systems at each iteration, we embed within our solver a general class of parallel-in-time preconditioners based on suitably-chosen diagonalization techniques, applied using discrete Fourier transforms. These enable efficient, scalable iterative solvers for each linear system, with robustness across a wide range of viscosities. We further develop fast solvers for the resulting ill-conditioned systems arising at each time step, using exact recursive schemes for structured grids while allowing for other geometries. Numerical experiments confirm the improved performance and parallel scalability of our approach.</description>

      <title>Long-time relative error analysis for linear ordinary differential equations with perturbed initial value</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08752v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the propagation of initial value perturbations along the solution of a linear ordinary differential equation \( y'(t) = Ay(t) \). This propagation is analyzed using the relative error rather than the absolute error. Our focus is on the long-term behavior of this relative error, which differs significantly from that of the absolute error. The present paper is a practical sequel to the theoretical papers \cite{M1,M2} on the long-time behavior of the relative error: it includes applicative examples and important issues not addressed in \cite{M1,M2}. In addition, the present paper shows that understanding the long-term behavior provides insights into the growth of the relative error over all times, not just at large times. Therefore, it represents a crucial and fundamental aspect of the conditioning of linear ordinary differential equations, with applications in, for example, non-normal dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08762v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We are interested in the relative
  conditioning of the problem $y_0\mapsto \mathrm{e}^{tA}y_0$, i.e., the
  relative conditioning of the action of the matrix exponential $\mathrm{e}%
  ^{tA}$ on a vector with respect to perturbations of this vector. The present paper is a qualitative study of the long-time behavior of this
  conditioning. In other words, we are interested in studying the propagation to the solution $y(t)$ of perturbations of the initial value for a linear ordinary differential equation $y^\prime(t)=Ay(t)$, by measuring these perturbations with relative errors. We introduce three condition numbers: the first considers a specific initial value and a specific direction of perturbation; the second considers a specific initial value and the worst case by varying the direction of perturbation; and the third considers the worst case by varying both the initial value
  and the direction of perturbation. The long-time behaviors of
  these three condition numbers are studied.</description>

      <title>Generalized Scattering Matrix Framework for Modeling Implantable Antennas in Multilayered Spherical Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13119v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a unified and computationally efficient framework for modeling antennas embedded in spherically stratified media, applicable to implantable biomedical antennas and radome-enclosed systems. The method separates the characterization of the radiator from that of the surrounding medium by combining the antenna's free-space generalized scattering matrix (GSM) with a set of extended spherical scattering operators (SSOs). This decoupling enables rapid reevaluation under arbitrary changes of the spherical medium without re-simulating the antenna, yielding orders-of-magnitude speedups over traditional DGF-based MoM approaches. The SSO formulation accommodates multilayer, radially inhomogeneous, and radially uniaxial anisotropic profiles, and the GSM can be obtained from diverse numerical solvers or far-field data, supporting array-level synthesis and measurement-driven modeling. Extensive examples confirm excellent agreement with full-wave and DGF-based solutions, demonstrating the accuracy, generality, and practical versatility of the proposed framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.13429v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a domain-decomposition pore-network method (DD-PNM) for modeling single-phase Stokes flow in porous media. The method combines the accuracy of finite-element discretizations on body-fitted meshes within pore subdomains with a sparse global coupling enforced through interface unknowns. Local Dirichlet-to-Neumann operators are precomputed from finite-element solutions for each pore subdomain, enabling a global Schur-complement system defined solely on internal interfaces. Rigorous mathematical analysis establishes solvability and discrete mass conservation of the global system. Moreover, we constructively recover classical pore-network models by fitting half-throat conductivities to local Dirichlet-to-Neumann maps, providing a principled bridge between mesh-based and network-based frameworks. Numerical results are presented to demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of the overall methodology.</description>

Abstract: This paper establishes the first-order convergence rate for the ergodic error of numerical approximations to a class of stochastic ODEs (SODEs) with superlinear coefficients and multiplicative noise. By leveraging the generator approach to the Stein method, we derive a general error representation formula for one-step numerical schemes. Under suitable dissipativity and smoothness conditions, we prove that the error between the accurate invariant measure $\pi$ and the numerical invariant measure $\pi_\tau$ is of order $\mathscr{O}(\tau)$, which is sharp. Our framework applies to several recently studied schemes, including the tamed Euler, projected Euler, and backward Euler methods.</description>

      <title>Data-driven dimensionally decomposed generalized polynomial chaos expansion for forward uncertainty quantification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.22642v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dimensionally decomposed generalized polynomial chaos expansion (DD-GPCE) efficiently performs forward uncertainty quantification (UQ) in complex engineering systems with high-dimensional random inputs of arbitrary distributions. However, constructing the measure-consistent orthonormal polynomial bases in DD-GPCE requires prior knowledge of input distributions, which is often unavailable in practice. This work introduces a data-driven DD-GPCE method that eliminates the need for such prior knowledge, extending its applicability to UQ with high-dimensional inputs. Input distributions are inferred directly from sample data using smoothed-bootstrap kernel density estimation (KDE), while the DD-GPCE framework enables KDE to handle high-dimensional inputs through low-dimensional marginal estimation. We then use the estimated input distributions to perform a whitening transformation via Monte Carlo Simulation, which enables generation of measure-consistent orthonormal basis functions. We demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed method in both mathematical examples and stochastic dynamic analysis for a practical three-dimensional mobility design involving twenty random inputs. The results indicate that the proposed method produces more accurate estimates of the output mean and variance compared to the conventional data-driven approach that assumes Gaussian input distributions.</description>

      <title>A polynomially accelerated fixed-point iteration for vector problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09012v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fixed-point solvers are ubiquitous in nonlinear PDEs, yet their progress collapses whenever the Jacobian at the solution carries an eigenvalue arbitrarily close to one. We ask whether such stagnation can be removed without storing long histories or solving dense least squares. Under two assumptions -- (A1) the linearised error $e_n$ is dominated by a multiplier $m$ with $|m|&lt;1$ and (A2) residuals shrink monotonically -- we construct a quadratic blend of three iterates whose error polynomial has a double root at $m$. This three-point polynomial accelerator (TPA) cancels the stubborn mode up to $o(\|e_n\|)$, reduces to Aitken's $\Delta^2$ process in one dimension, and matches a doubly blended Anderson step with depth $m=2$ when the regularisation vanishes, yet it keeps the Picard memory footprint. The only extra ingredient is a residual-based estimate of $w=(1-m)^{-1}$ obtained from a closed-form regularised least-squares fit that remains stable even when two residuals nearly coincide. Numerical experiments on linear systems with clustered spectra, a $320$-dimensional nonlinear $\tanh$ fixed point, and a $50\times 50$ Poisson discretisation show that TPA reaches the $10^{-8}$ residual tolerance in $32$, $36$, and $244$ map evaluations (respectively). In the same settings SOR requires $663$ steps and Anderson acceleration with depth $m=5$ consumes $52$, $38$, and $955$ evaluations. TPA therefore supplies a parameter-free, constant-memory drop-in accelerator whenever a single contraction factor throttles convergence.</description>

      <title>Hybrid coupling with operator inference and the overlapping Schwarz alternating method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20687v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel hybrid approach for coupling subdomain-local non-intrusive Operator Inference (OpInf) reduced order models (ROMs) with each other and with subdomain-local high-fidelity full order models (FOMs) with using the overlapping Schwarz alternating method (O-SAM). The proposed methodology addresses significant challenges in multiscale modeling and simulation, particularly the long runtime and complex mesh generation requirements associated with traditional high-fidelity simulations. By leveraging the flexibility of O-SAM, we enable the seamless integration of disparate models, meshes, and time integration schemes, enhancing computational efficiency while maintaining high accuracy. Our approach is demonstrated through a series of numerical experiments on complex three-dimensional (3D) solid dynamics problems, showcasing speedups of up to 106x compared to conventional FOM-FOM couplings. This work paves the way for more efficient simulation workflows in engineering applications, with potential extensions to a wide range of partial differential equations.</description>

      <title>Neural Multiscale Decomposition for Solving The Nonlinear Klein-Gordon Equation with Time Oscillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00266v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a neural multiscale decomposition method (NeuralMD) for solving the nonlinear Klein-Gordon equation (NKGE) with a dimensionless parameter $\varepsilon\in(0,1]$ from the relativistic regime to the nonrelativistic limit regime. The solution of the NKGE propagates waves with wavelength at $O(1)$ and $O(\varepsilon^2)$ in space and time, respectively, which brings the oscillation in time. Existing collocation-based methods for solving this equation lead to spectral bias and propagation failure. To mitigate the spectral bias induced by high-frequency time oscillation, we employ a multiscale time integrator (MTI) to absorb the time oscillation into the phase. This decomposes the NKGE into a nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with wave operator (NLSW) with well-prepared initial data and a remainder equation with small initial data. As $\varepsilon \to 0$, the NKGE converges to the NLSW at rate $O(\varepsilon^{2})$, and the contribution of the remainder equation becomes negligible. Furthermore, to alleviate propagation failure caused by medium-frequency time oscillation, we propose a gated gradient correlation correction strategy to enforce temporal coherence in collocation-based methods. As a result, the approximation of the remainder term is no longer affected by propagation failure. Comparative experiments with existing collocation-based methods demonstrate the superior performance of our method for solving the NKGE with various regularities of initial data over the whole regime.</description>

      <title>A fast stochastic interacting particle-field method for 3D parabolic parabolic Chemotaxis systems: numerical algorithms and error analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03452v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a novel numerical framework, namely the stochastic interacting particle-field method with particle-in-cell acceleration (SIPF-PIC), for the efficient simulation of the three-dimensional (3D) parabolic-parabolic Keller-Segel (KS) systems. The SIPF-PIC method integrates Lagrangian particle dynamics with spectral field solvers by leveraging localized particle-grid interpolations and fast Fourier transform (FFT) techniques. For $P$ particles and $H$ Fourier modes per spatial dimension, the SIPF-PIC method achieves a computational complexity of $O(P + H^3 \log H)$ per time step, a significant improvement over the original SIPF method (proposed in \cite{SIPF1}), which has a computational complexity of $O(PH^3)$, while preserving numerical accuracy. Moreover, we carry out a rigorous error analysis for the proposed method and establish the corresponding error estimates. Finally, we present numerical experiments to validate the convergence order and demonstrate the computational efficiency of SIPF-PIC. Further numerical experiments show the method's capability of capturing complex blowup dynamics beyond single-point collapse, including ring-shaped singularities.</description>

      <title>Convergence of a L2 regularized Policy Gradient Algorithm for the Multi Armed Bandit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06388v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although Multi Armed Bandit (MAB) on one hand and the policy gradient approach on the other hand are among the most used frameworks of Reinforcement Learning, the theoretical properties of the policy gradient algorithm used for MAB have not been given enough attention. We investigate in this work the convergence of such a procedure for the situation when a $L2$ regularization term is present jointly with the 'softmax' parametrization. We prove convergence under appropriate technical hypotheses and test numerically the procedure including situations beyond the theoretical setting. The tests show that a time dependent regularized procedure can improve over the canonical approach especially when the initial guess is far from the solution.</description>

      <title>A split-step Christov method for approximating rational PDE solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04013v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rational solutions of partial differential equations (PDEs) are notoriously difficult to approximate via spectral Fourier methods due to their algebraically slow decay rate. In this work we discuss approximating rational PDE solutions in a basis of orthogonal functions known as the Fourier series, allowing for the computation of its spectrum via the fast Fourier transform. Spectral differentiation matrices are derived. Several explicit fourth-order split-step integrators are derived and their performance compared. As an application, rogue wave solutions in a family of nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations are explored. Perturbing the constant background is found to generate rogue wave-like structures. The effects of higher-order dispersion and generalized nonlinearities are also examined.</description>

      <title>Generic Cuspidal Points and Their Localization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15762v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we consider generic coalescing of eigenvalues of smooth complex valued matrix functions depending on 2 parameters. We call generic cuspidal points the parameter values where eigenvalues coalesce and we discuss the relation between cuspidal points and the closely related exceptional points studied in the literature. By considering loops in parameter space enclosing the cuspidal points, we rigorously prove when there is a phase accumulation for the eigenvectors and further detail how, by looking at the periodicity of the eigenvalues along the loop, and/or by looking at the aforementioned phase accumulation, one may be able to localize generic cuspidal points.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.25781v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), whose design is inspired-rather than dictated-by the Kolmogorov superposition theorem, have emerged as a structured alternative to MLPs. This review provides a systematic and comprehensive overview of the rapidly expanding KAN literature.
  The review is organized around three core themes: (i) clarifying the relationships between KANs and Kolmogorov superposition theory (KST), MLPs, and classical kernel methods; (ii) analyzing basis functions as a central design axis; and (iii) summarizing recent advances in accuracy, efficiency, regularization, and convergence.
  Finally, we provide a practical "Choose-Your-KAN" guide and outline open research challenges and future directions. The accompanying GitHub repository serves as a structured reference for ongoing KAN research.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04947v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a class of fourth-order quasilinear degenerate parabolic equations under both time-and space-dependent and time-and space-independent forces, modeling non-Newtonian thin-film flow over a solid surface in the "complete wetting" regime. By analyzing the quantitative properties of solutions to non-autonomous differential inequalities and employing refined integral estimates, we derive two-sided convergence rate estimates for the solution. Numerical simulations are further provided to illustrate the consistency of our main results with the observed physical phenomena.</description>

      <title>Complete Characterizations of Well-Posedness in Parametric Composite Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14124v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper provides complete characterization of well-posedness for Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) systems associated with general problems of perturbed composite optimization. Leveraging the property of parabolic regularity for composite models, we show that the second-order subderivative of the cost function reduces to the novel second-order variational function playing a crucial role in the subsequent analysis. This foundational result implies that the strong second-order sufficient condition introduced in this work for the general class of composite optimization problems naturally extends the classical second-order sufficient condition in nonlinear programming. Then we obtain several equivalent characterizations of the second-order qualification condition (SOQC) and highlight its equivalence to the constraint nondegeneracy condition under the $\mathcal{C}^{2}$-cone reducibility assumption. These insights lead us to multiple equivalent conditions for the major Lipschitz-like/Aubin property of KKT systems, including SOQC combined with the new second-order subdifferential condition and SOQC combined with tilt stability of local minimizers. Furthermore, under $\mathcal{C}^{2}$-cone reducibility, we prove that the Lipschitz-like property of the reference KKT system is equivalent to its strong regularity. Finally, we demonstrate that the Lipschitz-like property is equivalent to the nonsingularity of the generalized Jacobian associated with the KKT system under a certain verifiable assumption. These results provide a unified and rigorous framework for analyzing stability and sensitivity of solutions to composite optimization problems, as well as for the design and justification of numerical algorithms.</description>

      <title>A first-order method for nonconvex-strongly-concave constrained minimax optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22909v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study a nonconvex-strongly-concave constrained minimax problem. Specifically, we propose a first-order augmented Lagrangian method for solving it, whose subproblems are nonconvex-strongly-concave unconstrained minimax problems and suitably solved by a first-order method developed in this paper that leverages the strong concavity structure. Under suitable assumptions, the proposed method achieves an operation complexity of $O(\varepsilon^{-3.5}\log\varepsilon^{-1})$, measured in terms of its fundamental operations, for finding an $\varepsilon$-KKT solution of the constrained minimax problem, which improves the previous best-known operation complexity by a factor of $\varepsilon^{-0.5}$.</description>

      <title>Precision Autotuning for Linear Solvers via Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00728v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a reinforcement learning (RL) framework for adaptive precision tuning of linear solvers, and can be extended to general algorithms. The framework is formulated as a contextual bandit problem and solved using incremental action-value estimation with a discretized state space to select optimal precision configurations for computational steps, balancing precision and computational efficiency. To verify its effectiveness, we apply the framework to iterative refinement for solving linear systems $Ax = b$. In this application, our approach dynamically chooses precisions based on calculated features from the system. In detail, a Q-table maps discretized features (e.g., approximate condition number and matrix norm)to actions (chosen precision configurations for specific steps), optimized via an epsilon-greedy strategy to maximize a multi-objective reward balancing accuracy and computational cost. Empirical results demonstrate effective precision selection, reducing computational cost while maintaining accuracy comparable to double-precision baselines. The framework generalizes to diverse out-of-sample data and offers insight into utilizing RL precision selection for other numerical algorithms, advancing mixed-precision numerical methods in scientific computing. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work on precision autotuning with RL and verified on unseen datasets.</description>
