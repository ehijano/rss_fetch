      <title>Unraveling subsurface crustal dynamics: exploring electrical and seismic refraction methods from theories to existing and machine learning-based emerging prospects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This comprehensive review explores electrical and seismic refraction methods, including their emerging techniques, namely electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) and seismic refraction tomography (SRT). It discusses their crucial roles in understanding surface-subsurface crustal dynamics, outlining their principles, strengths, and limitations. Additionally, it provides insights into the induced polarization method and briefly discusses the self-potential method. The review thoroughly examines the mapping of surface-subsurface resistivity and velocity structures, crucial for comprehending Earth's surface, deep crustal, and hazard processes. Despite the numerous benefits of these techniques, challenges persist, necessitating multidisciplinary approaches due to lithology heterogeneities, geological process nuances, and geophysical data uncertainties. Hence, the emergence of machine learning and deep learning in ERT and SRT significantly enhances their accuracy in inversion modeling and geological feature identification. This integration of domain-specific knowledge with data- and image-driven approaches effectively addresses subsurface characterization challenges. Case studies utilizing real-time field electrical and seismic P-wave velocity datasets illustrate concepts, accompanied by the development of new methodological frameworks and analytical modeling. These frameworks provide systematic data modeling, facilitating velocity-resistivity relationships for enhanced geological characterization. This evidence underscores the importance of leveraging state-of-the-art techniques to obtain a broader range of parameters for subsurface structure delineation, environmental risk assessment, and informed decision-making. Ongoing research innovation is anticipated to continue improving capabilities in subsurface geophysical exploration.</description>

      <title>Seismic traveltime simulation for variable velocity models using physics-informed Fourier neural operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.03751v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Seismic traveltime is critical information conveyed by seismic waves, widely utilized in various geophysical applications. Conventionally, the simulation of seismic traveltime involves solving the eikonal equation. However, the efficiency of traditional numerical solvers is hindered, as they are typically capable of simulating seismic traveltime for only a single source at a time. Recently, deep learning tools, particularly physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), have proven effective in simulating seismic traveltimes for multiple sources. Nonetheless, PINNs face challenges such as limited generalization capabilities across different models and difficulties in training convergence. To address these issues, we have developed a method for simulating multi-source seismic traveltimes in variable velocity models using a deep-learning technique, known as the physics-informed Fourier neural operator (PIFNO). The PIFNO-based method for seismic traveltime generation takes both velocity and background traveltime as inputs, generating the perturbation traveltime as the output. This method incorporates a factorized eikonal equation as the loss function and relies solely on physical laws, eliminating the need for labeled training data. We demonstrate that our proposed method is not only effective in calculating seismic traveltimes for velocity models used during training but also shows promising prediction capabilities for test velocity models. We validate these features using velocity models from the OpenFWI dataset.</description>

      <title>Number of aftershocks in epidemic-type seismicity models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18526v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let V(M, m0) be the number of m&gt;M aftershocks caused by m0 event. We consider the V(M, m0) distribution within epidemic-type seismicity models, ETAS(F). These models include the Gutenberg-Richter law for magnitude and Utsu law for average productivity of m0, but differ in the type of F distribution for the number v(m0) of direct aftershocks. The class of F is quite broad and includes both the Poisson distribution, which is the basis for the regular ETAS model, and its possible alternative, the Geometric distribution. Instead of the traditional threshold M=m0-d we consider M=ma-d, where ma is the mode in the distribution of the strongest aftershock. Under these conditions we find the limit V(M, m0) distribution at m0&gt;&gt;1. In the subcritical case, the limit distribution is extremely simple and identical to the v(m) distribution with a suitable magnitude m=m(d). Theoretical results of this kind are lacking even for the regular ETAS model. Our results provide an additional opportunity to test the type of F-distribution, Bath law, and the very concept of epidemic-type clustering.</description>

      <title>Gravity-Induced Ice Compaction and Subsurface Porosity on Icy Moons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10627v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Our understanding of the surface porosity of icy moons and its evolution with depth remains limited, including the precise scale at which ice compaction occurs under self-weight pressure. This parameter is of crucial interest for the correct interpretation of current remote sensing data (spectroscopy in the visible, infrared to passive microwave) but also for planetary exploration when designing a lander, a rover or a cryobot. In situ exploration of the ice crust would require knowledge about subsurface porosity. This study employs a compaction model solely driven by overburden pressure based on prior research. The formulation for density as a function of depth, incorporates an essential parameter: the ice compaction coefficient. To determine this coefficient, we fit our depth-dependent density model to existing data obtained from Earth-based measurements of ice cores in Antarctica and North Greenland. Our results yield a typical lengthscale for ice compaction on Earth of approximately 20.1 $\pm$ 0.6 m , consistent with the existing literature. We apply the model to Europa, which due to its lower gravity, has a typical ice compaction scale of 150 $\pm$ 4 m. We compare it with the depths scanned by current spaceborne data and find that porosity can be considered constant when accounting only for gravity-induced compaction.</description>
