      <title>Adaptive Nonparametric Estimation via Kernel Transport on Group Orbits: Oracle Inequalities and Minimax Rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a unified framework for nonparametric functional estimation based on kernel transport along orbits of discrete group actions, which we term \emph{Twin Spaces}. Given a base kernel $K$ and a group $G = \langle\varphi\rangle$ acting isometrically on the input space $E$, we construct a hierarchy of transported kernels $\{K_j\}_{j\geq 0}$ and a penalized model selection scheme satisfying a Kraft inequality. Our main contributions are threefold: (i) we establish non-asymptotic oracle inequalities for the penalized twin-kernel estimator with explicit constants; (ii) we introduce novel twin-regularity classes that capture smoothness along group orbits and prove that our estimator adapts to these classes; (iii) we show that the framework recovers classical minimax-optimal rates in the Euclidean setting while enabling improved rates when the target function exhibits orbital structure. The effective dimension $d_{\mathrm{eff}}$ governing the rates is characterized in terms of the quotient $G/L$, where $L$ is the subgroup preserving the base operation. Connections to wavelet methods, geometric quantization, and adaptive computation are discussed.</description>

      <title>TwinKernel Estimation for Point Process Intensity Functions: Adaptive Nonparametric Methods via Orbital Regularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop TwinKernel methods for nonparametric estimation of intensity functions of point processes. Building on the general TwinKernel framework and combining it with martingale techniques for counting processes, we construct estimators that adapt to orbital regularity of the intensity function. Given a point process $N$ with intensity $\lambda$ and a cyclic group $G = \langle\varphi\rangle$ acting on the time/space domain, we transport kernels along group orbits to create a hierarchy of smoothed Nelson-Aalen type estimators. Our main results establish: (i) uniform consistency via martingale concentration inequalities; (ii) optimal convergence rates for intensities in twin-H\"older classes, with rates depending on the effective dimension $d_{\mathrm{eff}}$; (iii) adaptation to unknown smoothness through penalized model selection; (iv) automatic boundary bias correction via local polynomial extensions in twin coordinates; (v) minimax lower bounds showing rate optimality. We apply the methodology to hazard rate estimation under random censoring, where periodicity or other orbital structure in the hazard may arise from circadian rhythms, seasonal effects, or treatment schedules. Martingale central limit theorems yield asymptotic confidence bands. Simulation studies demonstrate 3--7$\times$ improvements over classical kernel hazard estimators when the intensity exhibits orbital regularity.</description>

      <title>Concentration of Measure under Diffeomorphism Groups: A Universal Framework with Optimal Coordinate Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a universal framework for concentration inequalities based on invariance under diffeomorphism groups. Given a probability measure $\mu$ on a space $E$ and a diffeomorphism $\psi: E \to F$, concentration properties transfer covariantly: if the pushforward $\psi_*\mu$ concentrates, so does $\mu$ in the pullback geometry. This reveals that classical concentration inequalities -- Hoeffding, Bernstein, Talagrand, Gaussian isoperimetry -- are manifestations of a single principle of \emph{geometric invariance}. The choice of coordinate system $\psi$ becomes a free parameter that can be optimized. We prove that for any distribution class $\Pc$, there exists an optimal diffeomorphism $\psi^*$ minimizing the concentration constant, and we characterize $\psi^*$ in terms of the Fisher-Rao geometry of $\Pc$. We establish \emph{strict improvement theorems}: for heavy-tailed or multiplicative data, the optimal $\psi$ yields exponentially tighter bounds than the identity. We develop the full theory including transportation-cost inequalities, isoperimetric profiles, and functional inequalities, all parametrized by the diffeomorphism group $\Diff(E)$. Connections to information geometry (Amari's $\alpha$-connections), optimal transport with general costs, and Riemannian concentration are established. Applications to robust statistics, multiplicative models, and high-dimensional inference demonstrate that coordinate optimization can improve statistical efficiency by orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>On Learning-Curve Monotonicity for Maximum Likelihood Estimators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The property of learning-curve monotonicity, highlighted in a recent series of work by Loog, Mey and Viering, describes algorithms which only improve in average performance given more data, for any underlying data distribution within a given family. We establish the first nontrivial monotonicity guarantees for the maximum likelihood estimator in a variety of well-specified parametric settings. For sequential prediction with log loss, we show monotonicity (in fact complete monotonicity) of the forward KL divergence for Gaussian vectors with unknown covariance and either known or unknown mean, as well as for Gamma variables with unknown scale parameter. The Gaussian setting was explicitly highlighted as open in the aforementioned works, even in dimension 1. Finally we observe that for reverse KL divergence, a folklore trick yields monotonicity for very general exponential families.
  All results in this paper were derived by variants of GPT-5.2 Pro. Humans did not provide any proof strategies or intermediate arguments, but only prompted the model to continue developing additional results, and verified and transcribed its proofs.</description>

      <title>Adaptive almost full recovery in sparse nonparametric models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We observe an unknown function of $d$ variables $f(\boldsymbol{t})$, $\boldsymbol{t} \in[0,1]^d$, in the Gaussian white noise model of intensity $\varepsilon&gt;0$. We assume that the function $f$ is regular and that it is a sum of $k$-variate functions, where $k$ varies from $1$ to $s$ ($1\leq s\leq d$). These functions are unknown to us and only a few of them are nonzero. In this article, we address the problem of identifying the nonzero function components of $f$ almost fully in the case when $d=d_\varepsilon\to \infty$ as $\varepsilon\to 0$ and $s$ is either fixed or $s=s_\varepsilon\to \infty$, $s=o(d)$ as $\varepsilon\to 0$. This may be viewed as a variable selection problem. We derive the conditions when almost full variable selection in the model at hand is possible and provide a selection procedure that achieves this type of selection. The procedure is adaptive to the level of sparsity described by the sparsity index $\beta\in(0,1)$. We also derive conditions that make almost full variable selection in the model of our interest impossible. In view of these conditions, the proposed selector is seen to perform asymptotically optimal. The theoretical findings are illustrated numerically.</description>

      <title>Measures of inaccuracy based on Varextropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, varextropy has been introduced as a new dispersion index and a measure of information. In this article, we derive the generating function of extropy and present its infinite series representation. Furthermore, we propose new variability measures: the inaccuracy and weighted inaccuracy measures between two random variables based on varextropy and we investigate their properties. We also obtain lower bounds for the inaccuracy measure and compare them with each other. In addition, we introduce a discrimination measure based on varextropy and employ it both for comparing probability distributions and for assessing the goodness of fit of distributions to data and we compare this measure with the dispersion index derived from the Kullback-Leibler divergence given in Balakrishnan et al. (2022).</description>

      <title>Bootstrapping not under the null?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a bootstrap testing framework for a general class of hypothesis tests, which allows resampling under the null hypothesis as well as other forms of bootstrapping. We identify combinations of resampling schemes and bootstrap statistics for which the resulting tests are asymptotically exact and consistent against fixed alternatives. We show that in these cases the limiting local power functions are the same for the different resampling schemes. We also show that certain naive bootstrap schemes do not work. To demonstrate its versatility, we apply the framework to several examples: independence tests, tests on the coefficients in linear regression models, goodness-of-fit tests for general parametric models and for semi-parametric copula models. Simulation results confirm the asymptotic results and suggest that in smaller samples non-traditional bootstrap schemes may have advantages. This bootstrap-based hypothesis testing framework is implemented in the R package BootstrapTests.</description>

      <title>An Elementary Proof of the Near Optimality of LogSumExp Smoothing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the design of smoothings of the (coordinate-wise) max function in $\mathbb{R}^d$ in the infinity norm. The LogSumExp function $f(x)=\ln(\sum^d_i\exp(x_i))$ provides a classical smoothing, differing from the max function in value by at most $\ln(d)$. We provide an elementary construction of a lower bound, establishing that every overestimating smoothing of the max function must differ by at least $\sim 0.8145\ln(d)$. Hence, LogSumExp is optimal up to constant factors. However, in small dimensions, we provide stronger, exactly optimal smoothings attaining our lower bound, showing that the entropy-based LogSumExp approach to smoothing is not exactly optimal.</description>

      <title>Partitioning the Sample Space for a More Precise Shannon Entropy Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reliable data-driven estimation of Shannon entropy from small data sets, where the number of examples is potentially smaller than the number of possible outcomes, is a critical matter in several applications. In this paper, we introduce a discrete entropy estimator, where we use the decomposability property in combination with estimations of the missing mass and the number of unseen outcomes to compensate for the negative bias induced by them. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms some classical estimators in undersampled regimes, and performs comparably with some well-established state-of-the-art estimators.</description>

      <title>Peace Sells, But Whose Songs Connect? Bayesian Multilayer Network Analysis of the Big 4 of Thrash Metal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a Bayesian framework for multilayer song similarity networks and apply it to the complete studio discographies of the "Big 4" of thrash metal (Metallica, Slayer, Megadeth, Anthrax). Starting from raw audio, we construct four feature-specific layers (loudness, brightness, tonality, rhythm), augment them with song exogenous information, and represent each layer as a k-nearest neighbor graph. We then fit a family of hierarchical probit models with global and layer-specific baselines, node- and layer-specific sociability effects, dyadic covariates, and alternative forms of latent structure (bilinear, distance-based, and stochastic block communities), comparing increasingly flexible specifications using posterior predictive checks, discrimination and calibration metrics (AUC, Brier score, log-loss), and information criteria (DIC, WAIC). Across all bands, the richest stochastic block specification attains the best predictive performance and posterior predictive fit, while revealing sparse but structured connectivity, interpretable covariate effects (notably album membership and temporal proximity), and latent communities and hubs that cut across albums and eras. Taken together, these results illustrate how Bayesian multilayer network models can help organize high-dimensional audio and text features into coherent, musically meaningful patterns.</description>

      <title>Alpha Power Harris-G Family of Distributions: Properties and Application to Burr XII Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study introduces a new family of probability distributions, termed the alpha power Harris-generalized (APHG) family. The generator arises by incorporating two shape parameters from the Harris-G framework into the alpha power transformation, resulting in a more flexible class for modelling survival and reliability data. A special member of this family, obtained using the two-parameter Burr XII distribution as the baseline, is developed and examined in detail. Several analytical properties of the proposed alpha power Harris Burr XII (APHBXII) model are derived, which include closed-form expressions for its moments, mean and median deviations, Bonferroni and Lorenz curves, order statistics, and Renyi and Tsallis entropies. Parameter estimation is performed via maximum likelihood, and a Monte Carlo simulation study is carried out to assess the finite-sample performance of the estimators. In addition, three real lifetime datasets are analyzed to evaluate the empirical performance of the APHBXII distribution relative to four competing models. The results show that the five-parameter APHBXII model provides superior fit across all datasets, as supported by model-selection criteria and goodness-of-fit statistics.</description>

Abstract: This paper is concerned with differentiable resampling in the context of sequential Monte Carlo (e.g., particle filtering). We propose a new informative resampling method that is instantly pathwise differentiable, based on an ensemble score diffusion model. We prove that our diffusion resampling method provides a consistent estimate to the resampling distribution, and we show by experiments that it outperforms the state-of-the-art differentiable resampling methods when used for stochastic filtering and parameter estimation.</description>

      <title>Learning Time-Varying Correlation Networks with FDR Control via Time-Varying P-values</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.10467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a systematic framework for controlling false discovery rate in learning time-varying correlation networks from high-dimensional, non-linear, non-Gaussian and non-stationary time series with an increasing number of potential abrupt change points in means. We propose a bootstrap-assisted approach to derive dependent and time-varying P-values from a robust estimate of time-varying correlation functions, which are not sensitive to change points. Our procedure is based on a new high-dimensional Gaussian approximation result for the uniform approximation of P-values across time and different coordinates. Moreover, we establish theoretically guaranteed Benjamini--Hochberg and Benjamini--Yekutieli procedures for the dependent and time-varying P-values, which can achieve uniform false discovery rate control. The proposed methods are supported by rigorous mathematical proofs and simulation studies. We also illustrate the real-world application of our framework using both brain electroencephalogram and financial time series data.</description>

      <title>Measures and Models of Non-Monotonic Dependence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A margin-free measure of bivariate association generalizing Spearman's rho to the case of non-monotonic dependence is defined in terms of two square integrable functions on the unit interval. Properties of generalized Spearman correlation are investigated when the functions are piecewise continuous and strictly monotonic, with particular focus on the special cases where the functions are drawn from orthonormal bases defined by Legendre polynomials and cosine functions. For continuous random variables, generalized Spearman correlation is treated as a copula-based measure and shown to depend on a pair of uniform-distribution-preserving (udp) transformations determined by the underlying functions. Bounds for generalized Spearman correlation are derived and a novel technique referred to as stochastic inversion of udp transformations is used to construct singular copulas that attain the bounds and parametric copulas with densities that interpolate between the bounds and model different degrees of non-monotonic dependence. Sample analogues of generalized Spearman correlation are proposed and their asymptotic and small-sample properties are investigated. Potential applications of the theory are demonstrated including: exploratory analyses of the dependence structures of datasets and their symmetries; elicitation of functions maximizing generalized Spearman correlation via expansions in orthonormal basis functions; and construction of tractable probability densities to model a wide variety of non-monotonic dependencies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17431v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is numerically well known that moment-based tests for Gaussianity and estimators become increasingly unreliable at higher moment orders; however, this phenomenon has lacked rigorous mathematical justification. In this work, we establish quantitative bounds for Hermite-based moment tests, with matching exponential upper and lower bounds. Our results show that, even under ideal conditions with i.i.d. standard normal data, the sample size must grow exponentially with the highest moment order $d$ used in the test. These bounds, derived under both the convex distance and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov distance, are applied to classical procedures, such as the Shenton-Bowman test.</description>

      <title>A simple geometric proof for the characterisation of e-merging functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09708v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: E-values offer a powerful framework for aggregating evidence across different (possibly dependent) statistical experiments. A fundamental question is to identify e-merging functions, namely mappings that merge several e-values into a single valid e-value. A simple and elegant characterisation of this function class was recently obtained by Wang(2025), though via technically involved arguments. This note gives a short and intuitive geometric proof of the same characterisation, based on a supporting hyperplane argument applied to concave envelopes. We also show that the result holds even without imposing monotonicity in the definition of e-merging functions, which was needed for the existing proof. This shows that any non-monotone merging rule is automatically dominated by a monotone one, and hence extending the definition beyond the monotone case brings no additional generality.</description>

      <title>Rank-based linkage I: triplet comparisons and oriented simplicial complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.02200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.02200v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rank-based linkage is a new tool for summarizing a collection $S$ of objects according to their relationships. These objects are not mapped to vectors, and ``similarity'' between objects need be neither numerical nor symmetrical. All an object needs to do is rank nearby objects by similarity to itself, using a Comparator which is transitive, but need not be consistent with any metric on the whole set. Call this a ranking system on $S$. Rank-based linkage is applied to the $K$-nearest neighbor digraph derived from a ranking system. Computations occur on a 2-dimensional abstract oriented simplicial complex whose faces are among the points, edges, and triangles of the line graph of the undirected $K$-nearest neighbor graph on $S$. In $|S| K^2$ steps it builds an edge-weighted linkage graph $(S, \mathcal{L}, \sigma)$ where $\sigma(\{x, y\})$ is called the in-sway between objects $x$ and $y$. Take $\mathcal{L}_t$ to be the links whose in-sway is at least $t$, and partition $S$ into components of the graph $(S, \mathcal{L}_t)$, for varying $t$. Rank-based linkage is a functor from a category of ``out-ordered'' digraphs to a category of partitioned sets, with the practical consequence that augmenting the set of objects in a rank-respectful way gives a fresh clustering which does not ``rip apart'' the previous one. The same holds for single linkage clustering in the metric space context, but not for typical optimization-based methods. Orientation sheaves play in a fundamental role and ensure that partially overlapping data sets can be ``glued'' together. Open combinatorial problems are presented in the last section.</description>

      <title>Randomization Tests for Conditional Group Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14391v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Symmetry plays a central role in the sciences, machine learning, and statistics. While statistical tests for the presence of distributional invariance with respect to groups have a long history, tests for conditional symmetry in the form of equivariance or conditional invariance are absent from the literature. This work initiates the study of nonparametric randomization tests for symmetry (invariance or equivariance) of a conditional distribution under the action of a specified locally compact group. We develop a general framework for randomization tests with finite-sample Type I error control and, using kernel methods, implement tests with finite-sample power lower bounds. We also describe and implement approximate versions of the tests, which are asymptotically consistent. We study their properties empirically using synthetic examples and applications to testing for symmetry in two problems from high-energy particle physics.</description>

      <title>On the Intersection and Composition properties of conditional independence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11978v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Compositional graphoids are fundamental discrete structures which appear in probabilistic reasoning, particularly in the area of graphical models. They are semigraphoids which satisfy the Intersection and Composition properties. These important properties, however, are not enjoyed by general probability distributions. This paper surveys what is known about them, providing systematic constructions of examples and counterexamples as well as necessary and sufficient conditions. Novel sufficient conditions for both properties are derived in the context of discrete random variables via information-theoretic tools.</description>

      <title>Beyond Basic A/B testing: Improving Statistical Efficiency for Business Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08128v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The standard A/B testing approaches are mostly based on t-test in large scale industry applications. These standard approaches however suffers from low statistical power in business settings, due to nature of small sample-size or non-Gaussian distribution or return-on-investment (ROI) consideration. In this paper, we (i) show the statistical efficiency of using estimating equation and U statistics, which can address these issues separately; and (ii) propose a novel doubly robust generalized U that allows flexible definition of treatment effect, and can handles small samples, distribution robustness, ROI and confounding consideration in one framework. We provide theoretical results on asymptotics and efficiency bounds, together with insights on the efficiency gain from theoretical analysis. We further conduct comprehensive simulation studies, apply the methods to multiple real A/B tests at a large SaaS company, and share results and learnings that are broadly useful.</description>

      <title>Distributional Shrinkage I: Universal Denoisers in Multi-Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09500v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the problem of denoising from noisy measurements where only the noise level is known, not the noise distribution. In multi-dimensions, independent noise $Z$ corrupts the signal $X$, resulting in the noisy measurement $Y = X + \sigma Z$, where $\sigma \in (0, 1)$ is a known noise level. Our goal is to recover the underlying signal distribution $P_X$ from denoising $P_Y$. We propose and analyze universal denoisers that are agnostic to a wide range of signal and noise distributions. Our distributional denoisers offer order-of-magnitude improvements over the Bayes-optimal denoiser derived from Tweedie's formula, if the focus is on the entire distribution $P_X$ rather than on individual realizations of $X$. Our denoisers shrink $P_Y$ toward $P_X$ optimally, achieving $O(\sigma^4)$ and $O(\sigma^6)$ accuracy in matching generalized moments and density functions. Inspired by optimal transport theory, the proposed denoisers are optimal in approximating the Monge-Amp\`ere equation with higher-order accuracy, and can be implemented efficiently via score matching.
  Let $q$ represent the density of $P_Y$; for optimal distributional denoising, we recommend replacing the Bayes-optimal denoiser, \[ \mathbf{T}^*(y) = y + \sigma^2 \nabla \log q(y), \] with denoisers exhibiting less aggressive distributional shrinkage, \[ \mathbf{T}_1(y) = y + \frac{\sigma^2}{2} \nabla \log q(y), \] \[ \mathbf{T}_2(y) = y + \frac{\sigma^2}{2} \nabla \log q(y) - \frac{\sigma^4}{8} \nabla \left( \frac{1}{2} \| \nabla \log q(y) \|^2 + \nabla \cdot \nabla \log q(y) \right) . \]</description>
