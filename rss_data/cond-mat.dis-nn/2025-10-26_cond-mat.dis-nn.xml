      <title>The geometry and dynamics of annealed optimization in the coherent Ising machine with hidden and planted solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coherent Ising machine (CIM) is a nonconventional hardware architecture for finding approximate solutions to large-scale combinatorial optimization problems.It operates by annealing a laser gain parameter to adiabatically deform a high-dimensional energy landscape over a set of soft spins, going from a simple convex landscape to the more complex optimization landscape of interest. We address how the evolving energy landscapes guides the optimization dynamics against problems with hidden planted solutions. We study the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick spin-glass with ferromagnetic couplings that favor a hidden configuration by combining the replica method, random matrix theory, the Kac-Rice method and dynamical mean field theory. We characterize energy, number, location, and Hessian eigenspectra of global minima, local minima, and critical points as the landscape evolves. We find that low energy global minima develop soft-modes which the optimization dynamics can exploit to descend the energy landscape. Even when these global minima are aligned to the hidden configuration, there can be exponentially many higher energy local minima that are all unaligned with the hidden solution. Nevertheless, the annealed optimization dynamics can evade this cloud of unaligned high energy local minima and descend near to aligned lower energy global minima. Eventually, as the landscape is further annealed, these global minima become rigid, terminating any further optimization gains from annealing. We further consider a second optimization problem, the Wishart planted ensemble, which contains a hidden planted solution in a landscape with tunable ruggedness. We describe CIM phase transitions between recoverability and non-recoverability of the hidden solution. Overall, we find intriguing relations between high-dimensional geometry and dynamics in analog machines for combinatorial optimization.</description>

      <title>Markov Inequality as a Tool for Linear-Scaling Estimation of Local Observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a linear-scaling stochastic method to compute real-space maps of any positive local spectral operator in a tight-binding model. By employing positive-definite estimators, the sampling error at each site can be rigorously bounded relative to the mean via the Markov inequality, overcoming the lack of self-averaging and enabling accurate estimates even under strong spatial fluctuations. The approach extends to non-diagonal observables, such as local currents, through local unitary transformations and its effectiveness is showcased by benchmark calculations in the disordered two-dimensional (2D) $\pi$-flux model, where the LDoS and steady-state current maps are computed. This method will enable simulations of disorder-driven mesoscopic phenomena in realistically large lattices and accelerate real-space self-consistent mean-field calculations.</description>

Abstract: Philip Warren Anderson was a pioneering theoretical physicist whose work fundamentally shaped our understanding of complex systems. Anderson received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1977 for his groundbreaking research on localization and magnetism, yet he did so much more. His work on magnetism included antiferromagnetism, superexchange, the Kondo problem and local magnetic moments in metals. Anderson pointed out the importance of disorder through his work on localization, non-crystalline solids and spin glasses. In superconductivity, he is known for the dirty superconductor theorem, showing the gauge-invariance of the BCS theory, his study of flux creep, and for his collaboration with experimentalists to realize the Josephson effect. Anderson's resonating valence bond theory may yet play an important role in high temperature superconductivity. Anderson was also fascinated by broken symmetry, and he laid the theoretical groundwork for what is now known as the Anderson-Higgs mechanism, showing how gauge bosons can acquire mass - an insight that played a foundational role in the Standard Model of particle physics. In his seminal "More is Different" paper, Anderson argued that the collective emergent phenomena that arise in complex interacting systems cannot be deduced from their fundamental parts. Anderson's legacy endures not only through the lasting impact of his scientific work but also through his influence on generations of physicists who continue to explore the rich landscape of collective behavior in nature.</description>

      <title>Searching for emergent spacetime in spin glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent work on algebraic formulations of holographic dualities in terms of large $N$ algebras has revealed a deep connection between the properties of the associated spectral functions and the emergence of a semiclassical spacetime and causal horizons therein. One of the main lessons is that, for a radial direction to emerge, the spectral function has to exhibit non-compact support. Furthermore, there exist conjectures upon a possible duality between complex gravitational configurations and glassy systems. The goal of this paper is to combine these ideas by studying many-body quantum-mechanical systems and assess in which parameter regimes they could potentially be holographic. Thus, we compute the spectral functions of three many-body systems with quenched disorder, the SYK model, the $p$-spin model and the SU$(M)$ Heisenberg chain in the large $N$ limit and present results in different parameter regimes. Our main finding is that in the quantum spin glass phase of the SU$(M)$ Heisenberg model, the spectral function develops an exponential tail, similar to the large $q$ limit of SYK. Furthermore, we demonstrate the presence of an infinite family of quasiparticle excitations deep in the spin liquid phase of the $p$-spin model, which could point towards an emergent type I von Neumann algebra. In addition, we demonstrate the presence of an exponential tail in the spectral function for all cases without compact support and conformal symmetry. Motivated by this observation, we prove that no low-energy operator can detect a nontrivial bulk causal structure, if the spectral function has exponentially decaying tails.</description>

      <title>Kramers rate for Brownian particles in excitable media with deformable double-well substrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the Kramers escape problem for Brownian particles in bistable substrates with deformable double-well shapes. The shape deformability is considered of three distinct forms: in one, the positions of the two degenerate minima can be shifted continuously without affecting the barrier height. In the second the minima positions are kept fix while the barrier height is continuously shifted. In the third the minima positions and barrier height can be tuned simultaneously by changing a single real parameter that we refer to as deformability parameter. We obtain the analytical expression of the Kramers escape rate for the three different double-well models, and identify a critical value of the deformability parameter above which non-Gaussian corrections become relevant. Remarkable enough in the latter region, statistical mechanics predicts a first-order transition in quantum tunneling using the functional action associated with the family of deformable double-well potentials.</description>

      <title>Spectral Analysis of Representational Similarity with Limited Neurons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19648v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding representational similarity between neural recordings and computational models is essential for neuroscience, yet remains challenging to measure reliably due to the constraints on the number of neurons that can be recorded simultaneously. In this work, we apply tools from Random Matrix Theory to investigate how such limitations affect similarity measures, focusing on Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) and Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA). We propose an analytical framework for representational similarity analysis that relates measured similarities to the spectral properties of the underlying representations. We demonstrate that neural similarities are systematically underestimated under finite neuron sampling, mainly due to eigenvector delocalization. Moreover, for power-law population spectra, we show that the number of localized eigenvectors scales as the square root of the number of recorded neurons, providing a simple rule of thumb for practitioners. To overcome sampling bias, we introduce a denoising method to infer population-level similarity, enabling accurate analysis even with small neuron samples. Theoretical predictions are validated on synthetic and real datasets, offering practical strategies for interpreting neural data under finite sampling constraints.</description>

      <title>Improving deep neural network performance through sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07763v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Energy efficient sampling with probabilistic neurons or p-bits has been demonstrated in the context of Boltzmann machines and it is natural to ask if these approaches can be extended to the field of generative AI where energy costs have become prohibitively large. However, this very active field is dominated by feedforward deep neural networks (DNNs) which primarily use multi-bit deterministic neurons with no role for sampling. In this paper we first show that it is feasible to obtain superior accuracy through the use of multiple samples generated by probabilistic networks. This possibility raises the question of which option is energetically preferable for improving accuracy: generating more samples, or adding more bits to a single deterministic sample. We provide a simple expression that can be used to estimate these energy tradeoffs and illustrate it with results for different algorithms and architectures.</description>

      <title>Neural Thermodynamics: Entropic Forces in Deep and Universal Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12387v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the rapid discovery of emergent phenomena in deep learning and large language models, understanding their cause has become an urgent need. Here, we propose a rigorous entropic-force theory for understanding the learning dynamics of neural networks trained with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and its variants. Building on the theory of parameter symmetries and an entropic loss landscape, we show that representation learning is crucially governed by emergent entropic forces arising from stochasticity and discrete-time updates. These forces systematically break continuous parameter symmetries and preserve discrete ones, leading to a series of gradient balance phenomena that resemble the equipartition property of thermal systems. These phenomena, in turn, (a) explain the universal alignment of neural representations between AI models and lead to a proof of the Platonic Representation Hypothesis, and (b) reconcile the seemingly contradictory observations of sharpness- and flatness-seeking behavior of deep learning optimization. Our theory and experiments demonstrate that a combination of entropic forces and symmetry breaking is key to understanding emergent phenomena in deep learning.</description>

      <title>Recurrent Self-Attention Dynamics: An Energy-Agnostic Perspective from Jacobians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19458v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The theoretical understanding of self-attention (SA) has been steadily progressing. A prominent line of work studies a class of SA layers that admit an energy function decreased by state updates. While it provides valuable insights into inherent biases in signal propagation, it often relies on idealized assumptions or additional constraints not necessarily present in standard SA. Thus, to broaden our understanding, this work aims to relax these energy constraints and provide an energy-agnostic characterization of inference dynamics by dynamical systems analysis. In more detail, we first consider relaxing the symmetry and single-head constraints traditionally required in energy-based formulations. Next, we show that analyzing the Jacobian matrix of the state is highly valuable when investigating more general SA architectures without necessarily admitting an energy function. It reveals that the normalization layer plays an essential role in suppressing the Lipschitzness of SA and the Jacobian's complex eigenvalues, which correspond to the oscillatory components of the dynamics. In addition, the Lyapunov exponents computed from the Jacobians demonstrate that the normalized dynamics lie close to a critical state, and this criticality serves as a strong indicator of high inference performance. Furthermore, the Jacobian perspective also enables us to develop regularization methods for training and a pseudo-energy for monitoring inference dynamics.</description>

      <title>Digital Quantum Simulation of Flat-Band and All-Bands-Flat Dynamics for Tunable Quantum Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08734v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Flat-band systems offer a uniquely powerful tool for quantum control in dynamics due to their characteristic feature of having a dispersionless energy band. Simulating such highly sensitive systems on current digital quantum computers is a challenging task, due to the intrinsic limitations of the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. Here we present high-fidelity digital quantum simulations of flat-band (FB) and all-bands-flat (ABF) lattices, using an advanced tensor-network-based circuit compression method. With the compressed quantum circuits, we first explore single-particle dynamics and observe two distinct behaviours: strong localization in ABF lattices and delocalization in FB lattices. By integrating FB and ABF lattices into a one-dimensional hybrid structure, we achieve controllable quantum transport, where the ABF lattice acts as a quantum switch. Extending to two-particle dynamics, we show that transport remains controllable by tuning the hopping amplitude alone, even in the presence of interactions. These results establish flat-band engineered systems as a promising pathway for scalable control of quantum transport in emerging quantum technologies, with potential applications in qubit isolation, particle trapping, and state transfer.</description>

      <title>A Tale of Two Uplifts: Parisi-Sourlas with Defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18356v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Defects in conformal field theories (CFTs) play a key role in critical phenomena by modifying scaling behaviors and generating new universality classes. We introduce Parisi-Sourlas (PS) supersymmetry in the presence of extended operators and demonstrate that any $p$-dimensional defect in a CFT$_d$ can be uplifted to a defect in a PS-supersymmetric CFT$_{d+2}$. Surprisingly, there are actually two distinct uplifted defects--of dimensions $p$ and $p+2$--which reduce to the original one. We show how this reduction works for correlators with insertions both in the bulk and on the defect. As a byproduct, we find new relations between defect conformal blocks in dimensions $d$ and $d+2$. We further show that the reduction of the $p$-dimensional defect implies and extend a "global symmetry reduction" previously considered in the literature. Finally, we provide various examples of these uplifts, including perturbative computations in epsilon expansion of the uplift of the Ising magnetic line defect, as well as exact computations of observables in the four-dimensional uplift of minimal models with boundaries.</description>
