      <title>Single-valuedness of the AdS Veneziano amplitude</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Veneziano amplitude for the scattering of gluons in type IIB string theory on $AdS_5 \times S^5/\mathbb{Z}_2$ in the presence of D7 branes. On general grounds curvature corrections around flat space can be thought of as arising from the extra insertion of soft gravitons. This naturally leads to an open string world-sheet representation with the extra insertion of single-valued functions evaluated on the real line. We check that the recently obtained first curvature correction is of this form and use this new constraint to compute the second curvature correction of the AdS Veneziano amplitude.</description>

      <title>K-theoretic Global Symmetry in String-constructed QFT and T-duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose that generalized symmetries in some string-constructed QFTs are given by twisted K-theory, so as to be manifestly consistent under T-duality. We thus have \textit{even-form} and \textit{odd-form} symmetries determined by $K^*_N(\partial X)$, the twisted K-theory as D-brane charges on the asymptotic boundary $\partial X$ of internal geometry $X$ with twist class $N$. For these QFTs, "\textit{$p$-form symmetries}" are no longer separately well-defined for individual $p$, but instead mixed up. We discuss 6D ADE-type (2,0) SCFTs and some 6d (1,0) LSTs as examples, and demonstrate their twisted K-theoretic symmetries to be consistent with T-duality.</description>

      <title>Relative state-counting for semiclassical black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been shown that entropy differences between certain states of perturbative quantum gravity can be computed without specifying an ultraviolet completion. This is analogous to the situation in classical statistical mechanics, where entropy differences are defined but absolute entropy is not. Unlike in classical statistical mechanics, however, the entropy differences computed in perturbative quantum gravity do not have a clear physical interpretation. Here we construct a family of perturbative black hole states for which the entropy difference can be interpreted as a relative counting of states. Conceptually, this paper begins with the algebra of mass fluctuations around a fixed black hole background, and points out that while this is a type I algebra, it is not a factor and therefore has no canonical definition of entropy. As in previous work, coupling the mass fluctuations to quantum matter embeds the mass algebra within a type II factor, in which entropy differences (but not absolute entropies) are well defined. It is then shown that for microcanonical wavefunctions of mass fluctuation, the type II entropy difference equals the logarithm of the dimension of the extra Hilbert space that is needed to map one microcanonical window to another using gauge-invariant unitaries. The paper closes with comments on type II entropy difference in a more general class of states, where the von Neumann entropy difference does not have a physical interpretation, but "one-shot" entropy differences do.</description>

      <title>Pair creation in a space with spin noncommutativity of coordinates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Schwinger pair creation process for Dirac fermions in the presence of a Volkov plane wave and a constant external electric field by applying spin non-commutativity of coordinates. Using the Schwinger proper time method, the probability of pair creation from vacuum is calculated precisely and analytically. In the case of the Volkov plane wave, it is shown that the probability is zero. However, for a constant electric field, the spin noncommutativity of the coordinates contributes to the pair creation process and affects the calculated probability.</description>

      <title>The Weil Correspondence and Universal Special Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Weil correspondence states that the datum of a Seiberg-Witten differential is equivalent to an algebraic group extension of the integrable system associated to the Seiberg-Witten geometry. Remarkably this group extension represents quantum consistent couplings for the $\mathcal{N}=2$ QFT if and only if the extension is anti-affine in the algebro-geometric sense. The universal special geometry is the algebraic integrable system whose Lagrangian fibers are the anti-affine extension groups; it is defined over a base $\mathscr{B}$ parametrized by the Coulomb coordinates and the couplings. On the total space of the universal geometry there is a canonical (holomorphic) Euler differential. The ordinary Seiberg-Witten geometries at fixed couplings are symplectic quotients of the universal one, and the Seiberg-Witten differential arises as the reduction of the Euler one in accordance with the Weil correspondence. This universal viewpoint allows to study geometrically the flavor symmetry of the $\mathcal{N}=2$ SCFT in terms of the Mordell-Weil lattice (with N\'eron-Tate height) of the Albanese variety $A_\mathbb{L}$ of the universal geometry seen as a quasi-Abelian variety $Y_\mathbb{L}$ defined over the function field $\mathbb{L}\equiv\mathbb{C}(\mathscr{B})$.</description>

      <title>Counting $U(N)^{\otimes r}\otimes O(N)^{\otimes q}$ invariants and tensor model observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $U(N)^{\otimes r} \otimes O(N)^{\otimes q}$ invariants are constructed by contractions of complex tensors of order $r+q$, also denoted $(r,q)$. These tensors transform under $r$ fundamental representations of the unitary group $U(N)$ and $q$ fundamental representations of the orthogonal group $O(N)$. Therefore, $U(N)^{\otimes r} \otimes O(N)^{\otimes q}$ invariants are tensor model observables endowed with a tensor field of order $(r,q)$. We enumerate these observables using group theoretic formulae, for arbitrary tensor fields of order $(r,q)$. Inspecting lower-order cases reveals that, at order $(1,1)$, the number of invariants corresponds to a number of 2- or 4-ary necklaces that exhibit pattern avoidance, offering insights into enumerative combinatorics. For a general order $(r,q)$, the counting can be interpreted as the partition function of a topological quantum field theory (TQFT) with the symmetric group serving as gauge group. We identify the 2-complex pertaining to the enumeration of the invariants, which in turn defines the TQFT, and establish a correspondence with countings associated with covers of diverse topologies. For $r&gt;1$, the number of invariants matches the number of ($q$-dependent) weighted equivalence classes of branched covers of the 2-sphere with $r$ branched points. At $r=1$, the counting maps to the enumeration of branched covers of the 2-sphere with $q+3$ branched points. The formalism unveils a wide array of novel integer sequences that have not been previously documented. We also provide various codes for running computational experiments.</description>

      <title>Rotating strings and anomalous dimensions in Non-AdS holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we consider certain rigidly rotating closed string configurations in an asymptotically non-AdS string background. The string background is a deformation of $AdS_3 \times {\cal M}_7$. It interpolates between $AdS_3 $ and asymptotically linear dilaton ${\rm I\!R} \times S^1 \times {\rm I\!R}$ spacetime (times the internal compact manifold ${\cal M}_7$). We compute the quantity $E - J$ (in the large $J$ limit) where $E$ is the energy and $J$ is the angular momentum of the spinning strings. In the two dimensional CFT dual to string theory on $AdS_3$ (times ${\cal M}_7$) it gives the anomalous dimensions of certain twist two and higher operators. We show in the deformed background that $E - J$ is bounded. At a special value of the deformation coupling we also show that for spinning closed strings containing $n &gt; 2$ cusps or spikes both $E$ and $J$ are bounded. In the CFT dual to string theory on $AdS_3$ (times ${\cal M}_7$) the spinning cusped strings describe operators with twist $n$ larger than two. In general, at other values of the deformation coupling, we demonstrate that this feature is exhibited only by those cusped strings with $n &gt; n_0$ where $n_0$ is determined only by the deformation coupling. We also give simple exact Regge relations between $E$ and $J$. We also study the closely related cusp anomalous dimension of a light-like Wilson loop. We comment on what $E - J$ measures away from the CFT along the deformation in the coupling space. In the long string sector the deformation is dual to a single trace $T{\bar T}$ deformed orbifold theory. We determine the associated deformed sinh-Gordon model that classically describes the (long) strings near the boundary. This provides an example of single trace $T{\bar T}$ deformation in non-orbifold theories.</description>

      <title>Non-supersymmetric duality cascade of QCD(BF) via semiclassics on $\mathbb{R}^2\times T^2$ with the baryon-'t Hooft flux</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the phase diagrams of the bifundamental QCD (QCD(BF)) of different ranks, which is the $4$d $SU(N_1) \times SU(N_2)$ gauge theory coupled with a bifundamental Dirac fermion. After discussing the anomaly constraints on possible vacuum structures, we apply a novel semiclassical approach on $\mathbb{R}^2\times T^2$ with the baryon-'t Hooft flux to obtain the concrete dynamics. The $2$d effective theory is derived by the dilute gas approximation of center vortices, and it serves as the basis for determining the phase diagram of the model under the assumption of adiabatic continuity. As an application, we justify the non-supersymmetric duality cascade between different QCD(BF), which has been conjectured in the large-${N}$ argument. Combined with the semiclassics and the large-$N_{1,2}$ limit, we construct the explicit duality map from the parent theory, $SU(N_1) \times SU(N_2)$ QCD(BF), to the daughter theory, $SU(N_1) \times SU(N_2-N_1)$ QCD(BF), including the correspondence of the coupling constants. We numerically examine the validity of the duality also for finite $N_{1,2}$ within our semiclassics, finding a remarkable agreement of the phase diagrams between the parent and daughter sides.</description>

      <title>Double Copy of 3D Chern-Simons Theory and 6D Kodaira-Spencer Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply an algebraic double copy construction of gravity from gauge theory to three-dimensional (3D) Chern-Simons theory. The kinematic algebra ${\cal K}$ is the 3D de Rham complex of forms equipped, for a choice of metric, with a graded Lie algebra that is equivalent to the Schouten-Nijenhuis bracket on polyvector fields. The double copied gravity is defined on a subspace of ${\cal K}\otimes \bar{\cal K}$ and yields a topological double field theory for a generalized metric perturbation and two 2-forms. This local and gauge invariant theory is non-Lagrangian but can be rendered Lagrangian by abandoning locality. Upon fixing a gauge this reduces to the double copy of Chern-Simons theory previously proposed by Ben-Shahar and Johansson. Furthermore, using complex coordinates in $\mathbb{C}^3$ this theory is related to six-dimensional (6D) Kodaira-Spencer gravity in that truncating the two 2-forms and one equation yields the Kodaira-Spencer equations on a 3D real slice of $\mathbb{C}^3$. The full 6D Kodaira-Spencer theory can instead be obtained as a consistent truncation of a chiral double copy.</description>

      <title>Extension of Hayward black hole in $f(R)$ gravity coupled with a scalar field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study looks into regular solutions in a theory of gravity called $f(R)$ gravity, which also involves a scalar field. The $f(R)$ theory changes Einstein's ideas by adding a new function related to something called the Ricci scalar. This lets us tweak the equations that describe how gravity works. Adding a scalar field makes the theory more interesting, giving us more ways to investigate and understand it. { The main goal of this research is to create regular black holes using a combination of $f(R)$ gravitational theory and a scalar field.} Regular solutions don't have any singularities, which are points where certain physical quantities, like invariants, become really big or undefined. { In this context, we find two regular black hole solutions by using a spherical space with either an equal or unequal approach.} For the solutions where we use the equal approach, we figure out the shape of $f(R)$ and how it changes, along with its first and second derivatives. We demonstrate that Hayward's solution in this theory stays steady because all the shapes of $f(R)$ and their first and second derivatives are positive. Next, we focus on the case where the metric isn't equal and figure out the black hole solution. We also find out what $f(R)$ and the scalar field look like in this situation. We demonstrate that the solution in this case is a broader version of the Hayward solution. When certain conditions are met, we end up back at the scenario where the metrics are equal. We also prove that this model is stable because $f(R)$, along with its first and second derivatives, are all positive. { We analyze the trajectories of these black hole solutions and determine the forms of their conserved quantities that remain same along those trajectories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Measurements profoundly impact quantum systems, and can be used to create new states of matter out of equilibrium. Here, we investigate the multipartite entanglement structure that emerges in quantum circuits involving unitaries and measurements. We describe how a balance between measurements and unitary evolution can lead to multipartite entanglement spreading to distances far greater than what is found in non-monitored systems, thus evading the usual fate of entanglement. We introduce a graphical representation based on spanning graphs that allows to infer the evolution of genuine multipartite entanglement for general subregions. We exemplify our findings on circuits that realize a 1d measurement-induced dynamical phase transition, where we find genuine 3-party entanglement at all separations. The 2- and 4-party cases are also covered with examples. Finally, we discuss how our approach can provide fundamental insights regarding entanglement dynamics for a wide class of quantum circuits and architectures.</description>

Abstract: We classify connected \'etale algebras $A$'s in multiplicity-free modular fusion categories $\mathcal B$'s with $\text{rank}(\mathcal B)\le9$. We also identify categories $\mathcal B_A$'s of right $A$-modules. The results have physical applications in constraining renormalization group flows. As demonstration, we study massive renormalization group flows from non-unitary minimal models to predict ground state degeneracies and prove spontaneous $\mathcal B$-symmetry breaking.</description>

Abstract: In four-dimensional conformal field theory, the numbers a and c are defined as coefficients of particular terms in the operator product expansion (OPE) of the energy-momentum tensor. With supersymmetry there are relations between these coefficients and mixed R-symmetry and gravitational anomalies. In this paper we prove a relationship between these coefficients and anomalies to holomorphic reparametrization symmetry at the level of the holomorphic twist.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the notion of subsystem in the framework of spectral triple as a generalized notion of noncommutative submanifold. In the case of manifolds, we consider several conditions on Dirac operators which turn embedded submanifolds into isometric submanifolds. We then suggest a definition of spectral subtriple based on the notion of submanifold algebra and the already existing notions of Riemannian, isometric, and totally geodesic morphisms. We have shown that our definitions work at least in some relevant almost commutative examples.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We apply the Grabowska-Kaplan framework, originally proposed for lattice chiral gauge theories, to QCD. We show that the resulting theory contains a conserved and gauge invariant singlet axial current, both on the lattice and in the continuum limit. This must give rise to a difference with QCD, with the simplest possibility being a superfluous Nambu-Goldstone boson in the physical spectrum not present in QCD. We find a similar unwanted conserved current in the recent "disk" formalism [Kaplan, Kaplan &amp; Sen], this time limiting ourselves to the continuum formulation. A similar problem is expected when either of these formalisms is used for its original goal of constructing lattice chiral gauge theories. Finally we discuss a conjecture about the possible dynamics that might be associated with the unwanted conserved current, and the fate of 't Hooft vertices.</description>

      <title>Axial Gravitational Perturbations of Slowly-Rotating Compact Objects in General Relativity and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the axial gravitational perturbations of slowly-rotating compact objects which are assumed to be supported by anisotropic fluids. We find that the gravitational perturbations decouple from the matter perturbations for axial sectors. We obtain a master wave equation whose potential is fully determined by the metric functions. This equation makes the calculations of gravitational QNMs for rotating compact objects extremely easy in specific background configurations.</description>

      <title>Preconditioned flow as a solution to the hierarchical growth problem in the generalized Lefschetz thimble method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The generalized Lefschetz thimble method is a promising approach that attempts to solve the sign problem in Monte Carlo methods by deforming the integration contour using the flow equation. Here we point out a general problem that occurs due to the property of the flow equation, which extends a region on the original contour exponentially to a region on the deformed contour. Since the growth rate for each eigenmode is governed by the singular values of the Hessian of the action, a huge hierarchy in the singular value spectrum, which typically appears for large systems, leads to various technical problems in numerical simulations. We solve this hierarchical growth problem by preconditioning the flow so that the growth rate becomes identical for every eigenmode. As an example, we show that the preconditioned flow enables us to investigate the real-time quantum evolution of an anharmonic oscillator with the system size that can hardly be achieved by using the original flow.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of paraquaternionic contact structures (pqc structures), which turns out to be a generalization of the para 3-Sasakian geometry. We derive a distinguished linear connection preserving the pqc structure. Its torsion tensor is expressed explicitly in terms of the structure tensors. We define pqc-Einstein manifolds and show that para 3-Sasakian spaces are precisely pqc manifolds, which are pqc-Einstein. We introduce the paraquaternionic Heisenberg qroup and show that it is the flat model of the pqc geometry.</description>

      <title>Gromov-Witten Invariants and Mirror Symmetry for Non-Fano Varieties Using Scattering Diagrams</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gromov-Witten invariants arise in the topological A-model as counts of worldsheet instantons. On the A-side, these invariants can be computed for a Fano or semi-Fano toric variety using generating functions associated to the toric divisors. On the B-side, the same invariants can be computed from the periods of the mirror. We utilize scattering diagrams (aka wall structures) in the Gross-Siebert mirror symmetry program to extend the calculation of Gromov-Witten invariants to non-Fano toric varieties. Following the work of Carl-Pumperla-Siebert, we compute corrected mirror superpotentials $\vartheta_1(\mathbb{F}_m)$ and their periods for the Hirzebruch surfaces $\mathbb{F}_m$ with $m \ge 2$.</description>

      <title>Quantum effects on the evaporation of PBHs: contributions to dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the relic abundance of dark matter in the presence of Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) beyond the semiclassical approximation. We take into account the quantum corrections due to the memory burden effect, which is assumed to suppress the black hole evaporation rate by the inverse power of its own entropy. Such quantum effect significantly enhances the lifetime, rendering the possibility of PBH mass $\lesssim 10^{9}$ g being the sole dark matter (DM) candidate. However, Nature can not rule out the existence of fundamental particles such as DM. We, therefore, include the possibility of populating the dark sector by the decay of PBHs to those fundamental particles, adding the contribution to stable PBH whose lifetime is extended due to the quantum corrections. Depending on the strength of the burden effect, we show that a wide range of parameter space opens up in the initial PBH mass and fundamental dark matter mass plane that respects the correct relic abundance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2103.13408v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: New techniques based on Exceptional Field Theory have recently allowed for the calculation of the Kaluza-Klein spectra of certain AdS$_4$ solutions of $D=11$ and massive IIA supergravity. These are the solutions that consistently uplift on $S^7$ and $S^6$ from vacua of maximal four-dimensional supergravity with SO(8) and ISO(7) gaugings. In this paper, we provide the complete Kaluza-Klein spectrum of five such AdS$_4$ solutions, all of them ${\cal N}=1$. These solutions preserve SO(3) and $\textrm{U}(1) \times \textrm{U}(1)$ internal symmetry in $D=11$, and U(1) (two of them) and no continuous symmetry in type IIA. Together with previously discussed cases, our results exhaust the Kaluza-Klein spectra of known supersymmetric AdS$_4$ solutions in $D=11$ and type IIA in the relevant class.</description>

      <title>Symmetries and Covering Maps for the Minimal Tension String on $\mathbf{AdS_3\times S^3\times T^4}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.16280v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper considers a recently-proposed string theory on $AdS_3\times S^3\times T^4$ with one unit of NS-NS flux ($k=1$). We discuss interpretations of the target space, including connections to twistor geometry and a more conventional spacetime interpretation via the Wakimoto representation. We propose an alternative perspective on the role of the Wakimoto formalism in the $k=1$ string, for which no large radius limit is required by the inclusion of extra operator insertions in the path integral. This provides an exact Wakimoto description of the worldsheet CFT. We also discuss an additional local worldsheet symmetry, $Q(z)$, that emerges when $k=1$ and show that this symmetry plays an important role in the localisation of the path integral to a sum over covering maps. We demonstrate the emergence of a rigid worldsheet translation symmetry in the radial direction of the $AdS_3$, for which again the presence of $Q(z)$ is crucial. We conjecture that this radial symmetry plays a key role in understanding, in the case of the $k=1$ string, the encoding of the bulk physics on the two-dimensional boundary.</description>

      <title>Semiclassical analysis of the bifundamental QCD on $\mathbb{R}^2\times T^2$ with 't Hooft flux</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.13954v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the phase structure of bifundamental quantum chromodynamics (QCD(BF)), which is the $4$-dimensional $SU(N) \times SU(N)$ gauge theory coupled with the bifundamental fermion. Firstly, we refine constraints on its phase diagram from 't Hooft anomalies and global inconsistencies, and we find more severe constraints than those in previous literature about QCD(BF). Secondly, we employ the recently-proposed semiclassical approach for confining vacua to investigate this model concretely, and this is made possible via anomaly-preserving $T^2$ compactification. For sufficiently small $T^2$ with the 't Hooft flux, the dilute gas approximation of center vortices gives reliable semiclassical computations, and we determine the phase diagram as a function of the fermion mass $m$, two strong scales $\Lambda_{1},\Lambda_2$, and two vacuum angles, $\theta_1, \theta_2$. In particular, we find that the QCD(BF) vacuum respects the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ exchange symmetry of two gauge groups. Under the assumption of the adiabatic continuity, our result successfully explains one of the conjectured phase diagrams in the previous literature and also gives positive support for the nonperturbative validity of the large-$N$ orbifold equivalence between QCD(BF) and $\mathcal{N}=1$ $SU(2N)$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. We also comment on problems of domain walls.</description>

Abstract: We construct new exact solutions of the Georgi-Glashow model in $3+1$ dimensions. These configurations are periodic in time but lead to a stationary energy density and no energy flux. Nevertheless, they possess a characteristic frequency which manifests itself through non-trivial resonances on test fields. This allows us to interpret them as non-Abelian self sustained coils. We show that for larger energies a transition to chaotic behavior takes place, which we characterize by Poincar\'e sections, Fourier spectra and exponential growth of the geodesic deviation in an effective Jacobi metric, the latter triggered by parametric resonances.</description>

      <title>On co-dimension 2 defect anomalies in N=4 SYM and (2,0) theory via brane probes in AdS/CFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07881v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a $\frac{1}{2}$-BPS solution for a D3 brane probe in AdS$_5 \times S^5$ that has world-volume geometry of AdS$_3 \times S^1$. It intersects the boundary over a surface that represents a dimension 2 defect in the boundary N=4 SYM theory. The effective action of the probe brane is proportional to the logarithmically divergent volume of AdS$_3$ and may thus be interpreted as computing conformal anomaly of the supersymmetric $S^2$ defect. The classical action scales as $N$. We compute the 1-loop correction to it due to quantum fluctuations of the D3 brane world-volume fields and compare the result to an earlier suggested expression for the defect anomaly. We also perform a similar analysis of a $\frac{1}{2}$-BPS M5 brane probe solution in AdS$_7 \times S^4$ with the world-volume geometry of AdS$_5 \times S^1$ that represents a dimension 4 defect in the boundary (2,0) 6d theory. Here the classical M5 brane action computes the leading order $N^2$ term in $a$-anomaly of the supersymmetric $S^4$ defect. We perform a detailed computation of the 1-loop correction to the M5 brane effective action and thus provide a prediction for the subleading constant in the $S^4$ defect $a$-anomaly coefficient.</description>

Abstract: We revisit anomalies of $(4,0)$ and $(3,1)$ maximally supersymmetric tensor theories in $d=6$. A $(4,0)$ on-shell tensor multiplet descends to that of the $d=5$ maximal supergravity upon a dimensional reduction, hypothesized to offer a strong-coupled UV completion of the latter in the same sense of $(2,0)$ theories as the UV completion of $d=5$ $\mathcal{N}=2$ pure Yang-Mills. The gravitational anomalies, found to be nonvanishing, had been computed, although its relevance in the absence of the $d=6$ metric is not obvious. We perform a comprehensive anomaly computation for $(4,0)$ and $(3,1)$ tensor supermultiplets, respectively, for $Sp(4)$ and $Sp(3)\times Sp(1)$ $R$-symmetry anomalies and the mixed $R$-gravitational anomaly thereof, and find that anomalies involving $R$-symmetries cancel out identically. We close with questions on how to address the anomaly in this class of theories with no general covariance.</description>

Abstract: We explore higher-dimensional conformal field theories (CFTs) in the presence of a conformal defect that itself hosts another sub-dimensional defect. We refer to this new kind of conformal defect as the composite defect. We elaborate on the various conformal properties of the composite defect CFTs, including correlation functions, operator expansions, and conformal block expansions. As an example, we present a free O(N) vector model in the presence of a composite defect. Assuming the averaged null energy condition (ANEC) does hold even for the defect systems, we conclude that some boundary conditions can be excluded. Our investigations shed light on the rich phenomenology arising from hierarchical defect structures, paving the way for a deeper understanding of critical phenomena in nature.</description>

Abstract: We consider matrix models exhibiting open-closed string duality in two-dimensional string theories with various amounts of supersymmetry. In particular, a relationship between matrix models in the $\beta = 2$ Wigner-Dyson class and models in the $(1 + 2\Gamma, 2)$ Altland-Zirnbauer class relates the perturbative solutions of the two systems' string equations. Point-like operator insertions in the closed string theory are mapped to the topological expansion of the free energy in the open string theory. We compute correlation functions of macroscopic loop operators and FZZT branes in a general topological gravity background. The relationship between the topological recursion of moduli space volumes and branes is discussed by analyzing the Virasoro conditions in the matrix models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14787v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study numerically an $s$-wave holographic superconductor from an anti-de Sitter-Einstein-Born-Infeld black hole with backreaction in the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence. By introducing a parameter $G$ to tune the effects of the backreaction, we can study non-perturbatively how the condensation properties and conductivity of the superconductor change as the backreaction increases. We find that for small values of $G$, increasing the nonlinearity of the Born-Infeld model makes the formation of the condensate harder -- consistent with previous results reported in the literature -- while for values of $G$ close to one, the opposite effect occurs; increasing the nonlinearity slightly facilitates its formation. We also determine how the ratio $\omega_g/T_c$ varies for different intensities of nonlinearity and backreaction, showing in particular that large deviations from the so-called universal value arise as backreaction becomes stronger.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.11215v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we consider a resonant bar detector of gravitational wave in the generalized uncertainty principle (GUP) framework with linear and quadratic momentum uncertainties. The phonon modes in these detectors vibrate due to the interaction with the incoming gravitational wave. In this uncertainty principle framework, we calculate the resonant frequencies and transition rates induced by the incoming gravitational waves on these detectors. We observe that the energy eigenstates and the eigenvalues get modified by the GUP parameters. We also observe non-vanishing transition probabilities between two adjacent energy levels due to the existence of the linear order momentum correction in the generalized uncertainty relation which was not present in the quadratic GUP analysis [http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1361-6382/abac45, Class. Quantum Grav. 37 (2020) 195006]. We finally obtain bounds on the dimensionless GUP parameters using the form of the transition rates obtained during this analysis.</description>

Abstract: The program AutoEFT is described. It allows one to generate Effective Field Theories (EFTs) from a given set of fields and symmetries. Allowed fields include scalars, spinors, gauge bosons, and gravitons. The symmetries can be local or global Lie groups based on U(1) and SU(N). The mass dimension of the EFT is limited only by the available computing resources. The operators are stored in a compact, human and machine-readable format. Aside from the program itself, we provide input files for EFTs based on the Standard Model and a number of its extensions. These include additional particles and symmetries, EFTs with minimal flavor violation, and gravitons.</description>

      <title>Exceptional points and ground-state entanglement spectrum of a fermionic extension of the Swanson oscillator</title>

Abstract: Motivated by the structure of the Swanson oscillator, which is a well-known example of a non-hermitian quantum system consisting of a general representation of a quadratic Hamiltonian, we propose a fermionic extension of such a scheme which incorporates two fermionic oscillators, together with bilinear-coupling terms that do not conserve particle number. We determine the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, and expose the appearance of exceptional points where two of the eigenstates coalesce with the corresponding eigenvectors exhibiting the self-orthogonality relation. We compute the entanglement spectrum and entanglement entropy of the ground state in two different ways, with one of them being via the Gelfand-Naimark-Segal construction. In addition to the approach involving the usual bi-normalization of the eigenvectors of the non-hermitian Hamiltonian, we also discuss the case where the eigenvectors are normalized with respect to the Dirac norms. It is found that the model exhibits a quantum phase transition due to the presence of a ground-state crossing.</description>

      <title>Graviton topology</title>

Abstract: Over the past three decades, it has been shown that discrete and continuous media can support topologically nontrivial modes. Recently, it was shown that the same is true of the vacuum, namely, right (R) and left (L) circularly polarized photons are topologically nontrivial. Here, we study the topology of another class of massless particles, namely the gravitons. Working in the transverse-traceless gauge and the limit of weak gravity, we show that the collection of all gravitons forms a rank-two vector bundle over the lightcone. We prove the graviton bundle is topologically trivial, allowing us to discover a globally smooth basis for gravitons. It has often been assumed that there exists such a global basis consisting of linear polarized gravitons. We prove that this stronger assumption is false -- the graviton bundle has no linearly polarized subbundles. While the total graviton bundle can be decomposed into trivial line bundles, it also has a natural geometric splitting into two topologically nontrivial subbundles, consisting of the R and L gravitons. Unlike the bundles in the trivial decomposition, the R and L gravitons are unitary irreducible bundle representations of the Poincar\'{e} group, and are thus elementary particles. The nontrivial topologies of the R and L gravitons are fully characterized by the Chern numbers $\mp 4$. These topologies differ from those of the R and L photons, which are characterized by the Chern numbers $\mp 2$. This nontrivial topology obstructs the splitting of graviton angular momentum into spin and orbital angular momentum.</description>
