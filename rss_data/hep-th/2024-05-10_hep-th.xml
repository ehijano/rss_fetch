      <title>Swampland Conjectures Constraints on Dark Energy from a Highly Curved Field Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the interplay of the trans-Planckian censorship conjecture (TCC) and the swampland distance conjecture (SDC) in the context of multifield dark energy in a curved field space. In this scenario, the phase of accelerated expansion is realized as non-geodesic motion in a highly-curved field space, reminiscent of models developed in the context of inflation. The model features a stable attractor solution with near constant equation of state $w\simeq -1$, and predicts that the current era of accelerated expansion is eternal. The latter implies an eventual conflict with the TCC, which holds that the duration of any epoch of cosmic acceleration is bounded by the requirement that the large-scale observable universe is blind to Planck-scale early universe physics. This tension can be resolved by an interplay with the distance conjecture: for suitable parameter values, the apparent violation of the TCC occurs well after the fields have traversed a Planckian distance. The SDC then predicts a breakdown of the effective field theory (EFT) before the TCC can be violated. We derive the constraints on the model arising from the SDC+TCC and the de Sitter conjecture. We demonstrate that the model can be consistent with both swampland conjectures and observational data from Planck 2018 and the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument.</description>

      <title>$A_\infty$ perspective to Sen's formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sen's formalism is a mechanism for eliminating constraints on the dynamical fields that are imposed independently from equations of motion by employing spurious free fields. In this note a cyclic homotopy associative algebra underlying Sen's formalism is developed. The novelty lies in the construction of a symplectic form and cyclic $A_\infty$ maps on an extended algebra that combines the dynamical and spurious fields. This algebraic presentation makes the gauge invariance of theories using Sen's formulation manifest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microstate geometries are proposed microstates of black holes which can be described within supergravity. Even though their number may not reproduce the full entropy of black holes with finite-sized horizons, they still offer a glimpse into the microscopic structure of black holes. In this paper we construct a new set of microstate geometries of the supersymmetric D1-D5-P black hole, where the momentum charge is carried by a vector field, as seen from the perspective of six-dimensional supergravity. To aid our construction, we develop an algorithm which solves a complicated partial differential equation using the regularity of the geometries. The new solutions are asymptotically AdS$_3\times S^3$, and have a long, but finite AdS$_2$ throat that caps off without ever developing a horizon. These microstate geometries have a holographic interpretation as coherent superpositions of heavy states in the boundary D1-D5 CFT. We identify the states which are dual to our newly constructed solutions and carry out some basic consistency checks to support our identification.</description>

      <title>A Space/Time Interchange Symmetry of Rotating AdS Black Holes in General Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the previously known local inversion symmetry of the five-dimensional Kerr-AdS metric that relates the over-rotating black hole to the under-rotating one and reinterpret it as an interchanging symmetry between time and the longitudinal angular coordinates. We generalize this to all $D$ dimensions, including $D=4$, thereby enlarging the trivial linear $\mathbb Z_N$ symmetry of the $N=\lfloor(D-1)/2\rfloor$ longitudinal angular coordinates to the nonlinearly realized $\mathbb Z_{N+1}$ symmetry that involves time.</description>

      <title>Locally Scale Invariant Chern-Simons Actions in 3+1 Dimensions and Their Emergence From 4+2 Dimensional 2T-Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The traditional Chern-Simons (CS) terms in 3+1 dimensions that modify General Relativity (GR), Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), and Quantum Electrodynamics (QED), typically lack scale invariance. However, a locally scale invariant and geodesically complete framework for the Standard Model (SM) coupled to GR was previously constructed by employing a tailored form of local scale (Weyl) symmetry. This refined SM+GR model closely resembles the conventional SM in subatomic realms where gravitational effects are negligible. Nevertheless, it offers an intriguing prediction: the emergence of new physics beyond the traditional SM and GR near spacetime singularities, characterized by intense gravity and substantial deviations in the Higgs field. In this study, we expand upon the enhanced SM+GR by incorporating Weyl invariant CS terms for gravity, QCD, and QED in 3+1 dimensions, thereby integrating CS contributions within the locally scale-invariant and geodesically complete paradigm. Additionally, we establish a holographic correspondence between the new CS terms in 3+1 dimensions and novel 4+2 dimensional CS-type actions within 2T-physics. We demonstrate that the Weyl transformation in 3+1 dimensions arises from 4+2 general coordinate transformations, which unify the hidden extra 1+1 large (not curled up) dimensions with the evident 3+1 dimensions. By leveraging the newfound local conformal symmetry, the augmented and geodesically complete SM+GR+CS introduces innovative tools and perspectives for exploring classical field theory aspects of black hole and cosmological singularities in 3+1 dimensions, while the 4+2 dimensional connection unveils deeper facets of spacetime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we present three new families of smooth Type II string theory backgrounds. These are dual to supersymmetry-preserving deformations of 4d SCFTs. The deformations include a VEV for a global current and a `twisted compactification' on a circle. We study various holographic aspects of the dual QFTs, focusing on Wilson loops and Entanglement Entropy. Additionally, we present a monotonic quantity calculating the density of degrees of freedom in terms of the energy, which interpolates between the IR 3d gapped theory and the 4d SCFT result. Other probes related to global aspects of the QFTs are briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Semiclassical solution of black hole information paradox</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We resolve black hole information paradox within semiclassical gravity, in a manner that does not depend on details of unknown quantum gravity. Our crucial insight is that outgoing Hawking particles are physical only at distances much larger than the Schwarzschild radius, so they are created far from the horizon and entangled with degrees of freedom at smaller distances. The later degrees of freedom can be understood as quasi-classical coherent states, implying that Hawking radiation is accompanied by additional radiation similar to classical radiation by which the black hole loses hair during the classical gravitational collapse. The two kinds of radiation are entangled, which resolves black hole information paradox.</description>

Abstract: We study the beta functions for the dimensionless couplings in quadratic curvature gravity, and find that there is a simple argument to restrict the possible form of the beta functions as derived from the counterterms at an arbitrary loop. The relation to the recent different results on beta functions is also commented on.</description>

      <title>Robustness of the Hedgehog Skyrmion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the radial profile function of the hedgehog Skyrmion with unit baryon number in generic EFTs (effective field theories) of pions. The analysis assumes chiral symmetry and ignores the pion mass term. The Skyrmion is always smooth, because it has no point source at the origin, and terms in the EFT with higher numbers of pion derivatives do not result in uncontrolled large corrections or singularities there. The profile varies in quite a limited way as the terms in the EFT change, and a universal profile function is proposed.</description>

      <title>3D bulk field theories for 2D non-unitary N=1 supersymmetric minimal models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose bulk 3D N=4 rank-0 superconformal field theories, which are related to 2D N=1 supersymmetric minimal models, SM(2, ...) and SM(3, ...), via recently discovered non-unitary bulk-boundary correspondence. The correspondence relates a 3D N=4 rank-0 superconformal field theory to 2D chiral rational conformal field theories. A topologically twisted theory of the rank-0 SCFT supports the rational chiral algebra at the boundary upon a proper choice of boundary condition. We test the proposal by checking several non-trivial dictionaries of the correspondence.</description>

      <title>An Infinite Family of Integrable Sigma Models Using Auxiliary Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a class of sigma models in two spacetime dimensions which are parameterized by an interaction function of one real variable. In addition to the physical group-valued field $g$, these models include an auxiliary vector field $v_\alpha$ which mediates interactions in a prescribed way. We prove that every model in this family is weakly integrable, in the sense that the classical equations of motion are equivalent to flatness of a Lax connection for any value of a spectral parameter. We also show that these models are strongly integrable, in the sense that the Poisson bracket of the Lax connection takes the Maillet form, which guarantees the existence of an infinite set of conserved charges in involution. This class of theories includes the principal chiral model (PCM) and all deformations of the PCM by functions of the energy-momentum tensor, such as $T \overline{T}$ and root-$T \overline{T}$.</description>

      <title>Modified gravity/entropic gravity correspondence due to graviton mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Some time ago, it has been suggested that gravitons can acquire mass in the process of spontaneous symmetry breaking of diffeomorphisms through the condensation of scalar fields [Chamseddine and Mukhanov, JHEP, 2010]. Taking this possibility into account, in the present paper, first we show how the graviton mass intricately reshapes the gravitational potential akin to a Yukawa-like potential at large distances. Notably, this long-range force modifies the Newton's law in large distances and might explain the phenomena of dark matter. The most important finding in the present paper is the derivation of a modified Newtons law of gravity by modifying the Verlindes entropic force relation due to the graviton contribution. The graviton contribution to the entropy basically measures the correlation of graviton and matter fields which then reproduces the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy at the horizon. This result shows the dual description of gravity: in the language of quantum information and entropy the gravity can be viewed as an entropic force, however in terms of particles and fields, it can be viewed as a longe range force. Further we have recovered the corrected Einstein field equations as well as the $\Lambda$CDM where dark matter emerges as an apparent effect.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent years have seen the concept of global symmetry extended to non-invertible (or categorical) symmetries, for which composition of symmetry generators is not necessarily invertible. Such non-invertible symmetries lead to a generalization of the standard Landau paradigm. In this work we substantiate this framework by providing a (1+1)d lattice model, whose gapped phases and phase transitions can only be explained by symmetry breaking of non-invertible symmetries.</description>

      <title>Higher Berry Curvature from the Wave Function I: Schmidt Decomposition and Matrix Product States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Higher Berry curvature (HBC) is the proposed generalization of Berry curvature to infinitely extended systems. Heuristically HBC captures the flow of local Berry curvature in a system. Here we provide a simple formula for computing the HBC for extended $d = 1$ systems at the level of wave functions using the Schmidt decomposition. We also find a corresponding formula for matrix product states (MPS), and show that for translationally invariant MPS this gives rise to a quantized invariant. We demonstrate our approach with an exactly solvable model and numerical calculations for generic models using iDMRG</description>

      <title>Higher Berry Curvature from the Wave function II: Locally Parameterized States Beyond One Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a systematic wave function based approach to construct topological invariants for families of lattice systems that are short-range entangled using local parameter spaces. This construction is particularly suitable when given a family of tensor networks that can be viewed as the ground states of $d$ dimensional lattice systems, for which we construct the closed $(d+2)$-form higher Berry curvature, which is a generalization of the well known 2-form Berry curvature. Such $(d+2)$-form higher Berry curvature characterizes a flow of $(d+1)$-form higher Berry curvature in the system. Our construction is equally suitable for constructing other higher pumps, such as the (higher) Thouless pump in the presence of a global on-site $U(1)$ symmetry, which corresponds to a closed $d$-form. The cohomology classes of such higher differential forms are topological invariants and are expected to be quantized for short-range entangled states. We illustrate our construction with exactly solvable lattice models that are in nontrivial higher Berry classes in $d=2$.</description>

      <title>Higher Berry Phase from Projected Entangled Pair States in (2+1) dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider families of invertible many-body quantum states in $d$ spatial dimensions that are parameterized over some parameter space $X$. The space of such families is expected to have topologically distinct sectors classified by the cohomology group $\mathrm{H}^{d+2}(X;\mathbb{Z})$. These topological sectors are distinguished by a topological invariant built from a generalization of the Berry phase, called the higher Berry phase. In the previous work, we introduced a generalized inner product for three one-dimensional many-body quantum states, (``triple inner product''). The higher Berry phase for one-dimensional invertible states can be introduced through the triple inner product and furthermore the topological invariant, which takes its value in $\mathrm{H}^{3}(X;\mathbb{Z})$, can be extracted. In this paper, we introduce an inner product of four two-dimensional invertible quantum many-body states. We use it to measure the topological nontriviality of parameterized families of 2d invertible states. In particular, we define a topological invariant of such families that takes values in $\mathrm{H}^{4}(X;\mathbb{Z})$. Our formalism uses projected entangled pair states (PEPS). We also construct a specific example of non-trivial parameterized families of 2d invertible states parameterized over $\mathbb{R}P^4$ and demonstrate the use of our formula. Applications for symmetry-protected topological phases are also discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In one spatial dimension, families of short-range entangled many-body quantum states, parameterized over some parameter space, can be topologically distinguished and classified by topological invariants built from the higher Berry phase -- a many-body generalization of the Berry phase. Previous works identified the underlying mathematical structure (the gerbe structure) and introduced a multi-wavefunction overlap, a generalization of the inner product in quantum mechanics, which allows for the extraction of the higher Berry phase and topological invariants. In this paper, building on these works, we introduce a connection, the higher Berry connection, for a family of parameterized Matrix Product States (MPS) over a parameter space. We demonstrate the use of our formula for simple non-trivial models.</description>

      <title>Quantum Phases and Transitions in Spin Chains with Non-Invertible Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generalized symmetries often appear in the form of emergent symmetries in low energy effective descriptions of quantum many-body systems. Non-invertible symmetries are a particularly exotic class of generalized symmetries, in that they are implemented by transformations that do not form a group. Such symmetries appear generically in gapless states of quantum matter, constraining the low-energy dynamics. To provide a UV-complete description of such symmetries, it is useful to construct lattice models that respect these symmetries exactly. In this paper, we discuss two families of one-dimensional lattice Hamiltonians with finite on-site Hilbert spaces: one with (invertible) $S^{\,}_3$ symmetry and the other with non-invertible $\mathsf{Rep}(S^{\,}_3)$ symmetry. Our models are largely analytically tractable and demonstrate all possible spontaneous symmetry breaking patterns of these symmetries. Moreover, we use numerical techniques to study the nature of continuous phase transitions between the different symmetry-breaking gapped phases associated with both symmetries. Both models have self-dual lines, where the models are enriched by so-called intrinsically non-invertible symmetries generated by Kramers-Wannier-like duality transformations. We provide explicit lattice operators that generate these non-invertible self-duality symmetries. We show that the enhanced symmetry at the self-dual lines is described by a 2+1D symmetry-topological-order (SymTO) of type $\mathrm{JK}^{\,}_4\boxtimes \overline{\mathrm{JK}}^{\,}_4$. The condensable algebras of the SymTO determine the allowed gapped and gapless states of the self-dual $S^{\,}_3$-symmetric and $\mathsf{Rep}(S^{\,}_3)$-symmetric models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The chiral magnetic effect (CME) is a collective quantum phenomenon that arises from the interplay between gauge field topology and fermion chiral anomaly, encompassing a wide range of physical systems from semimetals to quark-gluon plasma. This review, with a focus on CME and related effects in heavy ion collisions, aims to provide an introductory discussion on its conceptual foundation and measurement methodology, a timely update on the present status in terms of experimental findings and theoretical progress, as well as an outlook into the open problems and future developments.</description>

      <title>Geodesic motion of particles in the vicinity of the $\kappa$-deformed Schwarzchild Black Hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the geodesic motion of a test particle around the Schwarzchild black hole in a $\kappa$-deformed space-time. We compute a modified Lagrangian to obtain the $\kappa$-deformed effective potential and find the particle trajectories based on the constants of motion. For the same value of angular momentum, we obtain a significant deformation in the orbits of the particles due to the non-commutativity of the $\kappa$-deformed space-time. The deformation parameter becomes more significant for higher values of the angular momentum. The radius of the individual trajectories become smaller and their velocities decrease compared to the commutative case. The radius of the innermost stable circular orbit ($r_{ISCO}$) is also found using the modified effective potential. Though the equations get modified due to the non-commutativity of the $\kappa$-deformed space-time, the $r_{ISCO}$ remains the same. We then study a large number of freely streaming particles moving in this $\kappa$-deformed space-time and analyze the movement of these particles around the black hole due to the non-commutativity of the space-time. We concentrate on particles with different angular momentum moving around the black hole. We find that the motion of the particles are modified due to the non-commutativity of the space-time. The particles move slower along their respective trajectories in the deformed space-time. So, they remain closer to the black hole for a longer period of time, indicating that the accretion of freely streaming particles around the black hole would be modified by the non-commutativity of the space-time.</description>

      <title>The effect of anisotropy on the formation of heavy quarkonium bound states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the real part of the static potential of a heavy quark-antiquark system in an anisotropic plasma medium. We use a quasi-particle approach where the collective dynamics of the plasma constituents is described using hard-loop perturbation theory. The parton distribution function is characterized by a set of parameters that can accurately describe the anisotropy of the plasma produced in a heavy ion collision. We calculate the potential numerically in strongly anisotropic systems and study the angular dependence of the distortion of the potential relative to the isotropic one. We obtain an analytic expression for the real part of the heavy quark potential in the limit of weak anisotropy using a model that expresses the potential in terms of effective screening masses that depend on the anisotropy parameters and the orientation of the quark-antiquark pair. A 1-dimensional potential is formulated in terms of angle averaged screening masses that incorporate the anisotropy of the medium into a radial coordinate. We solve the corresponding Schr\"odinger equation and show that the magnitude of the binding energy typically increases with anisotropy. Anisotropy can play an important role, especially in states with non-zero angular momentum. This means that the number of bound states that are formed could depend on specific characteristics of the anisotropy of the plasma. Our study suggests that plasma anisotropy plays an important role in the dynamics of heavy quarkonium and motivates further study.</description>

Abstract: ``Calabi-Yau Manifolds: a Bestiary for Physicists'' by Tristan Hubsch in 1992 was a classic that served to introduce algebraic geometry to physicists when the first string theory revolution of 1984 - 94 brought, inter alia, the subject of Calabi-Yau manifolds to the staple of high-energy theorists. We are fortunate that a substantially expanded and updated new edition of the Bestiary will shortly appear. This brief note will serve as an afterword to the much anticipated volume.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the propagation of the quantum field perturbations in the interior of the Schwarzschild black hole. The interior of the black hole is like an anisotropic cosmological background which expands in one extended direction while contracting in azimuthal directions. Solving the quantum mode functions approximately, we calculate the expectation values of physical quantities such as the energy density $\langle \rho \rangle$ and pressure $\langle P\rangle$ as measured by an observer in the interior of the black hole. We employ a combination of the $\zeta$ function regularization and dimensional regularization schemes to regularize the UV divergences in the energy momentum tensor associated to these quantum perturbations. By solving the Einstein field equations, we calculate the quantum backreactions induced in the background geometry. We speculate that the effects of quantum fluctuations in the interior of the black hole can be measured by the exterior observer.</description>

      <title>Alleviating $H_0$ and $S_8$ Tensions Simultaneously in K-essence Cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The present work begins by examining the early-Universe inflationary epoch of a special K-essence model, which incorporates a linear coupling term between the scalar field potential and the canonical Lagrangian. For the power law potential, we both numerically and analytically prove that the inflationary parameters such as the spectral index and tensor-to-scalar ratio are compatible with the recent BICEP/Keck observations. Continuing this work, our analysis based on comparing early-Universe observations with late-Universe measurements indicates that the tension on the Hubble parameter $H_0$ and the growth of structure parameter $S_8$ can be alleviated simultaneously. More precisely, compared to the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, our model can reduce $H_0$ tension to roughly $2.2 \sigma$ and the $S_8$ discrepancy diminishes to $0.82\sigma$.</description>

      <title>Non-perturbative determination of the $N_f=2+1$ QCD sphaleron rate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The strong sphaleron rate, i.e., the rate of real time QCD topological transitions, is a key phenomenological quantity, playing a fundamental role in several physical contexts. In heavy-ion collisions, a non-vanishing rate can lead to the so-called Chiral Magnetic Effect. In early-Universe cosmology, instead, it can be related to the rate of thermal production of QCD axions. In this talk, we present the first reliable fully non-perturbative computation of the strong sphaleron rate in $N_f=2+1$ QCD at the physical point by means of lattice simulations, in a range of temperatures going from 200 MeV to 600 MeV. Our strategy is based on the inversion of lattice correlators via a recently-proposed modified version of the Backus-Gilbert method.</description>

      <title>Lattice Models for Phases and Transitions with Non-Invertible Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-invertible categorical symmetries have emerged as a powerful tool to uncover new beyond-Landau phases of matter, both gapped and gapless, along with second order phase transitions between them. The general theory of such phases in (1+1)d has been studied using the Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT), also known as topological holography. This has unearthed the infrared (IR) structure of these phases and transitions. In this paper, we describe how the SymTFT information can be converted into an ultraviolet (UV) anyonic chain lattice model realizing in the IR limit these phases and transitions. In many cases, the Hilbert space of the anyonic chain is tensor product decomposable and the model can be realized as a quantum spin-chain Hamiltonian. We also describe operators acting on the lattice models that are charged under non-invertible symmetries and act as order parameters for the phases and transitions. In order to fully describe the action of non-invertible symmetries, it is crucial to understand the symmetry twisted sectors of the lattice models, which we describe in detail. Throughout the paper, we illustrate the general concepts using the symmetry category $\mathsf{Rep}(S_3)$ formed by representations of the permutation group $S_3$, but our procedure can be applied to any fusion category symmetry.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave signatures of departures from classical black hole scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We initiate a general investigation into gravitational wave signatures of modifications to scattering of gravitational radiation from black holes. Such modifications may be present due to the quantum dynamics that makes black holes consistent with quantum mechanics, or in other models for departures from classical black hole behavior. We propose a parameterization of the corrections to scattering as a physically meaningful, model-independent, and practical bridge between theoretical and observational aspects of the problem; this parameterization can incorporate different models in the literature. We then describe how these corrections influence the gravitational wave signal, e.g. of a body orbiting a much more massive black hole. In particular, they generically change the rate of energy emission; this effect can be leveraged over many orbits of inspiral to enhance the sensitivity to small corrections, as has been noticed in simple models. We provide preliminary estimates of the sensitivity of future gravitational wave observations to these corrections, and outline further work to be done to connect both to a more fundamental theory of quantum black holes, and to realistic observational situations.</description>

      <title>Signatures of quantum geometry from exponential corrections to the black hole entropy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.13383v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has been recently shown in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 125 (2020) 041302] that microstate counting carried out for quantum states residing on the horizon of a black hole leads to a correction of the form $\exp(-A/4l_p^2)$ in the Bekenstein-Hawking form of the black hole entropy. In this paper, we develop a novel approach to obtain the possible form of the spacetime geometry from the entropy of the black hole for a given horizon radius. The uniqueness of this solution for a given energy-momentum tensor has also been discussed. Remarkably, the black hole geometry reconstructed has striking similarities to that of noncommutative-inspired Schwarzschild black holes [Phys. Lett. B 632 (2006) 547]. We also obtain the matter density functions using Einstein field equations for the geometries we reconstruct from the thermodynamics of black holes. These also have similarities to that of the matter density function of a noncommutative-inspired Schwarzschild black hole. The conformal structure of the metric is briefly discussed and the Penrose-Carter diagram is drawn. We then compute the Komar energy and the Smarr formula for the effective black hole geometry and compare it with that of the noncommutative-inspired Schwarzschild black hole. We also discuss some astrophysical implications of the solutions. Finally, we propose a set of quantum Einstein vacuum field equations, as a solution of which we obtain one of the spacetime solutions obtained in this work. We then show a direct connection between the quantum Einstein vacuum field equations and the first law of black hole thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Generalized Uncertainty Principle from the Regularized Self-Energy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.07198v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use the Schr\"odinger--Newton equation to calculate the regularized self-energy of the particle using a regular self-gravitational and electrostatic potential derived in the string T-duality. The particle mass $M$ is no longer concentrated into a point but it is diluted and described by a quantum-corrected smeared energy density resulting in corrections to the energy of the particle which is interpreted as a regularized self-energy. We extend our results and find corrections to the relativistic particles using the Klein-Gordon, Proca, and Dirac equations. An important finding is that we extract a form of generalized uncertainty principle (GUP) from the corrected energy. The form of GUP is shown to depend on the nature of particles; namely, for bosons (spin $0$ and spin $1$) we obtain a quadratic form of GUP, while for fermions (spin $1/2$) we obtain a linear form of GUP. The correlation we found between spin and GUP may offer insights into investigating quantum gravity.</description>

Abstract: We discuss the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model in curved space-time with torsion in the leading order of the $1/N$ expansion. The effective potential of the torsion sector is calculated using the new technique based on the nonlocal part of anomaly-induced action which was recently found to produce the effective potential in the low-energy limit. The spontaneous symmetry breaking caused by the change of the torsion term is found, confirming the statements known from the existing literature. Furthermore, the gap equation is calculated as a function of curvature and torsion. Finally, the behavior of the effective four fermions coupling constant as a function of the torsion is discussed.</description>

      <title>A Long Exact Sequence in Symmetry Breaking: order parameter constraints, defect anomaly-matching, and higher Berry phases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.16749v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study defects in symmetry breaking phases, such as domain walls, vortices, and hedgehogs. In particular, we focus on the localized gapless excitations which sometimes occur at the cores of these objects. These are topologically protected by an 't Hooft anomaly. We classify different symmetry breaking phases in terms of the anomalies of these defects, and relate them to the anomaly of the broken symmetry by an anomaly-matching formula. We also derive the obstruction to the existence of a symmetry breaking phase with a local defect. We obtain these results using a long exact sequence of groups of invertible field theories, which we call the "symmetry breaking long exact sequence" (SBLES). The mathematical backbone of the SBLES is studied in a companion paper. Our work further develops the theory of higher Berry phase and its bulk-boundary correspondence, and serves as a new computational tool for classifying symmetry protected topological phases.</description>

Abstract: We consider the case of the SYK model with non-gaussian disorder in the large $N$ limit. After obtaining the effective action, we derive the density of states and the free energy of the modified theory. We show that the non-gaussian disorder corresponds to a non-local Liouville theory, and non-minimally coupled 2D gravity action. It also provides a nice realization of Colemania - Coleman's idea from the 80s of generating a small Cosmological Constant. Finally, we also calculate out of time order correlation functions (OTOC) for the model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14921v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The superconformal index of $\frac12$-BPS states of $N=4$ U(N) super Yang-Mills theory has a known infinite $q$-series expression with successive terms suppressed by $q^N$. We derive a holographic bulk interpretation of this series by evaluating the corresponding functional integral in the dual $AdS_5 \times S^5$. The integral localizes to a product of small fluctuations of the vacuum and of the collective modes of an arbitrary number of giant-gravitons wrapping an $S^3$ of maximal size inside the $S^5$. The quantum mechanics of the small fluctuations of one maximal giant is described by a supersymmetric version of the Landau problem. The quadratic fluctuation determinant reduces to a sum over the supersymmetric ground states, and precisely reproduces the first non-trivial term in the infinite series. Further, we show that the terms corresponding to multiple giants are obtained precisely by the matrix versions of the above super-quantum-mechanics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17056v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Light-cone gauge-fixed sigma-models on $AdS_n\times S^n$ backgrounds play an important role in the integrability formulation of the AdS/CFT correspondence. The string spectrum of the sigma-model is gauge-independent, however the Hamiltonian and scattering matrix of the transverse worldsheet fields are not. We study how these change for a large family of inequivalent light-cone gauges, which are interpreted as $T\bar{T}$, $\tilde{J}T_\tau$, $JT_\sigma$ and $J^\tau$ deformations. We investigate the moduli space of equivalent light-cone gauges and, specialising to $AdS_5 \times S^5$, compute the different light-cone gauge symmetry algebras, well-known to be $\mathfrak{psu}(2|2)^{\oplus 2} \oplus \mathfrak{u}(1)^{\oplus 2}$ for the standard gauge-fixing. Many integrable deformations require a non-standard light-cone gauge, hence our classification and analysis of inequivalent gauges will be important for analysing such models.</description>

      <title>Supersymmetric smooth distributions of M2-branes as AdS solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00880v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the singularities of certain distributions of M2-branes can be removed by adding a Wilson loop around a compact direction along the brane. The holographic coordinate naturally ends up before the singularity and the resulting spacetime provides an AdS soliton configuration, albeit possibly supersymmetric. We study the phase space diagram of these M2-branes distributions endowed with Wilson loops and show that different distributions are interconnected, providing a rich structure of phase transitions at zero temperature.</description>

      <title>Restricted Phase Space Thermodynamics of NED-AdS Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03261v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Restricted Phase Space Thermodynamics (RPST) of magnetically charged Anti de Sitter (AdS) black holes sourced by nonlinear electrodynamics(NED). The first law and the corresponding Euler relation are examined using the scaling properties. While the mass is homogeneous in the first order, the intensive variables are observed to follow zeroth order homogeneity. We use numerical and graphical techniques to find the critical points of the various thermodynamic quantities. By utilizing the re-scaling properties of the equation of states, we study the thermodynamic processes using different pairs of variables. From our analysis, we infer that although the RPS thermodynamics of NED-AdS black hole resembles those of RN-AdS, Kerr-AdS, Kerr-Sen-Ads black holes in most of its aspects, hinting at a possible universality, there exists one particular $\mu-C$ process that differs in its behaviour from its counterparts in earlier reported works.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Novel Insights in Quantum Dynamics through Extended Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19029v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by recent developments in the study of the model of double scaled SYK (DSSYK), as elucidated in a recent paper, we embark on a re-evaluation of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model. Our motivation stems from the insights gained from the DSSYK model, particularly its ability to capture essential features of quantum dynamics and gravitational effects. In this work, we delve into the SYK model, uncovering precise solutions for the two-point function and self-energy that have not been previously reported. Building upon the advancements made in particle physics phenomenology, we extend the SYK model to encompass tensor field theory. Through the incorporation of a cutoff term to ensure convergence, we substantially advance our understanding of quantum many-body physics. Our investigation extends to experimental parameter estimation and the exploration of cutoff dependency in random couplings, providing invaluable insights into system dynamics. The introduction of a novel tensor field theory replaces conventional fermionic degrees of freedom with tensorial counterparts, leading to the discovery of intriguing phase transition phenomena characterized by a first-order transition. Furthermore, we elucidate a direct linear relationship between the coupling parameter and the cutoff scale. These findings not only shed light on emergent behavior across both high-energy physics and condensed matter systems but also pave the way for further theoretical and experimental exploration, inspired by the recent advancements in the SYK model.</description>

      <title>The Chromatic Lagrangian: Wavefunctions and Open Gromov-Witten Conjectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.00159v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inside a symplectic leaf of the cluster Poisson variety of Borel-decorated $PGL_2$ local systems on a punctured surface is an isotropic subvariety we will call the chromatic Lagrangian. Local charts for the quantized cluster variety are quantum tori defined by cubic planar graphs, and can be put in standard form after some additional markings giving the notion of a framed seed. The mutation structure is encoded as a groupoid. The local description of the chromatic Lagrangian defines a wavefunction which, we conjecture, encodes open Gromov-Witten invariants of a Lagrangian threefold in threespace defined by the cubic graph and the other data of the framed seed. We also find a relationship we call framing duality: for a family of "canoe" graphs, wavefunctions for different framings encode DT invariants of symmetric quivers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.03647v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a version of quantum mechanics that can handle nonassociative algebras of observables and which reduces to standard quantum theory in the traditional associative setting. Our algebraic approach is naturally probabilistic and is based on using the universal enveloping algebra of a general nonassociative algebra to introduce a generalized notion of associative composition product. We formulate properties of states together with notions of trace, and use them to develop GNS constructions. We describe Heisenberg and Schr\"odinger pictures of completely positive dynamics, and we illustrate our formalism on the explicit examples of finite-dimensional matrix Jordan algebras as well as the octonion algebra.</description>

      <title>Decoherence rate in random Lindblad dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04705v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Open quantum systems undergo decoherence, which is responsible for the transition from quantum to classical behavior. The time scale in which decoherence takes place can be analyzed using upper limits to its rate. We examine the dynamics of open chaotic quantum systems governed by random Lindblad operators sourced from Gaussian and Ginibre ensembles with Wigner-Dyson symmetry classes. In these systems, the ensemble-averaged purity decays monotonically as a function of time. This decay is governed by the decoherence rate, which is upper-bounded by the dimension of their Hilbert space and is independent of the ensemble symmetry. These findings hold upon mixing different ensembles, indicating the universal character of the decoherence rate limit. Moreover, our findings reveal that open chaotic quantum systems governed by random Lindbladians tend to exhibit the most rapid decoherence, regardless of the initial state. This phenomenon is associated with the concentration of the decoherence rate near its upper bound. Our work identifies primary features of decoherence in dissipative quantum chaos, with applications ranging from quantum foundations to high-energy physics and quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Solving lattice gauge theories using the quantum Krylov algorithm and qubitization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08859v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Computing vacuum states of lattice gauge theories (LGTs) containing fermionic degrees of freedom can present significant challenges for classical computation using Monte-Carlo methods. Quantum algorithms may offer a pathway towards more scalable computation of groundstate properties of LGTs. However, a comprehensive understanding of the quantum computational resources required for such a problem is thus far lacking. In this work, we investigate using the quantum subspace expansion (QSE) algorithm to compute the groundstate of the Schwinger model, an archetypal LGT describing quantum electrodynamics in one spatial dimension. We perform numerical simulations, including the effect of measurement noise, to extrapolate the resources required for the QSE algorithm to achieve a desired accuracy for a range of system sizes. Using this, we present a full analysis of the resources required to compute LGT vacuum states using a quantum algorithm using qubitization within a fault tolerant framework. We develop of a novel method for performing qubitization of a LGT Hamiltonian based on a 'linear combination of unitaries' (LCU) approach. The cost of the corresponding block encoding operation scales as $\tilde{O}(N)$ with system size $N$. Including the corresponding prefactors, our method reduces the gate cost by multiple orders of magnitude when compared to previous LCU methods for the QSE algorithm, which scales as $\tilde{O}(N^2)$ when applied to the Schwinger model. While the qubit and single circuit T-gate cost resulting from our resource analysis is appealing to early fault-tolerant implementation, we find that the number of shots required to avoid numerical instability within the QSE procedure must be significantly reduced in order to improve the feasibility of the methodology we consider and discuss how this might be achieved.</description>

      <title>Computing renormalized curvature integrals on Poincar\'e-Einstein manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11319v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe a general procedure for computing renormalized curvature integrals on Poincar\'e-Einstein manifolds. In particular, we explain the connection between the Gauss-Bonnet-type formulas of Albin and Chang-Qing-Yang for the renormalized volume, and explicitly identify a scalar conformal invariant in the latter formula. Our approach constructs scalar conformal invariants that are divergences at any Einstein manifold; these imply that the scalar invariant in the Chang-Qing-Yang formula is not unique in dimension at least eight. Our procedure also produces explicit conformally invariant Gauss-Bonnet-type formulas for compact Einstein manifolds.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian simulation of minimal holographic sparsified SYK model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14784v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The circuit complexity for Hamiltonian simulation of the sparsified SYK model with $N$ Majorana fermions and $q=4$ (quartic interactions) which retains holographic features (referred to as `minimal holographic sparsified SYK') with $k\ll N^{3}/24$ (where $k$ is the total number of interaction terms times 1/$N$) using second-order Trotter method and Jordan-Wigner encoding is found to be $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(k^{p}N^{3/2} \log N (\mathcal{J}t)^{3/2}\varepsilon^{-1/2})$ where $t$ is the simulation time, $\varepsilon$ is the desired error in the implementation of the unitary $U = \exp(-iHt)$, $\mathcal{J}$ is the disorder strength, and $p &lt; 1$. This complexity implies that with less than a hundred logical qubits and about $10^{6}$ gates, it will be possible to achieve an advantage in this model and simulate real-time dynamics up to scrambling time.</description>
