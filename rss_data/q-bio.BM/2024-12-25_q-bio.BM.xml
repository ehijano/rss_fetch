      <title>Old vaccines, new usages, surprisingly effective in solving the century-old problem -Inactivated African Swine Fever Virus vaccine induces safe and efficient immune protection through mucosal immunity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: African swine fever is among the most devastating viral diseases of pigs. Despite nearly a century of research, there is still no safe and effective vaccine available. The current situation is that either vaccines are safe but not effective, or they are effective but not safe.Findings: The ASF vaccine prepared using the inactivation method with propiolactone provided 98.6% protection within 100 days after three intranasal immunizations, spaced 7 days apart.Conclusions: An inactivated vaccine made from complete African swine fever virus particles using propiolactone is safe and effective for controlling ASF through mucosal immunity.</description>

      <title>Learning to engineer protein flexibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative machine learning models are increasingly being used to design novel proteins for therapeutic and biotechnological applications. However, the current methods mostly focus on the design of proteins with a fixed backbone structure, which leads to their limited ability to account for protein flexibility, one of the crucial properties for protein function. Learning to engineer protein flexibility is problematic because the available data are scarce, heterogeneous, and costly to obtain using computational as well as experimental methods. Our contributions to address this problem are three-fold. First, we comprehensively compare methods for quantifying protein flexibility and identify data relevant to learning. Second, we design and train flexibility predictors utilizing sequential or both sequential and structural information on the input. We overcome the data scarcity issue by leveraging a pre-trained protein language model. Third, we introduce a method for fine-tuning a protein inverse folding model to steer it toward desired flexibility in specified regions. We demonstrate that our method Flexpert-Design enables guidance of inverse folding models toward increased flexibility. This opens up new possibilities for protein flexibility engineering and the development of proteins with enhanced biological activities.</description>

      <title>PLD-Tree: Persistent Laplacian Decision Tree for Protein-Protein Binding Free Energy Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in topology-based modeling have accelerated progress in physical modeling and molecular studies, including applications to protein-ligand binding affinity. In this work, we introduce the Persistent Laplacian Decision Tree (PLD-Tree), a novel method designed to address the challenging task of predicting protein-protein interaction (PPI) affinities. PLD-Tree focuses on protein chains at binding interfaces and employs the persistent Laplacian to capture topological invariants reflecting critical inter-protein interactions. These topological descriptors, derived from persistent homology, are further enhanced by incorporating evolutionary scale modeling (ESM) from a large language model to integrate sequence-based information. We validate PLD-Tree on two benchmark datasets-PDBbind V2020 and SKEMPI v2 demonstrating a correlation coefficient ($R_p$) of 0.83 under the sophisticated leave-out-protein-out cross-validation. Notably, our approach outperforms all reported state-of-the-art methods on these datasets. These results underscore the power of integrating machine learning techniques with topology-based descriptors for molecular docking and virtual screening, providing a robust and accurate framework for predicting protein-protein binding affinities.</description>
