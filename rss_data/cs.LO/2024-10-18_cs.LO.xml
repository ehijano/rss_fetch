      <title>Verification of Linear Dynamical Systems via O-Minimality of Real Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study decidability of the following problems for both discrete-time and continuous-time linear dynamical systems. Suppose we are given a matrix $M$, a set $S$ of starting points, and a set $T$ of unsafe points.
  (a) Does there exist $\varepsilon &gt; 0$ such that the trajectory of every point in the $\varepsilon$-ball around $S$ avoids $T$?
  (b) Does there exist $\varepsilon &gt; 0$ such that every $\varepsilon$-pseudo-orbit of a point $s \in S$ avoids $T$?
  These two problems correspond to two different notions of robust safety for linear dynamical systems. Restricting $S$ to be bounded in both questions, and $M$ to be diagonalisable in question (b), we prove decidability for discrete-time systems and conditional decidability assuming Schanuel's conjecture for continuous-time systems. Our main technical tool is the o-minimality of real numbers equipped with arithmetic operations and exponentiation.</description>

      <title>Formalizing Hyperspaces and Operations on Subsets of Polish spaces over Abstract Exact Real Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building on our prior work on axiomatization of exact real computation by formalizing nondeterministic first-order partial computations over real and complex numbers in a constructive dependent type theory, we present a framework for certified computation on hyperspaces of subsets by formalizing various higher-order data types and operations. We first define open, closed, compact and overt subsets for generic spaces in an abstract topological way that allows short and elegant proofs with computational content coinciding with standard definitions in computable analysis and constructive mathematics. From these proofs we can extract programs for testing inclusion, overlapping of sets, et cetera. To enhance the efficiency of the extracted programs, we then focus on Polish spaces, where we give more efficient encodings based on metric properties of the space. As various computational properties depend on the continuity of the encoding functions, we introduce a nondeterministic version of a continuity principle which is natural in our formalization and valid under the standard type-2 realizability interpretation. Using this principle we further derive the computational equivalence between the generic and the metric encodings. Our theory is fully implemented in the Coq proof assistant. From proofs in this Coq formalization, we can extract certified programs for error-free operations on subsets. As an application, we provide a function that constructs fractals in Euclidean space, such as the Sierpinski triangle, from iterated function systems using the limit operation. The resulting programs can be used to draw such fractals up to any desired resolution.</description>

      <title>Axiomatization of Compact Initial Value Problems: Open Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article proves the completeness of an axiomatization for initial value problems (IVPs) with compact initial conditions and compact time horizons for bounded open safety, open liveness and existence properties. Completeness systematically reduces the proofs of these properties to a complete axiomatization for differential equation invariants. This result unifies symbolic logic and numerical analysis by a computable procedure that generates symbolic proofs with differential invariants for rigorous error bounds of numerical solutions to polynomial initial value problems. The procedure is modular and works for all polynomial IVPs with rational coefficients and initial conditions and symbolic parameters constrained to compact sets. Furthermore, this paper discusses generalizations to IVPs with initial conditions/symbolic parameters that are not necessarily constrained to compact sets, achieved through the derivation of fully symbolic axioms/proof-rules based on the axiomatization.</description>

      <title>Golyadkin's Torment: Doppelg\"angers and Adversarial Vulnerability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many machine learning (ML) classifiers are claimed to outperform humans, but they still make mistakes that humans do not. The most notorious examples of such mistakes are adversarial visual metamers. This paper aims to define and investigate the phenomenon of adversarial Doppelgangers (AD), which includes adversarial visual metamers, and to compare the performance and robustness of ML classifiers to human performance.
  We find that AD are inputs that are close to each other with respect to a perceptual metric defined in this paper. AD are qualitatively different from the usual adversarial examples. The vast majority of classifiers are vulnerable to AD and robustness-accuracy trade-offs may not improve them. Some classification problems may not admit any AD robust classifiers because the underlying classes are ambiguous. We provide criteria that can be used to determine whether a classification problem is well defined or not; describe the structure and attributes of an AD-robust classifier; introduce and explore the notions of conceptual entropy and regions of conceptual ambiguity for classifiers that are vulnerable to AD attacks, along with methods to bound the AD fooling rate of an attack. We define the notion of classifiers that exhibit hypersensitive behavior, that is, classifiers whose only mistakes are adversarial Doppelgangers. Improving the AD robustness of hyper-sensitive classifiers is equivalent to improving accuracy. We identify conditions guaranteeing that all classifiers with sufficiently high accuracy are hyper-sensitive.
  Our findings are aimed at significant improvements in the reliability and security of machine learning systems.</description>

      <title>Formalizing equivalences without tears</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11501v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This expository note describes two convenient techniques in the context of homotopy type theory for proving and formalizing that a given map is an equivalence. The first technique decomposes the map as a series of basic equivalences, while the second refines this approach using the 3-for-2 property of equivalences. The techniques are illustrated by proving a basic result in synthetic homotopy theory.</description>

      <title>Unifying lower bounds for algebraic machines, semantically</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.06787</link>
      <description>arXiv:1811.06787v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a new abstract method for proving lower bounds in computational complexity. Based on the notion of topological and measurable entropy for dynamical systems, it is shown to generalise three previous lower bounds results from the literature in algebraic complexity. We use it to prove that maxflow, a Ptime complete problem, is not computable in polylogarithmic time on parallel random access machines (prams) working with real numbers. This improves, albeit slightly, on a result of Mulmuley since the class of machines considered extends the class "prams without bit operations", making more precise the relationship between Mulmuley's result and similar lower bounds on real prams.
  More importantly, we show our method captures previous lower bounds results from the literature, thus providing a unifying framework for "topological" proofs of lower bounds: Steele and Yao's lower bounds for algebraic decision trees, Ben-Or's lower bounds for algebraic computation trees, Cucker's proof that NC is not equal to Ptime in the real case, and Mulmuley's lower bounds for "prams without bit operations".</description>

      <title>A complete formalization of Fermat's Last Theorem for regular primes in Lean</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01466v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We formalize a complete proof of the regular case of Fermat's Last Theorem in the Lean4 theorem prover. Our formalization includes a proof of Kummer's lemma, that is the main obstruction to Fermat's Last Theorem for regular primes. Rather than following the modern proof of Kummer's lemma via class field theory, we prove it by using Hilbert's Theorems 90-94 in a way that is more amenable to formalization.</description>

      <title>LeanAgent: Lifelong Learning for Formal Theorem Proving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06209v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been successful in mathematical reasoning tasks such as formal theorem proving when integrated with interactive proof assistants like Lean. Existing approaches involve training or fine-tuning an LLM on a specific dataset to perform well on particular domains, such as undergraduate-level mathematics. These methods struggle with generalizability to advanced mathematics. A fundamental limitation is that these approaches operate on static domains, failing to capture how mathematicians often work across multiple domains and projects simultaneously or cyclically. We present LeanAgent, a novel lifelong learning framework for theorem proving that continuously generalizes to and improves on ever-expanding mathematical knowledge without forgetting previously learned knowledge. LeanAgent introduces several key innovations, including a curriculum learning strategy that optimizes the learning trajectory in terms of mathematical difficulty, a dynamic database for efficient management of evolving mathematical knowledge, and progressive training to balance stability and plasticity. LeanAgent successfully proves 162 theorems previously unproved by humans across 23 diverse Lean repositories, many from advanced mathematics. It performs significantly better than the static LLM baseline, proving challenging theorems in domains like abstract algebra and algebraic topology while showcasing a clear progression of learning from basic concepts to advanced topics. In addition, we analyze LeanAgent's superior performance on key lifelong learning metrics. LeanAgent achieves exceptional scores in stability and backward transfer, where learning new tasks improves performance on previously learned tasks. This emphasizes LeanAgent's continuous generalizability and improvement, explaining its superior theorem-proving performance.</description>
