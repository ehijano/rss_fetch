      <title>Magnetically Enhanced Fenton-Like Processes by Nanofibers: Real-Time Observation of Tetracycline Degradation in Pig Manure Wastewater</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a novel approach for the degradation of tetracycline (TC) in pig manure wastewater using magnet-ite-based magnetic nanofibers (MNFs) as heterogeneous Fenton-like catalysts. The MNFs, composed of polyacrylonitrile (PAN) embedded with MnFe_2O_4 nanoparticles, were synthesized via electrospinning and exhibited high stability and catalytic efficiency. The degradation process was driven by hydroxyl radical (OH) formation through hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) activation on the MNF surface. The results showed that TC was first adsorbed onto the MNFs before undergoing oxidation, with treatment efficiency increasing with H2O2 concentration up to an optimum point, due to increased OH scavenging by H_2O_2. A heterogeneous dynamic kinetic model (DKM) was developed to describe the degradation mechanism, incorporating reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, catalyst surface inactivation, and polymer strip-ping effects. Furthermore, the application of an alternating magnetic field significantly accelerated the reaction rate, likely due to localized heating effects. This study highlights the potential of MNFs as a scalable, reusable and efficient alternative for antibiotic-contaminated wastewater treatment, offering advantages over conventional homogeneous Fenton processes by minimizing iron sludge formation and broadening the operational pH range.</description>

      <title>Redox chemistry meets semiconductor defect physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how the electronic structure of electrodes influences electrocatalytic reactions has been a longstanding topic in the electrochemistry community, with predominant attention paid to metallic electrodes. In this work, we present a defect physics perspective on the effect of semiconductor band structure on electrochemical redox reactions. Specifically, the Haldane-Anderson model, originally developed to study multiple charge states of transition-metal defects in semiconductors, is extended to describe electrochemical redox reactions by incorporating the solvent effect, inspired by the Holstein model. The solvent coordinate and the actual charge on the redox species in reduced and oxidized states are assumed to be instant equilibrium, and the transitions between these states are defined by the framework of Green's function. With these treatments, we treat the charge state transition in a self-consistent manner. We first confirm that this self-consistent approach is essential to accurately depict the hybridization effect of band structure by comparing the model-calculated ionization potential (IP), electron affinity (EA), and redox potential of the species with those obtained from density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Next, we illustrate how this self-consistent treatment enhances our understanding of the catalytic activities of semiconductor electrodes and the source of asymmetry in reorganization energies, which is often observed in prior ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations. Additionally, we discuss how band structure impacts redox reactions in the strong coupling limit. Finally, we compare our work with other relevant studies in the literature.</description>

      <title>Isomer-selective dissociation dynamics of 1,2-dibromoethene ionized by femtosecond-laser radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the isomer-specific photoionization and photofragmentation of 1,2- dibromoethene (DBE) under strong-field fs-laser irradiation in the gas phase complementing previous studies utilising ns- and ps-laser excitation. Our findings are compatible with a dissociative multiphoton-ionization mechanism producing a variety of ionic photofragments. Using both Stark deflection and chemical separation of the two isomers, pronounced isomer-specific photofragmentation dynamics could be observed for different product channels. While for Br+ formation, the isomer specificity appears to originate from different photoexcitation efficiencies, for the C2H2Br+ channel it is more likely caused by differences in the coupling to the exit channel. By contrast, the formation of the C2H2+ photofragment does not seem to exhibit a pronounced isomeric dependence under the present conditions. The present work underlines the importance of isomeric effects in photochemistry even in small polyatomics like the present system as well as their pronounced dependence on the photoexcitation conditions.</description>

      <title>Cavity Field-Driven Symmetry Breaking and Modulation of Vibrational Properties: Insights from the Analytical QED-HF Hessian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present the analytical derivation and implementation of the quantum electrodynamics Hartree-Fock Hessian. We investigate how electronic strong coupling influences molecular vibrational properties, applying this framework to formaldehyde, p-nitroaniline, and adamantane. Our analysis reveals cavity-induced changes in vibrational frequencies and intensities. Additionally, we show how the quantum electromagnetic field breaks molecular symmetry, activating previously forbidden infrared transitions. Our findings highlight the potential of strong coupling as a method for controlling and modulating molecular vibrational properties.</description>

      <title>Simulating metal complex formation and dynamics in aqueous solutions: Insights into stability, mechanism, and rates of ligand exchange</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metal coordination is ubiquitous in Nature and central in many applications ranging from nanotechnology to catalysis and environmental chemistry. Complex formation results from the subtle interplay between different thermodynamic, kinetic, and mechanistic contributions, which remain largely elusive to standard experimental methodologies and challenging for typical modeling approaches. Here, we present an effective molecular simulation approach that can fully describe the chemical equilibrium and dynamics of metal complexes in solution, with atomistic detail. Application to Cd(II) and Ni(II) complexes with various amine ligands provides an excellent agreement with available association constants and formation rates spanning several orders of magnitude. Moreover, investigation of polydentate ligands allows unravelling the origin of the chelate effect as due to the concurrent contribution of entropy, dissociation rates, and ligand binding mechanisms. This study represents a step forward for the in silico design of coordination chemistry applications and for a better understanding of biochemical processes activated by metal binding.</description>

      <title>Quantum Signature of Anisotropic Singularities in Hydrogen Bond Breaking of Water Dimer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In all standard force field-based simulations of organic, bio-molecules, polymers; the torsion angle based Hamiltonian has been an indispensable term to set up molecular simulation. Torsion often termed as a dihedral angle, the coordinate assumes a continuous molecular geometry and energy changes for an angle range from 0 to 360 degrees. However, quantum mechanics-based results presented earlier and in this report show electronic energy will have singularities due to molecular geometry criticality, and torsion based electrotonic energy is not a smooth function of (r, theta) due to bond-breaking geometry. Contrast to force field or molecular mechanics based results of geometrical and energy continuity, continuum of geometry under torsion is not feasible as per quantum mechanical electronic energy computations. This feature of electronic energy is readily observed for weakly H-bonded and VDW dimers.
  Applying the ab initio methods of Hartree-Fock, Density Functional as well as Moller-Plesset, we have reconfirmed the previous general predictions of electronic energy singularities with torsion angle variation around weak H-bond equilibrium and beyond for water dimer. Due to the quantum nature of the weak chemical bond breaking process leading to break-point conditions in molecules, the singularities in electronic energy is observed contrast to molecular mechanics results. These overlooked results of quantum energy singularities can be useful to improve the current bio-molecular force field and reaction chemistry dynamics involving bond-breaking process.

      <title>AI-enhanced High Resolution Functional Imaging Reveals Trap States and Charge Carrier Recombination Pathways in Perovskite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding and controlling charge carrier recombination dynamics is essential for enhancing the performance of metal halide perovskite optoelectronic devices. In this study, we present a machine learning-assisted intensity-modulated two-photon photoluminescence microscopy (ML-IM2PM) method to quantitatively map recombination processes in MAPbBr3 perovskite microcrystalline films at micrometer-scale resolution. To improve model accuracy, we implemented a balanced classification sampling strategy during the machine learning optimization phase. The resulting regression chain model effectively predicts key physical parameters across a 576-pixel spatial map, including exciton generation rate (G), initial trap concentration (N_TR), and trap energy barrier (E_a).
  These extracted parameters were subsequently used to solve a system of coupled ordinary differential equations, enabling spatially resolved simulations of carrier populations and recombination dynamics under steady-state photoexcitation. The simulations reveal significant spatial heterogeneity in exciton, electron, hole, and trap populations, along with photoluminescence and nonradiative losses. Correlation analysis delineates three distinct recombination regimes: (i) a trap-filling regime dominated by nonradiative recombination, (ii) a transitional crossover regime, and (iii) a band-filling regime characterized by markedly enhanced radiative efficiency. A critical trap density threshold of approximately 10^17 cm^-3 marks the transition between these regimes. Overall, this work establishes ML-IM2PM as a robust framework for probing carrier dynamics and informing defect passivation strategies in perovskite materials.</description>

      <title>Energy-Based Coarse-Graining in Molecular Dynamics: A Flow-Based Framework Without Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coarse-grained (CG) models offer an effective route to reducing the complexity of molecular simulations, yet conventional approaches depend heavily on long all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories to adequately sample configurational space. This data-driven dependence limits their accuracy and generalizability, as unvisited configurations remain excluded from the resulting CG model. We introduce a data-free generative framework for coarse-graining that directly targets the all-atom Boltzmann distribution. Our model defines a structured latent space comprising slow collective variables, which are statistically associated with multimodal marginal densities capturing metastable states, and fast variables, which represent the remaining degrees of freedom with simple, unimodal conditional distributions. A potentially learnable, bijective map from the full latent space to the all-atom configuration space enables automatic and accurate reconstruction of molecular structures. The model is trained using an energy-based objective that minimizes the reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence, relying solely on the interatomic potential rather than sampled trajectories. A tempering scheme is used to stabilize training and promote exploration of diverse configurations. Once trained, the model can generate unbiased, one-shot equilibrium all-atom samples. We validate the method on two synthetic systems-a double-well potential and a Gaussian mixture-as well as on the benchmark alanine dipeptide. The model captures all relevant modes of the Boltzmann distribution, accurately reconstructs atomic configurations, and learns physically meaningful coarse-grained representations, all without any simulation data.</description>

      <title>Egret-1: Pretrained Neural Network Potentials For Efficient and Accurate Bioorganic Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20955v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate simulation of atomic systems has the potential to revolutionize the design of molecules and materials. Unfortunately, exact solutions of the Schr\"odinger equation scale as O(N!) and remain inaccessible for systems with more than a handful of atoms, forcing scientists to accept steep tradeoffs between speed and accuracy and limiting the reliability and utility of the resultant simulations. Recent work in machine learning has demonstrated that neural network potentials (NNPs) can learn efficient approximations to quantum mechanics and resolve this tradeoff, but existing NNPs still suffer from limited accuracy relative to state-of-the-art quantum-chemical methods. Here, we present Egret-1, a family of large pretrained NNPs based on the MACE architecture with general applicability to main-group, organic, and biomolecular chemistry. We find that the Egret-1 models equal or exceed the accuracy of routinely employed quantum-chemical methods on a variety of standard tasks, including torsional scans, conformer ranking, and geometry optimization, while offering multiple-order-of-magnitude speedups relative to legacy methods. We also highlight important lacunae for future NNP research to investigate, and suggest strategies for building future high-quality models with increased scale and generality.</description>

      <title>The role of dark polariton states for electronic strong coupling in molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polaritonic chemistry investigates the possible modification of chemical and photochemical reactions by means of strong light-matter coupling in optical cavities, as demonstrated in numerous experiments over the last few years. These experiments are typically interpreted in terms of the Jaynes-Cummings or Tavis-Cummings models under the assumption that the molecular ensemble is only excited by a single photon. In such a model, two polariton states compete with an overwhelming number of dark states, inhibiting polaritonic reactions entropically. We analyze the higher excitation manifolds of the Tavis-Cummings model along with a three-level system that resembles photochemical reactions. We demonstrate that allowing for more than a single excitation makes the reaction of the involved polaritons entropically more favorable.</description>

      <title>Enhanced activity in layered-metal-oxide-based oxygen evolution catalysts by layer-by-layer modulation of metal ion identity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Few-layered potassium nickel and cobalt oxides show drastic differences in catalytic activity based on metal ion preorganization. Uniform compositions $[(\mathrm{CoO}_2/\mathrm{K})_6$ or $(\mathrm{NiO}_2/\mathrm{K})_6]$ show limited activity, while homogenously-mixed-metal cobalt/nickel oxides $[(\mathrm{Co}_n\mathrm{Ni}_{1-n}\mathrm{O}_2/\mathrm{K})_6]$ display moderate improvement. However, a layer-by-layer arrangement of cobalt and nickel oxide sheets [e.g., $(\mathrm{CoO}_2/\mathrm{K}/\mathrm{NiO}_2/\mathrm{K})$] provides superior catalytic performance, reducing the oxygen evolution overpotential by more than 400 mV. Density functional theory simulations provide an illustration of the electronic properties (density of states and localization of orbitals) that promote catalysis in the layer-segregated materials over those of homogeneous composition. This study reveals that atomic preorganization of metal ions within layered catalysts plays a more crucial role than overall metal composition in enhancing catalytic efficiency for oxygen evolution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00584v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a size-invariant (i.e., $N^0$) scaling algorithm for simulating fluorescence spectroscopy in large molecular aggregates. We combine the dyadic adaptive hierarchy of pure states (DadHOPS) equation-of-motion with an operator decomposition scheme and an efficient Monte Carlo sampling algorithm to enable a formally exact, local description of the fluorescence spectrum in large molecular aggregates. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the ensemble average inverse participation ratio (IPR) of DadHOPS wave functions reproduces the delocalization extent extracted from fluorescence spectroscopy of J-aggregates with strong vibronic transitions. This work provides a computationally efficient framework for fluorescence simulations, offering a new tool for understanding the optical properties of mesoscale molecular systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10560v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We apply the physics-learning duality to molecular systems by complementing the physical description of interacting particles with a dual learning description, where each particle is modeled as an agent minimizing a loss function. In the traditional physics framework, the equations of motion are derived from the Lagrangian function, while in the learning framework, the same equations emerge from learning dynamics driven by the agent loss function. The loss function depends on scalar quantities that describe invariant properties of all other agents or particles. To demonstrate this approach, we first infer the loss functions of oxygen and hydrogen directly from a dataset generated by the CP2K physics-based simulation of water molecules. We then employ the loss functions to develop a learning-based simulation of water molecules, which achieves comparable accuracy while being significantly more computationally efficient than standard physics-based simulations.</description>

Abstract: An ordered moment approach to exact open quantum dynamics is presented, which bypasses the Feynman-Vernon influence functional formalism. The hierarchical equations of motion are constructed using Wick's contraction, which follows specific orderings of the bath's creation and annihilation operators. Our approach moves beyond the traditional influence functional formalism, offering a more intuitive and direct framework, and extends the applicability of theory to nonlinear system--bath coupling scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10962v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hybrid functionals have been considered insufficiently reliable for the prediction of band gaps in solids and surfaces. We revisit this issue with a new generation of optimally-tuned range-separated hybrid functionals, focusing on the reconstructed Si(111)-(2x1) and Ge(111)-(2x1) surfaces. We show that certain hybrid functionals can accurately predict the surface-state and bulk fundamental and optical gaps, as well as projected band structures of these surfaces, by combining ground-state and time-dependent density functional theory.</description>

Abstract: Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are promising materials for methane capture due to their high surface area and tunable properties. Metal substitution represents a powerful strategy to enhance MOF performance, yet systematic exploration of the vast chemical space remains challenging. In this work, we compare density functional theory (DFT) and machine learning (ML) in predicting methane adsorption properties in metal-substituted variants of three high-performing MOFs: M-HKUST-1, M-ATC, and M-ZIF-8 (M = Cu, Zn). DFT calculations reveal significant differences in methane binding energies between Cu and Zn variants of all three MOFs. On the other hand, we fine-tuned a pretrained multimodal ML model, PMTransformer, on a curated subset of hypothetical MOF (hMOF) structures to predict macroscopic adsorption properties. While the fine-tuned heat of adsorption model and uptake model qualitatively predict adsorption properties for original unaltered MOFs, they fail to distinguish between metal variants despite their different binding energetics identified by DFT. We trace this limitation to the hMOF training data generated using Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations based on classical force fields (UFF/TraPPE). Our study highlights a key challenge in ML-based MOF screening: ML models inherit the limitations of their training data, particularly when electronic effects at open metal sites significantly impact adsorption behaviors. Our findings emphasize the need for improved force fields or hybrid GCMC/DFT datasets to incorporate both geometric and electronic factors for accurate prediction of adsorption properties in metal-substituted MOFs.</description>

      <title>Optical Properties of Nanocellulose and Nanocellulose-based Composites for Optoelectronic Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19166v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this review, we first provided a brief overview of cellulose structures, categorizing various types of nanocellulose based on their production methods, and discussed different photonic structures such as cholesteric phases, photonic crystals, distributed Bragg reflectors, and inverse photonic structures. We then reviewed some models that predict optical properties, including refractive index, scattering, reflection, and birefringence, highlighting factors that can influence these properties, such as electric field, surface roughness, temperature, and density, among others. Following this, we explored recent advancements in predicting optical properties, particularly the use of AI-driven algorithms to enhance the prediction of optical behaviors in nanomaterials. Finally, we provided an in-depth discussion of the latest developments in nonlinear optical phenomena and chiroptical responses in nanocellulose-based materials, focusing on circularly polarized luminescence, structural colors, structural correlations, the impact of enantiomers, and more.</description>
