      <title>The First Radio-Bright Off-Nuclear TDE 2024tvd Reveals the Fastest-Evolving Double-Peaked Radio Emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first multi-epoch broadband radio and millimeter monitoring of an off-nuclear TDE using the VLA, ALMA, ATA, AMI-LA, and the SMA. The off-nuclear TDE 2024tvd exhibits double-peaked radio light curves and the fastest evolving radio emission observed from a TDE to date. With respect to the optical discovery date, the first radio flare rises faster than $F_{\rm \nu} \sim t^{9}$ at $\Delta t = 88-131$ days, and then decays as fast as $F_{\rm \nu} \sim t^{-6}$. The emergence of a second radio flare is observed at $\Delta t \approx 194$ days with an initial fast rise of $F_{\rm \nu} \sim t^{18}$, and an optically thin decline of $F_{\rm \nu} \sim t ^{-12}$. We interpret these observations in the context of a self-absorbed and free-free absorbed synchrotron spectrum, while accounting for both synchrotron and external inverse-Compton cooling. We find that a single prompt outflow cannot easily explain these observations and it is likely that either there is only one outflow that was launched at $\Delta t \sim 80$ days, or two distinct outflows, with the second launched at $\Delta t \sim 170-190$ days. The nature of these outflows, whether sub-, mildly-, or ultra-relativistic, is still unclear, and we explore these different scenarios. Finally, we find a temporal coincidence between the launch time of the first radio-emitting outflow and the onset of a power-law component in the X-ray spectrum, attributed to inverse-Compton scattering of thermal photons.</description>

      <title>Analysis and simulations of binary black hole merger spins -- the question of spin-axis tossing at black hole formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin of binary black hole (BH) mergers remains a topic of active debate, with effective spins (chi_eff) measured by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) Collaboration providing crucial insights. In this study, our objective is to investigate the empirical chi_eff distribution (and constrain individual spin components) of binary BH mergers and compare them with extensive simulations, assuming that they originate purely from isolated binaries or a mixture of formation channels. We explore scenarios using BH kicks with and without the effect of spin-axis tossing during BH formation. We employ simple yet robust Monte Carlo simulations of the final core collapse forming the second-born BH, using minimal assumptions to ensure transparency and reproducibility. The synthetic chi_eff distribution is compared to the empirical data from LVK science runs O1-O3 using functional data analysis, kernel density estimations, and three different statistical tests, accounting for data uncertainties. We find strong indications for spin-axis tossing during BH formation if LVK sources are dominated by the isolated binary channel. Simulations with spin-axis tossing achieve high p-values (up to 0.882) using Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Cramer-von Mises, and Anderson-Darling tests, while without tossing, all p-values drop below 0.001 for isolated binaries. A statistically acceptable solution without tossing, however, emerges if ~72+/-8% of detected binary BH mergers result from dynamical interactions causing random BH spin directions. Finally, for an isolated binary origin, we find a preference for mass reversal in ~30% of the progenitor binaries. Predictions from this study can be tested with LVK O4+O5 data as well as the 3G detectors, Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer, enabling improved constraints on formation channel ratios and the critical question of BH spin-axis tossing.</description>

      <title>Utilizing Maximum Variability to Discern TDE Emission from AGN Flares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray emission arising from active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity may potentially mimic the expected emission of Tidal disruption events (TDEs). Ongoing and upcoming wide-field X-ray surveys will detect thousands of TDE-like sources, and classifying them securely as TDEs or AGNs is a challenging task. To this aim, we measure the average X-ray variability of AGNs and derive a threshold of maximum variation as a function of time separating the TDEs from AGN flares. For the comparison between TDE and AGN X-ray variability, we cross-match the publicly available XMM-Newton and Swift-XRT point source catalogs with the Million Quasars Catalog and optically selected TDEs. Then we compute the X-ray structure function (SF) and maximum variability of the AGN and TDE samples. The X-ray SF of AGNs has a power-law index $\gamma\sim0.11-0.14$ when fitted with a simple power-law model. However, the SF of AGNs is best described by a broken power-law or a power exponential model with a damping time scale $\tau=950\pm300$ days. The maximum variability comparison between TDE and simulated AGN light curves indicates they have a similar order of variation on a time scale of less than 20 days. However, at a longer time scale of ~20 days or more, the large-scale variations expected from power-law-like decay in TDEs become less frequent in AGNs. Furthermore, we compare the maximum variability of eROSITA TDE candidates with AGN, finding that many of the eROSITA-DE TDE candidates are consistent with flares from AGNs, and may not be TDEs.</description>

      <title>Instability windows of relativistic r-modes in stably stratified neutron stars with hyperonic cores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: (abridged) $R$-modes are oscillations in rotating stars, primarily restored by the Coriolis force. These oscillations are the most susceptible to the Chandrasekhar-Friedman-Schutz (CFS) instability driven by gravitational wave emission, which makes them promising targets for current and future gravitational wave searches. In order to develop, the instability must overcome dissipative processes within the star. As a result, $r$-modes become unstable only for certain combinations of stellar angular velocity $\Omega$ and (redshifted) temperature $T^\infty$, defining the so-called instability window on the $(\Omega, T^\infty)$ plane. At high temperatures, bulk viscosity $\zeta$, arising from out-of-equilibrium chemical reactions, is the dominant dissipative agent. Dissipation due to $\zeta$ can be greatly enhanced by two independent mechanisms: (1) the presence of hyperons, which significantly increases the bulk viscosity, and (2) the distinctive properties of relativistic $r$-modes in nonbarotropic matter, which further amplify dissipation beyond Newtonian predictions. In this work, we present the first investigation of the combined impact of these mechanisms on $r$-mode instability windows. Our calculations also account for the fact that chemical reactions modify the adiabatic index, in addition to producing bulk viscosity. We further estimate the influence of nucleon pairing effects on the instability windows. By comparing our predictions with recent observations of neutron stars in low-mass X-ray binaries, we find that bulk viscosity in hyperonic matter may provide the necessary dissipation to stabilize $r$-modes in the fastest-spinning and moderately hot stars, even when nucleon superfluidity and superconductivity are taken into account. These results have important implications for the interpretation of observations and for the broader understanding of relativistic $r$-mode physics.</description>

      <title>Magnetized Proto-Neutron Stars: Structure and Stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines the evolution of the global properties of magnetized proto-neutron stars (PNSs) across four key stages: neutrino-trapping, deleptonization, the neutrino-transparent phase, and the formation of a cold, catalyzed neutron star (NS). We perform general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations with strong magnetic fields of approximately 10^17 Gauss. The stellar matter is modeled using equations of state (EoS) derived from relativistic mean-field theory, employing density-dependent couplings calibrated by the DDME2 parameterization. We analyze how the gravitational mass, equatorial radius, shape deformation, magnetic flux, and the magnetic-to-binding energy ratio evolve in response to changes in internal composition, thermodynamic conditions, and magnetic field configuration. Our results show that as PNSs evolve, increasing entropy per baryon and decreasing lepton fractions lead to higher core temperatures. These thermodynamic changes enhance the star's susceptibility to magnetic field-induced deformation, facilitate greater magnetic flux confinement, and increase the magnetic-to-binding energy ratio, especially during the deleptonization and neutrino-transparent phases. The PNS's core temperature also determines the efficiency of magnetic field decay. We find that dissipation is fastest during the deleptonization and neutrino-transparent phases, a process that ultimately defines the observable magnetic field of the mature NS.</description>

      <title>Low-frequency spectra of neutron star + OB supergiant binaries: Does wind density drive persistent and flaring modes of accretion?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutron star high-mass X-ray binaries, where the compact object orbits a massive star in a sufficiently tight orbit to allow accretion to occur, are well-studied in wavebands between the infrared and hard X-rays. Their low-frequency millimeter and radio properties, on the other hand, remain poorly understood. In this paper, we present the first work in a series focusing on the millimeter and radio emission of systems where a neutron star accretes from an OB supergiant. We report ALMA and NOEMA millimeter observations of twelve systems, supplemented by VLA radio observations of six of those targets. Our targets include six Supergiant X-ray Binaries (SgXBs), four Supergiant Fast X-ray Transients (SFXTs), and two intermediate systems. Nine out of twelve targets, including all SFXTs, are detected in at least one millimeter band, while in the radio, only two targets are detected. All detected targets display inverted radio/millimeter spectra, with spectral indices in the range $\alpha =0.6-0.8$ for those systems where accurate SED fits could be performed. We conclude, firstly, that the low-frequency SEDs of neutron star SFXTs and SgXBs are dominated by free-free emission from the OB supergiant's stellar wind, and that jet emission is unlikely to be observed unless the systems can be detected at sub-GHz frequencies. Secondly, we find that SFXTs are fainter at 100 GHz than prototypical SgXBs, probably due to systematically less dense winds in the former, as supported further by the differences in their fluorescence Fe K$\alpha$ lines. We furthermore compare the stellar wind constraints obtained from our millimeter observations with those from IR/optical/UV studies and bow shock detections, and present evidence for long-term stellar wind variability visible in the thermal emission.</description>

      <title>Spectral Energy Correlations of Gamma-Ray Bursts from Structured Jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using 148 out-axis gamma-ray bursts, we build their spectrum-energy relations of peak energy versus isotropic energy, peak energy versus peak luminosity and peak energy versus jet-calibrated energy which are corrected for a structured jet model. These relations are found to depend on the observer's viewing angle as long as the observer is within the jet cone. After converting the out-axis energy relations to the in-axis situations, we find that the corresponding in-axis energy relations are universally steeper, of which all of them can be roughly interpreted by the Synchrotron radiation mechanism as shown in Xu et al.. Meanwhile, we notice that the in-axis means of isotropic energies are about one order of magnitude larger than the out-axis means for both short and long bursts except the Supernova-associated gamma-ray bursts. Furthermore, we apply all the newly-found energy relations to construct the Hubble diagrams of out/in-axis bursts. It is found that the in-axis Hubble diagrams are better cosmological indicators.</description>

      <title>TeV Afterglows of Gamma-Ray Bursts: Theoretical Analysis and Prospects for Future Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent detections of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) at TeV energies opened new prospects for investigating radiative environments and particle acceleration mechanisms under extreme conditions. In this paper, we study the afterglows of these GRBs - namely GRB 180720B, GRB 190114C, GRB 190829A, GRB 201216C, and GRB 221009A - modeling their synchrotron and inverse Compton emission within the framework of an optimized relativistic fireball model. We constrain the model parameters and their temporal evolution by applying our theoretical model to the high-energy emission in the X-ray and GeV-TeV energy bands observed at intermediate and late times. Our results reveal interesting differences among the TeV-detected GRBs, potentially reflecting a variety of underlying physical processes that lead to different maximum energies $E_{\text{max}}= \, \gamma_{\text{max}}\, m_e \, c^2$ of the accelerated particles responsible for the GRB high-energy emission. We indeed obtain different behaviors of the late TeV afterglows that ultimately depend on $\gamma_{\text{max}}$. We discuss how late afterglow observations - on timescales of hours and days - of X-ray and GeV-TeV emissions are crucial for providing diagnostics of the physical processes behind GRBs, and we emphasize the theoretical expectations for future TeV observations.</description>

      <title>Energy Cascade and Damping in Fast-Mode Compressible Turbulence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.03443v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This letter presents hybrid and fully kinetic particle-in-cell simulations of fast-mode compressible turbulence. Turbulence damping at magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) scales closely follows linear transit-time damping theory. Despite strong phase steepening, turbulence sustains robust cross-scale energy cascading. These findings resolve the long-standing question about the validity of classical wave theories in strongly nonlinear regimes and overturn the common presumption that wave steepening disrupts compressible turbulence cascade, thereby providing a more complete picture of MHD turbulence.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Axion Background Detection Using Resonant Cavity Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The axion is a well-motivated and generic extension of the Standard Model. If produced in the early universe, axions may still be relativistic today, forming a Cosmic Axion Background (C$a$B) potentially detectable in direct detection experiments. A key challenge, however, is that the C$a$B is expected to have a broad energy spectrum, limiting the effectiveness of resonant cavity experiments designed for narrowband searches. We propose a new strategy using multi-cavity arrays to distinguish signal from background noise by exploiting spatial correlations in the axion-induced electric fields. We compute the two-point correlation function for electric fields in spatially separated cavities sourced by an isotropic C$a$B. Analyzing various cavity geometries, we find that stacked, wide-base cavity arrays offer optimal sensitivity to the axion signal. We apply our formalism to prospective upgrades of the ADMX experiment, including configurations with four and eighteen coupled cavities.</description>

      <title>Profiling Dark Matter Spikes with Gravitational Waves from Accelerated Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dark matter halos can develop a density spike, e.g., around a galactic supermassive black hole, with the profile $\rho \propto r^{-\gamma_{\rm sp}}$ determined both by the galaxy's formation history and the microphysics of dark matter. We show that future LISA/DECIGO observations, of intermediate/stellar-mass binary mergers inside the spike around the supermassive black hole, can measure $\gamma_{\rm sp}$ at a few-percent--level precision. The spike induces a distinctive time-dependent acceleration along the non-circular orbit taken by the binary's center of mass, which is observable as a secular modulation of the gravitational wave signal. This method -- insensitive to confounding astrophysical effects (dynamical friction, tidal effects, etc.) and not reliant on unknown dark matter particle physics -- provides a clean diagnostic of density spikes and a new probe of dark matter.</description>

      <title>Jet collimation in a spiral-hosted AGN: a parabolic jet profile in 0313-192</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03817v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Double-lobed radio sources associated with active galactic nuclei (DRAGNs) are typically found in elliptical galaxies, while supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in disk galaxies rarely produce powerful kpc-scale jets. However, the growing number of spiral- and disk-hosted DRAGNs challenges this classical dichotomy. We present a study of the jet collimation profile for one such source, 0313-192, using VLBA and VLA data, tracing the jet morphology across nearly five orders of magnitude in scale -- from $\sim$ pc to $\sim100$ kpc (projected). We find that the jet exhibits a parabolic expansion up to $\sim 610$ pc ($\sim 7.9 \times 10^6$ Schwarzschild radii), followed by a transition to a nearly conical shape, assuming kpc-scale emission primarily originates from the jet rather than the lobe. This structural evolution closely resembles those in AGNs hosted by elliptical galaxies and provides an explanation for how the jet in this system could extend to large distances by magnetohydrodynamic collimation and acceleration. However, this collimation break occurs beyond the sphere of gravitational influence of the SMBH ($\sim7.3\times10^{5} R_{S}$), and no extended X-ray halos or dense molecular gas structures are detected to provide the necessary external pressure. Therefore we suggest that jet confinement in 0313-192 is mediated by contributions from non-thermal components, such as ram and magnetic pressure from magnetized disk winds. These mechanisms may enable jet collimation even in the absence of dense ambient gas. Our results highlight how large-scale jets can arise in disk galaxies under rare conditions and demonstrate the need to broaden studies of AGN jet formation beyond traditional models.</description>

Abstract: We present James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations of four Luminous Red Novae (LRNe): dusty, extragalactic transients from stellar mergers following common-envelope evolution (CEE) in massive binary stars. Our targets - AT2021blu, AT2021biy, AT2018bwo, and M31-LRN-2015 - span a broad range in progenitor primary masses ($\approx$3-24M$_{\odot}$) and post-merger ages ($\approx$1100-3700 days). All four were observed with the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) from 5-25$\mu$m; AT2021blu and AT2021biy additionally have 5-12$\mu$m spectra from the Low-Resolution Spectrometer. These spectra show strong features of oxygen-rich molecules, including water vapor, supporting the recent association of water fountain sources with CEE. Radiative transfer modeling of the spectral energy distributions yields dust masses of $\approx$4.2$\times10^{-5}$, 3$\times10^{-4}$, 7.5$\times10^{-5}$, and 7.7$\times10^{-4}$M$_{\odot}$ respectively - corresponding to $\approx10$%, 60%, 6% and 12% of median dust masses in core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) at similar phases. Accounting for their occurrence rates, we estimate that LRNe can contribute $\sim$25% as much dust as CCSNe to the cosmic dust budget. Furthermore, the lower expansion velocities of LRNe may reduce dust destruction by reverse shocks compared to CCSNe, potentially increasing this contribution. In addition to dust masses, we use our \emph{JWST} observations to measure late-time properties such as the luminosities, temperatures, radii, and dust-to-gas ratios of the merger remnants. Our results highlight the need for broader infrared studies of LRNe to quantify their contribution to the cosmic dust budget, study the evolution of oxygen-rich molecules, and probe the final fates of CEE.</description>

      <title>Primordial black hole induced gravitational waves in $f(R)$ gravity</title>

Abstract: Ultra-light primordial black holes (PBHs) with masses $M_\mathrm{PBH}&lt;5\times 10^{8}\mathrm{g}$ can trigger an early matter-dominated (eMD) era before Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) and reheat the Universe through their evaporation. Notably, the initial isocurvature in nature PBH energy density fluctuations can induce abundantly gravitational waves (GWs) due to second-order gravitational effects. In this work, we study this induced GW signal within the context of $f(R)$ gravity theories investigating the effect of $f(R)$ gravity on the behaviour of scalar perturbations during the PBH-driven eMD era as well as on the source of the second-order induced tensor modes. In particular, we focus on two very minimal $f(R)$ models, that is $R^2$ and $R^{1+\epsilon}$, with $\epsilon\ll 1$, gravity theories as illustrative examples, finding at the end that $R^2$ gravity presents very small deviations from general relativity (GR) at the level of both the scalar and tensor perturbations. However, $R^{1+\epsilon}$ gravity features a different behaviour, exhibiting in particular an exponential growth of scalar perturbations during a matter-dominated era. This unique feature leads ultimately to an enhanced induced GW signal even for very small initial PBH abundances, being characterized by a linear frequency scaling on large infrared scales away from the peak frequency, i.e. $\Omega_\mathrm{GW}(k)\propto f$ for $f\ll f_\mathrm{peak}$, and a spiky behaviour close to the non-linear cut-off scale below which perturbation theory breaks down. Interestingly, one finds as well that the induced GW signal can be well within the sensitivity curves of GW detectors, namely that of LISA, ET, BBO and SKA.</description>

      <title>Stringent constraint on the CCC+TL cosmology with $H(z)$ Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04277v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, the Covarying Coupling Constants and Tired Light (CCC+TL) hybrid model was proposed to explain the unexpectedly small angular diameters of high-redshift galaxies observed by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) that are challenging to reconcile with the $\Lambda$CDM model. In this work, we test the CCC+TL model against model-independent Hubble parameter [$H(z)$] measurements obtained from cosmic chronometers. It turns out that the parameter set optimized for the type-Ia supernova (SN Ia) dataset within the CCC+TL model fails to reproduce the $H(z)$ data, but the $\Lambda$CDM model works well. Statistical comparison using the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) strongly favors $\Lambda$CDM over CCC+TL for the $H(z)$ data, with $\Delta \mathrm{BIC} = 60.85$. Additionally, the fit of the CCC+TL model to the $H(z)$ data results in a best-fit value for the speed-of-light variation index parameter $\alpha$ disagreeing with that for the SN Ia data at the $\sim 6\sigma$ level, demonstrating significant internal tension within the CCC+TL framework.</description>

      <title>X-ray flux -- mass relation for $z\gtrsim 0.7$ galaxy clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use a subsample of co-detections of the ACT and MaDCoWS cluster catalogs to verify the predicted relation between the observed X-ray flux $F_X$ in the 0.5-2~keV band and the cluster mass $M_{\rm 500c}$ for halos at $z&gt;0.6-0.7$. We modify this relation by introducing a correction coefficient $\eta$, which is supposed to encapsulate factors associated with a particular method of flux estimation, the sample selection function, the definition of the cluster mass, etc. We show that the X-ray flux, being the most basic X-ray observable, serves as a convenient and low-cost mass indicator for distant galaxy clusters with photometric or even missing redshifts (by setting $z=1$) as long as it is known that $z\gtrsim 0.6-0.7$. The correction coefficient $\eta$ is $\approx 0.8$ if $M^{\rm UPP}_{\rm 500c}$ from the ACT-DR5 catalog are used as cluster masses and $\eta\approx 1.1$ if weak-lensing-calibrated masses $M^{\rm Cal}_{\rm 500c}$ are used instead.</description>

      <title>A novel approach for air shower profile reconstruction with dense radio antenna arrays using Information Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reconstructing the longitudinal profile of extensive air showers, generated from the interaction of cosmic rays in the Earth's atmosphere, is crucial to understanding their mass composition, which in turn provides valuable insight on their possible sources of origin. Dense radio antenna arrays such as the LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR) telescope as well as the upcoming Square Kilometre Array Observatory (SKAO) are ideal instruments to explore the potential of air shower profile reconstruction, as their high antenna density allows cosmic ray observations with unprecedented accuracy. However, current analysis approaches can only recover $X_\mathrm{max}$, the atmospheric depth at shower maximum, and heavily rely on computationally expensive simulations. As such, it is ever more crucial to develop new analysis approaches that can perform a full air shower profile reconstruction efficiently.
  In this work, we develop a novel framework to reconstruct the longitudinal profile of air showers using measurements from radio detectors with Information Field Theory (IFT), a state-of-the-art reconstruction framework based on Bayesian inference. Through IFT, we are able to exploit all available information in the signal (amplitude, phase, and pulse shape) at each antenna position simultaneously and explicitly utilise models that are motivated through our current understanding of air shower physics. We verify our framework on simulated datasets prepared for LOFAR, showcasing that we can not only reconstruct the air shower profile with uncertainties in each atmospheric depth bin but also recover the reconstructed trace at each antenna position. Our framework demonstrates that radio measurements with dense antenna layouts such as LOFAR and SKAO have the capability to go beyond reconstruction of $X_\mathrm{max}$ and will thus aid in our understanding of the mass composition of cosmic rays.</description>

      <title>Dance to Demise -- How Massive Stars May Form Dense Circumstellar Shells Before Explosion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the evolution of red supergiant (RSG) progenitors of core-collapse (CC) supernovae (SNe) with initial masses between 12-20 Msun focusing on effects of enhanced mass loss due to pulsation-driven instabilities in their envelopes and subsequent dynamical ejections during advanced stages of nuclear burning. Using time-dependent mass loss rates from detailed MESA stellar evolution models, including prescriptions for both pulsation-driven superwinds and shock-induced ejections, we construct the circumstellar medium (CSM) before the SN explosion. We calculate resulting CSM density profiles and column densities considering the radiation-driven acceleration of the stellar wind. Our models produce episodes of enhanced mass loss ~10^-4-10^-2 Msun/yr in the last centuries-decades before explosion forming dense CSM (&gt;~10^-15 g/cm^3 at distances &lt;~10^15 cm) - consistent with multi-wavelength observations of Type II SNe such as SN 2023ixf, SN 2020ywx, SN 2017hcc, SN 2005ip and SN 1998S. The formation of such dense CS shells, as predicted by our single star RSG models, provides a natural explanation for observed flash-ionization signatures, X-ray and radio emission, and has important implications for dust formation around Type II SNe.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.04510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The detection of side-scattered ultraviolet light from spaceborne lasers with fluorescence telescopes of cosmic ray observatories offers unique opportunities for systematic studies of the aerosol content of the local atmosphere. It also enables the validation of the optical calibration of the telescopes. Additionally, these observations provide valuable ground-based monitoring of the performance of the scientific instruments aboard satellites used for Earth climate observation. Here, we report on results from the reconstruction of laser shots from the spaceborne lidar instrument ALADIN aboard the Aeolus satellite in 2019, 2020 and 2021. Furthermore, we present initial observations of laser shots from ATLID, the atmospheric lidar of the EarthCARE satellite, launched in 2024. EarthCARE's orbit is particularly well-suited for enabling laser detection within a few days at both the Pierre Auger Observatory and the Telescope Array Experiment, facilitating a relative calibration of the energy scales of these observatories.</description>

      <title>The Role of r-Modes in Pulsar Spin-down, Pulsar Timing, and Gravitational Waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.11270v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the role of r-mode oscillations in pulsar spin-down and their implications for gravitational wave emission and pulsar timing analysis. Using a non-linear differential framework that includes r-mode contributions, we derive time-dependent solutions for rotational frequency and period evolution. These expressions are validated using observational data from the Crab pulsar with high precision. By analytically fitting braking indices and spin-down coefficients, we link measurable pulsar properties to gravitational wave signatures. Furthermore, we present closed-form expressions for neutron star compactness and tidal deformability using Lambert W and Lambert-Tsallis functions, enabling model-independent inferences from r-mode gravitational wave frequencies. Our results show that incorporating r-modes significantly improves the accuracy of spin-down models and continuous wave detectability, particularly through the inclusion of high-order frequency terms. This framework supports the modeling of timing residuals, glitch quantification, and gravitational wave constraints. Our findings have direct relevance for data analysis in ongoing and future gravitational wave observatories.</description>

      <title>CHIME/FRB/Pulsar discovery of a nearby long period radio transient with a timing glitch</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07480v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the discovery of a 421 s long period radio transient (LPT) using the CHIME telescope, CHIME J0630+25. The source is localized to RA=06:30:38.4$\pm1'$ Dec=25:26:24$\pm1'$ using voltage data acquired with the CHIME baseband system. A timing analysis shows that a model including a glitch is preferred over a non-glitch model with $dF/F=1.3\times10^{-6}$, consistent with other glitching neutron stars. The timing model suggests a surface magnetic field of $\sim1.5\times10^{15}$ G and a characteristic age of $\sim1.28\times10^{6}$ yrs. A separate line of evidence to support a strong local magnetic field is an abnormally high rotation measure of $RM=-347.8(6) \mathrm{rad\, m^{-2}}$ relative to CHIME J0630+25's modest dispersion measure of 22(1) pc cm$^{-2}$, implying a dense local magneto-ionic structure. As a result, we believe that CHIME J0630+25 is a magnetized, slowly spinning, isolated neutron star. This marks CHIME J0630+25 as the longest period neutron star and the second long period neutron star with an inferred magnetar-like field. Based on dispersion measure models and comparison with pulsars with distance measurements, CHIME J0630+25 is located at a nearby distance of 170$^{+310}_{-100}$ pc (95.4\%), making it an ideal candidate for follow-up studies.</description>

      <title>The unreasonable effectiveness of the $n \Sigma v$ approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17436v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In kinetic theory, the classic $n \Sigma v$ approach calculates the rate of particle interactions from local quantities: the number density of particles $n$, the cross-section $\Sigma$, and the average relative speed $v$. In stellar dynamics, this formula is often applied to problems in collisional (i.e. dense) environments such as globular and nuclear star clusters, where blue stragglers, tidal capture binaries, binary ionizations, and micro-tidal disruptions arise from rare close encounters. The local $n \Sigma v$ approach implicitly assumes the ergodic hypothesis, which is not well motivated for the densest star systems in the Universe. In the centers of globular and nuclear star clusters, orbits close into 1D ellipses because of the degeneracy of the potential (either Keplerian or harmonic). We find that the interaction rate in perfectly Keplerian or harmonic potentials is determined by a global quantity -- the number of orbital intersections -- and that this rate can be far lower or higher than the ergodic $n \Sigma v$ estimate. However, we find that in most astrophysical systems, deviations from a perfectly Keplerian or harmonic potential (due to e.g. granularity or extended mass) trigger sufficient orbital precession to recover the $n \Sigma v$ interaction rate. Astrophysically relevant failures of the $n \Sigma v$ approach only seem to occur for tightly bound stars orbiting intermediate-mass black holes, or for the high-mass end of collisional cascades in certain debris disks.</description>

      <title>Simulations of Astrophysically Relevant Pair Beam Instabilities in a Laboratory Context</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14518v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interaction of TeV blazars emitted gamma-rays with the extragalactic background photons gives rise to a relativistic beam of electron-positron ($e^- e^+$) pairs propagating through the intergalactic medium, producing a cascade through up-scattering low-energy photons. Plasma instability is considered one of the underlying energy-loss processes of the beams. We employ particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations to study the plasma instabilities of relativistic pair beams propagating in a denser background plasma, using the parameters designed to replicate astrophysical jets under laboratory conditions. In an astrophysical scenario with a broad, dilute beam, electromagnetic instability is suppressed because the beam exhibits momentum anisotropy with a large longitudinal momentum spread compared to its transverse momentum. We find the range of density contrast at which electrostatic modes are dominating over electromagnetic modes with an anisotropic beam in laboratory scales, consistent with the physically relevant conditions for Blazar-induced beams. We have used a broad Cauchy distribution for the beam particles, which is more realistic in representing the non-Maxwellian nature of pair beams, improving upon previous studies. We investigate the interplay between the instability-generated magnetic field and the momentum anisotropy of the beam. We extrapolate the beam energy loss and the angular broadening due to non-linear feedback of instability. We find that the astrophysical beams have lost approximately 4\% of their total energy due to instability. Nevertheless, the instability generates a negligible angular broadening for Blazar-induced beams.</description>

      <title>On testing in-vacuo dispersion with the most energetic neutrinos: KM3-230213A case study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13093v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The phenomenology of in-vacuo dispersion, an effect such that quantum properties of spacetime slow down particles proportionally to their energies, has been a very active research area since the advent of the Fermi telescope. One of the assumptions made in this 15-year effort is that the phenomenology of in-vacuo dispersion has a particle-energy sweet spot: the energy of the particle should be large enough to render the analysis immune to source-intrinsic confounding effects but still small enough to facilitate the identification of the source of the particle. We use the gigantic energy of KM3-230213A as an opportunity to challenge this expectation. For a neutrino of a few hundred PeVs a transient source could have been observed at lower energies several years earlier, even assuming the characteristic scale of in-vacuo dispersion to be close to the Planck scale. We report that GRB090401B is in excellent directional agreement with KM3-230213A, and we discuss a strategy of in-vacuo-dispersion analysis suitable for estimating the significance of KM3-230213A as a GRB090401B-neutrino candidate. The $p$-value resulting from our analysis (0.015) is not small enough to warrant any excitement, but small enough to establish the point that a handful of such coincidences would be sufficient to meaningfully test in-vacuo dispersion.</description>

      <title>A Machine Learning Method for Hunting Hidden Axion Signals in Pulsar Dispersion Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16562v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In axion models, interactions between axions and electromagnetic waves induce frequency-dependent time delays determined by the axion mass and decay constant. These small delays are difficult to detect, limiting the effectiveness of traditional methods. We compute such delays under realistic radio telescope conditions and identify a prominent dispersive feature near half the axion mass, which appears non-divergent within the limits of observational resolution. Based on this, we develop a machine learning pipeline that achieves 95\% classification accuracy and demonstrates robust detection performance in low signal-to-noise regimes. The method's robustness is confirmed against false positives using both simulated noisy data and real-world, known-null observations. Future improvements in optical clock precision and telescope bandwidth, particularly with instruments such as the Qitai Radio Telescope, may enhance constraints on the axion decay constant by up to four orders of magnitude in the $10^{-6} \sim 10^{-4}$ eV mass range.</description>

      <title>Detectability of compact intermediate-mass black hole binaries as low-frequency gravitational wave sources: the influence of dynamical friction of dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03582v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The black hole (BH) spin could significantly change the density of dark matter (DM) in its vicinity, creating a mini-spike of the density of DM. The dynamical friction (DF) between DM and the companion star of a BH can provide an efficient loss of angular momentum, driving the BH-main sequence (MS) star binary to evolve toward a compact orbit system. We investigate the influence of the DF of DM on the detectability of intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH)-MS binaries as low-frequency gravitational wave (GW) sources. Taking into account the DF of DM, we employ the detailed binary evolution code MESA to model the evolution of a large number of IMBH-MS binaries. Our simulation shows that the DF of DM can drive those IMBH-MS binaries to evolve toward low-frequency GW sources for a low donor-star mass, a high spike index, or a short initial orbital period. When the spike index $\gamma=1.60$, those IMBH-MS binaries with donor-star masses of $1.0-3.4~ M_{\odot}$ and initial orbital periods of $0.65-16.82~ \rm days$ could potentially evolve into visible LISA sources within a distance of $10~\rm kpc$. The DF of DM can enlarge the initial parameter space and prolong the bifurcation periods. In the low-frequency GW source stage, the X-ray luminosities of those IMBH X-ray binaries are $\sim 10^{35}-10^{36}~\rm erg\,s^{-1}$, hence they are ideal multimessenger objects.</description>

      <title>Incorporation of model accuracy in gravitational wave Bayesian inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19404v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inferring the properties of colliding black holes from gravitational-wave observations is subject to systematic errors arising from modelling uncertainties. Although the accuracy of each model can be calculated through comparison to theoretical expectations from general relativity, Bayesian analyses are yet to incorporate this information. As such, a mixture model is typically used where results obtained with different gravitational-wave models are combined with either equal weight, or based on their relative Bayesian evidence. In this work we present a novel method to incorporate the accuracy of multiple models in gravitational-wave Bayesian analyses. By analysing simulated gravitational-wave signals in zero-noise, we show that our technique uses $30\%$ less computational resources, and more faithfully recovers the true parameters than existing techniques. We further apply our method to a real gravitational-wave signal and, when assuming the binary black hole hypothesis, demonstrate that the source of GW191109_010717 has unequal component masses, with the primary having a $69\%$ probability that it lies above the maximum black hole mass from stellar collapse. We envisage that this method will become an essential tool within ground-based gravitational-wave astronomy.</description>

      <title>Non-thermal filaments and AGN recurrent activity in the galaxy group Nest200047: a LOFAR, uGMRT, MeerKAT, VLA radio spectral analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18244v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nest200047 is a clear example of multiple radio bubbles from an Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) in a galaxy group, featuring non-thermal filaments likely shaped by buoyancy, gas motions, and stabilized by magnetic fields. This study presents high-quality data obtained from uGMRT, MeerKAT, and VLA, alongside existing LOFAR data, to analyze the system's morphology and spectrum over a broad frequency range (53-1518 MHz). Our findings reveal new filamentary emission in the inner 60 kpc, surrounding and extending from the inner bubbles and jets, suggesting complex dynamical evolution of the non-thermal plasma in the group core. The filaments have widths of a few kpc and lengths from tens to hundreds of kpc, with a steep and curved radio spectrum ($\rm \alpha=1\sim2$). They exhibit a constant spectral index profile along their length, implying particles are either (re-)accelerated together or move at super-Alfvenic speeds. Spectral aging analysis yields jet active times between 50 and 100 Myr with short inactive phases, suggesting continuous energy injection typical of AGN feedback in galaxy groups. This study highlights the potential of combining high-quality radio data to understand recurrent jet activity and feedback, with implications for future research with the SKA observatory.</description>

      <title>Diffraction around caustics in gravitational wave lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22648v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational lensing magnification is maximal around caustics. At these source locations, an incoming wave from a point source would formally experience an infinite amplification in the high-frequency or geometric optics limit. This divergence reflects the break-down of the mathematical formalism, which is regularized by either the finite size of the source or its wavelength. We explore diffraction around caustics and their implications for the distortion of waveforms from point sources, focusing on three types of caustics: point singularities, folds, and cusps. We derive analytical results for the amplitude and phase of the diffracted waves, and compare those against the stationary phase approximation. We then study the observational signatures and detectability of these distortions on gravitational waves. We find that the lensing distortions could be detectable, but that the stationary phase approximation is still a good description of the system even close to the caustic, when the repeated gravitational wave chirps interfere with each other. We also quantify the possibility of distinguishing lensed signals from different caustics by performing Bayesian parameter estimation on simulated signals. Our results demonstrate that the universal distortions due to diffraction around caustics could be used to single out a gravitational wave event as lensed.</description>

      <title>RGE effects on new physics searches via gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13074v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational wave (GW) observations offer a promising probe of new physics associated with a first-order electroweak phase transition. Precision studies of the Higgs potential, including Fisher matrix analyses, have been extensively conducted in this context. However, significant theoretical uncertainties in the GW spectrum, particularly those due to renormalization scale dependence in the conventional daisy-resummed approach, have cast doubt on the reliability of such precision measurements. These uncertainties have been highlighted using the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) as a benchmark. To address these issues, we revisit Fisher matrix analyses based on the daisy-resummed approach, explicitly incorporating renormalization scale uncertainties. We then reassess the prospects for precise new physics measurements using GW observations. Adopting the SMEFT as a benchmark, we study the effects of one-loop RGE running of dimension-six operators on the Higgs effective potential via the Higgs self-couplings, top Yukawa coupling, and gauge couplings, in addition to the SMEFT tree-level effects. We find that future GW observations can remain sensitive to various dimension-six SMEFT effects, even in the presence of renormalization scale uncertainties, provided that the SMEFT $(H^{\dagger}H)^3$ operator is precisely measured, e.g., by future collider experiments.</description>

      <title>`Dark' Matter Effect as a Novel Solution to the KM3-230213A Puzzle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22754v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent KM3NeT observation of an ${\cal{O}}(100~{\rm PeV})$ event KM3-230213A is puzzling because IceCube with much larger effective area times exposure has not found any such events. We propose a novel solution to this conundrum in terms of dark matter (DM) scattering in the Earth's crust. We show that intermediate dark-sector particles that decay into muons are copiously produced when high-energy ($\sim100~\text{PeV}$) DM propagates through a sufficient amount of Earth overburden. The same interactions responsible for DM scattering in Earth also source the boosted DM flux from a high-luminosity blazar. We address the non-observation of similar events at IceCube via two examples of weakly coupled long-lived dark sector scenarios that satisfy all existing constraints. We calculate the corresponding dark sector cross sections, lifetimes and blazar luminosities required to yield one event at KM3NeT, and also predict the number of IceCube events for these parameters that can be tested very soon. Our proposed DM explanation of the event can also be distinguished from a neutrino-induced event in future high-energy neutrino flavor analyses, large-scale DM direct detection experiments, as well as at future colliders.</description>

      <title>Role of thermal fluctuations in nucleation of three-flavor quark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00139v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a framework that aims to investigate the role of thermal fluctuations of the matter composition and color-superconductivity in the nucleation of three-flavor deconfined quark matter in the typical conditions of high-energy astrophysical systems related to compact stars. It is usually assumed that the flavor composition is locally fixed during the formation of the first seed of deconfined quark matter since weak interaction acts too slowly to re-equilibrate flavors. However, the matter composition fluctuates around its average equilibrium values at the typical temperatures of high-energy astrophysical processes. Here, we extend our previous two-flavor nucleation formalism to a three-flavor case. We develop a thermodynamic framework incorporating finite-size effects and thermal fluctuations of local composition to compute the nucleation probability as the product of droplet formation and composition fluctuation rates. Moreover, we discuss the role of color-superconductivity in nucleation, arguing that it can play a role only in systems larger than the typical coherence length of diquark pairs. We found that thermal fluctuations of the matter composition lead to lowering the potential barrier between the metastable hadronic phase and the stable quark phase. Moreover, the formation of diquark pairs reduces the critical radius and thus the potential barrier in the low baryon density and temperature regime.</description>
