      <title>Interactive Oracle Proofs of Proximity to Codes on Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We design an Interactive Oracle Proof of Proximity (IOPP) for codes on graphs inspired by the FRI protocol. The soundness is significantly improved compared to the FRI, the complexity parameters are comparable, and there are no restrictions on the field used, enabling to consider new codes to design code-based SNARKs.</description>

      <title>Explaining the Ubiquity of Phase Transitions in Decision Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I present an analytic approach to establishing the presence of phase transitions in a large set of decision problems. This approach does not require extensive computational study of the problems considered. The set -- that of all paddable problems over even-sized alphabets satisfying a condition similar to not being sparse -- shown to exhibit phase transitions contains many "practical" decision problems, is very large, and also contains extremely intractable problems.</description>

      <title>Whether a quantum computation employs nonlocal resources is operationally undecidable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computational complexity characterizes the usage of spatial and temporal resources by computational processes. In the classical theory of computation, e.g. in the Turing Machine model, computational processes employ only local space and time resources, and their resource usage can be accurately measured by us as users. General relativity and quantum theory, however, introduce the possibility of computational processes that employ nonlocal spatial or temporal resources. While the space and time complexity of classical computing can be given a clear operational meaning, this is no longer the case in any setting involving nonlocal resources. In such settings, theoretical analyses of resource usage cease to be reliable indicators of practical computational capability. We prove that the verifier (C) in a multiple interactive provers with shared entanglement (MIP*) protocol cannot operationally demonstrate that the "multiple" provers are independent, i.e. cannot operationally distinguish a MIP* machine from a monolithic quantum computer. Thus C cannot operationally distinguish a MIP* machine from a quantum TM, and hence cannot operationally demonstrate the solution to arbitrary problems in RE. Any claim that a MIP* machine has solved a TM-undecidable problem is, therefore, circular, as the problem of deciding whether a physical system is a MIP* machine is itself TM-undecidable. Consequently, despite the space and time complexity of classical computing having a clear operational meaning, this is no longer the case in any setting involving nonlocal resources. In such settings, theoretical analyses of resource usage cease to be reliable indicators of practical computational capability. This has practical consequences when assessing newly proposed computational frameworks based on quantum theories.</description>

      <title>Quantum Circuit Optimization by Graph Coloring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Depth optimization of a quantum circuit consisting of commuting operations is shown to be reducible to the vertex coloring problem in graph theory. The reduction immediately leads to an algorithm for circuit optimization of commuting gates utilizing any coloring solver. To examine its applicability, known quantum circuits from the literature are optimized.</description>

      <title>Certificates in P and Subquadratic-Time Computation of Radius, Diameter, and all Eccentricities in Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.04660</link>
      <description>arXiv:1803.04660v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the context of fine-grained complexity, we investigate the notion of certificate enabling faster polynomial-time algorithms. We specifically target radius (minimum eccentricity), diameter (maximum eccentricity), and all-eccentricity computations for which quadratic-time lower bounds are known under plausible conjectures. In each case, we introduce a notion of certificate as a specific set of nodes from which appropriate bounds on all eccentricities can be derived in subquadratic time when this set has sublinear size. The existence of small certificates is a barrier against SETH-based lower bounds for these problems. We indeed prove that for graph classes with small certificates, there exist randomized subquadratic-time algorithms for computing the radius, the diameter, and all eccentricities respectively.Moreover, these notions of certificates are tightly related to algorithms probing the graph through one-to-all distance queries and allow to explain the efficiency of practical radius and diameter algorithms from the literature. Our formalization enables a novel primal-dual analysis of a classical approach for diameter computation that leads to algorithms for radius, diameter and all eccentricities with theoretical guarantees with respect to certain graph parameters. This is complemented by experimental results on various types of real-world graphs showing that these parameters appear to be low in practice. Finally, we obtain refined results for several graph classes.</description>

      <title>Improved Quantum Query Upper Bounds Based on Classical Decision Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.02968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.02968v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a classical query algorithm as a decision tree, when does there exist a quantum query algorithm with a speed-up over the classical one? We provide a general construction based on the structure of the underlying decision tree, and prove that this can give us an up-to-quadratic quantum speed-up. In particular, we obtain a bounded-error quantum query algorithm of cost $O(\sqrt{s})$ to compute a Boolean function (more generally, a relation) that can be computed by a classical (even randomized) decision tree of size $s$.
  Lin and Lin [ToC'16] and Beigi and Taghavi [Quantum'20] showed results of a similar flavor, and gave upper bounds in terms of a quantity which we call the "guessing complexity" of a decision tree. We identify that the guessing complexity of a decision tree equals its rank, a notion introduced by Ehrenfeucht and Haussler [Inf. Comp.'89] in the context of learning theory. This answers a question posed by Lin and Lin, who asked whether the guessing complexity of a decision tree is related to any complexity-theoretic measure. We also show a polynomial separation between rank and randomized rank for the complete binary AND-OR tree.
  Beigi and Taghavi constructed span programs and dual adversary solutions for Boolean functions given classical decision trees computing them and an assignment of non-negative weights to its edges. We explore the effect of changing these weights on the resulting span program complexity and objective value of the dual adversary bound, and capture the best possible weighting scheme by an optimization program. We exhibit a solution to this program and argue its optimality from first principles. We also exhibit decision trees for which our bounds are asymptotically stronger than those of Lin and Lin, and Beigi and Taghavi. This answers a question of Beigi and Taghavi, who asked whether different weighting schemes could yield better upper bounds.</description>

      <title>New Approaches to Complexity via Quantum Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.12887v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Problems based on the structure of graphs -- for example finding cliques, independent sets, or colourings -- are of fundamental importance in classical complexity. Defining well-formulated decision problems for quantum graphs, which are an operator system generalisation of graphs, presents several technical challenges. Consequently, the connections between quantum graphs and complexity have been underexplored.
  In this work, we introduce and study the clique problem for quantum graphs. Our approach utilizes a well-known connection between quantum graphs and quantum channels. The inputs for our problems are presented as circuits inducing quantum channel, which implicitly determine a corresponding quantum graph. We show that, quantified over all channels, this problem is complete for QMA(2); in fact, it remains QMA(2)-complete when restricted to channels that are probabilistic mixtures of entanglement-breaking and partial trace channels. Quantified over a subset of entanglement-breaking channels, this problem becomes QMA-complete, and restricting further to deterministic or classical noisy channels gives rise to complete problems for NP and MA, respectively. In this way, we exhibit a classical complexity problem whose natural quantisation is QMA(2), rather than QMA, and provide the first problem that allows for a direct comparison of the classes QMA(2), QMA, MA, and NP by quantifying over increasingly larger families of instances.
  We use methods that are inspired by self-testing to provide a direct proof of QMA(2)-completeness, rather than reducing to a previously-studied complete problem. We also give a new proof of the celebrated reduction of QMA(k) to QMA(2). In parallel, we study a version of the closely-related independent set problem for quantum graphs, and provide preliminary evidence that it may be in general weaker in complexity, contrasting to the classical case.</description>

      <title>A note on the complexity of the picker routing problem in multi-block warehouses and related problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.01857v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Picker Routing Problem (PRP), which consists of finding a minimum-length tour between a set of storage locations in a warehouse, is one of the most important problems in the warehousing logistics literature. Despite its popularity, the tractability of the PRP in multi-block warehouses remains an open question. This technical note aims to fill this research gap by establishing that the problem is strongly NP-hard. As a corollary, the complexity status of other related problems is settled.</description>

      <title>Quasi-quantum states and the quasi-quantum PCP theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13549v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce $k$-local quasi-quantum states: a superset of the regular quantum states, defined by relaxing the positivity constraint. We show that a $k$-local quasi-quantum state on $n$ qubits can be 1-1 mapped to a distribution of assignments over $n$ variables with an alphabet of size $4$, which is subject to non-linear constraints over its $k$-local marginals. Therefore, solving the $k$-local Hamiltonian over the quasi-quantum states is equivalent to optimizing a distribution of assignment over a classical $k$-local CSP. We show that this optimization problem is essentially classical by proving it is NP-complete. Crucially, just as ordinary quantum states, these distributions lack a simple tensor-product structure and are therefore not determined straightforwardly by their local marginals. Consequently, our classical optimization problem shares some unique aspects of Hamiltonian complexity: it lacks an easy search-to-decision reduction, and it is not clear that its 1D version can be solved with dynamical programming (i.e., it could remain NP-hard).
  Our main result is a PCP theorem for the $k$-local Hamiltonian over the quasi-quantum states in the form of a hardness-of-approximation result. The proof suggests the existence of a subtle promise-gap amplification procedure in a model that shares many similarities with the quantum local Hamiltonian problem, thereby providing insights on the quantum PCP conjecture.</description>
