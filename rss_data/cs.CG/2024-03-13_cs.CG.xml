      <title>Computing $p$-presentation distances is hard</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, $p$-presentation distances for $p\in [1,\infty]$ were introduced for merge trees and multiparameter persistence modules as more sensitive variations of the respective interleaving distances ($p=\infty$). It is well-known that computing the interleaving distance is NP-hard in both cases. We extend this result by showing that computing the $p$-presentation distance is NP-hard for all $p\in [1,\infty)$ for both merge trees and $t$-parameter persistence modules for any $t\geq 2$. Though the details differ, both proofs follow the same novel strategy, suggesting that our approach can be adapted to proving the NP-hardness of other distances based on sums or $p$-norms.</description>

      <title>Mesh Denoising and Inpainting using the Total Variation of the Normal and a Shape Newton Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.11748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2012.11748v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel approach to denoising and inpainting problems for surface meshes. The purpose of these problems is to remove noise or fill in missing parts while preserving important features such as sharp edges. A discrete variant of the total variation of the unit normal vector field serves as a regularizing functional to achieve these goals. In order to solve the resulting problem, we use a version of the split Bregman (ADMM) iteration adapted to the problem. A new formulation of the total variation regularizer, as well as the use of an inexact Newton method for the shape optimization step, bring significant speed-up compared to earlier methods. Numerical examples are included, demonstrating the performance of our algorithm with some complex 3D geometries.</description>

      <title>The characterization of $(n-1)$-spheres with $n+4$ vertices having maximal Buchstaber number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.00806v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a computationally efficient algorithm that is suitable for graphic processing unit implementation. This algorithm enables the identification of all weak pseudo-manifolds that meet specific facet conditions, drawn from a given input set. We employ this approach to enumerate toric colorable seeds. Consequently, we achieve a comprehensive characterization of $(n-1)$-dimensional PL spheres with $n+4$ vertices that possess a maximal Buchstaber number.
  A primary focus of this research is the fundamental categorization of non-singular complete toric varieties of Picard number $4$. This classification serves as a valuable tool for addressing questions related to toric manifolds of Picard number $4$. Notably, we have determined which of these manifolds satisfy equality within an inequality regarding the number of minimal components in their rational curve space. This addresses a question posed by Chen, Fu, and Hwang in 2014 for this specific case.</description>
