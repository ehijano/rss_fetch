      <title>Direct Detection of the Millicharged Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that dark matter direct detection experiments are sensitive to the existence of particles with a small effective charge (for instance, via couplings to a kinetically mixed, low-mass dark photon). Our forecasts do not depend on these particles comprising a significant fraction of the dark matter. Rather, these experiments are sensitive to the irreducible abundance produced in the early universe through the freeze-in mechanism. We find that ongoing and proposed direct detection experiments will have world-leading sensitivity to effective charges $Q\sim 10^{-12}$ across nine orders of magnitude in mass, corresponding to a dark matter sub-fraction as low as $\sim 10^{-3}$.</description>

      <title>Electric Dipole Moments as indirect probes of Dark Sectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dark sectors provide beyond Standard Model scenarios which can address unresolved puzzles, such as the observed dark matter abundance or the baryon asymmetry of the Universe. A naturally small portal to the dark sector is obtained if dark-sector interactions stem from a non-Abelian hidden gauge group that couples through kinetic mixing with the hypercharge boson. In this work, we investigate the phenomenology of such a portal of dimension five in the presence of CP violation, focusing on its signatures in fermion electric dipole moments. We show that, currently unbounded regions of the parameter space from dark photon searches can be indirectly probed with upcoming electron dipole moment experiments for dark boson masses in the range $1-100$ GeV. We also discuss two particular scenarios where a $SU(2)_D$ dark gauge group spontaneously breaks into either an Abelian $U(1)_D$ or nothing. In both cases, we show that potentially observable electron dipole moments can be produced in vast regions of the parameter space compatible with current experimental constraints and observed dark matter abundance.</description>

      <title>Gravitational form factors of pion from top-down holographic QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gravitational form factors (GFFs) of pions has been calculated from a top-down holographic QCD approach with momentum transfer dependence for the first time. It is important because the GFFs of hadrons have information on the internal stress distribution that may provide insight into the mechanism of how QCD forms hadrons. The forward limit value of this GFFs, i.e. the D-term, was also obtained. Furthermore, in this approach, we observe the so-called glueball dominance, in which pions have gravitational interactions via infinite glueball spectra.</description>

      <title>Confronting perturbative QCD with the hardest exclusive reactions: kaon electromagnetic form factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Among countless channels of hard exclusive reactions, the kaon electromagnetic form factors (EMFFs) are of special interest, which have been measured up to $Q^2 \sim 50\;{\rm GeV}^2$ in the timelike domain. The kaon EMFFs thereby serve an ideal platform to critically examine the validity and effectiveness of perturbative QCD (pQCD) in accounting for hard exclusive processes. In this work we confront the pQCD predictions that incorporate the next-to-next-to-leading-order (NNLO) perturbative corrections, with the available kaon EMFFs data set from experimental measurements and from lattice predictions. The inclusion of the NNLO corrections turns out to have a substantial and positive impact. If the profiles of the kaon light-cone distribution amplitudes (LCDAs) are taken from the recent lattice QCD prediction by {\tt LPC} Collaboration, the satisfactory agreement between theory and data can be reached for both charged and neutral kaons, in both spacelike and timelike large-$Q^2$ domains.</description>

      <title>Dynamical generation of electroweak scale from the conformal sector: A strongly coupled Higgs via the Dyson--Schwinger approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel pathway to generate the electroweak (EW) scale via non-perturbative dynamics of a conformally invariant scalar sector at the classical level. We provide a method to estimate the non-perturbative EW scale generation using the exact solution of the background equations of motion in a scalar theory via the Dyson-Schwinger approach. Particularly, we find an analytical result for the Higgs mass in the strongly coupled regime in terms of its quartic self interaction term and the cut-off scale of the theory. We also show that the Higgs sector is an essential part of the Standard Model as, without it, a Yang--Mills gauge theory cannot acquire mass even if a self-interaction term is present. Our analysis lead to a more realistic model building with possible solutions to the gauge hierarchy problem and, in general, to the dynamical generation of any scales scales in nature, be it the visible sector or the dark sector.</description>

      <title>Improved Precision in $Vh(\rightarrow b\bar b)$ via Boosted Decision Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extracting bounds on BSM operators at hadron colliders can be a highly non-trivial task. It can be useful or, depending on the complexity of the event structure, even essential to employ modern analysis techniques in order to measure New-Physics effects. A particular class of such modern methods are Machine-Learning algorithms, which are becoming more and more popular in particle physics. We attempt to gauge their potential in the study of $Vh(\rightarrow b\bar b)$ production processes, focusing on the leptonic decay channels of the vector bosons. Specifically, we employ boosted decision trees using the kinematical information of a given event to discriminate between signal and background. Based on this analysis strategy, we derive bounds on four dimension-6 SMEFT operators and subsequently compare them with the ones obtained from a conventional cut-and-count analysis. We find a mild improvement of $\mathcal{O}(\mathrm{few}\, \%)$ across the different operators.</description>

      <title>Captured molecules could make a Bose star visible</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Bose star passing through cold molecular clouds may capture atoms, molecules and dust particles. The observational signature of such an event would be a relatively small amount of matter that is gravitationally bound. This binding may actually be provided by invisible dark matter forming the Bose star. We may expect a relative excess of heavier atoms, molecules, and solid dust compared to the content of giant cold molecular clouds since the velocity of heavy particles at a given temperature is lower and it may be small compared to the escape velocity, $v_\mathrm{rms} = \sqrt{3k_\mathrm{B} T/m_\mathrm{gas}} \ll v_\mathrm{esc}=\sqrt{2GM/R}$. Finally, the velocity of this captured matter cloud may correlate with the expected velocity of free dark matter particles (e.g. expected axion wind velocity relative to Earth).</description>

      <title>Dark matter, leptogenesis and Z' in the B-L model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the interplay between dark matter, leptogenesis and a new gauge boson $Z^\prime$ in the $B-L$ model. A fermion dark matter $\chi$ carrying $U(1)_{B-L}$ charge is introduced to the model but not coupling with other particles. We consider the freeze-out and freeze-in mechanisms, and obtain the correct relic density respectively. We have scanned the feasible parameter space and found that the dark matter direct detection experiments imposed the most stringent constraints on the parameter space. The constraint on the parameter space places a limit on the mass of dark matter with $m_{\chi} \approx 1/2 M_{Z'}$ within a narrow region in the case of freeze-out scenario, and we can obtain the right baryon asymmetry result in the case of $m_{\chi}\subset[654$ GeV, 664 GeV]. For the freeze-in scenario, we have a much broader parameter space for $m_{\chi}$ and $M_{Z^\prime}$ but $g_{BL}$ is restricted at $10^{-5}$ level for $Q=0.1$. In both scenarios, $g_{BL}-M_{Z^\prime}$ is limited within a narrow region by the dark matter relic density, direct detection and baryon asymmetry constraints.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic $|G_E/G_M|$ ratios of hyperons at large timelike $q^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21397v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, it has become possible to measure not only the magnitude of the electric ($G_E$) and magnetic ($G_M$) form factors of spin $\frac{1}{2}$ baryons, but also to measure the relative phases of those quantities in the timelike kinematic region. Aiming to interpret present $|G_E/G_M|$ data on hyperons of the baryon octet, as well as to predict future data, we present model calculations of that ratio for large invariant 4-momentum square $q^2$ in the timelike region ($q^2&gt;0$). Without any further parameter fitting, we extend to the timelike region a covariant quark model previously developed to describe the kinematic spacelike region ($q^2 \le 0$) of the baryon octet form factors. The model takes into account both the effects of valence quarks and the excitations of the meson cloud which dresses the baryons. We report here that our results are in good agreement with very recent data from BESIII, within the uncertainty limits of our model. We also make new predictions which may be tested in the near future, when the range of the present measurements is expanded to the 20--50 GeV$^2$ region.</description>

      <title>Brane-vector dark matter and its connection to inflation and primordial gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The scalar mode describing the fluctuation of the 3-brane (the observable universe) in a five-dimensional bulk spacetime compactified on a circle is absorbed by the Kaluza-Klein U(1) gauge field, leading to a massive brane-vector living on the 3-brane. The brane-vector can be responsible for dark matter because it is odd under a $\mathrm{Z}_2$ symmetry, neutral under the Standard Model (SM) symmetries, and couples extremely weak to the SM particles due to its gravitational origin. Interestingly, the brane-vector dark matter could leave particular imprints on the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and the primordial gravitational waves. Hence, the precise measurements of the CMB and the observations of the primordial gravitational waves generated during the inflation can provide a potential way to probe the extra-dimensions and branes which are the main ingredients of string/M theory.</description>

      <title>Axion-like Particle Effects on Photon Polarization in High-Energy Astrophysics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this review, we present a self-contained introduction to axion-like particles (ALPs) with a particular focus on their effects on photon polarization: both theoretical and phenomenological aspects are discussed. We derive the photon survival probability in the presence of photon--ALP interaction, the corresponding final photon degree of linear polarization, and the polarization angle in a wide energy interval. The presented results can be tested by current and planned missions such as IXPE (already operative), eXTP, XL-Calibur, NGXP, XPP in the X-ray band and like COSI (approved to launch), e-ASTROGAM, and AMEGO in the high-energy range. Specifically, we describe ALP-induced polarization effects on several astrophysical sources, such as galaxy clusters, blazars, and gamma-ray bursts, and we discuss their real detectability. In particular, galaxy clusters appear as very good observational targets in this respect. Moreover, in the very-high-energy (VHE) band, we discuss a peculiar ALP signature in photon polarization, in principle capable of proving the ALP existence. Unfortunately, present technologies cannot detect photon polarization up to such high energies, but the observational capability of the latter ALP signature in the VHE band could represent an interesting challenge for the future. As a matter of fact, the aim of this review is to show new ways to make progress in the physics of ALPs, thanks to their effects on photon polarization, a topic that has aroused less interest in the past, but which is now timely with the advent of many new polarimetric missions.</description>

      <title>Pion polarizabilities from a dispersive analysis of $\gamma\gamma \to \pi\pi$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present results for the charged and neutral pion polarizabilities, obtained through a dispersive analysis of photon-fusion reactions with two pions in the final state. This analysis is motivated by current and future measurements at COMPASS, JLab (Hall D), and the BESIII measurement of single-virtual photon-fusion reactions in the space-like region, offering insight into generalized pion polarizabilities. To improve predictions within an unsubtracted dispersion formalism with only the pion left-hand cut, one needs to consider the influence of heavier left-hand cuts. We parametrize the latter using an expansion in a suitably constructed conformal variable, capturing the analytical structure of the left-hand cuts. The coefficients in this expansion are determined from the matching with the Lagrangian-based approach, the Adler zero constraint for $\gamma\gamma \to \pi^0\pi^0$, and a fit to the cross-section data. The extension to the single-virtual case is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Real-time chiral dynamics at finite temperature from quantum simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we explore the real-time dynamics of the chiral magnetic effect (CME) at a finite temperature in the (1+1)-dimensional QED, the massive Schwinger model. By introducing a chiral chemical potential $\mu_5$ through a quench process, we drive the system out of equilibrium and analyze the induced vector currents and their evolution over time. The Hamiltonian is modified to include the time-dependent chiral chemical potential, thus allowing the investigation of the CME within a quantum computing framework. We employ the quantum imaginary time evolution (QITE) algorithm to study the thermal states, and utilize the Suzuki-Trotter decomposition for the real-time evolution. This study provides insights into the quantum simulation capabilities for modeling the CME and offers a pathway for studying chiral dynamics in low-dimensional quantum field theories.</description>

      <title>NLO corrections to triple vector-boson production in final states with three charged leptons and two jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tri-boson production together with vector-boson scattering is a privileged channel to study the electroweak structure of the Standard Model. Upcoming LHC running stages will allow to measure these processes at unprecedented accuracy and for all possible final states, which requires to push theory predictions to still unexplored frontiers. In this work we present the first calculation for the process ${\rm p}{\rm p}\to\mu^+\mu^-{\rm e}^+\nu_{\rm e}\,{\rm j}\,{\rm j}$ at the LHC in a tri-boson phase space. We evaluate the three LO contributions, namely the $\mathcal{O}(\alpha^6)$, which contains the genuine tri-boson signature, along with the $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_{\rm s}\alpha^5)$ and $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_{\rm s}^2\alpha^4)$, and the two $\mathcal{O}(\alpha^7)$ and $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_{\rm s}\alpha^6)$ NLO corrections. The calculation is based on full Standard-Model matrix elements, including all resonant and non-resonant terms, complete spin correlations and interference effects. Integrated and differential cross sections are presented for a fiducial region inspired by High Luminosity LHC prospect studies. We find electroweak corrections of $-14\%$ for the fiducial cross section, almost twice as large as for other tri-boson processes.</description>

Abstract: We calculate four-loop QCD corrections to the electroweak $\rho$ parameter with a non-vanishing $b$ quark mass. At three loops, it was observed that elliptic integrals contribute to this observable. This prompts the question of which classes of functions appear at the next order. We report on the status of our calculation with a focus on the mathematical structures that emerge at four loops.</description>

      <title>Confining modeling of quark propagator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A confining extension of the quark model with nonlocal currents is proposed. The quark propagator is modified by introducing a cut in {\alpha}-space, which in momentum space corresponds to the subtraction of pole singularities. A two-phase phase structure is proposed for modeling the confinement-deconfinement phase transition. In the confined phase, the quark propagator does not have any pole singularities, while in the deconfined phase, there is a single quark pole.</description>

      <title>Final state interactions for high energy scattering off atomic electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the scattering of high energy leptons off bound atomic electrons focusing primarily on final state interactions i.e., the exchange of virtual photons between the outgoing energetic electron, and the heavy residual charged "debris" in the final state. These effects are inherently absent from calculations for a free electron at rest. Coulomb exchanges are enhanced by the large number of electrons in the atomic debris, and are unsuppressed by non-relativistic velocities in the debris. We find that these exchanges can be resummed using operator methods, and cancel at the level of the cross section until at least $O(\alpha^3)$. Furthermore, we argue that both final {\it and} initial state Coulomb exchanges (enhanced by the number of electrons in the atom) do not affect the cross section until at least $O(\alpha^3)$. Transverse photon couplings to non relativistic electrons are proportional to their small velocities, and rotational invariance suppresses their contribution to $O(\alpha^3)$. Our results are relevant for precision experiments involving neutrinos, electrons, positrons, and muons scattering off of atomic electrons in a fixed target.</description>

      <title>A simple high-accuracy method for solving bound-state equations with the Cornell potential in momentum space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a simple, high-accuracy method for solving bound-state integral equations in momentum space with singular kernels. For the case of the linear-confining potential, the associated Cauchy-principal-value singularity is removed by subtraction. Derivatives of the wave function that appear as a result of the subtraction technique are approximated by means of interpolating functions. The resulting non-singular integral equation is solved using the Nystr\"om method. The results show excellent agreement with exactly known energy eigenvalues. By further increasing the number of integration points and the order of the Lagrange interpolation, results with extremely high accuracy can be achieved.</description>

      <title>Causality and stability in relativistic hydrodynamic theory -- a choice to be endured</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18997v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, it has been indicated that the key features requisite for preserving causality and stability of the popularly existing relativistic hydrodynamic theories, can be translated into each other. It has been shown here, that a generic `fluid frame transformation' including all orders of gradient corrections can recast a stable-causal hydrodynamic theory that (i) only includes fundamental fluid variables (velocity and temperature) but requires to be in a general hydrodynamic frame other than the Landau or Eckart, to a theory that is (ii) pathology free in Landau frame but needs newer degrees of freedom. Since frame choice provides the first principle field definitions and degrees of freedom indicate the number of conserved quantities, the causality and stability of a theory seem to require a consensus between the two unless the derivative correction goes to infinity. The key finding of this work is to indicate a connection between these different formalisms, that lead to a causal and stable hydrodynamic theory.</description>

      <title>Bulk Black Hole Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dark dimension provides a mechanism to resolve the cosmological hierarchy problem and assembles a colosseum for dark matter contenders. In a series of recent publications we investigated whether primordial black holes (PBHs) perceiving the dark dimension could constitute all of the dark matter in the universe. A key assumption of these investigations is that PBHs remain confined to the brane during the entire evaporation process. As a consequence, the abundance of PBHs evaporating at the present epoch is severely constrained by observations of both the extragalactic and Galactic $\gamma$-ray backgrounds. As a natural outgrowth of these investigations, herein we relax the assumption of brane localized PBHs and reexamine the evaporation process of PBHs which are allowed to escape into the dark dimension. We show that the escape of PBHs from the brane is almost instantaneous. Armed with this pivotal finding we reassess the allowed mass range of PBHs to assemble all cosmological dark matter, which is estimated to be $10^{11} \lesssim M_{\rm BH}/{\rm g} \lesssim 10^{21}$.</description>

      <title>Neutrino and antineutrino charged-current multi-nucleon cross sections revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we improve on several aspects of the computation of the (anti-)neutrino charged-current multi-nucleon cross section carried out in Phys.Rev.C 83 (2011) 045501 and Phys.Rev.C 102 (2020) 024601. Most importantly, we implement a consistent treatment of the nucleon self-energy in the $W^\pm N\to N'\pi$ amplitude entering the definition of the two-particle two-hole (2p2h) cross-section, and estimate the source of uncertainty of our model due to a simplified treatment of the $\Delta$ self-energy. Our new predictions are around $20-40\%$ higher than previously. We show comparisons for the inclusive lepton double-differential cross sections, with no pions in the final state, measured by MiniBooNE on carbon and by T2K on carbon and oxygen. In all cases, we find an excellent reproduction of the experiments, and in particular, the neutrino MiniBooNE data is now well described without requiring a global $90\%$ re-scaling of the flux. In addition, we take the opportunity of this revision to discuss in detail several important issues of the calculation of the 2p2h cross section, delving into the microscopic dynamics of the multi-nucleon mechanisms. The improved treatment presented in this work provides realistic first-step emitted two-nucleon final state momentum configurations, beyond the approximation of phase-space distributions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rates of flavor-changing weak processes are crucial in determining the conditions of beta equilibrium in neutron stars and mergers, influencing the damping of oscillations, the stability of rotating pulsars, and the emission of gravitational waves. We derive a formula for these rates at nonzero temperature, to leading order in the Fermi coupling and exact in the QCD coupling. Utilizing a simple phenomenological holographic model dual to QCD, we study massless unpaired quark matter at high densities. We numerically compute the rate for small deviations from beta equilibrium and derive an analytic approximation for small temperatures. Our findings reveal that, compared to the perturbative result, the rate is suppressed by logarithmic factors of the temperature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study provides an analysis of atmospheric neutrino oscillations at the ESSnuSB far detector facility. The prospects of the two cylindrical Water Cherenkov detectors with a total fiducial mass of 540 kt are investigated over 10 years of data taking in the standard three-flavor oscillation scenario. We present the confidence intervals for the determination of mass ordering, $\theta_{23}$ octant as well as for the precisions on $\sin^2\theta_{23}$ and $|\Delta m_{31}^2|$. It is shown that mass ordering can be resolved by $3\sigma$ CL ($5\sigma$ CL) after 4 years (10 years) regardless of the true neutrino mass ordering. Correspondingly, the wrong $\theta_{23}$ octant could be excluded by $3\sigma$ CL after 4 years (7 years) in the case where the true neutrino mass ordering is normal ordering (inverted ordering). The results presented in this work are complementary to the accelerator neutrino program in the ESSnuSB project.</description>

      <title>Status of negative coupling modifiers for extended Higgs sectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2111.02533v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we study the status of negative coupling modifiers in extended Higgs sectors, focusing on the ratio of coupling modifiers that probes custodial symmetry violation $\lambda_{WZ} = \kappa_{W}/\kappa_{Z}$. Higgs sectors with multiplets larger than doublets are the only weakly coupled models that give tree-level modifications to $\lambda_{WZ}$, and we explore all such models allowed by the constraint from the $\rho$ parameter and perturbative unitarity. This class of models has a custodial symmetry violating potential, while the vacuum configuration preserves the symmetry. We apply precision measurements from ATLAS and CMS and show that each data set can exclude a vast set of models with $\lambda_{WZ} &lt; 0$ at greater than 95\% confidence level. We give evidence that $\lambda_{WZ}&lt;0$ is excluded in all weakly coupled models.
  [Erratum for this work on page 19 changing our claims of complete exclusion of negative $\lambda_{WZ}$ to a softer version where only the minimal models are excluded.]</description>

Abstract: The gravitational-wave energy-density spectra from cosmological first-order phase transitions crucially depend on the terminal wall velocity of asymptotic bubble expansion when the driving force from the effective potential difference is gradually balanced by the backreaction force from the thermal plasma. Much attention has previously focused on the backreaction force acting on the bubble wall alone but overlooked the backreaction forces on the sound shell and shock-wave front, if any, which have been both numerically and analytically accomplished in our previous studies but only for a bag equation of state. In this paper, we will generalize the backreaction force on bubble expansion beyond the simple bag model.</description>

Abstract: We study the global and local topological properties of multi-lepton patterns reconstructed at the detectors. We investigate the sensitivity of Forman Ricci curvature distributions and persistent homology features to kinematic cuts, integrated luminosity, and scales of maximum filtration. We find that these topological properties are efficient enough in discriminating the BSM scenarios from the SM background, particularly when the BSM scenarios possess a massive invisible particle. We also find that the topological properties exhibit a scaling behaviour with integrated luminosity. This exploratory study suggests that the topological features can potentially supplement the traditional cut-and-count analyses in search of new physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.13161v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, the spectra of the prospective exotic hidden-charm and hidden-bottom baryonium, viz. the baryon-antibaryon states, with $J^{PC}=0^{--}$ and $0^{+-}$ are investigated in the framework of QCD sum rules. The non-perturbative contributions up to dimension 12 are taken into account. Numerical results indicate that there might exist 3 possible $0^{--}$ hidden-charm baryonium states with masses $(5.22\pm0.26)$, $(5.52\pm0.25)$, and $(5.46\pm0.24)$ GeV, and 5 possible $0^{+-}$ hidden-charm baryonium states with masses $(4.76\pm0.28)$, $(5.24\pm0.28)$, $(5.16\pm0.27)$, $(5.52\pm0.27)$, and $(5.69\pm0.27)$ GeV, respectively. The corresponding hidden-bottom partners are found lying in the range of $11.68-12.28$ GeV and $11.38-12.33$ GeV, respectively. The possible baryonium decay modes are analyzed, which are hopefully measurable in LHC experiments.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Hole Sterile Neutrinogenesis: Sterile Neutrino Dark Matter Production Independent of Couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12136v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sterile neutrinos ($\nu_s$s) are well-motivated and actively searched for hypothetical neutral particles that would mix with the Standard Model active neutrinos. They are considered prime warm dark matter (DM) candidates, typically when their mass is in the keV range, although they can also be hot or cold DM components. We discuss in detail the characteristics and phenomenology of $\nu_s$s that minimally couple only to active neutrinos and are produced in the evaporation of early Universe primordial black holes (PBHs), a process we called "PBH sterile neutrinogenesis". Contrary to the previously studied $\nu_s$ production mechanisms, this novel mechanism does not depend on the active-sterile mixing. The resulting $\nu_s$s have a distinctive spectrum and are produced with larger energies than in typical scenarios. This characteristic enables $\nu_s$s to be WDM in the unusual $0.3$ MeV to $0.3$ TeV mass range, if PBHs do not matter-dominate the Universe before evaporating. When PBHs matter-dominate before evaporating, the possible coincidence of induced gravitational waves associated with PBH evaporation and astrophysical X-ray observations from $\nu_s$ decays constitutes a distinct signature of our scenario. constitutes a distinct signature of our scenario.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17228v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) QCD radiative corrections to the pion electromagnetic form factor with large momentum transfer. We explicitly verify the validity of the collinear factorization to two-loop order for this observable, and obtain the respective IR-finite two-loop hard-scattering kernel in the closed form. The NNLO QCD correction turns to be positive and significant. Incorporating this new ingredient of correction, we then make a comprehensive comparison between the finest theoretical predictions and numerous pion form factor measurements in both space-like and time-like regions. Our phenomenological analysis provides strong constraint on the second Gegenbauer moment of the pion light-cone distribution amplitude (LCDA) obtained from recent lattice QCD studies.</description>

Abstract: We present results for the $\tau_1$ and $\tau_{1a}$ 1-Jettiness global event shape distributions, for Deep Inelastic Scattering (DIS), at the N$^3$LL + ${\cal O}(\alpha_s^2)$ level of accuracy. These event-shape distributions quantify and characterize the pattern of final state radiation in electron-nucleus collisions. They can be used as a probe of nuclear structure functions, nuclear medium effects in jet production, and for a precision extraction of the QCD strong coupling. The results presented here, along with the corresponding numerical codes, can be used for analyses with HERA data, in EIC simulation studies, and for eventual comparison with real EIC data.</description>

      <title>Orbital Angular Momentum Small-$x$ Evolution: Exact Results in the Large-$N_c$ Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05508v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct an exact solution to the revised small-$x$ orbital angular momentum (OAM) evolution equations derived recently, based on an earlier work. These equations are derived in the double logarithmic approximation (summing powers of $\alpha_s \ln^2(1/x)$ with $\alpha_s$ the strong coupling constant and $x$ the Bjorken $x$ variable) and the large-$N_c$ limit, with $N_c$ the number of quark colors. From our solution, we extract the small-$x$, large-$N_c$ expressions of the quark and gluon OAM distributions. Additionally, we determine the large-$N_c$ small-$x$ asymptotics of the OAM distributions to be
  \begin{align}
  \notag
  L_{q+\bar{q}}(x,Q^2) \sim L_G(x,Q^2) \sim \Delta \Sigma (x,Q^2) \sim \Delta G(x,Q^2) \sim \left(\frac{1}{x} \right)^{\alpha_h},
  \end{align} with the intercept $\alpha_h$ the same as obtained in the small-$x$ helicity evolution, which can be approximated as $\alpha_h \approx 3.66074 \sqrt{\frac{\alpha_s N_c}{2\pi}}$. This result is in complete agreement with the literature. Additionally, we calculate the ratio of the quark and gluon OAM distributions to the flavor-singlet quark and gluon helicity parton distribution functions respectively in the small-$x$ region.</description>

      <title>Photon propagation in a charged Bose-Einstein condensate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13896v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the propagation of photons in a model of a charged scalar Bose-Einstein (BE) condensate. We determine the dispersion relations of the collective modes, as well as the photon polarization tensor and the dielectric constant in the model. Two modes correspond to the transverse photon polarizations, with dispersion relations of the usual form for transverse photons in a plasma. The other two modes, denoted as the $(\pm)$ modes, are combinations of the longitudinal photon and the massive scalar field. Their dispersion relations behave very differently as functions of momentum. The $(+)$ mode dispersion relation increases steadily and remains greater than the momentum as the momentum increases. The dispersion relation of the $(-)$ mode decreases in a given momentum range, with the group velocity being negative in that range, while in another range it increases steadily but remains smaller than the momentum, akin to the situation in a medium with an index of refraction greater than 1. We consider the non-relativistic limit of the $(\pm)$ dispersion relations and discuss some aspects of the results. We also determine the wavefunctions of the $(\pm)$ modes, which are useful to obtain the corrections to the dispersion relations, e.g., imaginary parts due to the damping effects and/or the effects of scattering, due to the interactions with the excitations of the system. The results can be useful in various physical contexts that have been considered in the literature involving the electrodynamics of a charged scalar BE condensate.</description>

      <title>Dual chiral density wave induced oscillating Casimir effect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17638v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Casimir effect is known to be induced from photon fields confined by a small volume, and also its fermionic counterpart has been predicted in a wide range of quantum systems. Here, we investigate what types of Casimir effects can occur from quark fields in dense and thin quark matter. In particular, in the dual chiral density wave, which is a possible ground state of dense quark matter, we find that the Casimir energy oscillates as a function of the thickness of matter. This oscillating Casimir effect is regarded as an analog of that in Weyl semimetals and is attributed to the Weyl points in the momentum space of quark fields. In addition, we show that an oscillation is also induced from the quark Fermi sea, and the total Casimir energy is composed of multiple oscillations.</description>

      <title>Global Lepton Flavour Violating Constraints on New Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09772v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform a global analysis of the bounds from charged lepton flavour violating observables to new physics. We parametrize generic new physics through the Effective Field Theory formalism and perform global fits beyond the common one-operator-at-a-time analyses to investigate how much present data is able to constrain the full parameter space. We particularly focus on leptonic and semileptonic operators with light quarks, identifying unbounded flat directions, detailing how many are present and which operators are involved. The analysis is performed in the general LEFT formalism, which contains all possible low-energy effective operators relevant for lepton flavour violation, as well as in more restricted scenarios, when operators come from a SMEFT completion. We find that flat directions play no role in the fully leptonic four-fermion operators. Conversely, they significantly hinder the ability to derive global bounds on semileptonic operators, with several flat or at least very poorly constrained directions preventing to fully constrain the parameter space. These results are particularly affected by the proper inclusion of uncertainties in the parameters describing $\mu-e$ conversion, which decrease the number of well-constrained directions in operator space when treated as nuisance parameters in the fit. While present data is able to provide global constraints on all operators only in the more restricted scenarios we investigated, very strong correlations among the parameters must exist to avoid conflict with the different observables. We provide correlation matrices approximating our full results as a useful tool to compare present data with particular UV completions.</description>

      <title>QCD bounds on leading-order hadronic vacuum polarization contributions to the muon anomalous magnetic moment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08591v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: QCD bounds on the leading-order (LO) hadronic vacuum polarization (HVP) contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon ($a_\mu^{\mathrm{HVP,LO}}$, $a_\mu=\left(g-2\right)_\mu/2$) are determined by imposing H\"older inequalities and related inequality constraints on systems of Finite-Energy QCD sum-rules. This novel methodology is complementary to lattice QCD and data-driven approaches to determining $a_\mu^{\mathrm{HVP,LO}}$. For the light-quark ($u,d,s$) contributions up to five-loop order in perturbation theory in the chiral limit, LO in light-quark mass corrections, next-to-leading order in dimension-four QCD condensates, and to LO in dimension-six QCD condensates, we find that $\left(657.0\pm 34.8\right)\times 10^{-10}\leq a_\mu^{\mathrm{HVP,LO}} \leq \left(788.4\pm 41.8\right)\times10^{-10}\,$, bridging the range between lattice QCD and data-driven values.</description>

      <title>Quantum effects on the evaporation of PBHs: contributions to dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16815v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the relic abundance of dark matter in the presence of Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) beyond the semiclassical approximation. We take into account the quantum corrections due to the memory burden effect, which is assumed to suppress the black hole evaporation rate by the inverse power of its own entropy. Such quantum effect significantly enhances the lifetime, rendering the possibility of PBH mass $\lesssim 10^{9}$ g being the sole dark matter (DM) candidate. However, Nature can not rule out the existence of fundamental particles such as DM. We, therefore, include the possibility of populating the dark sector by the decay of PBHs to those fundamental particles, adding the contribution to stable PBH whose lifetime is extended due to the quantum corrections. Depending on the strength of the burden effect, we show that a wide range of parameter space opens up in the initial PBH mass and fundamental dark matter mass plane that respects the correct relic abundance.</description>

      <title>An innovative model for coupled fermion-antifermion pairs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16290v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the behavior of fermion-antifermion (\(f\overline{f}\)) pairs is crucial in modern physics. These systems, governed by fundamental forces, exhibit complex interactions essential for particle physics, high-energy physics, nuclear physics, and solid-state physics. This study introduces a novel theoretical model using the many-body Dirac equation for \(f\overline{f}\) pairs with an effective position-dependent mass (i.e., \(m \rightarrow m + \mathcal{S}(r)\)) under the influence of an external magnetic field. To validate our model, we show that by modifying the mass with a Coulomb-like potential, \(m(r) = m - \alpha/r\), where \(-\alpha/r\) is the Lorentz scalar potential \(\mathcal{S}(r)\), our results match the well-established energy eigenvalues for \(f\overline{f}\) pairs interacting through the Coulomb potential, without approximation. By applying adjustments based on the Cornell potential (i.e., \(\mathcal{S}(r) = kr - \alpha/r\)), we derive a closed-form energy expression. We believe this unique model offers significant insights into the dynamics of \(f\overline{f}\) pairs under various interaction potentials, with potential applications in particle physics. Additionally, it could be extended to various \(f\overline{f}\) systems, such as positronium, relativistic Landau levels for neutral mesons, excitons in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides, and Weyl pairs in monolayer graphene sheets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14608v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the effects of anomalous thresholds on the non-local form factors describing the hadronization of the light-quark contribution to $B\to(P,V)\gamma^*$ transitions. Starting from a comprehensive discussion of anomalous thresholds in the triangle loop function for different mass configurations, we detail how the dispersion relation for $\pi\pi$ intermediate states is affected by contour deformations mandated by the anomalous branch points. Phenomenological estimates of the size of the anomalous contributions to the form factors are provided with couplings determined from measured branching fractions and Dalitz plot distributions. Our key finding is that anomalous effects are suppressed on the $\rho(770)$ resonance, while off-peak the effects can become as large as $\mathcal{O}(10\%)$ of the full (light-quark-loop induced) non-local form factors. We comment on future generalizations towards higher intermediate states and the charm loop, outlining how the dispersive framework established in this work could help improve the non-local form factors needed as input for a robust interpretation of $B\to (P,V)\ell^+\ell^-$ decays.</description>

Abstract: Dark photons coupling to $L_\mu-L_\tau$ lepton number difference are a highly studied light dark matter candidate, with potential to be discovered through their impact on terrestrial neutrino oscillation experiments. We re-examine this in the light of claimed tensions between the NO$\nu$A and T2K long baseline experiments, also taking into account data from the MINOS experiment. We obtain leading limits on the $L_\mu-L_\tau$ gauge coupling $g'$ versus dark photon mass $m_{A'}$, and find no statistically significant alleviation of the tension from inclusion of the new physics effect.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.14535v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the quantum geometric effects near the locations where classical black hole horizons used to appear in Einstein's classical theory, within the framework of an improved dynamic approach, in which the internal region of a black hole is modeled by the Kantowski-Sachs (KS) spacetime and the two polymerization parameters are functions of the phase space variables. Our detailed analysis shows that the effects are so strong that black and white hole horizons of the effective quantum theory do not exist at all and instead are replaced by transition surfaces, across which the metric coefficients and their inverses are smooth and remain finite, as are the corresponding curvatures, including the Kretschmann scalar. These surfaces always separate trapped regions from anti-trapped regions. The number of such surfaces is infinite, so the corresponding KS spacetimes become geodesically complete, and no black and white hole-like structures exist in this scheme.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.09951v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: New long-lived particles produced at the colliders may escape from conventional particle detectors. Using satellites or ground telescopes, we can detect the photons generated from the annihilation of the star-captured dark matter into a pair of long-lived particles. When the propagation length of these long-lived particles surpasses the interplanetary distance between the Sun and Jupiter, it becomes unfeasible to detect such dark matter signals originating from the Sun or Jupiter on Earth. Our analysis of the dark matter-induced photons produced by prompt radiation, inverse Compton scattering, and synchrotron radiation mechanisms reveals that a decay length of about $10^{-3}$ pc for long-lived particles is required for maximum detectability. We investigate the parameters that allow the long-lived particle's lifetime to be consistent with Big Bang nucleosynthesis while also allowing it to escape the confines of our solar system. The Sirius system is proposed as a promising target for the indirect detection of such long-lived particles. Utilizing the prompt, inverse Compton scattering, and synchrotron radiation, upper limits on the dark matter-proton spin-independent and spin-dependent cross section are estimated with the Fermi-LAT null-signal observation and the capabilities of the upcoming Square Kilometre Array radio telescope.</description>

Abstract: Cosmology offers opportunities to test Dark Matter independently of its interactions with the Standard Model. We study the imprints of long-range forces acting solely in the dark sector on the distribution of galaxies, the so-called Large Scale Structure (LSS). We derive the strongest constraint on such forces from a combination of Planck and BOSS data. Along the way we consistently develop, for the first time, the Effective Field Theory of LSS in the presence of new dynamics in the dark sector. We forecast that future surveys will improve the current bound by an order of magnitude.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.05965v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel study of Kerr Compton amplitudes in a partial wave basis in terms of the Nekrasov-Shatashvili (NS) function of the confluent Heun equation (CHE). Remarkably, NS-functions enjoy analytic properties and symmetries that are naturally inherited by the Compton amplitudes. Based on this, we characterize the analytic dependence of the Compton phase-shift in the Kerr spin parameter and provide a direct comparison to the standard post-Minkowskian (PM) perturbative approach within General Relativity (GR). We also analyze the universal large frequency behavior of the relevant characteristic exponent of the CHE -- also known as the renormalized angular momentum -- and find agreement with numerical computations. Moreover, we discuss the analytic continuation in the harmonics quantum number $\ell$ of the partial wave, and show that the limit to the physical integer values commutes with the PM expansion of the observables. Finally, we obtain the contributions to the tree level, point-particle, gravitational Compton amplitude in a covariant basis through $O(a_{\text{BH}}^8)$, without the need to take the super-extremal limit for Kerr spin.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we present an updated model for nuclear $\pi^0$ photoproduction, which incorporates pion second-order rescattering on intermediate excited nuclear states. Our approach is based on the distorted wave impulse approximation in momentum space. The many-body medium effects are incorporated in the complex effective $\Delta$ self-energy, employing the results of the recently developed second-order pion-nucleus scattering potential. The experimental data for ${}^{12}$C and ${}^{40}$Ca are successfully described without the need to fit the model parameters of the photoproduction amplitude as a result of incorporating the second-order part of nuclear photoproduction potential, which involves intermediate nucleon spin-flip and charge exchange.</description>

      <title>Wormholes in the axiverse, and the species scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14489v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze a large class of four-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=1$ low-energy realizations of the axiverse satisfying various quantum gravity constraints. We propose a novel upper bound on the ultimate UV cutoff of the effective theory, namely the species scale, which only depends on data available at the two-derivative level. Its dependence on the moduli fields and the number $N$ of axions matches expectations from other independent considerations. After an assessment of the regime of validity of the effective field theory, we investigate the non-perturbative gravitational effects therein. We identify a set of axionic charges supported by extremal and non-extremal wormhole configurations. We present a universal class of analytic wormhole solutions, explore their deformations, and analyze the relation between wormhole energy scales and species scale. The connection between these wormholes and a special subclass of BPS fundamental instantons is discussed, and an argument in favor of the genericity of certain axion-dependent effective superpotentials is provided. We find a lower bound increasing with $N\gg 1$ on the Gauss-Bonnet coefficient, resulting in an exponential suppression of non-extremal wormhole effects. Our claims are illustrated and tested in concrete string theory models.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate that the Schwarzschild black hole can be ``resolved'' into bound states of Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes in four dimensions. These bound states closely resemble the Schwarzschild geometry from the asymptotic region up to an infinitesimal distance away from the Schwarzschild horizon. Below this scale, the horizon is replaced by novel spacetime structures supported by intense and entrapped electromagnetic flux. The flux originates from collinear black holes that can be brought arbitrarily close to extremality. We find that the charge distribution follows a universal pattern, with magnitudes scaling proportionally to the total mass and alternating in sign. Moreover, the bound states always have an entropy that constitutes a fraction of the Schwarzschild entropy. Constructed in four dimensions, the black holes are kept apart by struts, for which we analyze tensions and energies. These solutions pave the way for analogous constructions in supergravity and for a brane/anti-brane description of the Schwarzschild black hole in string theory.</description>

      <title>Statistical divergences in high-dimensional hypothesis testing and a modern technique for estimating them</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06397v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hypothesis testing in high dimensional data is a notoriously difficult problem without direct access to competing models' likelihood functions. This paper argues that statistical divergences can be used to quantify the difference between the population distributions of observed data and competing models, justifying their use as the basis of a hypothesis test. We go on to point out how modern techniques for functional optimization let us estimate many divergences, without the need for population likelihood functions, using samples from two distributions alone. We use a physics-based example to show how the proposed two-sample test can be implemented in practice, and discuss the necessary steps required to mature the ideas presented into an experimental framework. The code used has been made available for others to use.</description>
