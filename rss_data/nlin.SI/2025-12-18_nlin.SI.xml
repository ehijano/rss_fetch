      <title>Liouvillian integrability of vector fields in higher dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider complex rational vector fields in dimension $n&gt;2$ (equivalently, differential forms of degree $n-1$ in $n$ variables) which admit a Liouvillian first integral. Extending a classical result by Singer for $n=2$, our main result states that there exists a first integral which is obtained by two successive integrations from one-forms with coefficients in a finite algebraic extension of the rational function field. The proof uses Puiseux series in a novel way to simplify computations. We also apply this method to give elementary proofs of Singer's theorem for rational one-forms, and of the Prelle-Singer theorem on elementary integrability of rational vector fields.</description>

      <title>BiHom-Lie brackets and the Toda equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a BiHom-type skew-symmetric bracket on $\mathfrak{gl}(V)$ built from two commuting inner automorphisms $\alpha=Ad_\psi$ and $\beta=Ad_\phi$ with $\psi,\phi\in \mathfrak{gl}(V)$ and integers $i,j$. We prove that $(\mathfrak{gl}(V),[\cdot,\cdot]^{(i,j)}_{(\psi,\phi)},\alpha,\beta)$ is a BiHom--Lie algebra, and we study the Lax equation obtained by replacing the commutator in the finite nonperiodic Toda lattice by this bracket. For the symmetric choice $\phi=\psi$ with $(i,j)=(0,0)$, the deformed flow is equivariant under conjugation and becomes gauge-equivalent, via $\widetilde L=\psi^{-1}L\psi$, to a Toda-type Lax equation with a conjugated triangular projection. In particular, scalar deformations amount to a constant rescaling of time. On embedded $2\times2$ blocks, we derive explicit trigonometric and hyperbolic formulas that make symmetry constraints (e.g. tracelessness) transparent. In the asymmetric hyperbolic case, we exhibit a trace obstruction showing that the right-hand side is generically not a commutator, which amounts to symmetry breaking of the isospectral property. We further extend the construction to the weakly coupled Toda lattice with an indefinite metric and provide explicit $2\times2$ solutions via an inverse-scattering calculation, clarifying and correcting certain formulas in the literature. The classical Toda dynamics are recovered at special parameter values.</description>

      <title>Graph-theoretical search for integrable multistate Landau-Zener models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The search for exactly solvable models is an evergreen topic in theoretical physics. In the context of multistate Landau-Zener models -- $N$-state quantum systems with linearly time-dependent Hamiltonians -- the theory of integrability provides a framework for identifying new solvable cases. In particular, it was proved that the integrability of a specific class known as the multitime Landau-Zener (MTLZ) models guarantees their exact solvability. A key finding was that an $N$-state MTLZ model can be represented by data defined on an $N$-vertex graph. While known host graphs for MTLZ models include hypercubes, fans, and their Cartesian products, no other families have been discovered, leading to the conjecture that these are the only possibilities. In this work, we conduct a systematic graph-theoretical search for integrable models within the MTLZ class. By first identifying minimal structures that a graph must contain to host an MTLZ model, we formulate an efficient algorithm to systematically search for candidate graphs for MTLZ models. Implementing this algorithm using computational software, we enumerate all candidate graphs with up to $N = 13$ vertices and perform an in-depth analysis of those with $N \le 11$. Our results corroborate the aforementioned conjecture for graphs up to $11$ vertices. For even larger graphs, we propose a specific family, termed descendants of ``$(0,2)$-graphs'', as promising candidates that may violate the conjecture above. Our work can serve as a guideline to identify new exactly solvable multistate Landau-Zener models in the future.</description>

      <title>Liouvillian integrability of three dimensional vector fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.20451v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a three dimensional complex polynomial, or rational, vector field (equivalently, a two-form in three variables) which admits a Liouvillian first integral. We prove that there exists a first integral whose differential is the product of a rational 1-form with a Darboux function, or there exists a Darboux Jacobi multiplier. Moreover, we prove that Liouvillian integrability {in any dimension $n\geq 3$} always implies the existence of a first integral that is obtained by two successive integrations from one-forms with coefficients in a finite algebraic extension of the rational function field.</description>

      <title>On differential equations invariant under a projective transformation group: integrability and reductions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09800v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a projective transformation and establish the invariants for this transformation group up to order seven. We use the obtained invariants to construct a class of nonlinear evolution equations and identify some symmetry-integrable equations in this class. Notably, the only symmetry-integrable evolution equation of order three in this class is a fully-nonlinear equation for which we find the recursion operator and its connection to the Schwarzian KdV. We furthermore establish that higher-order symmetry-integrable equations in this class belong to the hierarchy of the fully-nonlinear 3rd-order equation and prove this for the 5th-order case as well as for the quasi-linear 7th-order case. We list all symmetry reductions of this 3rd-order fully-nonlinear symmetry-integrable evolution equation to ordinary differential equations by exploiting the 1-dimensional optimal Lie symmetry subalgebras of the transformation group. We also identify the ordinary differential equations that are invariant under this projective transformation and reduce the order of these equations.</description>
