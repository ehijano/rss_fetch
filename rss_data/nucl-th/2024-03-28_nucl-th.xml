      <title>Trineutron resonances in the SS-HORSE-NCSM approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The SS-HORSE-NCSM method is generalized to the case of democratic decay into an odd number of fragments. This method is applied to the search for resonances in three-neutron system (trineutron) using ab initio No-Core Shell Model calculations with realistic nucleon-nucleon potentials. The $3/2^-$ and $1/2^-$ strongly overlapping resonances are predicted when softened $NN$ interactions are used and are preferred over the case where bare $NN$ interactions of the chiral effective field theory are used with no resonance obtained.</description>

      <title>Nuclear shape staggering of neutron-deficient Au and kink structure of Pb isotopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we examine the abnormal odd-even shape staggering (OES) behavior of nuclear charge radii of neutron-deficient gold (Au) isotopes, which has recently been confirmed by advanced laser techniques. To understand the nuclear structure underlying this phenomenon, we apply the deformed relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov theory in continuum (DRHBc). Our results find that the shape staggering can be attributed to nuclear shape transition in the Au isotopes. The gold isotopic chain exhibits significant changes in ground state deformation around $N = 98 \sim 100$ region and $N =$ 108. The abrupt decrease in the relative changes in mean-squared charge radii ($\delta {&lt; r^2 &gt;}$) turns out to originate from sudden transitions from prolate deformation to oblate deformation. We elucidate the nuclear shape staggering by analyzing the evolution of occupation probability for single-particle states. Finally, the abrupt kink structure in the nuclear charge radius of lead (Pb) isotopes near the $N =$ 126 shell is also investigated and reproduced quite well.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty quantification in $(p,n)$ reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Charge-exchange reactions are versatile probes for nuclear structure. In particular, when populating isobaric analog states, these reactions are used to study isovector nuclear densities and neutron skins. The quality of the information extracted from charge-exchange data depends on the accuracy of the reaction models and their inputs; this work addresses these two points. First, we quantify the uncertainties due to effective nucleon-nucleus interactions by propagating the parameter posterior distributions of the recent global optical model KDUQ [1] to $(p,n)$ reaction observables populating the isobaric analogue state, at beam energies in the range of $25-160$ MeV. Our analysis, focusing on $^{48}$Ca, shows that the total parametric uncertainties on the cross sections are around 60-100%. The source of this uncertainty is mainly the transition operator as the uncertainties from the distorted waves alone are less than about 15%. Second, we perform a comparison between two- and three-body models that both describe the dynamics of the reaction within the DWBA. The predictions from these two models are similar and generally agree with the available data, suggesting that 1-step DWBA is sufficient to describe the reaction process. Only at a beam energy of 25 MeV there are possibly signs that a 1-step assumption is not fully correct. This work provides motivation for the quantification of uncertainties associated with the transition operator in three-body model. It also suggests that further constraint of the optical potential parameters is needed for increased model precision.</description>

      <title>$p\bar\Lambda$ final-state interaction in the reactions $e^+e^- \to K^- p \bar \Lambda$ and $J/\psi \to K^- p \bar \Lambda$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Near-threshold $p\bar\Lambda$ mass spectra for the reactions $e^+e^- \to K^- p\bar\Lambda$ and $J/\psi \to K^- p\bar\Lambda$ are investigated with an emphasis on the role played by the interaction in the $p\bar\Lambda$ system. As guideline for the $p\bar\Lambda$ interaction a variety of $\Lambda\bar\Lambda$ potential models is considered that have been established in the analysis of data on $p\bar p\to \Lambda\bar\Lambda$ in the past. Arguments why the properties of the $p\bar\Lambda$ and $\Lambda\bar\Lambda$ interactions can be expected to be very similar are provided. It is shown that the near-threshold enhancement in the invariant mass observed for the $e^+e^-$ reaction can be reproduced quantitatively by the assumed $p\bar\Lambda$ final-state interaction in the partial wave suggested by an amplitude analysis of the experiment. The effect of the $p\bar\Lambda$ final-state interaction in other decays is explored, including the recently measured reactions $B^- \to J/\psi\, \bar p \Lambda$ and $B^+ \to J/\psi\, p \bar\Lambda$. It is found that the final-state interaction improves the description of the measured invariant mass near threshold in most cases.</description>

      <title>Pressure and speed of sound in two-flavor color-superconducting quark matter at next-to-leading order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deconfined quark matter at asymptotically high densities is weakly coupled, due to the asymptotic freedom of Quantum Chromodynamics. In this weak-coupling regime, bulk thermodynamic properties of quark matter, assuming a trivial ground state, are currently known to partial next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order. However, the ground state at high densities is expected to be a color superconductor, in which the excitation spectrum of (at least some) quarks exhibit a gap with a non-perturbative dependence on the strong coupling. In this work, we calculate the thermodynamic properties of color-superconducting quark matter at high densities and zero temperature at next-to-leading order (NLO) in the coupling in the presence of a finite gap. We work in the limit of two massless quark flavors, which corresponds to deconfined symmetric nuclear matter, and further assume that the gap is small compared to the quark chemical potential. In these limits, we find that the NLO corrections to the pressure and speed of sound are comparable in size to the leading-order effects of the gap, and further increase both quantities above their values for non-superconducting quark matter. We also provide a parameterization of the NLO speed of sound to guide phenomenology in the high-density region, and we furthermore comment on whether our findings should be expected to extend to the case of three-flavor quark matter of relevance to neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Parity doublet model for baryon octets: ground states saturated by good diquarks and the role of bad diquarks for excited states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18214v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parity doublet model is an effective chiral model that includes the chiral variant and invariant masses of baryons. The chiral invariant mass has large impacts on the density dependence of models which can be constrained by neutron star observations. In the previous work, models of two-flavors have been considered up to a few times nuclear saturation density, but in such dense region it is also necessary to consider hyperons. With the chiral invariant masses baryons can stay massive in extreme environments (e.g., neutron stars) where the chiral symmetry restoration takes place. In this work, we generalize the previous $\mbox{SU(2)}_L \times \mbox{SU(2)}_R$ parity models of nucleons to $\mbox{SU(3)}_L \times \mbox{SU(3)}_R$ models of the baryon octet, within the linear realization of the chiral symmetry. The major problem in constructing such models has been too many candidates for the chiral representations of baryons. Motivated by the concepts of diquarks and the mended symmetry, we choose the $(3_L, \bar{3}_R) + (\bar{3}_L, 3_R)$, $(3_L, 6_R) + (6_L, 3_R)$ and $(1_L, 8_R) + (8_L, 1_R)$ representations and use quark diagrams to constrain the possible types of Yukawa interactions. The masses of the baryon octets for positive and negative baryons up to the first excitations are successfully reproduced. As expected from the diquark considerations, the ground state baryons are well dominated by $(3_L, \bar{3}_R) + (\bar{3}_L, 3_R)$ and $(1_L, 8_R) + (8_L, 1_R)$ representations, while the excited states require $(3_L, 6_R) + (6_L, 3_R)$ representations. Important applications of our model are the chiral restoration for strange quarks at large density and the continuity of diquarks from hadronic to quark matter. We also address the problem of large Yukawa couplings which are enhanced in three-flavor construction.</description>

      <title>A Deep Learning Framework for Disentangling Triangle Singularity and Pole-Based Enhancements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Enhancements in the invariant mass distribution or scattering cross-section are usually associated with resonances. However, the nature of exotic signals found near hadron-hadron thresholds remain a puzzle today. In fact, a purely kinematic triangle mechanism is also capable of producing similar structures, but do not correspond to any unstable quantum state. In this paper, we report for the first time, that a deep neural network can be trained to distinguish triangle singularity from pole-based enhancements. We also identify the type of dynamic pole structure that can be misidentified as triangle enhancement. We apply our method to confirm that the $P_\psi^N(4312)^+$ state is not due to a single triangle singularity, and the pole-based interpretation is more favored for this signal. Lastly, we argue how our method can be used as a model-selection framework to help in classifying other exotic hadron candidates.</description>

      <title>The role of hidden-color components in the tetraquark mixing model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18411v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multiquarks can have two-hadron components and hidden-color components in their wave functions. The presence of two-hadron components in multiquarks introduces a potential source of confusion, particularly with respect to their resemblance to hadronic molecules. On the other hand, hidden-color components are essential for distinguishing between multiquarks and hadronic molecules. In this work, we study the hidden-color components in the wave functions of the tetraquark mixing model, a model that has been proposed as a suitable framework for describing the properties of two nonets in the $J^P=0^+$ channel: the light nonet [$a_0 (980)$, $K_0^* (700)$, $f_0 (500)$, $f_0 (980)$] and the heavy nonet [$a_0 (1450)$, $K_0^* (1430)$, $f_0 (1370)$, $f_0 (1500)$]. Our analysis reveals a substantial presence of hidden-color components within the tetraquark wave functions. To elucidate the impact of hidden-color components on physical quantities, we conduct computations of the hyperfine masses, $\langle V_{CS}\rangle$, for the two nonets, considering scenarios involving only the two-meson components and those incorporating the hidden-color components. We demonstrate that the hidden-color components constitute an important part of the hyperfine masses, such that the mass difference formula, $\Delta M\approx \Delta \langle V_{CS}\rangle$, which has been successful for the two nonets, cannot be achieved without the hidden-color contributions. This can provide another evidence supporting the tetraquark nature of the two nonets.</description>

      <title>The effect of cutoff dependence on heavy quark spin symmetry partners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hadron spectroscopy is revealed by observing heavy resonances. Among various explanations of the internal structure of these hadronic states, hadronic molecules play a unique role. For hadronic molecules, which are associated with meson-meson or meson-baryon interactions, the $\Lambda$ cutoff is a significant factor in determining the composite states' binding energies and overall properties. The cutoff becomes important when it comes to the location of hadronic molecules' masses because it influences the predictions. From this perspective, in the light of cutoff dependency, heavy quark spin partners of near-threshold the $\chi_{c0}(3915)$, $\chi_{c1}(3872)$, $P_c(4440)$, and $P_c(4457)$ resonances, which are considered as hadronic molecules, are examined.</description>

      <title>Effects of Dark Matter on $f$-mode oscillations of Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of dark matter (DM) on $f$-mode oscillations in DM admixed neutron stars (NSs). We consider hadronic matter modeled by the relativistic mean field model and the DM model based on the neutron decay anomaly. We study the non-radial $f$-mode oscillations for such DM admixed NS in a full general relativistic framework. We investigate the impact of DM, DM self-interaction, and DM fraction on the $f$-mode characteristics. We derive relations encoding the effect of DM on $f$-mode parameters. We then perform a systematic study by varying all the model parameters within their known uncertainty range and obtain a universal relation for the DM fraction based on the total mass of the star and DM self-interaction strength. We also perform a correlation study among model parameters and NS observables, in particular, $f$-mode parameters. Finally, we check the $f$-mode universal relations (URs) for the case of DM admixed NSs and demonstrate the existence of a degeneracy between purely hadronic NSs and DM admixed NSs.</description>

      <title>Measuring the Lense-Thirring precession and the neutron star moment of inertia with pulsars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutron stars (NSs) are compact objects that host the densest forms of matter in the observable universe, providing unique opportunities to study the behaviour of matter at extreme densities. While precision measurements of NS masses through pulsar timing have imposed effective constraints on the equation of state (EoS) of dense matter, accurately determining the radius or moment of inertia (MoI) of a NS remains a major challenge. This article presents a detailed review on measuring the Lense-Thirring (LT) precession effect in the orbit of binary pulsars, which would give access to the MoI of NSs and offer further constraints on the EoS. We discuss the suitability of certain classes of binary pulsars for measuring the LT precession from the perspective of binary star evolution, and highlight five pulsars that exhibit properties promising to realise these goals in the near future. Finally, discoveries of compact binaries with shorter orbital periods hold the potential to greatly enhance measurements of the MoI of NSs. The MoI measurements of binary pulsars are pivotal to advancing our understanding of matter at supranuclear densities as well as improving the precision of gravity tests, such as the orbital decay due to gravitational wave emission and of tests of alternative gravity theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.16250v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gribov-Zwanziger prescription in Yang-Mills theory improves the infrared dynamics. In this work, we study the static potential of a heavy quark-antiquark pair with the HTL resummed perturbation method within the Gribov-Zwanziger approach at finite temperature. The real and imaginary parts of the heavy quark complex potential are obtained from the one-loop effective static gluon propagator. The one-loop effective gluon propagator is obtained by calculating the one-loop gluon self-energies containing the quark, gluon, and ghost loop. The gluon and ghost loops are modified in the presence of the Gribov parameter. We also calculate the decay width from the imaginary part of the potential. We also discuss the medium effect of heavy quark potential with the localized action via auxiliary fields.</description>

Abstract: The elastic pion-proton and pion-pion scattering are studied in a holographic QCD model, focusing on the Regge regime. Taking into account the Pomeron and Reggeon exchange, which are described by the Reggeized $2^{++}$ glueball and vector meson propagator respectively, the total and differential cross sections are calculated. The adjustable parameters involved in the model are determined with the experimental data of the pion-proton total cross sections. The differential cross sections can be predicted without any additional parameters, and it is shown that our predictions are consistent with the data. The energy dependence of the Pomeron and Reggeon contribution is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Spin polarization and spin alignment from quantum kinetic theory with self-energy corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15197v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive the quantum kinetic theory for massive fermions with collision terms and self-energy corrections based on quantum field theory. We adopt an effective power counting scheme with $\hbar$ expansion to obtain the leading-order perturbative solutions of the vector and axial Wigner functions and the corresponding kinetic equations. We observe that both the onshell relation and the structure of Wigner functions, along with the kinetic equations, are modified due to the presence of self-energies and their space-time gradients. We further apply our formalism to investigate the spin polarization phenomena in relativistic heavy ion collisions and derive the modification to the spin polarization spectrum of massive quarks. We find that the gradient of vector self-energy plays a similar role to the background electromagnetic fields, which induces a more dominant contribution than the collisional effects by a naive power counting in the gradient expansion and weak coupling. Our findings could further modify the spin polarization of strange quarks and spin alignment of $\phi$ mesons beyond local thermal equilibrium.</description>

Abstract: The nature of the highly dense matter inside the supernova remnant compact star is not constrained by terrestrial experiments and hence modeled phenomenologically to accommodate the astrophysical observations from compact stars. The observable properties of the compact stars are highly sensitive to the microscopic model of highly dense matter. However, some universal relations exist between some macroscopic properties of compact stars independent of the matter model. We study the universal relation including the stars containing exotic degrees of freedom such as heavier strange and non-strange baryons, strange quark matter in normal and superconducting phases, etc. We examine the universal relations for quantities moment of inertia - tidal love number - quadrupole moment. We also study the correlation of non-radial f-mode and p-mode frequencies with stellar properties. We find the f-mode frequency observes the universal relation with dimensionless tidal deformability but the p-mode frequency does not show a good correlation with stellar properties. The p-mode frequency is sensitive to the composition of the matter. We find that universal relation is also applicable for stars with exotic matter in the core of the star with several models of exotic matter.</description>

      <title>Baryon electric charge correlation as a magnetometer of QCD</title>

Abstract: The correlation between net baryon number and electric charge, $\chi_{11}^{\rm BQ}$, can serve as a magnetometer of QCD. This is demonstrated by lattice QCD computations using the highly improved staggered quarks with physical pion mass of $M_\pi=135~$MeV on $N_\tau=8$ and 12 lattices. We find that $\chi_{11}^{\rm BQ}$ along the transition line starts to increase rapidly with magnetic field strength $eB\gtrsim 2M_\pi^2$ and by a factor 2 at $eB\simeq 8M_\pi^2$. Furthermore, the ratio of electric charge chemical potential to baryon chemical potential, $\mu_{\rm Q}/\mu_{\rm B}$, shows significant dependence on the magnetic field strength and varies from the ratio of electric charge to baryon number in the colliding nuclei in heavy ion collisions. These results can provide baselines for effective theory and model studies, and both $\chi_{11}^{\rm BQ}$ and $\mu_{\rm Q}/\mu_{\rm B}$ could be useful probes for the detection of magnetic fields in relativistic heavy ion collision experiments as compared with corresponding results from the hadron resonance gas model.</description>

      <title>Improved Constraints on the Variation of the Weak Scale from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09325v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the recent EMPRESS data on the $^4$He abundance in Big Bang nucleosynthesis as a function of the Higgs vacuum expectation value $v$ and compare the methods of our calculation to the recently published work of Burns et al. [1]. The EMPRESS result for the $^4$He abundance can be explained within $2\sigma$ by $0.011 \leq \delta v / v \leq 0.055$. However, as first noted in [1], a Higgs VEV in this range would worsen the discrepancy between theory and experiment for the deuterium abundance significantly.</description>
