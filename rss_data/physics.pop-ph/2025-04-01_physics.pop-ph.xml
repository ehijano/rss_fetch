      <title>Quantum Port: Gamification of quantum teleportation for public engagement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Concepts on quantum physics are generally difficult for the general public to understand and grasp due to its counter-intuitive nature and requirement for higher level of mathematical literacy. With categorical quantum mechanics (CQM), quantum theory is re-formalized into a more intuitive diagrammatic approach, which we will refer to as the first level of transformation, to improve the accessibility and readability of quantum theory to a broader audience since the mathematical details are embedded into diagrammatic rules. Taking inspiration from this diagrammatic approach, we propose the second level of transformation by gamifying the diagrammatic rules of quantum teleportation into a quantum card game called Quantum Port. In this work, we discuss the gamification process of quantum teleportation and provide a printable version of Quantum Port for public engagement.</description>

      <title>The Universe is Odd</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cosmological principle posits that the universe does not exhibit any specific preference for position or direction. However, it remains unclear whether the universe has a distinct preference for parity: whether certain properties are more likely to be classified as even or odd. In this study, we analyze the largest available galaxy group catalogs to explore this hypothesis: specifically, whether the number of galaxies within a galaxy group or cluster is more likely to be odd or even. Our findings convincingly indicate that the universe indeed favors odd numbers, with results achieving a significance level well above the $4.1-\sigma$ threshold.</description>

      <title>Macroscopic "Lola/Mola" Cat State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first--ever example of a macroscopic system in a quantum superposition. The system in question is a Siamese cat known as Lola; however, on a time scale of about 12 hours it oscillates into a different state that we refer to as "Mola". In the "Lola" state, the system is sweet and friendly and allows to cuddle itself, but in the "Mola" state, it is malevolent and witchy. When the probability of the system being in the "Mola" state is high, decoherence is strongly discouraged!</description>

      <title>Astronomers Getting Less Creative Over Time Is Why This Title Isn't Better</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For generations, people have complained that things used to be better in the past. In this paper, we investigate this change by specifically looking at creativity in astronomy. To do this,we explore if older constellations reflected a greater sense of creativity on the part of those designing them than more modern constellations do. We find that things really have become simplistic and less original over time.</description>

      <title>Written in the Stars: How your (pens and) papers decide the fate of the arXiverse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We all love the ecstasy that comes with submitting papers to journals or arXiv. Some have described it as yeeting their back-breaking products of labor into the void, wishing they could never deal with them ever again. The very act of yeeting papers onto arXiv contributes to the expansion of the arXiverse; however, we have yet to quantify our contribution to the cause. In this work, I investigate the expansion of the arXiverse using the arXiv astro-ph submission data from 1992 to date. I coin the term "the arXiverse constant", $a_0$, to quantify the rate of expansion of the arXiverse. I find that astro-ph as a whole has a positive $a_0$, but this does not always hold true for the six subcategories of astro-ph. I then investigate the temporal changes in $a_0$ for the astro-ph subcategories and astro-ph as a whole, from which I infer the fate of the arXiverse.</description>

      <title>Practical Quantum Advantage for Boosting Citations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Realizing practical quantum advantage with meaningful economic impact is the holy grail of the quantum information field. Recent quantum technology advances have driven exponential growth in quantum information research, with resultant publications achieving significantly elevated impact. Within academia, citation counts serve as a key metric for evaluating research impact, often directly influencing career advancement and compensation structures. Motivated by these observations, we propose a potential protocol for practical quantum advantage in boosting citations.</description>

      <title>Resolving the baryon assymmetry with RATS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current leading theories of physics such as the Big Bang, the standard model of particle physics, and general relativity suggest that the universe should contain an equal amount of matter and antimatter. Yet observations have found a disproportionately large amount of matter, a phenomenon known as the baryon assymmetry problem. Since century-old established theories are traditionally impossible to refute, the only possible explanation is that the remaining antimatter is hidden in plain sight and remains to be observed. We propose the existence of anti-stars to solve the baryon assymetry in our new Reasonable Antimatter Theory of Stars (RATS). In this context, the RATS will create a framework to resolve the traditional tension between observers and theorists, and thus contribute to the peaceful and collaborative spirit of astronomy. Our method is the firing of neurons in our brains, typically known as a thought experiment. We still have no idea why or how this works, but it must be good because most of science was created this way. Our results are the result of our methods, which result in some text and the resulting conclusions. In order to encourage the reader to reach the end of this short paper, we do not want to spoil the conclusions here. Instead, the conclusions will conclude the paper.</description>

      <title>Orientation of Entrance and Burial Chamber in the Pyramids of the Egyptian Fourth and Fifth Dynasties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a recent work, arxiv:2412.20407, we have mentioned two Egyptian kings, Shepseskaf and Userkaf, of the IV and V Dynasties. Here we continue discussing their burial places, that is their pyramids, in a new framework based on the study of orientation of pyramid substructures (entrances, corridors, burial chambers). Shepseskaf and Userkaf opted for the same architectonic solutions, exhibiting a continuity in funerary architecture. After showing the substructure orientations of the pyramids of the IV and V Dynasties, we will stress that the substructure in the Shepseskaf's pyramid, the Mastabat Fara'un, is oriented as in the Fourth Dynasty architecture of pyramids and that it has a layout which is closer to that used by the following Fifth Dynasty. In our discussion, we will start with the first ruler of the Fourth Dynasty, Snefru, who introduced a new form of external and internal layout of the burial complexes of the king, through an evolution based on four attempts, the Seila, Meidum, Bent and Red pyramids. In the final model, the Snefru's Red pyramid, the substructure has a north entrance and a burial chamber east-west oriented. This orientation persisted in the pyramids of the Fourth and Fifth Dynasties, and beyond. The Sekhemkhet (Djoserty) pyramid of the Third Dynasty is also illustrated for comparison, such as some earlier burial monuments. In the discussion here proposed the position of sarcophagus and of the body inside it is also investigated. The sarcophagus has its axis north-south. The body of the deceased king was lying on its left side, extended, head to the north, face towards the east. In this framework, we propose again what we told in arXiv 2016, arxiv:1604.05963, and the layout of pyramids with respect to sunrise on solstices.</description>

      <title>Attraction of a jerk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Jerk plays a pivotal role in the thrilling experience of many amusemement park rides. In addition to exploring the physical aspect of jerks, we tackle the empirical observation of an attractive force between passengers in the popular attraction, the spinning teacups. By modeling the complex system of rotating platforms, we show that pseudotorques induced by changing acceleration lead to jerky movements and an attractive interaction among riders. Our numerical analysis confirms the empirical observations, highlighting the connection between attraction and jerks.</description>

      <title>The New Science of Unidentified Aerospace-Undersea Phenomena (UAP)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06794v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: After decades of dismissal and secrecy, it has become clear that a significant number of the world's governments take Unidentified Aerospace-Undersea Phenomena (UAP), formerly known as Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs), seriously -- yet still seem to know little about them. As a result, these phenomena are increasingly attracting the attention of scientists around the world, some of whom have recently formed research efforts to monitor and scientifically study UAP. In this paper, we review and summarize approximately 20 historical government studies dating from 1933 to the present (in Scandinavia, WWII, US, Canada, France, Russia, China), several historical private research studies (France, UK, US), and both recent and current scientific research efforts (Ireland, Germany, Norway, Sweden, US). In doing so, our objective is to clarify the existing global and historical scientific narrative around UAP. Studies range from field station development and deployment to the collection and analysis of witness reports from around the world. We dispel the common misconception that UAPs are an American phenomenon and show that UAP can be, and have been, scientifically investigated. Our aim here is to enable future studies to draw on the great depth of prior documented experience.</description>
