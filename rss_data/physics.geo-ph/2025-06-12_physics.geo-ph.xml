      <title>Diffusion prior as a direct regularization term for FWI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models have recently shown promise as powerful generative priors for inverse problems. However, conventional applications require solving the full reverse diffusion process and operating on noisy intermediate states, which poses challenges for physics-constrained computational seismic imaging. In particular, such instability is pronounced in non-linear solvers like those used in Full Waveform Inversion (FWI), where wave propagation through noisy velocity fields can lead to numerical artifacts and poor inversion quality. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective framework that directly integrates a pretrained Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) as a score-based generative diffusion prior into FWI through a score rematching strategy. Unlike traditional diffusion approaches, our method avoids the reverse diffusion sampling and needs fewer iterations. We operate the image inversion entirely in the clean image space, eliminating the need to operate through noisy velocity models. The generative diffusion prior can be introduced as a simple regularization term in the standard FWI update rule, requiring minimal modification to existing FWI pipelines. This promotes stable wave propagation and can improve convergence behavior and inversion quality. Numerical experiments suggest that the proposed method offers enhanced fidelity and robustness compared to conventional and GAN-based FWI approaches, while remaining practical and computationally efficient for seismic imaging and other inverse problem tasks.</description>

      <title>Self-learning signal classifier for decameter coherent scatter radars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper presents a method for automatic constructing a classifier for processed data obtained by decameter coherent scatter radars. Method is based only on the radar data obtained, the results of automatic modeling of radio wave propagation in the ionosphere, and mathematical criteria for estimating the quality of the models. The final classifier is the model trained at data obtained by 12 radars of the SuperDARN and SECIRA networks over two years for each radar. The number of the model coefficients is 2669. For the classification, the model uses both the calculated parameters of radio wave propagation in the model ionosphere and the parameters directly measured by the radar. Calibration of radiowave elevation measurements at each radar was made using meteor trail scattered signals. The analysis showed that the optimal number of classes in the data is 37, of which 25 are frequently observed. The analysis made it possible to choose 14 classes from them, which are confidently separated in other variants of model training. A preliminary interpretation of 10 of them was carried out. The dynamics of observation of various classes and their dependence on the geographical latitude of radars at different levels of solar and geomagnetic activity were presented, it was shown that it does not contradict with known physical mechanisms. The analysis showed that the most important parameters to identify the classes are the shape of the signal ray-tracing trajectory in its second half, the ray-traced scattering height and the Doppler velocity measured by the radar.</description>

      <title>No influence of passing stars on paleoclimate reconstructions over the past 56 million years</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Passing stars (also called stellar flybys) have notable effects on the solar system's long-term dynamical evolution, injection of Oort cloud comets into the solar system, properties of trans-Neptunian objects, and more. Based on a simplified solar system model, omitting the Moon and the Sun's quadrupole moment J2, it has recently been suggested that passing stars are also an important driver of paleoclimate before ~50 Myr ago, including a climate event called the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (~56 Myr ago). In contrast, using a state-of-the-art solar system model, including a lunar contribution and J2, and random stellar parameters (&gt;400 simulations), we find no influence of passing stars on paleoclimate reconstructions over the past 56 Myr. Even in an extreme flyby scenario in which the Sun-like star HD 7977 (m = 1.07 M_Sun) would have passed within ~3,900 au about 2.8 Myr ago (with 5% likelihood), we detect no discernible change in Earth's orbital evolution over the past 70 Myr, compared to our standard model. Our results indicate that a complete physics model is essential to accurately study the effects of stellar flybys on Earth's orbital evolution.</description>

      <title>On the Efficacy of Ocean Formation with a Primordial Hydrogen Atmosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has been suggested that Earth's present water budget formed from oxidation reactions between its initial hydrogen-rich primordial atmosphere and its magma ocean. Here we examine this hypothesis by building a comprehensive atmosphere-magma ocean model. We find that water formation is unlikely for two reasons. First, any water formed from oxidation reactions in the magma ocean would quickly outgass because of the water-poor atmosphere above. Second, the top boundary layer of the magma ocean becomes stable against convection because the oxidation reactions produce metallic iron, which sinks to the core of a growing Earth. This iron loss makes the top boundary layer significantly more buoyant than the rest of the magma, thus becoming stable against mixing. Our results suggest that hydrogen dissolution is unlikely to play a major role in the formation of Earth's oceans.</description>

      <title>Pushing the Limits of Extreme Weather: Constructing Extreme Heatwave Storylines with Differentiable Climate Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the plausible upper bounds of extreme weather events is essential for risk assessment in a warming climate. Existing methods, based on large ensembles of physics-based models, are often computationally expensive or lack the fidelity needed to simulate rare, high-impact extremes. Here, we present a novel framework that leverages a differentiable hybrid climate model, NeuralGCM, to optimize initial conditions and generate physically consistent worst-case heatwave trajectories. Applied to the 2021 Pacific Northwest heatwave, our method produces temperature anomalies up to 3.7 $^\circ$C above the most extreme member of a 75-member ensemble. These trajectories feature intensified atmospheric blocking and amplified Rossby wave patterns--hallmarks of severe heat events. Our results demonstrate that differentiable climate models can efficiently explore the upper tails of event likelihoods, providing a powerful new approach for constructing targeted storylines of extreme weather under climate change.</description>
