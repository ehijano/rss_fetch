      <title>Integer Representations in IEEE 754, Posit, and Takum Arithmetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The posit and takum machine number formats have been proposed as alternatives to the IEEE 754 floating-point standard. As floating-point numbers are frequently employed to represent integral values, with certain applications explicitly relying on this capability, it is pertinent to evaluate how effectively these new formats fulfil this function compared to the standard they seek to replace. While empirical results are known for posits, this aspect has yet to be formally investigated.
  This paper provides rigorous derivations and proofs of the integral representation capabilities of posits and takums, examining both the exact number of bits required to represent a given integer and the largest consecutive integer that can be represented with a specified number of bits. The findings indicate that, while posits are generally less effective than IEEE 754 floating-point numbers in this regard, takums demonstrate overall superior representational strength compared to both IEEE 754 and posits.</description>

      <title>A note on the structure of locally finite planar quasi-transitive graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20300v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In an early work from 1896, Maschke established the complete list of all finite planar Cayley graphs. This result initiated a long line of research over the next century, aiming at characterizing in a similar way all planar infinite Cayley graphs. Droms (2006) proved a structure theorem for finitely generated planar groups, i.e., finitely generated groups admitting a planar Cayley graph, in terms of Bass-Serre decompositions. As a byproduct of his structure theorem, Droms proved that such groups are finitely presented. More recently, Hamann (2018) gave a graph theoretical proof that every planar quasi-transitive graph $G$ admits a generating $\mathrm{Aut}(G)$-invariant set of closed walks with only finitely many orbits, and showed that a consequence is an alternative proof of Droms' result. Based on the work of Hamann, we show in this note that we can also obtain a general structure theorem for $3$-connected locally finite planar quasi-transitive graphs, namely that every such graph admits a canonical tree-decomposition whose edge-separations correspond to cycle-separations in the (unique) embedding of $G$, and in which every part admits a vertex-accumulation free embedding. This result can be seen as a version of Droms' structure theorem for quasi-transitive planar graphs. As a corollary, we obtain an alternative proof of a result of Hamann, Lehner, Miraftab and R\"uhmann (2022) that every locally finite quasi-transitive planar graph admits a canonical tree-decomposition, whose parts are either $1$-ended or finite planar graphs.</description>

      <title>Ramanujan Graphs and Interlacing Families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This survey accompanies a lecture on the paper ``Interlacing Families I: Bipartite Ramanujan Graphs of All Degrees'' by A. Marcus, D. Spielman, and N. Srivastava at the 2024 International Congress of Basic Science (ICBS) in July, 2024. Its purpose is to explain the developments surrounding this work over the past ten or so years, with an emphasis on connections to other areas of mathematics. Earlier surveys about the interlacing families method by the same authors focused on applications in functional analysis, whereas the focus here is on applications in spectral graph theory.</description>

      <title>Simple Quantum Coins Enable Pretty Good State Transfer on Every Hypercube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider pretty good state transfer in coined quantum walks between antipodal vertices on the hypercube $Q_d$. When $d$ is a prime, this was proven to occur in the arc-reversal walk with Grover coins. We extend this result by constructing weighted Grover coins that enable pretty good state transfer on every $Q_d$. Our coins are real, and require modification of the weight on only one arc per vertex. We also generalize our approach and establish a sufficient condition for pretty good state transfer to occur on other graphs.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Optimal Ordering in Global Routing Problems in Semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21035v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a new method for ordering nets during the process of layer assignment in global routing problems. The global routing problems that we focus on in this work are based on routing problems that occur in the design of substrates in multilayered semiconductor packages. The proposed new method is based on machine learning techniques and we show that the proposed method supersedes conventional net ordering techniques based on heuristic score functions. We perform global routing experiments in multilayered semiconductor package environments in order to illustrate that the routing order based on our new proposed technique outperforms previous methods based on heuristics. Our approach of using machine learning for global routing targets specifically the net ordering step which we show in this work can be significantly improved by deep learning.</description>

      <title>On the clique number of random Cayley graphs and related topics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that a random Cayley graph on a group of order $N$ has clique number $O(\log N \log \log N)$ with high probability. This bound is best possible up to the constant factor for certain groups, including~$\mathbb{F}_2^n$, and improves the longstanding upper bound of $O(\log^2 N)$ due to Alon. Our proof does not make use of the underlying group structure and is purely combinatorial, with the key result being an essentially best possible upper bound for the number of subsets of given order that contain at most a given number of colors in a properly edge-colored complete graph. As a further application of this result, we study a conjecture of Alon stating that every group of order $N$ has a Cayley graph whose clique number and independence number are both $O(\log N)$, proving the conjecture for all abelian groups of order $N$ for almost all $N$. For finite vector spaces of order $N$ with characteristic congruent to $1 \pmod 4$, we prove the existence of a self-complementary Cayley graph on the vector space whose clique number and independence number are both at most $(2+o(1))\log N$. This matches the lower bound for Ramsey numbers coming from random graphs and solves, in a strong form, a problem of Alon and Orlitsky motivated by information theory.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.06157</link>
      <description>arXiv:1906.06157v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article presents proof that the reverse of the Prefer Max De Bruijn sequence can be expanded into an infinite De Bruijn sequence by increasing the size of the alphabet. Furthermore, we show that every De Bruijn sequence possessing this characteristic exhibits behavior similar to that of the reverse of the Prefer Max De Bruijn sequence.</description>

      <title>Finite groups with geodetic Cayley graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00261v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A connected undirected graph is called \emph{geodetic} if for every pair of vertices there is a unique shortest path connecting them. It has been conjectured that for finite groups, the only geodetic Cayley graphs are odd cycles and complete graphs. In this article we present a series of theoretical results which contribute to a computer search verifying this conjecture for all groups of size up to 1024. The conjecture is also verified for several infinite families of groups including dihedral and some families of nilpotent groups. Two key results which enable the computer search to reach as far as it does are: if the center of a group has even order, then the conjecture holds (this eliminates all $2$-groups from our computer search); if a Cayley graph is geodetic then there are bounds relating the size of the group, generating set and center (which {significantly} cuts down the number of generating sets which must be searched).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11806v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dumitru Popa found asymptotic expansions for certain nonlinear recurrences, but left open the numerical evaluation of associated constants. We address this issue. A change of variables involving reciprocals and the algorithm of Mavecha &amp; Laohakosol play a key role in our computations.</description>
