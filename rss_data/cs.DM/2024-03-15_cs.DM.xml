      <title>On sampling diluted Spin Glasses using Glauber dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin-glasses are Gibbs distributions that have been studied in CS for many decades. Recently, they have gained renewed attention as they emerge naturally in learning, inference, optimisation etc.
  We consider the Edwards-Anderson (EA) spin-glass distribution at inverse temperature $\beta$ when the underlying graph is an instance of $G(n,d/n)$. This is the random graph on $n$ vertices where each edge appears independently with probability $d/n$ and $d=\Theta(1)$. We study the problem of approximate sampling from this distribution using Glauber dynamics.
  For a range of $\beta$ that depends on $d$ and for typical instances of the EA model on $G(n,d/n)$, we show that the corresponding Glauber dynamics exhibits mixing time $O(n^{2+\frac{3}{\log^2 d}})$.
  The range of $\beta$ for which we obtain our rapid-mixing results correspond to the expected influence being $&lt;1/d$; we conjecture that this is the best possible.
  Unlike the mean-field spin-glasses, where the problem has been studied before, the diluted case has not.
  We utilise the well-known path-coupling technique. In the standard Glauber dynamics on $G(n,d/n)$, one has to deal with the so-called effect of high degree vertices. Here, rather than considering degrees, it is more natural to use a different measure on the vertices called aggregate influence.
  We build on the block-construction approach proposed by [Dyer et al. 2006] to circumvent the problem of high-degree vertices. Specifically, we first establish rapid mixing for an appropriately defined block-dynamics. We design this dynamics such that vertices of large aggregate influence are placed deep inside their blocks. Then, we obtain rapid mixing for the Glauber dynamics utilising a comparison argument.</description>

      <title>Bounds and extremal graphs for monitoring edge-geodetic sets in graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A monitoring edge-geodetic set, or simply an MEG-set, of a graph $G$ is a vertex subset $M \subseteq V(G)$ such that given any edge $e$ of $G$, $e$ lies on every shortest $u$-$v$ path of $G$, for some $u,v \in M$. The monitoring edge-geodetic number of $G$, denoted by $meg(G)$, is the minimum cardinality of such an MEG-set. This notion provides a graph theoretic model of the network monitoring problem.
  In this article, we compare $meg(G)$ with some other graph theoretic parameters stemming from the network monitoring problem and provide examples of graphs having prescribed values for each of these parameters. We also characterize graphs $G$ that have $V(G)$ as their minimum MEG-set, which settles an open problem due to Foucaud \textit{et al.} (CALDAM 2023), and prove that some classes of graphs fall within this characterization. We also provide a general upper bound for $meg(G)$ for sparse graphs in terms of their girth, and later refine the upper bound using the chromatic number of $G$. We examine the change in $meg(G)$ with respect to two fundamental graph operations: clique-sum and subdivisions. In both cases, we provide a lower and an upper bound of the possible amount of changes and provide (almost) tight examples.</description>

      <title>Binary Stretch Embedding of Weighted Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce and study the problem of \textit{binary stretch embedding} of edge-weighted graph. This problem is closely related to the well-known \textit{addressing problem} of Graham and Pollak. Addressing problem is the problem of assigning the shortest possible length strings (called ``addresses") over the alphabet $\{0,1,*\}$ to the vertices of an input graph $G$ with the following property. For every pair $u,v$ of vertices, the number of positions in which one of their addresses is $1$, and the other is $0$ is exactly equal to the distance of $u,v$ in graph $G$. When the addresses do not contain the symbol $*$, the problem is called \textit{isometric hypercube embedding}. As far as we know, the isometric hypercube embedding was introduced by Firsov in 1965. It is known that such addresses do not exist for general graphs.
  Inspired by the addressing problem, in this paper, we introduce the \textit{binary stretch embedding problem}, or BSEP for short, for the edge-weighted undirected graphs. We also argue how this problem is related to other graph embedding problems in the literature.
  Using tools and techniques such as Hadamard codes and the theory of linear programming, several upper and lower bounds as well as exact solutions for certain classes of graphs will be discovered.
  As an application of the results in this paper, we derive improved upper bounds or exact values for the maximum size of Lee metric codes of certain parameters.</description>

      <title>On maximum-sum matchings of bichromatic points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Huemer et al. (Discrete Math, 2019) proved that for any two finite point sets $R$ and $B$ in the plane with $|R| = |B|$, the perfect matching that matches points of $R$ with points of $B$, and maximizes the total squared Euclidean distance of the matched pairs, has the property that all the disks induced by the matching have a nonempty common intersection. A pair of matched points induces the disk that has the segment connecting the points as diameter. In this note, we characterize these maximum-sum matchings for any continuous (semi)metric, focusing on both the Euclidean distance and squared Euclidean distance. Using this characterization, we give a different but simpler proof for the common intersection property proved by Huemer et al..</description>

      <title>Binomial sums and Mellin asymptotics with explicit error bounds: a case study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09408v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Making use of a newly developed package in the computer algebra system SageMath, we show how to perform a full asymptotic analysis by means of the Mellin transform with explicit error bounds. As an application of the method, we answer a question of B\'ona and DeJonge on 132-avoiding permutations with a unique longest increasing subsequence that can be translated into an inequality for a certain binomial sum.</description>

      <title>Edge-apexing in hereditary classes of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09456v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A class $\mathcal{G}$ of graphs is called hereditary if it is closed under taking induced subgraphs. We denote by $G^{epex}$ the class of graphs that are at most one edge away from being in $\mathcal{G}$. We note that $G^{epex}$ is hereditary and prove that if a hereditary class $\mathcal{G}$ has finitely many forbidden induced subgraphs, then so does $G^{epex}$.
  The hereditary class of cographs consists of all graphs $G$ that can be generated from $K_1$ using complementation and disjoint union. Cographs are precisely the graphs that do not have the $4$-vertex path as an induced subgraph. For the class of edge-apex cographs our main result bounds the order of such forbidden induced subgraphs by 8 and finds all of them by computer search.</description>

      <title>Almost Perfect Mutually Unbiased Bases that are Sparse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03964v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In dimension $d$, Mutually Unbiased Bases (MUBs) are a collection of orthonormal bases over $\mathbb{C}^d$ such that for any two vectors $v_1, v_2$ belonging to different bases, the scalar product $|\braket{v_1|v_2}| = \frac{1}{\sqrt{d}}$. The upper bound on the number of such bases is $d+1$. Constructions to achieve this bound are known when $d$ is some power of prime. The situation is more restrictive in other cases and also when we consider the results over real rather than complex. Thus, certain relaxations of this model are considered in literature and consequently Approximate MUBs (AMUB) are studied. This enables one to construct potentially large number of such objects for $\mathbb{C}^d$ as well as in $\mathbb{R}^d$. In this regard, we propose the concept of Almost Perfect MUBs (APMUB), where we restrict the absolute value of inner product $|\braket{v_1|v_2}|$ to be two-valued, one being 0 and the other $ \leq \frac{1+\mathcal{O}(d^{-\lambda})}{\sqrt{d}}$, such that $\lambda &gt; 0$ and the numerator $1 + \mathcal{O}(d^{-\lambda}) \leq 2$. Each such vector constructed, has an important feature that large number of its components are zero and the non-zero components are of equal magnitude. Our techniques are based on combinatorial structures related to RBDs. We show that for several composite dimensions $d$, one can construct $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{d})$ many APMUBs, in which cases the number of MUBs are significantly small. To be specific, this result works for $d$ of the form $(q-e)(q+f), \ q, e, f \in \mathbb{N}$, with the conditions $0 \leq f \leq e$ for constant $e, f$ and $q$ some power of prime. We also show that such APMUBs provide sets of Bi-angular vectors which are $\mathcal{O}(d^{\frac{3}{2}})$ in numbers, having high angular distances among them. Finally, as the MUBs are equivalent to a set of Hadamard matrices, we show that the APMUBs are so with the set of Weighing matrices.</description>

      <title>Plum: Prompt Learning using Metaheuristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.08364v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since the emergence of large language models, prompt learning has become a popular method for optimizing and customizing these models. Special prompts, such as Chain-of-Thought, have even revealed previously unknown reasoning capabilities within these models. However, the progress of discovering effective prompts has been slow, driving a desire for general prompt optimization methods. Unfortunately, few existing prompt learning methods satisfy the criteria of being truly "general", i.e., automatic, discrete, black-box, gradient-free, and interpretable all at once. In this paper, we introduce metaheuristics, a branch of discrete non-convex optimization methods with over 100 options, as a promising approach to prompt learning. Within our paradigm, we test six typical methods: hill climbing, simulated annealing, genetic algorithms with/without crossover, tabu search, and harmony search, demonstrating their effectiveness in white-box and black-box prompt learning. Furthermore, we show that these methods can be used to discover more human-understandable prompts that were previously unknown in both reasoning and image generation tasks, opening the door to a cornucopia of possibilities in prompt optimization. We release all the codes in \url{https://github.com/research4pan/Plum}.</description>
