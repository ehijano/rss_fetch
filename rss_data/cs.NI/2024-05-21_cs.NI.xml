      <title>Optimizing Generative AI Networking: A Dual Perspective with Multi-Agent Systems and Mixture of Experts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the continued development of next-generation networking and artificial intelligence content generation (AIGC) services, the integration of multi-agent systems (MAS) and the mixture of experts (MoE) frameworks is becoming increasingly important. Motivated by this, this article studies the contrasting and converging of MAS and MoE in AIGC-enabled networking. First, we discuss the architectural designs, operational procedures, and inherent advantages of using MAS and MoE in generative AI to explore its functionality and applications fully. Next, we review the applications of MAS and MoE frameworks in content generation and resource allocation, emphasizing their impact on networking operations. Subsequently, we propose a novel multi-agent-enabled MoE-proximal policy optimization (MoE-PPO) framework for 3D object generation and data transfer scenarios. The framework uses MAS for dynamic task coordination of each network service provider agent and MoE for expert-driven execution of respective tasks, thereby improving overall system efficiency and adaptability. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework and significantly improve the performance indicators under different network conditions. Finally, we outline potential future research directions.</description>

      <title>Multi-hop Multi-RIS Wireless Communication Systems: Multi-reflection Path Scheduling and Beamforming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) provides a promising way to proactively augment propagation environments for better transmission performance in wireless communications. Existing multi-RIS works mainly focus on link-level optimization with predetermined transmission paths, which cannot be directly extended to system-level management, since they neither consider the interference caused by undesired scattering of RISs, nor the performance balancing between different transmission paths. To address this, we study an innovative multi-hop multi-RIS communication system, where a base station (BS) transmits information to a set of distributed users over multi-RIS configuration space in a multi-hop manner. The signals for each user are subsequently reflected by the selected RISs via multi-reflection line-of-sight (LoS) links. To ensure that all users have fair access to the system to avoid excessive number of RISs serving one user, we aim to find the optimal beam reflecting path for each user, while judiciously determining the path scheduling strategies with the corresponding beamforming design to ensure the fairness. Due to the presence of interference caused by undesired scattering of RISs, it is highly challenging to solve the formulated multi-RIS multi-path beamforming optimization problem. To solve it, we first derive the optimal RISs' phase shifts and the corresponding reflecting path selection for each user based on its practical deployment location. With the optimized multi-reflection paths, we obtain a feasible user grouping pattern for effective interference mitigation by constructing the maximum independent sets (MISs). Finally, we propose a joint heuristic algorithm to iteratively update the beamforming vectors and the group scheduling policies to maximize the minimum equivalent data rate of all users.</description>

      <title>Edge Information Hub-Empowered 6G NTN: Latency-Oriented Resource Orchestration and Configuration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quick response to disasters is crucial for saving lives and reducing loss. This requires low-latency uploading of situation information to the remote command center. Since terrestrial infrastructures are often damaged in disaster areas, non-terrestrial networks (NTNs) are preferable to provide network coverage, and mobile edge computing (MEC) could be integrated to improve the latency performance. Nevertheless, the communications and computing in MEC-enabled NTNs are strongly coupled, which complicates the system design. In this paper, an edge information hub (EIH) that incorporates communication, computing and storage capabilities is proposed to synergize communication and computing and enable systematic design. We first address the joint data scheduling and resource orchestration problem to minimize the latency for uploading sensing data. The problem is solved using an optimal resource orchestration algorithm. On that basis, we propose the principles for resource configuration of the EIH considering payload constraints on size, weight and energy supply. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed scheme in reducing the overall upload latency, thus enabling quick emergency rescue.</description>

      <title>IREE Oriented Green 6G Networks: A Radial Basis Function Based Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In order to provide design guidelines for energy efficient 6G networks, we propose a novel radial basis function (RBF) based optimization framework to maximize the integrated relative energy efficiency (IREE) metric. Different from the conventional energy efficient optimization schemes, we maximize the transformed utility for any given IREE using spectrum efficiency oriented RBF network and gradually update the IREE metric using proposed Dinkelbach's algorithm. The existence and uniqueness properties of RBF networks are provided, and the convergence conditions of the entire framework are discussed as well. Through some numerical experiments, we show that the proposed IREE outperforms many existing SE or EE oriented designs and find a new Jensen-Shannon (JS) divergence constrained region, which behaves differently from the conventional EE-SE region. Meanwhile, by studying IREE-SE trade-offs under different traffic requirements, we suggest that network operators shall spend more efforts to balance the distributions of traffic demands and network capacities in order to improve the IREE performance, especially when the spatial variations of the traffic distribution are significant.</description>

      <title>Towards an AI/ML-defined Radio for Wi-Fi: Overview, Challenges, and Roadmap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Will AI/ML-defined radios become a reality in the near future? In this paper, we introduce the concept of an AI/ML-defined radio - a radio architecture specifically designed to support AI/ML-based optimization and decision-making in communication functions - and depict its promised benefits and potential challenges. Additionally, we discuss a potential roadmap for the development and adoption of AI/ML-defined radios, and highlight the enablers for addressing their associated challenges. While we offer a general overview of the AI/ML-defined radio concept, our focus throughout the paper remains on Wi-Fi, a wireless technology that may significantly benefit from the integration of AI/ML-defined radios, owing to its inherent decentralized management and operation within unlicensed frequency bands.</description>

      <title>A Survey of Integrating Wireless Technology into Active Noise Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active Noise Control (ANC) is a widely adopted technology for reducing environmental noise across various scenarios. This paper focuses on enhancing noise reduction performance, particularly through the refinement of signal quality fed into ANC systems. We discuss the main wireless technique integrated into the ANC system, equipped with some innovative algorithms, in diverse environments. Instead of using microphone arrays, which increase the computation complexity of the ANC system, to isolate multiple noise sources to improve noise reduction performance, the application of the wireless technique avoids extra computation demand. Wireless transmissions of reference, error, and control signals are also applied to improve the convergence performance of the ANC system. Furthermore, this paper lists some wireless ANC applications, such as earbuds, headphones, windows, and headrests, underscoring their adaptability and efficiency in various settings.</description>

      <title>Application Layer Cyber Deception without Developer Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cyber deception techniques that are tightly intertwined with applications pose significant technical challenges in production systems. Security measures are usually the responsibility of a system operator, but they are typically limited to accessing built software artifacts, not their source code. This limitation makes it particularly challenging to deploy cyber deception techniques at application runtime and without full control over the software development lifecycle. This work reviews 19 technical methods to accomplish this and evaluates them based on technical, topological, operational, and efficacy properties. We find some novel techniques beyond honeypots and reverse proxies that seem to have received little research interest despite their promise for cyber deception. We believe that overcoming these technical challenges can drive the adoption of more dynamic and personalized cyber deception techniques, tailored to specific classes of applications.</description>

      <title>Strategic Deployment of Honeypots in Blockchain-based IoT Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of enhancing cybersecurity in Blockchain-based Internet of Things (BIoTs) systems, which are increasingly vulnerable to sophisticated cyberattacks. It introduces an AI-powered system model for the dynamic deployment of honeypots, utilizing an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) integrated with smart contract functionalities on IoT nodes. This model enables the transformation of regular nodes into decoys in response to suspicious activities, thereby strengthening the security of BIoT networks. The paper analyses strategic interactions between potential attackers and the AI-enhanced IDS through a game-theoretic model, specifically Bayesian games. The model focuses on understanding and predicting sophisticated attacks that may initially appear normal, emphasizing strategic decision-making, optimized honeypot deployment, and adaptive strategies in response to evolving attack patterns.</description>

      <title>Spatial Models for Crowdsourced Internet Access Network Performance Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11138v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite significant investments in access network infrastructure, universal access to high-quality Internet connectivity remains a challenge. Policymakers often rely on large-scale, crowdsourced measurement datasets to assess the distribution of access network performance across geographic areas. These decisions typically rest on the assumption that Internet performance is uniformly distributed within predefined social boundaries, such as zip codes, census tracts, or community areas. However, this assumption may not be valid for two reasons: (1) crowdsourced measurements often exhibit non-uniform sampling densities within geographic areas; and (2) predefined social boundaries may not align with the actual boundaries of Internet infrastructure.
  In this paper, we model Internet performance as a spatial process. We apply and evaluate a series of statistical techniques to: (1) aggregate Internet performance over a geographic region; (2) overlay interpolated maps with various sampling boundary choices; and (3) spatially cluster boundary units to identify areas with similar performance characteristics. We evaluated the effectiveness of these using a 17-month-long crowdsourced dataset from Ookla Speedtest. We evaluate several leading interpolation methods at varying spatial scales. Further, we examine the similarity between the resulting boundaries for smaller realizations of the dataset. Our findings suggest that our combination of techniques achieves a 56% gain in similarity score over traditional methods that rely on aggregates over raw measurement values for performance summarization. Our work highlights an urgent need for more sophisticated strategies in understanding and addressing Internet access disparities.</description>

      <title>Blockchains for Internet of Things: Fundamentals, Applications, and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04803v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Internet of Things (IoT) services necessitate the storage, transmission, and analysis of diverse data for inference, autonomy, and control. Blockchains, with their inherent properties of decentralization and security, offer efficient database solutions for these devices through consensus-based data sharing. However, it's essential to recognize that not every blockchain system is suitable for specific IoT applications, and some might be more beneficial when excluded with privacy concerns. For example, public blockchains are not suitable for storing sensitive data. This paper presents a detailed review of three distinct blockchains tailored for enhancing IoT applications. We initially delve into the foundational aspects of three blockchain systems, highlighting their strengths, limitations, and implementation needs. Additionally, we discuss the security issues in different blockchains. Subsequently, we explore the blockchain's application in three pivotal IoT areas: edge AI, communications, and healthcare. We underscore potential challenges and the future directions for integrating different blockchains in IoT. Ultimately, this paper aims to offer a comprehensive perspective on the synergies between blockchains and the IoT ecosystem, highlighting the opportunities and complexities involved.</description>

      <title>A GAN-Based Data Poisoning Attack Against Federated Learning Systems and Its Countermeasure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11440v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As a distributed machine learning paradigm, federated learning (FL) is collaboratively carried out on privately owned datasets but without direct data access. Although the original intention is to allay data privacy concerns, "available but not visible" data in FL potentially brings new security threats, particularly poisoning attacks that target such "not visible" local data. Initial attempts have been made to conduct data poisoning attacks against FL systems, but cannot be fully successful due to their high chance of causing statistical anomalies. To unleash the potential for truly "invisible" attacks and build a more deterrent threat model, in this paper, a new data poisoning attack model named VagueGAN is proposed, which can generate seemingly legitimate but noisy poisoned data by untraditionally taking advantage of generative adversarial network (GAN) variants. Capable of manipulating the quality of poisoned data on demand, VagueGAN enables to trade-off attack effectiveness and stealthiness. Furthermore, a cost-effective countermeasure named Model Consistency-Based Defense (MCD) is proposed to identify GAN-poisoned data or models after finding out the consistency of GAN outputs. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets indicate that our attack method is generally much more stealthy as well as more effective in degrading FL performance with low complexity. Our defense method is also shown to be more competent in identifying GAN-poisoned data or models.
