      <title>Generalized Mazur Patterns and Immersed Heegaard Floer Homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalizing prior work of Levine, we give infinitely many examples of pattern knots P such that P(K) is not slice in any rational homology 4-ball, for any companion knot K. To show this, we establish a closed formula for the concordance invariants tau and epsilon of a family of satellite knots obtained from generalized Mazur patterns. Our main computational tool is the immersed curve technique from bordered Heegaard Floer homology arising from the work of Chen-Hanselman.</description>

      <title>Classification of Lattices Bounded by Large Surgeries of Knots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We classify all the lattices realized as the intersection form of a positive definite four manifold with boundary $S_n^3(K)$ for a knot $K$ in the three sphere and a positive integer $n$ greater than $4g_4(K)+3$. We then use this result to define a concordance invariant and generalize a theorem of Rasmussen on lens space surgeries.</description>

      <title>Tight contact structures on hyperbolic homology 3-spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We produce a large class of hyperbolic homology $3$-spheres admitting arbitrarily many distinct tight contact structures. We also produce a sub-class admitting arbitrarily many distinct tight contact structures within the same homotopy class of oriented plane distributions. We also introduce a notion of geometric limits of contact structures compatible with geometric limits of hyperbolic manifolds. We study the behavior of the tight contact structures we construct under geometric limits.</description>

      <title>Polyhedral CAT(0) metrics on locally finite complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the arborescence of any locally finite complex that is $CAT(0)$ with a polyhedral metric for which all vertex stars are convex. In particular locally finite $CAT(0)$ cube complexes or equilateral simplicial complexes are arborescent. Moreover, a triangulated manifold admits a $CAT(0)$ polyhedral metric if and only if it admits arborescent triangulations. We prove eventually that every locally finite complex which is $CAT(0)$ with a polyhedral metric has a barycentric subdivision which is arborescent.</description>

      <title>Alexandrov spaces are CS sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the extremal stratification of an Alexandrov space by Perelman-Petrunin is a CS stratification in the sense of Siebenmann. We also show that every space of directions of an Alexandrov space without proper extremal subsets is homeomorphic to a sphere. In the appendix we give an example of a primitive extremal subset of codimension 2 that is not an Alexandrov space with respect to the induced intrinsic metric.</description>

      <title>Simplicial volume of manifolds fibering with connected structure group</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note we investigate the simplicial volume of fiber bundles with connected structure group. We are able to show that if the structure group is either compact or a Lie group, or if the fiber is aspherical that the simplicial volume of the total space agrees with the simplicial volume of the trivial bundle.</description>

      <title>Multivariable knot polynomials from braided Hopf algebras with automorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.11528v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct knot invariants from solutions to the Yang--Baxter equation associated to appropriately generalized left/right Yetter--Drinfel'd modules over a braided Hopf algebra with an automorphism. When applied to Nichols algebras, our method reproduces known knot polynomials and naturally produces multivariable polynomial invariants of knots. We discuss in detail Nichols algebras of rank $1$ which recover the ADO and the colored Jones polynomials of a knot and two sequences of examples of rank $2$ Nichols algebras, one of which starts with the product of two Alexander polynomials, and then conjecturally the Harper polynomial. The second sequence starts with the Links--Gould invariant (conjecturally), and then with a new 2-variable knot polynomial that detects chirality and mutation, and whose degree gives sharp bounds for the genus for a sample of 30 computed knots.</description>

      <title>Annular Links from Thompson's Group $T$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12065v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 2014 Jones showed how to associate links in the $3$-sphere to elements of Thompson's group $F$. We provide an analogue of this program for annular links and Thompson's group $T$. The main result is that any edge-signed graph embedded in the annulus is the Tait graph of an annular link built from an element of $T$. In analogy to the work of Aiello and Conti, we also show that the coefficients of certain unitary representations of $T$ recover the Jones polynomial of annular links.</description>

      <title>The geometric data on the boundary of convex subsets of hyperbolic manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.11782v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $N$ be a geodesically convex subset in a convex co-compact hyperbolic manifold $M$ with incompressible boundary. We assume that each boundary component of $N$ is either a boundary component of $\partial_\infty M$, or a smooth, locally convex surface in $M$. We show that $N$ is uniquely determined by the boundary data defined by the conformal structure on the boundary components at infinity, and by either the induced metric or the third fundamental form on the boundary components which are locally convex surfaces. We also describe the possible boundary data. This provides an extension of both the hyperbolic Weyl problem and the Ahlfors-Bers Theorem.
  Using this statement for quasifuchsian manifolds, we obtain existence results for similar questions for convex domains $\Omega\subset \HH^3$ which meets the boundary at infinity $\partial_{\infty}\HH^3$ either along a quasicircle or along a quasidisk. The boundary data then includes either the induced metric or the third fundamental form in $\HH^3$, but also an additional "gluing" data between different components of the boundary, either in $\HH^3$ or in $\partial_\infty\HH^3$.</description>

      <title>All triangulations have a common stellar subdivision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05930v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address two longstanding open problems, one originating in PL topology, another in birational geometry.
  First, we prove the weighted version of Oda's \emph{strong factorization conjecture} (1978), and prove that every two birational toric varieties are related by a common iterated blowup (at rationally smooth points).
  Second, we prove that every two PL homeomorphic polyhedra have a common stellar subdivisions, as conjectured by Alexander in~1930.</description>
