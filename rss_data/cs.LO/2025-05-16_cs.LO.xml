      <title>Characterization and Decidability of FC-Definable Regular Languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: FC is a first-order logic that reasons over all factors of a finite word using concatenation, and can define non-regular languages like that of all squares (ww). In this paper, we establish that there are regular languages that are not FC-definable. Moreover, we give a decidable characterization of the FC-definable regular languages in terms of algebra, automata, and regular expressions. The latter of which is natural and concise: Star-free generalized regular expressions extended with the Kleene star of terminal words.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Types for the Functional Machine Calculus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Functional Machine Calculus (FMC, Heijltjes 2022) extends the lambda-calculus with the computational effects of global mutable store, input/output, and probabilistic choice while maintaining confluent reduction and simply-typed strong normalization. Based in a simple call-by-name stack machine in the style of Krivine, the FMC models effects through additional argument stacks, and introduces sequential composition through a continuation stack to encode call-by-value behaviour, where simple types guarantee termination of the machine.
  The present paper provides a discipline of quantitative types, also known as non-idempotent intersection types, for the FMC, in two variants. In the weak variant, typeability coincides with termination of the stack machine and with spine normalization, while exactly measuring the transitions in machine evaluation. The strong variant characterizes strong normalization through a notion of perpetual evaluation, while giving an upper bound to the length of reductions. Through the encoding of effects, quantitative typeability coincides with termination for higher-order mutable store, input/output, and probabilistic choice.</description>

      <title>A categorical and logical framework for iterated protocols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we show that the now classical protocol complex approach to distributed task solvability of Herlihy et al. can be understood in standard categorical terms. First, protocol complexes are functors, from chromatic (semi-) simplicial sets to chromatic simplicial sets, that naturally give rise to algebras. These algebras describe the next state operator for the corresponding distributed systems. This is constructed for semi-synchronous distributed systems with general patterns of communication for which we show that these functors are always Yoneda extensions of simpler functors, implying a number of interesting properties. Furthermore, for these protocol complex functors, we prove the existence of a free algebra on any initial chromatic simplicial complex, modeling iterated protocol complexes. Under this categorical formalization, protocol complexes are seen as transition systems, where states are structured as chromatic simplicial sets. We exploit the epistemic interpretation of chromatic simplicial sets and the underlying transition system (or algebra) structure to introduce a temporal-epistemic logic and its semantics on all free algebras on chromatic simplicial sets. We end up by giving hints on how to extend this framework to more general dynamic network graphs and state-dependent protocols, and give example in fault-tolerant distributed systems and mobile robotics.</description>

      <title>Homological Invariants of Higher-Order Equational Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many first-order equational theories, such as the theory of groups or boolean algebras, can be presented by a smaller set of axioms than the original one. Recent studies showed that a homological approach to equational theories gives us inequalities to obtain lower bounds on the number of axioms. In this paper, we extend this result to higher-order equational theories. More precisely, we consider simply typed lambda calculus with product and unit types and study sets of equations between lambda terms. Then, we define homology groups of the given equational theory and show that a lower bound on the number of equations can be computed from the homology groups.</description>

      <title>Closure and Complexity of Temporal Causality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Temporal causality defines what property causes some observed temporal behavior (the effect) in a given computation, based on a counterfactual analysis of similar computations. In this paper, we study its closure properties and the complexity of computing causes. For the former, we establish that safety, reachability, and recurrence properties are all closed under causal inference: If the effect is from one of these property classes, then the cause for this effect is from the same class. We also show that persistence and obligation properties are not closed in this way. These results rest on a topological characterization of causes which makes them applicable to a wide range of similarity relations between computations. Finally, our complexity analysis establishes improved upper bounds for computing causes for safety, reachability, and recurrence properties. We also present the first lower bounds for all of the classes.</description>

      <title>Inconsistency Handling in DatalogMTL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the issue of inconsistency handling in DatalogMTL, an extension of Datalog with metric temporal operators. Since facts are associated with time intervals, there are different manners to restore consistency when they contradict the rules, such as removing facts or modifying their time intervals. Our first contribution is the definition of relevant notions of conflicts (minimal explanations for inconsistency) and repairs (possible ways of restoring consistency) for this setting and the study of the properties of these notions and the associated inconsistency-tolerant semantics. Our second contribution is a data complexity analysis of the tasks of generating a single conflict / repair and query entailment under repair-based semantics.</description>

      <title>A dual characterisation of simple and subdirectly-irreducible temporal Heyting algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish an Esakia duality for the categories of temporal Heyting algebras and temporal Esakia spaces. This includes a proof of contravariant equivalence and a congruence/filter/closed-upset correspondence. We then study two notions of {\guillemotleft} reachability {\guillemotright} on the relevant spaces/frames and show their equivalence in the finite case. We use these notions of reachability to give both lattice-theoretic and dual order-topological characterisations of simple and subdirectly-irreducible temporal Heyting algebras. Finally, we apply our duality results to prove the relational and algebraic finite model property for the temporal Heyting calculus. This, in conjunction with the proven characterisations, allows us to prove a relational completeness result that combines finiteness and the frame property dual to subdirect-irreducibility, giving us a class of finite, well-understood frames for the logic.</description>

      <title>An algebraic theory of {\omega}-regular languages, via {\mu}{\nu}-expressions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Alternating parity automata (APAs) provide a robust formalism for modelling infinite behaviours and play a central role in formal verification. Despite their widespread use, the algebraic theory underlying APAs has remained largely unexplored. In recent work, a notation for non-deterministic finite automata (NFAs) was introduced, along with a sound and complete axiomatisation of their equational theory via right-linear algebras. In this paper, we extend that line of work, in particular to the setting of infinite words. We present a dualised syntax, yielding a notation for APAs based on right-linear lattice expressions, and provide a natural axiomatisation of their equational theory with respect to the standard language model of {\omega}-regular languages. The design of this axiomatisation is guided by the theory of fixed point logics; in fact, the completeness factors cleanly through the completeness of the linear-time {\mu}-calculus.</description>

      <title>Towards SMT Solver Stability via Input Normalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22419v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In many applications, SMT solvers are utilized to solve similar or identical tasks over time. Significant variations in performance due to small changes in the input are not uncommon and lead to frustration for users. This sort of stability problem represents an important usability challenge for SMT solvers. We introduce an approach for mitigating the stability problem based on normalizing solver inputs. We show that a perfect normalizing algorithm exists but is computationally expensive. We then describe an approximate algorithm and evaluate it on a set of benchmarks from related work, as well as a large set of benchmarks sampled from SMT-LIB. Our evaluation shows that our approximate normalizer reduces runtime variability with minimal overhead and is able to normalize a large class of mutated benchmarks to a unique normal form.</description>

      <title>Synthesis with Privacy Against an Observer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08635v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study automatic synthesis of systems that interact with their environment and maintain privacy against an observer to the interaction. The system and the environment interact via sets $I$ and $O$ of input and output signals. The input to the synthesis problem contains, in addition to a specification, also a list of secrets, a function $cost: I\cup O\rightarrow\mathbb{N}$, which maps each signal to the cost of hiding it, and a bound $b\in\mathbb{N}$ on the budget that the system may use for hiding of signals. The desired output is an $(I/O)$-transducer $T$ and a set $H\subseteq I\cup O$ of signals that respects the bound on the budget, thus $\sum_{s\in H} cost(s)\leq b$, such that for every possible interaction of $T$, the generated computation satisfies the specification, yet an observer, from whom the signals in $H$ are hidden, cannot evaluate the secrets.
  We first show that the problem's complexity is 2EXPTIME-complete for specifications and secrets in LTL, making it no harder than synthesis without privacy requirements. We then analyze the complexity further, isolating the two aspects that do not exist in traditional synthesis: the need to hide secret values and the need to choose the set $H$. We do this by studying settings in which traditional synthesis is solvable in polynomial time -- when the specification formalism is deterministic automata and when the system is closed -- and show that each of these aspects adds an exponential blow-up in complexity. We continue and study bounded synthesis with privacy, where the input includes a bound on the synthesized transducer size, as well as a variant of the problem in which the observer has knowledge, either about the specification or about the system, which can be helpful in evaluating the secrets. Additionally, we study certified privacy, where the synthesis algorithm provides certification that the secrets remain hidden.</description>

Abstract: We give an alternative proof for the existing result that recurrent graph neural networks working with reals have the same expressive power in restriction to monadic second-order logic MSO as the graded modal substitution calculus. The proof is based on constructing distributed automata that capture all MSO-definable node properties over trees. We also consider some variants of the acceptance conditions.</description>

      <title>Beyond Value Iteration for Parity Games: Strategy Iteration with Universal Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.13338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.13338v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Parity games have witnessed several new quasi-polynomial algorithms since the breakthrough result of Calude et al. (STOC 2017). The combinatorial object underlying these approaches is a universal tree, as identified by Czerwi\'nski et al. (SODA 2019). By proving a quasi-polynomial lower bound on the size of a universal tree, they have highlighted a barrier that must be overcome by all existing approaches to attain polynomial running time. This is due to the existence of worst case instances which force these algorithms to explore a large portion of the tree.
  As an attempt to overcome this barrier, we propose a strategy iteration framework which can be applied on any universal tree. It is at least as fast as its value iteration counterparts, while allowing one to take bigger leaps in the universal tree. Our main technical contribution is an efficient method for computing the least fixed point of 1-player games. This is achieved via a careful adaptation of shortest path algorithms to the setting of ordered trees. By plugging in the universal tree of Jurdzi\'nski and Lazi\'c (LICS 2017), or the Strahler universal tree of Daviaud et al. (ICALP 2020), we obtain instantiations of the general framework that take time $O(mn^2\log n\log d)$ and $O(mn^2\log^3 n \log d)$ respectively per iteration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.03445v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show how the relatively initial or relatively terminal fixed points for a well-behaved functor $F$ form a pair of adjoint functors between $F$-coalgebras and $F$-algebras. We use the language of locally presentable categories to find sufficient conditions for existence of this adjunction. We show that relative fixed points may be characterized as (co)equalizers of the free (co)monad on $F$. In particular, when $F$ is a polynomial functor on $\mathsf{Set}$ the relative fixed points are a quotient or subset of the free term algebra or the cofree term coalgebra. We give examples of the relative fixed points for polynomial functors and an example which is the Sierpinski carpet. Lastly, we prove a general preservation result for relative fixed points.</description>

      <title>The categorical contours of the Chomsky-Sch\"utzenberger representation theorem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14703v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop fibrational perspectives on context-free grammars and on nondeterministic finite-state automata over categories and operads. A generalized CFG is a functor from a free colored operad (aka multicategory) generated by a pointed finite species into an arbitrary base operad: this encompasses classical CFGs by taking the base to be a certain operad constructed from a free monoid, as an instance of a more general construction of an \emph{operad of spliced arrows} $\mathcal{W}\,\mathcal{C}$ for any category $\mathcal{C}$. A generalized NFA is a functor from an arbitrary bipointed category or pointed operad satisfying the unique lifting of factorizations and finite fiber properties: this encompasses classical word automata and tree automata without $\epsilon$-transitions, but also automata over non-free categories and operads. We show that generalized context-free and regular languages satisfy suitable generalizations of many of the usual closure properties, and in particular we give a simple conceptual proof that context-free languages are closed under intersection with regular languages. Finally, we observe that the splicing functor $\mathcal{W} : Cat \to Oper$ admits a left adjoint $\mathcal{C}: Oper \to Cat$, which we call the \emph{contour category} construction since the arrows of $\mathcal{C}\,\mathcal{O}$ have a geometric interpretation as oriented contours of operations of $\mathcal{O}$. A direct consequence of the contour / splicing adjunction is that every pointed finite species induces a universal CFG generating a language of \emph{tree contour words.} This leads us to a generalization of the Chomsky-Sch\"utzenberger Representation Theorem, establishing that a subset of a homset $L \subseteq \mathcal{C}(A,B)$ is a CFL of arrows if and only if it is a functorial image of the intersection of a $\mathcal{C}$-chromatic tree contour language with a regular language.</description>

      <title>Certifying Lyapunov Stability of Black-Box Nonlinear Systems via Counterexample Guided Synthesis (Extended Version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00431v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Finding Lyapunov functions to certify the stability of control systems has been an important topic for verifying safety-critical systems. Most existing methods on finding Lyapunov functions require access to the dynamics of the system. Accurately describing the complete dynamics of a control system however remains highly challenging in practice. Latest trend of using learning-enabled control systems further reduces the transparency. Hence, a method for black-box systems would have much wider applications.
  Our work stems from the recent idea of sampling and exploiting Lipschitz continuity to approximate the unknown dynamics. Given Lipschitz constants, one can derive a non-statistical upper bounds on approximation errors; hence a strong certification on this approximation can certify the unknown dynamics. We significantly improve this idea by directly approximating the Lie derivative of Lyapunov functions instead of the dynamics. We propose a framework based on the learner-verifier architecture from Counterexample-Guided Inductive Synthesis (CEGIS). Our insight of combining regional verification conditions and counterexample-guided sampling enables a guided search for samples to prove stability region-by-region. Our CEGIS algorithm further ensures termination.
  Our numerical experiments suggest that it is possible to prove the stability of 2D and 3D systems with a few thousands of samples. Our visualization also reveals the regions where the stability is difficult to prove. In comparison with the existing black-box approach, our approach at the best case requires less than 0.01% of samples.</description>
