      <title>An alternative approach to several important systems in classical mechanics: energy factorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show how several important classical problems, with positive definite potential energy, can be solved by starting from the factorization of the total mechanical energy using complex numbers. In particular, we derive in a new way exact analytical solutions for: simple harmonic oscillator, vertical projectile motion, motion under a repulsive inverse cube force, and damped harmonic oscillator (with linear damping). We also show how this approach easily yields an excellent approximation of the energy decay and a new approximate analytical solution in the case of a weakly damped harmonic oscillator. Our derivations are suitable for undergraduate physics teaching as an alternative to solving Newton's equations of motion. In addition, we comment on the limitations of our approach, but also on the insights it provides and opportunities for further research.</description>

      <title>Multiple charge carrier species as a possible cause for triboelectric cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The tendency of materials to order in triboelectric series has prompted suggestions that contact electrification might have a single, unified underlying description. However, the possibility of triboelectric cycles, i.e. series that loop back onto themselves, is seemingly at odds with such a coherent description. In this work, we propose that if multiple charge carrying species are at play, both triboelectric series and cycles are possible. We show how series arise naturally if only a single charge carrier species is involved and if the driving mechanism is approach toward thermodynamic equilibrium, and simultaneously, that cycles are forbidden under such conditions. Suspecting multiple carriers might relax the situation, we affirm this is the case by explicit construction of a cycle involving two carriers, and then extend this to show how more complex cycles emerge. Our work highlights the importance of series/cycles towards determining the underlying mechanism(s) and carrier(s) in contact electrification.</description>

      <title>Relativity with or without light and Maxwell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19566v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The complex relationship between Einstein's second postulate and the Maxwell electromagnetic theory is elucidated. A simple deduction of the main results of the Ignatowski approach to the theory of relativity is given. The peculiar status of the principle of relativity among the Maxwellians is illustrated.</description>

      <title>Generalizing Shell Theorem to Constant Curvature Spaces in All Dimensions and Topologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20852v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A gravitational potential has the spherical property when the field outside any uniform spherical shell is indistinguishable from that of a point mass at the center. We present the general potentials that possess this property on constant curvature spaces, using the Euler-Poisson-Darboux identity for spherical means. Our results are consistent with known findings in flat three-dimensional space and reduce to Gurzadyan's cosmological theorem when the rescaling factor is exactly $1$. Our approach naturally extends to nontrivial spatial topologies.</description>

      <title>Dynamical symmetries of the anisotropic oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.14306v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is well known that the Hamiltonian of an $n$-dimensional isotropic oscillator admits an $SU(n)$ symmetry, making the system maximally superintegrable. However, the dynamical symmetries of the anisotropic oscillator are much more subtle. We introduce a novel set of canonical transformations that map an $n$-dimensional anisotropic oscillator to the corresponding isotropic problem. Consequently, the anisotropic oscillator is found to possess the same number of conserved quantities as the isotropic oscillator, making it maximally superintegrable too (commensurate case). The first integrals are explicitly calculated in the case of a two-dimensional anisotropic oscillator and remarkably, they admit closed-form expressions.</description>
