      <title>High-field Breakdown and Thermal Characterization of Indium Tin Oxide Transistors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Amorphous oxide semiconductors are gaining interest for logic and memory transistors compatible with low-temperature fabrication. However, their low thermal conductivity and heterogeneous interfaces suggest that their performance may be severely limited by self-heating, especially at higher power and device densities. Here, we investigate the high-field breakdown of amorphous indium tin oxide (ITO) transistors with scanning thermal microscopy (SThM) and multiphysics simulations. The ITO devices break irreversibly at channel temperatures of ~180 {\deg}C and ~340 {\deg}C on SiO${_2}$ and HfO${_2}$ substrates, respectively, but failure appears primarily caused by thermally-induced compressive strain near the device contacts. Combining SThM measurements with simulations allows us to estimate a thermal boundary conductance (TBC) of 35 ${\pm}$ 12 MWm${^-}$${^2}$K${^-}$${^1}$ for ITO on SiO${_2}$, and 51 ${\pm}$ 14 MWm${^-}$${^2}$K${^-}$${^1}$ for ITO on HfO${_2}$. The latter also enables significantly higher breakdown power due to better heat dissipation and closer thermal expansion matching. These findings provide valuable insights into the thermo-mechanical limitations of ITO devices, paving the way for more reliable and high-performance amorphous oxide transistors.</description>

      <title>Spectral tuning and nanoscale localization of single color centers in silicon via controllable strain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of color centers in silicon enables scalable quantum technologies by combining telecom-wavelength emission and compatibility with mature silicon fabrication. However, large-scale integration requires precise control of each emitter's optical transition to generate indistinguishable photons for quantum networking. Here, we demonstrate a foundry-fabricated photonic integrated circuit (PIC) combining suspended silicon waveguides with a microelectromechanical (MEMS) cantilever to apply local strain and spectrally tune individual G-centers. Applying up to 35 V between the cantilever and the substrate induces a reversible wavelength shift of the zero-phonon line exceeding 100 pm, with no loss in brightness. Moreover, by modeling the strain-induced shifts with a `digital twin' physical model, we achieve vertical localization of color centers with sub-3 nm vertical resolution, directly correlating their spatial position, dipole orientation, and spectral behavior. This method enables on-demand, low-power control of emission spectrum and nanoscale localization of color centers, advancing quantum networks on a foundry-compatible platform.</description>

      <title>Magneto-optical polarisation texturing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Left and right circularly polarized transverse electromagnetic waves propagate at slightly different speeds in a magnetic material leading to a polarization rotation by an amount proportional to the projection of the magnetic field along the direction of the wave propagation. We show how this magneto-optical effect can serve as a vectorial polarization shaper if the input mode is either a radially-polarised or an azimuthally-polarised Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) mode. The specific polarization map of the output field can be achieved by choosing appropriately the magnetic material and/or its geometry. We show further that when the LG beam waist is comparable to the wavelength the fields are no longer purely transverse but acquire an additional longitudinal (axial) component. We demonstrate how this modifies the polarisation texturing.</description>

      <title>Flexoelectricity causes surface piezoelectric-like effects in dielectrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study the surface effects that bulk flexoelectric models in finite samples exhibit. We first show that when the body is infinite, flexoelectric materials do not exhibit electromechanical response under homogeneous loading. However, when the size of the body is finite, due to the symmetry-breaking nature of surfaces, homogeneous loading (mechanical or electrical) can cause an electromechanical response near the surfaces. We obtain closed-form solutions for finite samples under different electromechanical loading conditions, and show that the electromechanical response caused by the bulk flexoelectric effect is reminiscent of surface piezoelectricity, causing boundary layers in certain components of the strains and/or electric fields near the free surfaces.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Dimensional Cathodoluminescence Detector with 3D Printed Micro-Optics on a Fiber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cathodoluminescence, i.e. the radiation caused by the interaction of high-energy electron beams with matter, has gained a major interest in the analysis of minerals, semiconductors, and plasmonic resonances in nanoparticles. This radiation can either be coherent or incoherent, depending on the underlying interaction mechanism of electrons with nanostructured matter. Thanks to their high spatial resolution and large spectral excitation bandwidth, the evanescent near-field of a moving electron in a scanning electron microscope is used to probe locally photonic modes at the nanoscale, e.g., exciton or plasmon polaritons. The properties of these excitations can be analyzed through both spectral and temporal statistics of the emitted light. Here, we report on the technical design and implementation of a novel fiber-based cathodoluminescence detector for a scanning electron microscope. Moreover, we present first characterization measurements to prove the ability for raster scanning the cathodoluminescence emission using optical fibers with 3D printed micro-optics. The functionality and flexibility of this fiber-based detector is highlighted by resolving the spatial far-field distribution of the excited light, as well as cathodoluminescence spectroscopy and time-correlated single photon counting. Our findings pave the way for a better understanding of the characteristic of the light emitted from electron beams interacting with nanostructures and two-dimensional materials.</description>

      <title>Strain activation of localized states in WSe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11128v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Single-photon emission centers generated by controlled atomic force microscopy (AFM) indentation in monolayer WSe\(_2\) on a flexible polymer substrate are explored for applications in quantum technologies. Here, we study the response of these emitters to the polymer substrate's strain state, which is controlled by selecting the indentation force and by gradually thermally annealing the samples. In the indented areas, we observe sharp new photoluminescence (PL) peaks in the regions 1.62--1.68 eV and 1.70--1.73 eV, characterized by sublinear power dependence and spectral wandering. We find that these peaks arise only when the indentation force exceeds a few \(\mu\)N and generally redshift as the applied force increases. Conversely, after thermal annealing (\(T &lt; 60^{\circ}\)C), WSe\(_2\) experiences strain relaxation, leading to a blueshift of the peaks' spectral position and their ultimate disappearance. Our analysis of the peaks' positions vs. strain allows us to draw several conclusions about the nature of these emission. Specifically, we elucidate the roles of excitonic confinement and hybridization between free excitons and defect-related states, a process activated by the strain level. Overall, our approach suggests that the energy of localized emitters may be controlled via strain engineering.</description>
