      <title>Performance Reconstruction of Eco-Friendly Gas Mixtures for Improved Resistive Plate Chambers at GIF++ Using Geant4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A macroscopic reconstruction is developed to infer iRPC performance using Geant4 observables and one experimental anchor. The Geant4 energy deposition is used to estimate the primary ionization yield, while the efficiency turn-on is modeled through an induced-charge description encoded in an effective gain G(E). The absolute scale is fixed by calibrating the standard CMS mixture to its GIF++ efficiency curve and extracting macroscopic Townsend parameters (A,B). The same procedure is propagated to four alternative mixtures, including two HFO and CO2 eco-friendly blends, to reconstruct efficiency curves and working points, enabling detector mixture screening without microscopic transport inputs.</description>

      <title>Liquid Handling of the JUNO Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Filling, Overflow, and Circulation (FOC) system is a critical subsystem of the Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO), responsible for the safe handling of the Liquid Scintillator (LS) and water throughout the detector's commissioning and operational lifetime. This paper details the design and operation of the FOC system, which accomplished the filling of the world's largest LS detector--taking 45 days for water (6.4*10^4 m^3) and 200 days for LS (2.3*10^4 m^3). Throughout water filling, the liquid level difference between the Central Detector and Water Pool was rigorously maintained within safety limits. During LS filling, level control achieved +/-2 cm precision with flow regulation within +/-0.5% of setpoints. An automated control system based on Programmable Logic Controllers and the Experimental Physics and Industrial Control System framework ensured reliable operation. The system preserved LS radiopurity, maintaining 222Rn below 1 mBq/m^3 during filling and achieving 238U/232Th concentrations below 10^-16 g/g. The successful commissioning and operation of the FOC system have established it as an indispensable foundation for the stable long-term operation of the JUNO detector.</description>

      <title>An LNGS Mobile Neutron Detector (ALMOND): Mapping Ambient Neutron Background of Gran Sasso National Laboratory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In deep underground laboratories, environmental neutrons, which are produced at the cavern walls, introduce a source of background to rare event searches. The flux and spectrum of the ambient neutrons vary considerably with time and location. Precise knowledge of this background is necessary to devise shielding and veto mechanisms, thereby improving the sensitivity of the neutron-susceptible underground experiments. ALMOND, currently in operation, is a low-flux mobile neutron spectrometer developed for the LNGS underground laboratory to measure the ambient neutron background of the entire facility. In this paper, an overview of the design, construction and calibration of ALMOND is given. Furthermore, the result of the first underground neutron measurement is shown along with an outlook for future measurements and analyses.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Machine-Learning Particle Identification for the ePIC Proximity-Focusing RICH</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a machine-learning-based particle-identification study for the proximity-focusing Ring Imaging Cherenkov (pfRICH) detector of the ePIC experiment at the Electron-Ion Collider. Operating in the backward region ($-3.5 \lesssim \eta \lesssim -1.5$), the pfRICH is designed to achieve at least $3\sigma$ separation among pions, kaons, and protons up to $7,\mathrm{GeV}/c$ for Semi-Inclusive Deep Inelastic Scattering measurements. Using a standalone Geant4 simulation of the pfRICH, we develop a hybrid machine-learning approach that combines convolutional neural-network-based feature extraction with gradient-boosted decision-tree classifiers. This method significantly enhances Cherenkov-ring pattern recognition and improves particle-separation performance, demonstrating the effectiveness of hybrid machine-learning techniques for next-generation Cherenkov detectors at the EIC.</description>

      <title>Demonstrating sub-picometer non-reciprocity levels in the Three-Backlink Experiment for LISA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The current planned space-based gravitational-wave detectors require a bidirectional optical connection, referred to as Backlink, between two adjacent optical benches to provide a mutual phase reference for the local interferometric measurements. However, if the Backlink shows asymmetry between the two propagation directions, the effective optical pathlengths of the counter-propagating beams can introduce a differential phase noise, called non-reciprocity, into the main interferometric measurement that will limit the achievable accuracy in time-delay interferometry (TDI) post-processing. Hence, it is important to understand the properties of the Backlink to ensure that it will not compromise the interferometric detection. The Three-Backlink Experiment (3BL), which consists of an optical test facility with two rotatable benches, was designed under the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) framework to study the performance of three Backlink configurations: two fiber-based and one free-beam scheme. In this paper, we report recent experimental results from the 3BL. We describe the commissioning and the subsequent noise mitigation. We achieve a setup noise floor below $1\text{ pm}\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$ across most of the LISA measurement band, and provide an understanding of the current technical limitations. With this low-noise baseline, we measured the performance of the three Backlink implementations under non-rotational conditions. We show that all three Backlinks reach sub-picometer non-reciprocity levels across most of the frequency band, with the remaining part dominated by the mentioned testbed noise. This enabled us to conduct a preliminary study of the Backlink inherent noise, where we emphasized on the backscatter noise intrinsic to a straightforward fiber-based Backlink, as this is the current baseline for LISA.</description>

      <title>Construction techniques and commissioning of the Three-Backlink Experiment for the LISA mission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Designed to detect gravitational waves in the lower-frequency band, the space mission LISA will open a new window to astronomy after its launch in the 2030s. Each LISA spacecraft houses two optical benches that require the exchange of a phase reference between them via an optical connection, called a Backlink. Here we present the construction and commissioning of an ultra-stable quasi-monolithic optical testbed to investigate different Backlink implementations: a direct fiber, a frequency-separated fiber, and a free-beam link, compared in the Three-Backlink Experiment. Dedicated alignment techniques crucial for the construction of these optical benches are presented together with the development of a high-precision beam alignment and measurement tool - a Calibrated Quadrant Photodiode Singleton. An upper limit for the performance of all three investigated Backlink schemes, as determined by initial experiments, can be set at a $15\text{pm}/\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$-equivalent level within the LISA band, spanning 0.1mHz to 1Hz. Our measurements were able to verify the successful construction and commissioning of this very complex interferometer as an interferometric laboratory testbed for LISA. We find no limitations due to the construction on the here reported performance levels. Our results can support the construction of high-precision metrology testbeds for space-based laser interferometry for future gravitational wave or geodesy missions.</description>

      <title>Configurable {\gamma} Photon Spectrometer to Enable Precision Radioguided Tumor Resection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Surgical tumor resection aims to remove all cancer cells in the tumor margin and at centimeter-scale depths below the tissue surface. During surgery, microscopic clusters of disease are intraoperatively difficult to visualize and are often left behind, significantly increasing the risk of cancer recurrence. Radioguided surgery (RGS) has shown the ability to selectively tag cancer cells with gamma ({\gamma}) photon emitting radioisotopes to identify them, but require a mm-scale {\gamma} photon spectrometer to localize the position of these cells in the tissue margin (i.e., a function of incident {\gamma} photon energy) with high specificity. Here we present a 9.9 mm2 integrated circuit (IC)-based {\gamma} spectrometer implemented in 180 nm CMOS, to enable the measurement of single {\gamma} photons and their incident energy with sub-keV energy resolution. We use small 2 2 um reverse-biased diodes that have low depletion region capacitance, and therefore produce millivolt-scale voltage signals in response to the small charge generated by incident {\gamma} photons. A low-power energy spectrometry method is implemented by measuring the decay time it takes for the generated voltage signal to settle back to DC after a {\gamma} detection event, instead of measuring the voltage drop directly. This spectrometry method is implemented in three different pixel architectures that allow for configurable pixel sensitivity, energy-resolution, and energy dynamic range based on the widely heterogenous surgical and patient presentation in RGS. The spectrometer was tested with three common {\gamma}-emitting radioisotopes (64Cu, 133Ba, 177Lu), and is able to resolve activities down to 1 uCi with sub-keV energy resolution and 1.315 MeV energy dynamic range, using 5-minute acquisitions.</description>
