      <title>Bound dark energy: Particle origin of dark energy with DESI BAO and DES supernova data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent findings from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) indicate a preference for dynamical dark energy at a significance level above $2.5 \sigma$, with baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) combined with cosmic microwave background (CMB) data and Type Ia supernovae (SNe) data, favoring a time dependent equation of state $w(z)$ rather than the cosmological constant ($w = -1$). We introduce the Bound Dark Energy (BDE) model, in which dark energy arises from the lightest meson field $\phi$ in a dark SU(3) gauge group, developing dynamically through non perturbative interactions. Governed by an inverse power law potential $V(\phi) = \Lambda_c^{4+2/3}\phi^{-2/3}$, BDE features no dark energy free parameters: one less than $\Lambda$CDM ($\Lambda$) and three less than the $ w_{0}w_{a} $CDM ($ w_{0}, w_{a},\Lambda $) models. By integrating DESI BAO measurements, CMB data and Dark Energy Survey SN Ia distance data collected during the fifth year, BDE demonstrates a reduction of $42$ and $37$ percent in the reduced $\chi^{2}_{BAO}$ as well as lower AIC and BIC values compared to the $w_{0}w_{a}$CDM and $\Lambda$CDM models, respectively, while maintaining a comparable fit for both type Ia supernovae and the cosmic microwave background data. Although the ($w_{0},w_{a}$) contour in BDE is 10,000 times smaller than that found in the $w_{0}w_{a}$CDM model, the BDE model suggests a dynamical dark energy scenario with precise values of $w_{0}=$-0.9301 $\pm$ 0.0004 and $w_{a}=$ -0.8085 $\pm$ 0.0053 while providing a consistency on the six Planck and derived parameters at the 1$\sigma$ level between BDE, $\Lambda$CDM and $w_{0}w_{a}$CDM models. The critical parameters condensation energy scale $\Lambda_{c} = 43.806 \pm 0.190$ eV and epoch $a_{c} = (2.497 \pm 0.011) \times 10^{-6}$ are consistent with predictions from high energy physics.</description>

      <title>Cosmological observational tests in the JWST Era I: angular size - redshift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study is denoted to the cosmological "angular size - redshift" test. An analysis is performed of the angular and linear sizes of galaxies from the new ASTRODEEP-JWST catalogue, which contains over 500,000 objects at high redshifts (up to ~20 photometrically determined and up to ~14 spectroscopically determined). For the calculations, 6 860 galaxies with reliably determined spectroscopic redshifts and 319,771 galaxies with known photometric redshifts were used. The linear sizes of galaxies were computed within the framework of two cosmological models - the standard ({\Lambda}CDM) model and one of the static models (the so-called "tired light" model). We shown that within the framework of the {\Lambda}CDM model, a significant evolution of the linear sizes of galaxies is observed, with the rate of the evolution closely matching the rate of the cosmic expansion. In contrast, in the static model, the characteristic linear sizes of a galaxies exhibit almost no evolution with increasing z.</description>

      <title>From South to North: Leveraging Ground-Based LATs for Full-Sky CMB Delensing and Constraints on $r$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Delensing--the process of mitigating the lensing-induced B-mode contamination in cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations--will be a pivotal challenge for next-generation CMB experiments seeking to detect primordial gravitational waves (PGWs) through B-mode polarization. This process requires an accurate lensing tracer, which can be obtained either through internal reconstruction from high-resolution CMB observations or from external large-scale structure (LSS) surveys. Ground-based large-aperture telescopes (LATs) are crucial for internal reconstruction, yet existing and planned facilities are confined to the southern hemisphere, limiting effective delensing to that region. In this work, we assess the impact of introducing a northern hemisphere LAT, assumed to be situated near AliCPT (hence termed Ali-like LAT, or LATN), on delensing performance and PGW detection, using simulations. Our baseline setup includes a space-based small-aperture mission (LiteBIRD-like, SAT) and a southern LAT (SO-like, LATS). External LSS tracers, which have been shown to play an important role in delensing before the availability of ultra-sensitive polarization data, are also considered. We find that southern-hemisphere internal delensing reduces the uncertainty in r by approximately 21% compared to the no-delensing case. Adding LATN enables full-sky internal delensing, achieving a further ~19% reduction--comparable to that from including LSS tracers (~17%). Once LATN is included, the marginal benefit of LSS tracers drops to ~10%. These results highlight the significant role of LATN in advancing delensing capabilities and improving PGW constraints.</description>

      <title>Directional Neutrino Bursts from Spinning and Moving Primordial Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that primordial black holes (PBHs) with significant spin and bulk motion produce sharply collimated neutrino bursts from Hawking evaporation, arising from the interplay of spin-induced angular anisotropy and relativistic Doppler boosting. This effect shifts the neutrino spectrum into the multi-GeV to hundreds of GeV range, where atmospheric backgrounds drop steeply, and enhances the flux by orders of magnitude within a narrow forward cone. We compute the full lab-frame neutrino distribution and derive updated constraints on PBH number density from non-observation of such bursts in IceCube and KM3NeT. Our results identify directional high-energy neutrino bursts as a distinctive, testable signature of spinning PBHs, providing a complementary probe of the PBH dark matter hypothesis and Hawking radiation.</description>

      <title>Future Parameter Constraints from Weak Lensing CMB and Galaxy Lensing Power- and Bispectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Upcoming stage 4 surveys, such as the Simons Observatory, LSST, and Euclid, are poised to measure weak gravitational lensing of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and galaxies with unprecedented precision. While the power spectrum is the standard statistic used to analyze weak lensing data, non-Gaussianity from non-linear structure growth encodes additional cosmological information in higher-order statistics. We forecast the ability of future surveys to constrain cosmological parameters using the weak lensing power spectrum and bispectrum from both CMB and galaxy surveys, including their cross-correlations. We consider an eight-parameter model ($\Lambda$CDM + $\sum m_\nu$ + $w_0$) and assess constraints for stage 4 survey specifications. In the absence of systematics, both the CMB and galaxy lensing bispectra are found to be detectable at high signal-to-noise. We test two priors: a ''strong'' one based on constraints from CMB temperature and $E$-mode polarization anisotropies, and a ''weak'' one with minimal assumptions. With the weak prior, the bispectrum significantly improves parameter constraints by breaking degeneracies. For strong priors, improvements are more limited, especially for the CMB bispectrum. On small scales, where non-linear effects dominate, the bispectrum's constraining power can rival that of the power spectrum. We also find strong synergy between CMB and galaxy lensing; combining both probes leads to tighter constraints, particularly on neutrino mass. It was recently found that the CMB lensing bispectrum is strongly affected by the Born approximation, so we also consider post-Born corrections but find that our main conclusions remain the same. These results highlight the potential of higher-order lensing statistics and motivate further work on neglected effects such as non-Gaussian covariance, instrumental systematics, and baryonic feedback.</description>

      <title>A Comparative Study of Halo Mass Estimates from Group Catalogs and Lensing Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compare halo mass estimates from three galaxy group catalogs (redMaPPer, Yang21, and Zou21) with those derived from gravitational lensing measurements. Each catalog employs distinct methodologies, including mass-richness relations, abundance matching, and luminosity-based calibration. A linear correlation is observed between catalog-estimated and lensing-derived masses. The redMaPPer catalog shows the best agreement, especially for lower-redshift groups, with minor deviations in higher-redshift bins. Yang21 is the only catalog containing low mass groups, which gives a reasonably good mass estimation, except for the lowest mass bin. Cross-matched groups between redMaPPer and Yang21 reveal the former catalog provides more accurate mass estimation, while the Yang21 makes under-estimation of halo mass for those sharing the central galaxy with redMaPPer and over-estimation of halo mass for those with different center determination with redMaPPer and for the unique Yang21 groups. These findings emphasize the importance of redshift-dependent calibration and refined group definitions for accurate mass estimation.</description>

      <title>Superhorizon fluctuations and the cosmic dipole problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent observations have identified a significant 4.9$\sigma$ tension between the cosmic dipole inferred from galaxy number counts and that derived from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), suggesting a potential deviation from the cosmological principle. This work investigates whether superhorizon isocurvature perturbations in cold dark matter (CDM) can account for this discrepancy. We demonstrate that, unlike adiabatic modes which cancel at leading order, superhorizon isocurvature modes can generate an intrinsic CMB dipole without significantly affecting galaxy number counts, thereby explaining the observed mismatch. We explore both single-mode and continuous-spectrum cases, focusing on two concrete models: a nearly scale-invariant power-law spectrum with a UV cutoff and axion-induced isocurvature perturbations. For the axion scenario, we show that if the radial mode evolves during inflation, the resulting perturbations can match the required amplitude while evading current CMB constraints. Our analysis constrains the self-coupling of associated potential for the axion to the range $10^{-9} &lt; \lambda &lt; 4 \times 10^{-9}$. These findings offer a viable solution to the dipole tension and may serve as indirect evidence for axion dark matter.</description>

      <title>The Concordance of Weak Lensing and Escape Velocity Mass Estimates for Galaxy Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm, the masses of the galaxy clusters inferred using background galaxies via weak-lensing shear should agree with the masses measured using the galaxy projected radius-velocity phase-space data via the escape velocity profile. However, prior work indicates that the correlation between caustic-inferred escape masses and weak lensing masses is statistically consistent with zero. Based on recent advancements in the measurement of the escape edge and its physical interpretation, we conduct a revised comparison between these two independent mass inference techniques for 46 galaxy clusters between $0.05 \le z \le 0.3$ and over an order of magnitude in mass, $14.4 \le {\rm log}_{10} M/M_{\odot} \le 15.4$. We find excellent agreement, with a correlation ($0.679^{+0.046}_{-0.049}$), and a mean relative difference between the two mass measurements consistent with zero (0.02 $\pm$ 0.02 dex). The observed scatter between these direct mass estimates is 0.17 dex and is consistent with the reported individual mass errors, suggesting that there is no need for an additional intrinsic component. We discuss the important practical consequences of these results, focusing on the systematic uncertainties inherent to each technique, and their implications for cosmology.</description>

      <title>PyBird-JAX: Accelerated inference in large-scale structure with model-independent emulation of one-loop galaxy power spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present $\texttt{PyBird-JAX}$, a differentiable, $\texttt{JAX}$-based implementation of $\texttt{PyBird}$, using internal neural network emulators to accelerate computationally costly operations for rapid large-scale structure (LSS) analysis. $\texttt{PyBird-JAX}$ computes one-loop EFTofLSS predictions for redshift-space galaxy power spectrum multipoles in 1.2 ms on a CPU and 0.2 ms on a GPU, achieving 3-4 orders of magnitude speed-up over $\texttt{PyBird}$. The emulators take a compact spline-based representation of the input linear power spectrum $P(k)$ as feature vectors, making the approach applicable to a wide range of cosmological models. We rigorously validate its accuracy against large-volume simulations and on BOSS data, including cosmologies not explicitly represented in the training set. Leveraging automatic differentiation, $\texttt{PyBird-JAX}$ supports Fisher forecasting, Taylor expansion of model predictions, gradient-based searches, and vectorised ensemble sampling. Interfaced with a variety of samplers and Boltzmann solvers, $\texttt{PyBird-JAX}$ provides a high-performance, end-to-end inference pipeline. Combined with a symbolic-$P(k)$ generator, a typical Stage-4 LSS MCMC converges in minutes on a GPU. Our results demonstrate that $\texttt{PyBird-JAX}$ delivers the precision and speed required for upcoming LSS surveys, opening the door to accelerated cosmological inference with minimal accuracy loss and no pretraining. In a companion paper [1], we put $\texttt{PyBird-JAX}$ to use in achieving LSS marginalised constraints free from volume projection effects through non-flat measures.</description>

      <title>Debiasing inference in large-scale structure with non-flat volume measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Increasingly large parameter spaces, used to more accurately model precision observables in physics, can paradoxically lead to large deviations in the inferred parameters of interest -- a bias known as volume projection effects -- when marginalising over many nuisance parameters. For posterior distributions that admit a Laplace expansion, we show that this artefact of Bayesian inference can be mitigated by defining expectation values with respect to a non-flat volume measure, such that the posterior mean becomes unbiased on average. We begin by finding a measure that ensures the mean is an unbiased estimator of the mode. Although the mode itself, as we rediscover, is biased under sample averaging, this choice yields the least biased estimator due to a cancellation we clarify. We further explain why bias in marginal posteriors can appear relatively large, yet remains correctable, when the number of nuisances is large. To demonstrate our approach, we present mock analyses in large-scale structure (LSS) wherein cosmological parameters are subject to large projection effects (at the 1-2$\sigma$ level) under a flat measure, that are however recovered at high fidelity ($&lt;0.1\sigma$) when estimated using non-flat counterparts. Our cosmological analyses are enabled by $\texttt{PyBird-JAX}$, a fast, differentiable pipeline for LSS developed in our companion paper [1].</description>

      <title>SPLENDOR: a novel detector platform to search for light dark matter with narrow-gap semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the design and current status of SPLENDOR, a novel detector platform that combines narrow-gap semiconductor targets with low-noise charge readout to achieve sensitivity to dark matter energy deposits well below the eV scale. SPLENDOR is designed to be a modular and scalable system able to accommodate different target materials and signal readout technologies. SPLENDOR's present strategy entails: (i) the use of strongly correlated f-electron semiconductors with anisotropic electronic structures to enable not only sub-eV energy thresholds, but also directional sensitivity to the incoming dark matter flux, allowing for signal-background discrimination via daily modulation, and (ii) custom charge readout based on cryogenic high-electron-mobility transistor (cryoHEMT) amplifiers approaching single-electron resolution. We report on the selection and characterization of Eu$_5$In$_2$Sb$_6$ as the target material for SPLENDOR's first prototype detector, as well as the development and calibration of the prototype amplifier chain, achieving a measured charge resolution of 20$\pm$7 electrons in silicon test samples, consistent with predicted performance. This provides a demonstration of the detector architecture, which is now ready for deployment in a dark matter search campaign to deliver SPLENDOR's first science results. Finally, we present estimates of sensitivity reach in the parameter space of athermally produced relic dark matter under high- and low-background environments, and for various amplifier technology upgrades with increasing performance, including planned quantum sensing upgrades in order to achieve our ultimate goal of sub-electron resolution in optimized systems. SPLENDOR provides a novel approach to dark matter detection, combining quantum sensing with material's design to open new avenues of exploration in the sub-MeV mass range of dark matter parameter space.</description>

Abstract: Dark objects streaming into the solar system can be probed using gravitational wave (GW) experiments through the perturbations that they would induce on the detector test masses. In this work, we study the detectability of the resulting gravitational signal for a number of current and future GW observatories. Dark matter in the form of clumps or primordial black holes with masses in the range $10^7$-$10^{11}\,\rm{g}$ can be detected with the proposed DECIGO experiment.</description>

      <title>Efficient semi-analytic modelling of Pop III star formation from Cosmic Dawn to Reionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quest to find the first stars has driven astronomers across cosmic time, from hopes to identify their signatures in their heyday at cosmic dawn to deep searches for their remnants in our local neighborhood. Such work crucially relies on robust theoretical modelling to understand when and where we expect pristine star formation to have occurred and survived. To that end, here we introduce an analytic bathtub for cosmic dawn, the abcd model, to efficiently trace the formation of the first stars from their birth through the first billion years of our universe's history, jointly following star formation out of pristine and metal-enriched gas over time. Informed by the latest theoretical developments in our understanding of star formation in molecular cooling halos, metal mixing, and early galaxies, we expand pre-existing minimal models for galaxy formation to include Population III stars and many of the processes - both internal and environmental - affecting their evolution, while remaining fast and interpretable. With this framework, we can bridge the gap between numerical simulations and previous semi-analytic models, as we self-consistently follow star formation in dark matter halos from the minihalo era through the epoch of reionization, finding that, under plausible physical conditions, pristine star formation can persist at a high level in the presence of Pop II star formation down to $z\sim 5$, but is limited to the most massive halos. We highlight areas of theoretical uncertainty in the physics underpinning Pop III star formation and demonstrate the effects of this uncertainty first on individual star formation histories and subsequently bracketing the range of global star formation levels we expect. Finally, we leverage this model to make preliminary observable predictions, generating forecasts for high-$z$ luminosity functions, transient rates, and the 21-cm global signal.</description>

      <title>Testing the AGN unified model with simulated emission lines from the circumgalactic medium (CGM)</title>

Abstract: The CGM around unobscured AGN has received much attention in recent years. Comparatively, nebulae associated with obscured AGN are less studied. Here, we simulate the Ly$\alpha$, H$\alpha$, and HeII nebulae around the two types of AGN at $z=2-3$ with ten massive systems from the FIRE simulations based on the unified model to show their differences and to test if they can be used to constrain the AGN model. We post-process the data with the CLOUDY and the Ly$\alpha$ radiative transfer code, RASCAS. Overall, we find that the Ly$\alpha$ nebulae around the unobscured AGN (type-I nebulae) and obscured AGN (type-II nebulae) do not exhibit significant differences in the luminosity, area, and HeII/Ly$\alpha$ when the simulated cutout is set to the halo virial radius. Whereas, the type-II nebulae exhibit less symmetric morphologies, flatter surface brightness profiles, and larger emission line widths (at $R\geq 10$ kpc) than those of the type-I nebulae. These nebulae properties exhibit complicated correlations with the AGN, indicating that nebulae observations can be applied to constrain the AGN engine. However, independent observations on nebulae in the mentioned emissions are insufficient to test the unified model as a priori in observations is not possible to know the direction and opening angle of the ionization cone. We prompt that the joint observations of Ly$\alpha$ nebulae and radio jets can help to reveal the ionization cone to probe the unified model. Our calculations suggest that this method requires $\geq 75$ type-II Ly$\alpha$ nebulae with current instruments to reach a confidence level of $\geq 95\%$.</description>

      <title>Binary Neutron Star Mergers: Multi-Messenger Systematics and Prospects with Next-Generation Facilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-messenger astronomy was galvanized by the detection of gravitational waves (GWs) from the binary neutron star (BNS) merger GW170817 and electromagnetic (EM) emission from the subsequent kilonova and short gamma ray burst. Maximizing multi-messenger constraints on these systems requires combining models of the progenitors and products of BNS mergers within a single framework in anticipation of future GW and EM detectors. We demonstrate how combining models of different aspects of the BNS progenitor-merger-remnant system into a full multi-messenger modeling pipeline reveals insight into modeling challenges that will need to be addressed in the coming decade of multi-messenger astronomy. Motivated by GW170817, this combined model relates the progenitor astrophysics of a BNS population with their GW observability and localizability, kilonova light curves, gamma-ray burst afterglow flux, and kilonova remnant evolution. We find joint correlations between the GW and EM observables that depend on a complicated interplay between modeling assumptions and theoretical uncertainties. Next generation detectors will generically provide multi-messenger constraints on BNSs with median GW network signal-to-noise ratio $\approx 10$, median of the 90$^{\rm th}$ percentile sky area $\approx 10$ sq. deg., and kilonova $i$-band apparent magnitudes ranging from $\approx 33$ to $23$. We find no more than 4\% of the BNSs are simultaneously detectable by a network of two Cosmic Explorers and one Einstein Telescope and by the Roman and Rubin telescopes for 55 and 180 sec. exposures in a $K$-like band and $i$ and $g$ bands, respectively. We discuss key modeling assumptions that will be transmitted as multi-messenger systematics in the analysis of future datasets, such as uncertain astrophysical processes of binary populations and the nuclear equation of state for tests of nuclear physics and dark matter.</description>

      <title>Gravitational lensing of fast radio bursts: prospects for probing microlens populations in lensing galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational lensing by a stellar microlens of mass $M$ forms two images separated by micro-arcseconds on the sky and has a time delay of $2\times10^{-5}(M/{\rm M_\odot})$ seconds. Although we cannot resolve such micro-images in the sky, they could be resolved in time if the source is a fast radio burst (FRB). In this work, we study the magnification ($|\mu|$) and time delay~($t_d$) distributions of micro-images led by different microlens populations. We find that, in microlensing of typical strongly lensed (macro-)images in galaxy lenses, micro-images stemmed from a population of stellar mass microlenses in the $[0.08, 1.5]\:{\rm M_\odot}$ range and a second (dark) microlens population in $[10^{-3} - 10^{-2}]\:{\rm M_\odot}$ range reside in different parts of $|\mu|-t_d$ plane. For the global minimum macro-image, due to low stellar mass density, we find that the stellar population leads to peaks in autocorrelation at ${&gt;}10^{-6}$ seconds, whereas the secondary population leads to peaks at ${&lt;}10^{-6}$ seconds, allowing us to differentiate different microlens populations. However, an increase in stellar density introduces new peaks at ${&lt;}10^{-6}$ seconds, which can pollute the inference about the presence of multiple microlens populations. In addition, we also show that the number of micro-images, hence the number of peaks in the autocorrelation, is also sensitive to the underlying stellar mass function, allowing us to constrain the stellar initial mass function (IMF) with FRB microlesning in the future. This work is a first step towards using FRB lensing to probe the microlens population within strong lenses, and more detailed studies are required to assess the effect of various uncertainties that we only discussed qualitatively.</description>

      <title>Confronting Inflation and Reheating with Observations: Improved Predictions Beyond Slow-Roll</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20307v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the latest observational data, we constrain the inflationary dynamics and the subsequent reheating epoch. Predictions for both phases can be significantly improved by employing numerically computed results compared to the slow-roll approximations. These results enable a more accurate reassessment of the observational viability of inflationary models, provide tighter constraints on the reheating history, and help lift the degeneracies in the predictions of inflation and reheating dynamics. Given current observational bounds, this enables a more accurate understanding of the early universe physics.</description>

      <title>Fuzzy dark matter soliton as gravitational lens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Schr\"odinger-Poisson (SP) equations predict fuzzy dark matter (FDM) solitons. Given the FDM mass $\sim10^{-20}\rm~{eV}/c^2$, the FDM soliton in the Milky Way is massive $\sim 10^7~M_{\odot}$ but diffuse $\sim 10{\rm~pc}$. Therefore, this FDM soliton can serve as a gravitational lens for gravitational waves (GWs) with frequency $\sim10^{-8}{\rm~Hz}$. In this paper, we investigate its gravitational lensing effects by numerical simulation of the propagation of GWs through it. We find that the maximum magnification factor of GWs is very small $\sim10^{-4}$, but the corresponding magnification zone is huge $\sim6{\rm~pc}$ for FDM with mass equal to $8^{-21}\rm~{eV}/c^2$. Consequently, this small magnification factor in that large magnification zone means a small antisotropy of $\sim10^{-4}$ over a large solid angle in the GW background, even though this antisotropy is out of the sensitivity of the pulsar timing arrays today.</description>

Abstract: We present a set-based machine learning framework that infers posterior distributions of galaxy cluster masses from projected galaxy dynamics. Our model combines Deep Sets and conditional normalizing flows to incorporate both positional and velocity information of member galaxies to predict residual corrections to the $M$-$\sigma$ relation for improved interpretability. Trained on the Uchuu-UniverseMachine simulation, our approach significantly reduces scatter and provides well-calibrated uncertainties across the full mass range compared to traditional dynamical estimates.</description>

      <title>Dark photon dark matter from flattened axion potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dark photons can be resonantly produced in the early universe via their coupling to an oscillating axion field. However, this mechanism typically requires large axion-dark photon couplings or some degree of fine-tuning. In this work, we present a new scenario in which efficient dark photon production arises from axion potentials that are shallower than quadratic at large field values. For moderately large initial misalignment angles, the oscillation of the axion field can trigger either efficient dark photon production or strong axion self-resonance via parametric resonance. When self-resonance dominates and disrupts the field's homogeneity, we show that oscillons -- localized, oscillating axion field configurations -- naturally form and can sustain continued dark photon production, provided the coupling is $\gtrsim \mathcal O(1)$. For dark photon mass up to three orders of magnitude below the axion mass, the produced dark photons can account for a significant fraction of the present-day dark matter. We support this scenario with numerical lattice simulations of a benchmark model. Our results further motivate experimental searches for ultralight dark photon dark matter. The simulation code is publicly available at https://github.com/hongyi18/AxionDarkPhotonSimulator.</description>

      <title>Maximal parameter space of sterile neutrino dark matter with lepton asymmetries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large lepton flavor asymmetries with zero total lepton asymmetry could be generated in the Early Universe. They are loosely constrained by current observations, being washed out at MeV temperatures by neutrino oscillations. We show that such lepton flavor asymmetries open up a new parameter space for sterile neutrino dark matter, consistent with all observational bounds. To this end, we construct the semi-classical Boltzmann equation for sterile neutrinos applicable in the case of arbitrarily large lepton asymmetries, and confirm its validity by quantum kinetic equations. This way, we derive the maximal parameter space for sterile neutrino dark matter with lepton asymmetries. The allowed range of sterile neutrinos' squared couplings extends by up to two orders of magnitude across a 5-70 keV mass range, and may be testable by X-ray, structure formation, and upcoming CMB observations.</description>

      <title>Do Ultra-Diffuse Galaxies Follow the Globular Cluster-Halo Mass Relation?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20687v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The stellar mass-halo mass relation and the globular cluster (GC) number-halo mass relation are two scaling relations that relate fundamental properties of normal galaxies. Ultra-Diffuse Galaxies (UDGs), some of which, have rich GC systems and relatively low stellar masses can not follow the mean trend of both relations simultaneously; it is thus important to understand which relationship is followed by UDGs. Using independent halo masses determined from kinematic fitting to large radii, we identify three UDGs and two UDG-like galaxies from the literature and examine which scaling relation they follow. We find that the galaxies follow the GC number-halo mass relation but deviate in a systematic way from the stellar mass-halo mass relation, which depends on their GC count. This scatter off the relation is towards higher halo masses, or equivalently lower stellar masses. The galaxies exhibiting the largest offsets may represent `failed galaxies' that have experienced quenched star formation with later assembly.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration recently reported an exceptional gravitational-wave event, GW231123. This gravitational-wave signal was assumed to be generated from the merger of a binary black hole system, with source frame masses of $137^{+22}_{-17}~\textup{M}_\odot$ and $103^{+20}_{-52}~ \textup{M}_\odot$ (90\% credible intervals). As seen by the two LIGO detectors, the signal has only $\sim 5$ cycles, between 30 and 80 Hz, over $\sim 10$ ms. It is of critical importance to confirm the origin of this signal. Here we present the results of a Bayesian model comparison to test whether the gravitational-wave signal was actually generated by a binary black hole merger, or emitted from cusps or kinks on a cosmic string. We find significant evidence for a binary black hole merger origin of the signal.</description>

      <title>Fast and "lossless" propagation of relativistic electrons along magnetized non-thermal filaments in galaxy clusters and the Galactic Center region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Relativistic leptons in galaxy clusters lose their energy via radiation (synchrotron and inverse Compton losses) and interactions with the ambient plasma. At z~0, pure radiative losses limit the lifetime of electrons emitting at ~GHz frequencies to t&lt;100 Myr. Adiabatic losses can further lower Lorentz factors of electrons trapped in an expanding medium. If the propagation speed of electrons relative to the ambient weakly magnetized (plasma $\beta\sim10^2$) Intracluster Medium (ICM) is limited by the Alfv\'en speed, $v_{a,ICM}=c_{s,ICM}/\beta^{1/2}\sim 10^7\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}}$, GHz-emitting electrons can travel only $l \sim v_{a,ICM}t_r\sim 10\,kpc$ relative to the underlying plasma. Yet, elongated structures spanning hundreds of kpc or even a few Mpc are observed, requiring either a re-acceleration mechanism or another form of synchronization, e.g., by a large-scale shock. We argue that filaments with ordered magnetic fields supported by non-thermal pressure have $v_{a}\gg v_{a,{\rm ICM}}$ and so can provide such a synchronization even without re-acceleration or shocks. In particular, along quasi-stationary filaments, electrons can propagate without experiencing adiabatic losses, and their velocity is not limited by the Alfv\'en or sound speeds of the ambient thermal plasma. This model predicts that along filaments that span significant pressure gradients, e.g., in the cores of galaxy clusters, the synchrotron break frequency $\nu_b\propto B$ should scale with the ambient gas pressure as $P^{1/2}$, and the emission from such filaments should be strongly polarized. While some of these structures can be observed as "filaments", i.e., long and narrow bright structures, others can be unresolved and have a collective appearance of a diffuse structure, or be too faint to be detected, while still providing channels for electrons' propagation.</description>

      <title>Survival of higher overdensity cold gas in a turbulent, multiphase medium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cold gas clouds embedded in a hot, turbulent medium are expected to be short-lived due to disruptive hydrodynamic instabilities. However, radiative cooling might allow such clouds to survive and grow. We present 3D \texttt{Athena++} simulations of clouds with a density contrast of $\chi = 1000$, exploring turbulent Mach numbers $\mathcal{M}\in (0.25, 0.75)$ and cloud radii chosen to span cooling-to-crushing ratios $\alpha \in [0.001, 10]$. We find a shift in the survival boundary, with cloud survival occurring only when the cooling-to-cloud-crushing ratio ($t_{\text{cool,mix}} / t_{\text{cc}}$) $\lesssim 0.01$, which is lower than the expected boundary of $\sim 1$. This result shows that it is more difficult for higher over-density cold clouds to survive in a turbulent, hot medium, and suggests another `survival criterion'.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Hole Triggered Type Ia Supernovae I: Impact on Explosion Dynamics and Light Curves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21041v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) in the asteroid-mass window are compelling dark matter candidates, made plausible by the existence of black holes and by the variety of mechanisms of their production in the early universe. If a PBH falls into a white dwarf (WD), the strong tidal forces can generate enough heat to trigger a thermonuclear runaway explosion, depending on the WD mass and the PBH orbital parameters. In this work, we investigate the WD explosion triggered by the passage of PBH. We perform 2D simulations of the WD undergoing thermonuclear explosion in this scenario, with the predicted ignition site as the parameter assuming the deflagration-detonation transition model. We study the explosion dynamics and predict the associated light curves and nucleosynthesis. We find that the model sequence predicts the light curves which align with the Phillip's relation ($B_{\max}$ vs. $\Delta M_{15}$). Our models hint at a unifying approach in triggering Type Ia supernovae without involving two distinctive evolutionary tracks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01124v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces ASTRA (Algorithm for Stochastic Topological RAnking), a new method for classifying galaxies into cosmic web structures -voids, sheets, filaments, and knots- specifically designed for large spectroscopic surveys. ASTRA operates on observed galaxy positions and a corresponding random catalog, generating probabilistic cosmic web classifications for both datasets. The method's key innovation lies in using random points to trace underdense regions, enabling robust identification of cosmic voids that are poorly sampled by galaxies. We evaluate ASTRA using N-body simulations (dark matter-only and hydrodynamical) and SDSS observational data, performing both visual inspections and quantitative analyses of mass and volume distributions. The algorithm successfully produces void catalogs with size functions following theoretical expectations and demonstrates consistent environmental statistics across diverse datasets. Comparative analysis against established cosmic web classifiers confirms ASTRA's effectiveness, particularly for filament identification. By incorporating both observed and random points in its classification scheme, ASTRA provides a full cosmic web characterization without requiring density field interpolation or fixed geometric assumptions. The method's ability to quantify spatial correlations among different cosmic web components offers promising avenues for enhancing cosmological parameter constraints through non-standard clustering statistics.</description>

      <title>Does DESI 2024 Confirm $\Lambda$CDM?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08633v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that a $\sim 2 \sigma$ discrepancy with the Planck-$\Lambda$CDM cosmology in DESI Luminous Red Galaxy (LRG) data in the redshift range $0.4 &lt; z &lt; 0.6$ with effective redshift $z_{\textrm{eff}} = 0.51$ translates into an unexpectedly large $\Omega_m$ value, $\Omega_m = 0.67^{+0.18}_{-0.17}$. We independently confirm that this anomaly drives the preference for $w_0 &gt; -1$ in DESI data \textit{alone} confronted to the $w_0 w_a$CDM model. Given that LRG data at $z_{\textrm{eff}} = 0.51$ is at odds with Type Ia supernovae in overlapping redshifts, we expect that this anomaly will decrease in statistical significance with future DESI data releases leaving an increasing $\Omega_m$ trend with effective redshift at higher redshifts. We estimate the current significance of the latter in DESI data at $\sim 1.8 \sigma$ and comment on how it dovetails with independent observations. It is imperative to understand what makes DESI LRG data at $z_{\textrm{eff}} = 0.51$ an outlier when it comes to $\Omega_m$ determinations.</description>

      <title>Steady-state bubbles beyond local thermal equilibrium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16580v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the hydrodynamic solutions for expanding bubbles in cosmological first-order phase transitions going beyond local thermal equilibrium approximation. Under the assumption of a tangenosidal field profile, we supplement the matching conditions with the entropy produced due to the interaction of the bubble wall with ambient plasma. This allows us to analytically compute the corresponding fluid profiles and find bubble-wall velocity. We show that due to the entropy production, two stable solutions corresponding to a deflagration or hybrid and a detonation can coexist. Finally, we use numerical real-time simulations of bubble growth to show that in such cases it is typically the faster detonation solution which is realised. This effect can be explained in terms of the fluid profile not being fully formed into the predicted steady-state solution as the wall accelerates past this slower solution.</description>

      <title>Practical photonic band gap structures for high frequency axion haloscopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18914v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current and future searches for dark matter axions, based on their resonant conversion to photons in a magnetic field, span many orders of magnitude. A major impediment to designing resonators at the high end of this range, 5 GHz and above, is the proliferation of TE modes, which overwhelm and hybridize with the TM010 mode to which the axion couples, making the search impossible. We demonstrate that a photonic band gap structure can be designed that completely suppresses the TE spectrum, even reducing the number of lattice periods to two or one, and violating perfect lattice symmetry. This allows tunable resonators to be designed in a convenient, volumetrically efficient circular geometry thus enabling future searches in the post-inflation axion mass range.</description>

      <title>Filtering in CMB data analysis with application to ACT DR4 and Planck observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13995v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by observed discrepancies between the Atacama Cosmology Telescope Data Release 4 (ACT DR4) and Planck 2018 cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy power spectra, particularly in the cross-correlation of temperature and E-mode polarization, we investigate challenges that may be encountered in the comparison of satellite and ground-based CMB data. In particular, we focus on the effects of Fourier-space filtering and masking involving bright point sources. We show that the filtering operation generates bright cross-shaped artifacts in the map, which stretch far outside typical point-source masks. If not corrected, these artifacts can add bias or additional variance to cross-spectra, skewing results. However we find that the effect of this systematic is not large enough to explain the ACT-Planck differences presented with ACT DR4.</description>

Abstract: Using the cross-correlation data from the first three observing runs of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration, we search for a gravitational-wave background (GWB) from primordial black holes, arising from the superposition of compact binary coalescence events. We consider both early and late binary formation mechanisms and perform Bayesian parameter inference. From the non-detection of the GWB, we provide constraints on the fraction of primordial black holes contributing to the present dark matter energy density.</description>

      <title>Constraining the primordial power spectrum using a differentiable likelihood</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00108v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The simplest inflationary models predict the primordial power spectrum (PPS) of curvature perturbations to be nearly scale-invariant. However, various other models of inflation predict deviations from this behaviour, motivating a data-driven approach to reconstruct the PPS and constrain its shape. In this work, we present a novel method that employs a fully differentiable pipeline to reconstruct the PPS using Gaussian Processes and uses neural network emulators for fast and differentiable theoretical predictions. By leveraging gradient-based sampling techniques, such as Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, our approach efficiently samples the high-dimensional parameter space of cosmological parameters and the free-form PPS, enabling joint constraints on both. Applying this framework to Planck 2018 Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) temperature anisotropy data we find our reconstructed PPS to be consistent with near scale-invariance on small scales, while exhibiting large uncertainties at large scales, driven mostly by cosmic variance. Our results show an overestimation of the PPS amplitude compared to $\Lambda$CDM predictions from the Planck 2018 analysis, which we attribute to our choice of a wider prior on the optical depth $\tau$ based on Planck 2015 measurements. Adopting a prior consistent with Planck 2018 measurements brings our results into full agreement with previous work. To ensure robustness of our results, we validate our differentiable pipeline against a non-differentiable framework, and also demonstrate that our results are insensitive to the choice of Gaussian process hyperparameters. These promising results and the flexibility of our pipeline make it ideally suited for application to additional data sets such as CMB polarisation as well as Large-Scale Structure probes, thus moving towards multi-probe primordial power spectrum reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Faster than SAM: An empirical model for the tidal evolution of dark matter substructure around strong gravitational lenses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07728v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Strong gravitational lenses enable direct inference of halo abundance and internal structure, which in turn enable constraints on the nature of dark matter and the primordial matter power spectrum. However, the density profiles of dark subhalos around the main deflector of a strong lens system also depend on tidal evolution inside the host, complicating the interpretation of strong-lensing inferences. We present a model for subhalo tidal evolution that accurately predicts the bound mass function and the density profiles of tidally stripped subhalos that appear near the Einstein radius of a typical deflector for a variety of dark matter models. This model matches predictions from the semianalytic model (SAM) {\sc galacticus}, but enables the simulation of subhalo populations in seconds, rather than hours. We use this model to examine the expected number of subhalos near the Einstein radius of a typical lens, and examine their lensing signals. We show that in cold dark matter the amplitude of the bound mass function is suppressed by a factor of $20$ relative to the infall mass function, and $87 \%$ of subhalos appearing in projection near the Einstein radius of a typical strong lensing deflector have lost more than $80\%$ of their mass since infall. Tidal stripping becomes increasingly severe in dark matter models with suppressed small-scale power, such as warm dark matter. This model will be used to forward model subhalo populations in forthcoming analyses of strong lens systems.</description>

      <title>The Poisson noise in modeling the redshift-space distortion at large scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03401v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the errors in modeling the redshift-space distortion (RSD) effect at large linear scales, using data from the Millennium simulation. While standard theoretical templates, such as the Kaiser formula and the TNS method, could precisely model RSD for individual large-scale modes, we find that for tracers with number densities lower than $\sim10^{-3}({\rm Mpc}/h)^{-3}$, there is a few-percent level bias in the predicted power spectrum. This error arises due to the amplification of intrinsic Poisson noise during RSD modeling from real-space power spectrum. This amplified noise can be analytically expressed as $1 + \epsilon/[{\bar{n}P}({1+\epsilon})]$, with $\epsilon=2\beta/3+\beta^2/5$, where $P$ denotes the real-space tracer power spectrum and $\beta \equiv f/b$. Specifically, for halos with a number density of around $5\times10^{-4}({\rm Mpc}/h)^{-3}$, this phenomenon results in an additional systematic error of 2.5\%. Our result suggests that caution is necessary when directly modeling redshift-space distortions (RSD) using real-space power spectra of tracers obtained from simulations or actual surveys. This caution is particularly pertinent in scenarios where emulators trained on simulation data forecast the real-space tracer power spectrum, as well as in baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) reconstruction using galaxy samples, for which we estimate that shot noise could introduce random errors of about one-third in the displacement field, potentially diminishing the effectiveness of the BAO peak sharpening.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07679v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent observational evidence of deviations from the $\Lambda$-Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model points towards the presence of evolving dark energy. The simplest possibility consists of a cosmological scalar field $\varphi$, dubbed quintessence, driving the accelerated expansion. We assess the evidence for the existence of such a scalar field. We find that, if the accelerated expansion is driven by quintessence, the data favour a potential energy $V(\varphi)$ that is concave, i.e., $m^2=d^2V/d\varphi^2&lt;0$. Furthermore, and more significantly, the data strongly favour a scalar field that is non-minimally coupled to gravity (Bayes factor $\log(B) = 7.34 \pm 0.6$), leading to time variations in the gravitational constant on cosmological scales, and the existence of fifth forces on smaller scales. The fact that we do not observe such fifth forces implies that either new physics must come into play on non-cosmological scales or that quintessence is an unlikely explanation for the observed cosmic acceleration.</description>

      <title>Vector induced Gravitational Waves sourced by Primordial Magnetic Fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10477v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we develop a generic formalism for the study of tensor perturbations induced at second order by first-order vector metric perturbations, dubbing these induced tensor modes $\textit{vector-induced gravitational waves}$ (VIGWs). Notably, considering an inflation-inspired power-law type magnetic field power spectrum of the form $P_B(k)\propto k^{n_\mathrm{B}}$ (where $n_{\rm B}$ is the magnetic spectral index), we show that the VIGW signal is enhanced for stiff post-inflationary EoS, with the maximum enhancement happening for $w=1$. We explicitly demonstrate this contribution is dominant over the first-order magnetically-sourced GWs. The VIGW spectrum exhibits a maximum at around the scale crossing the cosmological horizon at the end of reheating, $k_\mathrm{reh}$, with its present day peak amplitude scaling as $\Omega_{\rm GW}(k_{\rm reh},\eta_0)\propto \Delta N_{\rm reh}\times(H_{\rm inf}/M_{\rm Pl})^{8}$, where $H_{\rm inf}$ is the Hubble parameter at the end of inflation and $\Delta N_{\rm reh}$ the duration of the post-inflationary era in $e$-folds. For $w=1$ (kination) and $n_{\rm B}&gt;-3/2$, one further obtains a nearly $n_{\rm B}$-independent frequency scaling of the GW spectrum of the form $\Omega_{\rm GW}(f,\eta_0)\propto \left(\frac{f}{f_{\rm reh}}\right)^{-2.8}$ for $f&gt;f_\mathrm{reh}\equiv k_\mathrm{reh}/(2\pi)$. Finally, we highlight that the VIGW signal can be well within the detection bands of several next-generation interferometric GW missions at small scales. Indicatively, for $H_{\rm inf} \sim O(10^{7})\:\mathrm{GeV}$ and $O(10^{14})\:\mathrm{GeV}$, and $\Delta N_{\rm reh} \sim 15$ and $10$, the VIGW signal is expected to be detectable by LISA and ET respectively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08467v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a two-parameter phenomenological extension of the $\Lambda$CDM model in which the equation of state parameter of the ``dust'' fluid becomes different from zero for redshifts below a transition value $z_t$. Using data from DESI DR2 BAO, DESY5 Sn~Ia and CMB distance priors ($R,l_A,\omega_b$) data, we compare our model with the standard CPL parameterization $w_0-w_a$ for dynamical dark energy. Using the Deviance Information Criteria (DIC), we find that the two models are essentially indistinguishable ($\Delta$DIC $&lt;$ 2) and preferred over $\Lambda$CDM with a significance $\geq 3 \sigma$. We discuss how this parameterization finds a natural interpretation in the context of cosmological backreaction and derive a prediction for the evolution of the growth factor, discussing its impact on low redshift $f\sigma_8$ measurements.</description>

Abstract: We perform a detailed analysis of the synchrotron signals produced by Dark Matter annihilations and decays. We consider different set-ups for the propagation of electrons and positrons, the galactic magnetic field and Dark Matter properties. We then confront these signals with radio and microwave maps, including Planck measurements, from a frequency of 22 MHz up to 70 GHz. We derive two sets of constraints: conservative and progressive, the latter based on a modeling of the astrophysical emission. Radio and microwave constraints are complementary to those obtained with other indirect detection methods, especially for dark matter annihilating into leptonic channels.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07335v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Finite-temperature one-loop renormalization of the Standard Model, coupled with dynamic metric, is conducted in this study. The entire analysis is coherently carried out by using the refined background field method, applied in the spirit of the Coleman-Weinberg technique. The general form of the propagator, introduced in our previous work to facilitate Feynman diagram computation in a general curved background, proves useful in the presence of time-dependent temperature. Its utilization allows for the renormalization analysis of a FLRW background to essentially reduce to that of a constant finite-T flat spacetime. For infrared physics, the actual curved background should be considered. The implications of our findings for cosmology, particularly the cosmological constant problem and Hubble tension, are discussed.</description>

Abstract: Dark photon dark matter (DPDM) emerges as a compelling candidate for ultralight bosonic dark matter, detectable through resonant conversion into photons within a plasma environment. This study employs in-situ measurements from the Parker Solar Probe (PSP), the first spacecraft to venture into the solar corona, to probe for DPDM signatures. The PSP in-situ measurements go beyond the traditional radio window, spanning frequencies between about 10 kHz and 20 MHz, a challenging range inaccessible to Earth-based radio astronomy. Additionally, the proximity of PSP to the resonant conversion location enhances the signal flux, providing a distinct advantage over ground-based observations. As a result, the PSP data establishes the most stringent constraints on the kinetic mixing parameter $\epsilon$ for DPDM frequencies between 70 kHz and 20 MHz, with values of $\epsilon \lesssim 10^{-14}-10^{-13}$. Investigating the data from STEREO satellites resulted in weaker constraints compared to those obtained from PSP. By utilizing state-of-the-art solar observations from space, we have surpassed the cosmic microwave background limits derived from early-universe observations.</description>

      <title>Variable gravitational potential of Milky Way analogues in HESTIA suite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18880v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Investigations of trajectories of various objects orbiting the Milky Way (MW) halo with modern precision, achievable in observations by Gaia, requires sophisticated, non-stationary models of the Galactic potential. In this paper we analyze the evolution of the spherical harmonics expansion of MW analogues potential in constrained simulations of the Local Group (LG) from the HESTIA suite. We find that at distances $r\ge 100$~kpc the non-spherical part of the potential demonstrates a significant impact of the environment: ignoring the mass distribution outside the virial radius of the MW results in $&gt;$20\% errors in the potential quadrupole at these distances. {Account of the environment results in a noticeable change of the angular momenta of objects orbiting MW analogues}. Spherical harmonics vary significantly during the last 6 Gyr. We attribute variations of the potential at $r\ge 30$~kpc to the motions of MW satellites and LG galaxies. We also predict that the non-sphericity of the real MW potential should grow with distance in the range $r_\mathrm{vir}&lt;r&lt;500$~kpc, since all realizations of simulated MW-like objects demonstrate such a trend.</description>

      <title>Exploring Hubble Tension Alleviation through Neutrino-Coupled Perturbed $f(R)$ Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03190v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work examines the Hubble constant (\(H_0\)) tension within the frameworks of perturbed \(f(R)\) gravity and perturbed \(f(R)\) gravity coupled with neutrinos, using lastest observational data. The datasets incorporate the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO), Cosmic Chronometers (CC), lensing, and Pantheon supernovae. We compare the ability of these models to bridge the discrepancy between Planck 2018 (\(H_0 = 67.4 \pm 0.5 \ \text{km/s/Mpc}\)) and the local R22 measurement (\(H_0 = 73.5 \pm 1.04 \ \text{km/s/Mpc}\)). In perturbed \(f(R)\) gravity, the derived \(H_0\) values align closely with Planck, leaving a substantial tension with R22. The inclusion of neutrino interactions introduces additional parameters that shift \(H_0\) toward higher values, reducing the tension with local measurements. Notably, the coupled model achieves a smaller residual tension compared to the standalone perturbed \(f(R)\) model, indicating that neutrino physics plays a significant role in modifying the late-time expansion dynamics. While both models provide insights into addressing the Hubble tension, the coupled \(f(R)\) gravity with neutrinos offers a more consistent alignment across the datasets.</description>

      <title>Playing with lepton asymmetry at the resonant production of sterile neutrino dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17374v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine the sterile neutrino dark matter production in the primordial plasma with lepton asymmetry unequally distributed over different neutrino flavors. We argue that with the specific flavor fractions, one can mitigate limits from the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis on the sterile-active neutrino mixing angle and sterile neutrino mass. It happens due to cancellation of the neutrino flavor asymmetries in active neutrino oscillations, which is more efficient in the case of inverse hierarchy of active neutrino masses and does not depend on the value of CP-phase. This finding opens a window of lower sterile-active mixing angles. Likewise, we show that, with lepton asymmetry disappearing from the plasma at certain intermediate stages of the sterile neutrino production, the spectrum of produced neutrinos becomes much colder, which weakens the limits on the model parameter space from observations of cosmic small-scale structures (Ly-$\alpha$ forest, galaxy counts, etc.). This finding reopens the region of lighter sterile neutrinos. The new region may be explored with the next generation of X-ray telescopes searching for the inherent peak signature provided by the dark matter sterile neutrino radiative decays in the Galaxy.</description>

      <title>Prospects of future MeV telescopes in probing weak-scale Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04907v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Galactic weak-scale Dark Matter (DM) particles annihilating into lepton-rich channels not only produce gamma-rays via prompt radiation but also generate abundant energetic electrons and positrons, which subsequently emit through bremsstrahlung or inverse Compton scattering (collectively called `secondary-radiation photons'). While the prompt gamma-rays concentrate at high-energy, the secondary emission falls in the MeV range, which a number of upcoming experiments (AMEGO, E-ASTROGAM, MAST...) will probe. We investigate the sensitivity of these future telescopes for weak-scale DM, focusing for definiteness on observations of the galactic center. We find that they have the potential of probing a wide region of the DM parameter space which is currently unconstrained. Namely, in rather optimistic configurations, future MeV telescopes could probe thermally-produced DM with a mass up to the TeV range, or GeV DM with an annihilation cross section 2 to 3 orders of magnitude smaller than the current bounds, precisely thanks to the significant leverage provided by their sensitivity to secondary emissions. We comment on astrophysical and methodological uncertainties, and compare with the reach of high-energy gamma ray experiments.</description>

      <title>Probing Leptogenesis at LISA: A Fisher analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09884v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In JCAP 11 (2024) 051, we discussed how different regimes (flavoured) of leptogenesis can be probed through a ``tomographic'' approach using primordial gravitational waves. By examining the theory's parameter space, we identified regions where right-handed neutrino mass-dependent non-standard cosmological expansion leaves characteristic imprints on propagating gravitational waves. Our analysis focused on inflationary blue-tilted gravitational waves, modeled by a power-law tensor power spectrum with a constant spectral index. The resulting double-peak spectrum -- where peak and dip frequencies are sensitive to leptogenesis parameters -- provided marked signatures of different leptogenesis regimes. In this follow-up article, we conduct a statistical analysis of two-flavour leptogenesis signals, particularly those producing a peak (more generally, a broken power-law signal) within the LISA frequency band. Using a Fisher matrix analysis, we delineate the regions of parameter space that LISA can probe with minimal uncertainty, accounting for galactic and extragalactic foregrounds along with LISA's instrumental noise.</description>

      <title>Continuum optical-UV and X-ray variability of AGN: current results and future challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23899v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) are believed to be powered by accretion of matter onto a supermassive black hole. A fundamental ingredient in shaping our understanding of AGN is their variability across the entire electromagnetic spectrum. Variability studies have the potential to help us understand the geometry of the emitting regions (in various energy bands), their causal relations, and the physics of the accretion processes. This review focuses on the observational properties of AGN variability in the optical/UV/X-ray bands (where most of the AGN luminosity is emitted) and their dependence on the AGN physical parameters (i.e. mass, luminosity, accretion rate). We also discuss possible interpretations in the context of accreting compact systems, and we review the use of variability as a tool to discover AGN and trace their properties across cosmic time, using both ground and space facilities. Finally, we discuss the opportunities and challenges provided by current and next-generation optical/X-ray surveys, to use variability as an effective tool to probe the growth of super massive black holes in the Universe.</description>

      <title>Primordial black hole formation in k-inflation models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02490v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The local primordial density fluctuations caused by quantum vacuum fluctuations during inflation grow into stars and galaxies in the late universe and, if they are large enough, also produce primordial black holes. We study the formation of the primordial black holes in $k$-essence inflation models with a potential characterized by an inflection point. The background and perturbation equations are integrated numerically for two specific models. Using the critical collapse and peaks formalism, we calculate the abundance of primordial black holes today.</description>
