      <title>Balancing Profit and Traveller Acceptance in Ride-Pooling Personalised Fares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a ride-pooling system, travellers experience discomfort associated with a detour and a longer travel time, which is compensated with a sharing discount. Most studies assume travellers receive either a flat discount or, in rare cases, a proportional to the inconvenience. We show the system benefits from individually tailored fares. We argue that fares that optimise an expected profit of an operator also improve system-wide performance if they include travellers' acceptance.
  Our pricing method is set in a heterogeneous population, where travellers have varying levels of value-of-time and willingness-to-share, unknown to the operator. A high fare discourages clients from the service, while a low fare reduces the profit margin. Notably, a shared ride is only realised if accepted by all co-travellers (decision is driven by the latent behavioural factors).
  Our method reveals intriguing properties of the shareability topology. Not only identifies rides efficient for the system and supports them with reduced fares (to increase their realisation probability), but also identifies travellers unattractive for the system (e.g. due to incompatibility with other travellers) and effectively shifts them to private rides via high fares. Unlike in previous methods, such approach naturally balances the travellers satisfaction and the profit maximisation. With an experiment set in NYC, we show that this leads to significant improvements over the flat discount baseline: the mileage (proxy for environmental externalities) is reduced by 4.5% and the operator generates more profit per mile (over 20% improvement). We argue that ride pooling systems with fares that maximise profitability are more sustainable and efficient if they include travellers' satisfaction. Keywords: ride-pooling, personalised pricing, individual discounts</description>

      <title>Six Candidates Suffice to Win a Voter Majority</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A cornerstone of social choice theory is Condorcet's paradox which says that in an election where $n$ voters rank $m$ candidates it is possible that, no matter which candidate is declared the winner, a majority of voters would have preferred an alternative candidate. Instead, can we always choose a small committee of winning candidates that is preferred to any alternative candidate by a majority of voters?
  Elkind, Lang, and Saffidine raised this question and called such a committee a Condorcet winning set. They showed that winning sets of size $2$ may not exist, but sets of size logarithmic in the number of candidates always do. In this work, we show that Condorcet winning sets of size $6$ always exist, regardless of the number of candidates or the number of voters. More generally, we show that if $\frac{\alpha}{1 - \ln \alpha} \geq \frac{2}{k + 1}$, then there always exists a committee of size $k$ such that less than an $\alpha$ fraction of the voters prefer an alternate candidate. These are the first nontrivial positive results that apply for all $k \geq 2$.
  Our proof uses the probabilistic method and the minimax theorem, inspired by recent work on approximately stable committee selection. We construct a distribution over committees that performs sufficiently well (when compared against any candidate on any small subset of the voters) so that this distribution must contain a committee with the desired property in its support.</description>

      <title>Beyond Regularity: Simple versus Optimal Mechanisms, Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A large proportion of the Bayesian mechanism design literature is restricted to the family of regular distributions $\mathbb{F}_{\tt reg}$ [Mye81] or the family of monotone hazard rate (MHR) distributions $\mathbb{F}_{\tt MHR}$ [BMP63], which overshadows this beautiful and well-developed theory. We (re-)introduce two generalizations, the family of quasi-regular distributions $\mathbb{F}_{\tt Q-reg}$ and the family of quasi-MHR distributions $\mathbb{F}_{\tt Q-MHR}$. All four families together form the following hierarchy: $\mathbb{F}_{\tt MHR} \subsetneq (\mathbb{F}_{\tt reg} \cap \mathbb{F}_{\tt Q-MHR}) \subsetneq \mathbb{F}_{\tt Q-reg}$ and $\mathbb{F}_{\tt Q-MHR} \subsetneq (\mathbb{F}_{\tt reg} \cup \mathbb{F}_{\tt Q-MHR}) \subsetneq \mathbb{F}_{\tt Q-reg}$.
  The significance of our new families is manifold. First, their defining conditions are immediate relaxations of the regularity/MHR conditions (i.e., monotonicity of the virtual value functions and/or the hazard rate functions), which reflect economic intuition. Second, they satisfy natural mathematical properties (about order statistics) that are violated by both original families $\mathbb{F}_{\tt reg}$ and $\mathbb{F}_{\tt MHR}$. Third but foremost, numerous results [BK96, HR09a, CD15, DRY15, HR14, AHN+19, JLTX20, JLQ+19b, FLR19, GHZ19b, JLX23, LM24] established before for regular/MHR distributions now can be generalized, with or even without quantitative losses.</description>

      <title>On the Decomposition of Differential Game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To understand the complexity of the dynamic of learning in differential games, we decompose the game into components where the dynamic is well understood. One of the possible tools is Helmholtz's theorem, which can decompose a vector field into a potential and a harmonic component. This has been shown to be effective in finite and normal-form games. However, applying Helmholtz's theorem by connecting it with the Hodge theorem on $\mathbb{R}^n$ (which is the strategy space of differential game) is non-trivial due to the non-compactness of $\mathbb{R}^n$. Bridging the dynamic-strategic disconnect through Hodge/Helmoltz's theorem in differential games is then left as an open problem \cite{letcher2019differentiable}. In this work, we provide two decompositions of differential games to answer this question: the first as an exact scalar potential part, a near vector potential part, and a non-strategic part; the second as a near scalar potential part, an exact vector potential part, and a non-strategic part. We show that scalar potential games coincide with potential games proposed by \cite{monderer1996potential}, where the gradient descent dynamic can successfully find the Nash equilibrium. For the vector potential game, we show that the individual gradient field is divergence-free, in which case the gradient descent dynamic may either be divergent or recurrent.</description>

      <title>Temporal Network Creation Games: The Impact of Non-Locality and Terminals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We live in a world full of networks where our economy, our communication, and even our social life crucially depends on them. These networks typically emerge from the interaction of many entities, which is why researchers study agent-based models of network formation. While traditionally static networks with a fixed set of links were considered, a recent stream of works focuses on networks whose behavior may change over time. In particular, Bil\`o et al. (IJCAI 2023) recently introduced a game-theoretic network formation model that embeds temporal aspects in networks. More precisely, a network is formed by selfish agents corresponding to nodes in a given host network with edges having labels denoting their availability over time. Each agent strategically selects local, i.e., incident, edges to ensure temporal reachability towards everyone at low cost.
  In this work we set out to explore the impact of two novel conceptual features: agents are no longer restricted to creating incident edges, called the global setting, and agents might only want to ensure that they can reach a subset of the other nodes, called the terminal model. For both, we study the existence, structure, and quality of equilibrium networks. For the terminal model, we prove that many core properties crucially depend on the number of terminals. We also develop a novel tool that allows translating equilibrium constructions from the non-terminal model to the terminal model. For the global setting, we show the surprising result that equilibria in the global and the local model are incomparable and we establish a high lower bound on the Price of Anarchy of the global setting that matches the upper bound of the local model. This shows the counter-intuitive fact that allowing agents more flexibility in edge creation does not improve the quality of equilibrium networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the challenge of AI value alignment with multiple individuals that have different reward functions and optimal policies in an underlying Markov decision process. We formalize this problem as one of policy aggregation, where the goal is to identify a desirable collective policy. We argue that an approach informed by social choice theory is especially suitable. Our key insight is that social choice methods can be reinterpreted by identifying ordinal preferences with volumes of subsets of the state-action occupancy polytope. Building on this insight, we demonstrate that a variety of methods--including approval voting, Borda count, the proportional veto core, and quantile fairness--can be practically applied to policy aggregation.</description>

      <title>AdaSociety: An Adaptive Environment with Social Structures for Multi-Agent Decision-Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional interactive environments limit agents' intelligence growth with fixed tasks. Recently, single-agent environments address this by generating new tasks based on agent actions, enhancing task diversity. We consider the decision-making problem in multi-agent settings, where tasks are further influenced by social connections, affecting rewards and information access. However, existing multi-agent environments lack a combination of adaptive physical surroundings and social connections, hindering the learning of intelligent behaviors. To address this, we introduce AdaSociety, a customizable multi-agent environment featuring expanding state and action spaces, alongside explicit and alterable social structures. As agents progress, the environment adaptively generates new tasks with social structures for agents to undertake. In AdaSociety, we develop three mini-games showcasing distinct social structures and tasks. Initial results demonstrate that specific social structures can promote both individual and collective benefits, though current reinforcement learning and LLM-based algorithms show limited effectiveness in leveraging social structures to enhance performance. Overall, AdaSociety serves as a valuable research platform for exploring intelligence in diverse physical and social settings. The code is available at https://github.com/bigai-ai/AdaSociety.</description>

      <title>Bounds on the revenue gap of linear posted pricing for selling a divisible item</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.08246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2007.08246v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Selling a perfectly divisible item to potential buyers is a fundamental task with apparent applications to pricing communication bandwidth and cloud computing services. Surprisingly, despite the rich literature on single-item auctions, revenue maximization when selling a divisible item is a much less understood objective. We introduce a Bayesian setting, in which the potential buyers have concave valuation functions (defined for each possible item fraction) that are randomly chosen according to known probability distributions. Extending the sequential posted pricing paradigm, we focus on mechanisms that use linear pricing, charging a fixed price for the whole item and proportional prices for fractions of it. Our goal is to understand the power of such mechanisms by bounding the gap between the expected revenue that can be achieved by the best among these mechanisms and the maximum expected revenue that can be achieved by any mechanism assuming mild restrictions on the behavior of the buyers. Under regularity assumptions for the probability distributions, we show that this revenue gap depends only logarithmically on a natural parameter characterizing the valuation functions and the number of agents. Our results follow by bounding the objective value of a mathematical program that maximizes the ex-ante relaxation of optimal revenue under linear pricing revenue constraints.</description>

      <title>Breaking the Metric Voting Distortion Barrier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.17838v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the following well-studied problem of metric distortion in social choice. Suppose we have an election with $n$ voters and $m$ candidates located in a shared metric space. We would like to design a voting rule that chooses a candidate whose average distance to the voters is small. However, instead of having direct access to the distances in the metric space, the voting rule obtains, from each voter, a ranked list of the candidates in order of distance. Can we design a rule that regardless of the election instance and underlying metric space, chooses a candidate whose cost differs from the true optimum by only a small factor (known as the distortion)?
  A long line of work culminated in finding optimal deterministic voting rules with metric distortion $3$. However, for randomized voting rules, there is still a gap in our understanding: Even though the best lower bound is $2.112$, the best upper bound is still $3$, attained even by simple rules such as Random Dictatorship. Finding a randomized rule that guarantees distortion $3 - \epsilon$ has been a major challenge in computational social choice, as prevalent approaches to designing voting rules are known to be insufficient. Such a voting rule must use information beyond aggregate comparisons between pairs of candidates, and cannot only assign positive probability to candidates that are voters' top choices.
  In this work, we give a rule that guarantees distortion less than $2.753$. To do so we study a handful of voting rules that are new to the problem. One is Maximal Lotteries, a rule based on the Nash equilibrium of a natural zero-sum game which dates back to the 60's. The others are novel rules that can be thought of as hybrids of Random Dictatorship and the Copeland rule. Though none of these rules can beat distortion $3$ alone, a randomization between Maximal Lotteries and any of the novel rules can.</description>

      <title>Principal-Agent Problem with Third Party: Information Design from Social Planner's Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16959v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the principal-agent problem with a third party that we call social planner, whose responsibility is to reconcile the conflicts of interest between the two players and induce socially optimal outcome in terms of some given social utility function. The social planner owns no contractual power but manages to control the information flow between the principal and the agent. We design a simple workflow with two stages for the social planner. In the first stage, the problem is reformulated as an optimization problem whose solution is the optimal utility profile. In the second stage, we investigate information design and show that binary-signal information structure suffices to induce the socially optimal outcome determined in the first stage. The simplicity and modularity of our method make it easy to implement in various scenarios within the principal-agent problem.</description>

      <title>First-order (coarse) correlated equilibria in non-concave games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18174v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate first-order notions of correlated equilibria; distributions of actions for smooth, potentially non-concave games such that players do not incur any regret against small modifications to their strategies along a set of continuous vector fields. We define two such notions, based on local deviations and on stationarity of the distribution, and identify the notion of coarseness as the setting where the associated vector fields are in fact gradient fields. For coarse equilibria, we prove that online (projected) gradient decent has a universal approximation property for both variants of equilibrium. In the non-coarse setting, we instead reduce the problem of finding an equilibrium to fixed-point computation via the usual framework of $\Phi$-regret minimisation, and identify tractable instances. Finally, we study the primal-dual framework to our notion of first-order equilibria. For coarse equilibria defined by a family of functions, we find that a dual bound on the worst-case expectation of a performance metric takes the form of a generalised Lyapunov function for the dynamics of the game. Specifically, usual primal-dual price of anarchy analysis for coarse correlated equilibria as well as the smoothness framework of Roughgarden are both equivalent to a problem of general Lyapunov function estimation. For non-coarse equilibria, we instead observe a vector field fit problem for the gradient dynamics of the game. These follow from containment results in normal form games; the usual notion of a (coarse) correlated equilibria is equivalent to our first-order local notions of (coarse) correlated equilibria with respect to an appropriately chosen set of vector fields.</description>

      <title>The Fairness of Maximum Nash Social Welfare Under Matroid Constraints and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01462v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of fair allocation of a set of indivisible items among agents with additive valuations, under matroid constraints and two generalizations: $p$-extendible system and independence system constraints. The objective is to find fair and efficient allocations in which the subset of items assigned to every agent satisfies the given constraint. We focus on a common fairness notion of envy-freeness up to one item (EF1) and a well-known efficient (and fair) notion of the maximum Nash social welfare (Max-NSW). By using properties of matroids, we demonstrate that the Max-NSW allocation, implying Pareto optimality (PO), achieves a tight $1/2$-EF1 under matroid constraints. This result resolves an open question proposed in prior literature [26]. In particular, if agents have 2-valued ($\{1, a\}$) valuations, we prove that the Max-NSW allocation admits $\max\{1/a^2, 1/2\}$-EF1 and PO. Under strongly $p$-extendible system constraints, we show that the Max-NSW allocation guarantees $\max\{1/p, 1/4\}$-EF1 and PO for identical binary valuations. Indeed, the approximation of $1/4$ is the ratio for independence system constraints and additive valuations. Additionally, for lexicographic preferences, we study possibly feasible allocations other than Max-NSW admitting exactly EF1 and PO under the above constraints.</description>

Abstract: Generative art using Diffusion models has achieved remarkable performance in image generation and text-to-image tasks. However, the increasing demand for training data in generative art raises significant concerns about copyright infringement, as models can produce images highly similar to copyrighted works. Existing solutions attempt to mitigate this by perturbing Diffusion models to reduce the likelihood of generating such images, but this often compromises model performance. Another approach focuses on economically compensating data holders for their contributions, yet it fails to address copyright loss adequately. Our approach begin with the introduction of a novel copyright metric grounded in copyright law and court precedents on infringement. We then employ the TRAK method to estimate the contribution of data holders. To accommodate the continuous data collection process, we divide the training into multiple rounds. Finally, We designed a hierarchical budget allocation method based on reinforcement learning to determine the budget for each round and the remuneration of the data holder based on the data holder's contribution and copyright loss in each round. Extensive experiments across three datasets show that our method outperforms all eight benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness in optimizing budget distribution in a copyright-aware manner. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first technical work that introduces to incentive contributors and protect their copyrights by compensating them.</description>

Abstract: Socio-technical networks represent emerging cyber-physical infrastructures that are tightly interwoven with human networks. The coupling between human and technical networks presents significant challenges in managing, controlling, and securing these complex, interdependent systems. This paper investigates game-theoretic frameworks for the design and control of socio-technical networks, with a focus on critical applications such as misinformation management, infrastructure optimization, and resilience in socio-cyber-physical systems (SCPS). Core methodologies, including Stackelberg games, mechanism design, and dynamic game theory, are examined as powerful tools for modeling interactions in hierarchical, multi-agent environments. Key challenges addressed include mitigating human-driven vulnerabilities, managing large-scale system dynamics, and countering adversarial threats. By bridging individual agent behaviors with overarching system goals, this work illustrates how the integration of game theory and control theory can lead to robust, resilient, and adaptive socio-technical networks. This paper highlights the potential of these frameworks to dynamically align decentralized agent actions with system-wide objectives of stability, security, and efficiency.</description>
