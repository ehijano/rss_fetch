      <title>On distance logics of Euclidean spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider logics derived from Euclidean spaces $\mathbb{R}^n$. Each Euclidean space carries relations consisting of those pairs that are, respectively, distance more than 1 apart, distance less than 1 apart, and distance 1 apart. Each relation gives a uni-modal logic of $\mathbb{R}^n$ called the farness, nearness, and constant distance logics, respectively. These modalities are expressive enough to capture various aspects of the geometry of $\mathbb{R}^n$ related to bodies of constant width and packing problems. This allows us to show that the farness logics of the spaces $\mathbb{R}^n$ are all distinct, as are the nearness logics, and the constant distance logics. The farness and nearness logics of $\mathbb{R}$ are shown to strictly contain those of $\mathbb{Q}$, while their constant distance logics agree. It is shown that the farness logic of the reals is not finitely axiomatizable and does not have the finite model property.</description>

      <title>Continuity in Potential Infinite Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a model of simple type theory with potential infinite carrier sets. The functions in this model are automatically continuous, as defined in this paper. This notion of continuity does not rely on topological concepts, including domain theoretic concepts, which essentially use actual infinite sets. The model is based on the concept of a factor system, which generalizes direct and inverse systems. A factor system is basically an extensible set indexed over a directed set of stages, together with a predecessor relation between object states at different stages.
  The function space, when considered as a factor system, expands simultaneously with its elements. On the one hand, the space is subdivided more and more, on the other hand, the elements increase and are defined more and more precisely. In addition, a factor system allows the construction of limits that are part of its expansion process and not outside of it. At these limits, elements are indefinitely large or small, which is a contextual notion and a substitute for elements that are infinitely large or small (points). This dynamic and contextual view is consistent with an understanding of infinity as a potential infinite.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolicity and model-complete fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15300v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study model-complete fields that avoid a given quasi-project variety $V$. There is a close connection between hyperbolicity of $V$ and the existence of the model companion for the theory of characteristic-zero fields avoiding rational points on $V$. This gives a model theoretic notion of hyperbolicity that we call excludability.
  In particular, we show that if $V$ is a Brody hyperbolic projective variety over $\mathbb{Q}$ with $V(\mathbb{Q}) = \varnothing$, then the model companion, called $V\XF$, exists. We also study some model-theoretic properties of $V\mathrm{XF}$. This extends the results for curves by Will Johnson and the second author.</description>

      <title>Models for common knowledge logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13537v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we discuss models of the common knowledge logic. The common knowledge logic is a multi-modal logic that includes the modal operators $\mathsf{K}_{i}$ ($i\in\mathcal{I}$, where $\mathcal{I}$ is a finite set of agents), $\mathsf{E}$, and $\mathsf{C}$. The intended meanings of $\mathsf{K}_{i}\phi$ ($i\in\mathcal{I}$), $\mathsf{E}\phi$, and $\mathsf{C}\phi$ are ''the agent $i$ knows $\phi$'' ($i\in\mathcal{I}$), ''everyone in $\mathcal{I}$ knows $\phi$'', and ''$\phi$ is common knowledge among $\mathcal{I}$'', respectively. Then, the models of these formulas are required to satisfy the following conditions: $\mathsf{E}\phi$ is true if and only if $\mathsf{K}_{i}\phi$ is true for every $i\in\mathcal{I}$, and $\mathsf{C}\phi$ is true if and only if all of $\phi$, $\mathsf{E}\phi$, $\mathsf{E}^{2}\phi$, $\mathsf{E}^{3}\phi,\ldots$ are true. A suitable Kripke frame for this is $\langle W,R_{\mathsf{K}_{i}} (i\in\mathcal{I}), R_{\mathsf{C}}\rangle$, where $R_{\mathsf{C}}$ is the reflexive and transitive closure of $R_{\mathsf{E}}=\bigcup_{i\in\mathcal{I}}R_{\mathsf{K}_{i}}$. We refer to such Kripke frames as CKL-frames. A suitable algebra for this is a modal algebra with modal operators $\mathrm{K}_{i}$ ($i\in\mathcal{I}$) and $\mathrm{C}$, which satisfies that $\mathrm{C} x\leq\mathrm{E}\mathrm{C} x$, and $\mathrm{C} x$ is the greatest lower bound of the set $\{\mathrm{E}^{n} x\mid n\in\omega\}$, where$\mathrm{E} x=\bigwedge_{i\in\mathcal{I}} \mathrm{K}_{i} x$. We refer to such modal algebras as CKL-algebras. In this paper, we show that the class of CKL-frames is modally definable, whereas the class of CKL-algebras is not. That is, the class of CKL-algebras does not form a variety, and there exists a modal algebra in which the common knowledge logic is valid, but $\mathrm{C}x$ is not the greatest lower bound of the set $\{\mathrm{E}^{n} x\mid n\in\omega\}$.</description>
