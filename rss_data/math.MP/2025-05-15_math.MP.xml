      <title>The Anti-Unitarity of Time Reversal &amp; Co-representations of Lorentzian Pin Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the representation theory of Lorentzian orthogonal groups, there are well known arguments as to why the parity inversion operator $\mathcal{P}$ and the time reversal operator $\mathcal{T}$, should be realized as linear and anti-linear operators respectively (Wigner 1932). Despite this, standard constructions of double covers of the Lorentzian orthogonal groups naturally build time reversal operators in such a manner that they are linear, and the anti-linearity is put in ad-hoc after the fact. This article introduces a viewpoint naturally incorporating the anti-linearity into the construction of these double covers, through what Wigner called co-representations, a kind of semi-linear representation. It is shown how the standard spinoral double covers of the Lorentz group -- $\operatorname{Pin}(1,3)$ and $\operatorname{Pin}(3,1)$ -- may be naturally centrally extended for this purpose, and the relationship between the $\mathcal{C}$, $\mathcal{P}$, and $\mathcal{T}$ operators is discussed. Additionally a mapping is constructed demonstrating an interesting equivalence between Majorana and Weyl spinors. Finally a co-representation is built for the de Sitter group $\operatorname{Pin}(1,4)$, and it is demonstrated how a theory with this symmetry has no truly scalar fermion mass terms.</description>

      <title>Variational formulations of transport on combinatorial meshes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop analogues of the primal and mixed variational formulations of the conservation laws describing transport of scalar physical properties for topological spaces referred to as cell complexes. The development is restricted to cell complexes with cells having connectivity of simple polytopes. Such spaces are suitable representations of physical systems composed of elements of different apparent topological dimensions, where all elements might have individual properties, and elements of a given dimension might interact via common elements of lower dimensions. This modelling foundation can be considered as intermediate between the foundation for particle-based modelling, which is the discrete topology, and the foundation for continuum modelling, which is the smooth topology. The new foundation offers advantages for the analysis of the behaviour of physical systems with complex internal structures. The development is based on a calculus with combinatorial differential forms which is a discrete analogue of the smooth exterior calculus with differential forms. We call the resulting calculus combinatorial mesh calculus (CMC) as it is based on combinatorial meshes, for which embedding is forgotten and only the connectivity between cells and measures of the cells are used in calculations. We discuss how the obtained formulation is specialised for several different problems, including mass diffusion, heat conduction, fluid flow in porous media, and charge diffusion, and provide details about the formulation of initial boundary value problems for these transport cases. Examples and results for selected boundary value problems are given to demonstrate the capabilities of the CMC formulations.</description>

      <title>Classical Dirac particle I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we produce a classical Lagrangian description of an elementary spinning particle which satisfies Dirac equation when quantized. We call this particle a classical Dirac particle. We analyze in detail the way we arrive to this model and how the different observables and constants of the motion can be expressed in terms of the degrees of freedom and their derivatives, by making use of Noether's theorem. The main feature is that the particle has a center of charge r, moving at the speed of light, that satisfies fourth-order diferential equations and all observables can be expressed only in terms of this point and their time derivatives. The particle has also a center of mass q, that is a different point than the center of charge. This implies that two different spin observables can be defined, one S with respect to the point r and another SCM with respect to the point q, that satisfy different dynamical equations. The spin S satisfies the same dynamical equation than Dirac's spin operator. The fourth-order differential equations for the point r can be transformed into a system of second-order ordinary differential equations for the center of charge and center of mass. The dynamics can be described in terms of dimensionless variables. The possible interaction Lagrangians are described and we devote the main part of the work to the electromagnetic interaction of the Dirac particle with uniform and oscillating electric and magnetic fields. The numerical integrations of the dynamical equations are performed with different Mathematica notebooks that are available for the interested reader.</description>

      <title>On the three-point functions in timelike N=1 Liouville CFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use analytic (super-)conformal bootstrap methods to derive explicit expressions for the structure constants of $\mathcal{N}=1$ Liouville CFT in the `timelike' regime of the superconformal central charge. The obtained expressions take the form of inverses of the appropriate spacelike counterparts, which we explain concretely by elucidating the analytic properties of the corresponding shift relations in the NS- and R-sectors for the normalization-independent bootstrap data on the sphere. In a particular normalization, the timelike structure constants are shown to agree with the OPE coefficients of $\mathcal{N}=1$ Minimal Models when specified at degenerate values of the momenta, exactly as in the non-supersymmetric case. We discuss possible applications of our results, with emphasis on the construction of the $\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetric analog of the Virasoro Minimal String.</description>

      <title>Quantized six-vertex model on a torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the integrability of the quantized six-vertex model with four parameters on a torus. It is a three-dimensional integrable lattice model in which a layer transfer matrix, depending on two spectral parameters associated with the homology cycles of the torus, can be defined not only on the square lattice but also on more general graphs. For a class of graphs that we call admissible, we establish the commutativity of the layer transfer matrices by introducing four types of tetrahedron equations and two types of inversion relations. Expanding in the spectral parameters yields a family of commuting quantum Hamiltonians. The quantized six-vertex model can also be reformulated in terms of (quantized) dimer models, and encompasses known integrable systems as special cases, including the free parafermion model and the relativistic Toda chain.</description>

      <title>Metric degeneracies and gradient flows on symplectic leaves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a Poisson manifold endowed with a pseudo-Riemannian metric, we investigate degeneracies arising when the metric is restricted to symplectic leaves. Central to this work is the generalized double bracket (GDB) vector field-a geometric construct introduced in our earlier work-which generalizes gradient dynamics to indefinite metric settings. We identify admissible regions where the so-called double bracket metric remains non-degenerate on symplectic leaves, enabling the GDB vector field to function as a gradient flow on the admissible regions with respect to this metric. We illustrate these concepts with a variety of examples and carefully discuss the complications that arise when the pseudo-Riemannian metric fails to induce a non-degenerate metric on certain regions of the symplectic leaves.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Approach via Global Relaxation to the Variational Modelling of Hierarchical Structured Deformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The response of many materials to applied forces and boundary constraints depends upon internal geometric changes at multiple submacroscopic levels. Hierarchical structured deformations provide a mathematical setting for the description of such changes and for the variational determination of the corresponding energetic response. The research in this article provides substantial refinements and broadenings of the mathematical setting both for the underlying geometrical structure and for the variational analysis of energetic response. The mathematical tools employed in this research include the global method for relaxation and establish the equivalence of a relaxed energy obtained via relaxation under simultaneous geometrical changes at all levels and a relaxed energy obtained via iterated relaxations proceeding from the deepest submacroscopic level successively to the macroscopic level.</description>

      <title>Spectral Gap Bounds for Quantum Markov Semigroups via Correlation Decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Starting from an arbitrary full-rank state of a lattice quantum spin system, we define a "canonical purified Hamiltonian" and characterize its spectral gap in terms of a spatial mixing condition (or correlation decay) of the state. When the state considered is a Gibbs state of a local, commuting Hamiltonian at positive temperature, we show that the spectral gap of the canonical purified Hamiltonian provides a lower bound to the spectral gap of a large class of reversible generators of quantum Markov semigroup, including local and ergodic Davies generators. As an application of our construction, we show that the mixing condition is always satisfied for any finite-range 1D model, as well as by Kitaev's quantum double models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Generalized First Law (GFL) and the Generalized Second Law (GSL) of thermodynamics are searched for effective and alternative cosmic models using the entropy as a function of the apparent area, transforming the effective cosmological model into the standard form in cosmology. The general conditions of the GSL validity are analyzed for the entropy as a general function and for logarithmic corrections to the usual Black Hole entropy. In particular, we study the GFL and the regions where the GSL is valid for an effective Loop Quantum Cosmology model with spatially flat curvature taking every possible value of the logarithmic correction factor. In addition, we explore the possibility of having negative temperature, where the validity conditions for an alternative generalized second law (AGSL) are studied.</description>

      <title>Magnetized Letelier black hole in AdS spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the motion of charged, neutral, and light-like particles in a magnetized black hole solution surrounded by a cloud of strings in an anti-de Sitter (AdS) background. This spacetime admits several well-known solutions as special cases, including the Letelier-AdS black hole, the Melvin spacetime, and the Schwarzschild-AdS black hole. We demonstrate that key parameters characterizing the geometry-such as the cloud of strings parameter, the magnetic field strength, and the AdS radius-significantly affect the trajectories of these particles. Our analysis shows that increasing the cloud of strings parameter weakens the gravitational influence, while the magnetic field introduces additional attractive components that can destabilize particle orbits. We examine the photon sphere and calculate the black hole shadow, showing that the shadow radius decreases with increasing magnetic field parameter but increases with the cloud of strings parameter. These findings provide potential observables for distinguishing between different black hole models in realistic astrophysical environments.</description>

      <title>Fully analytical propagator for lunar satellite orbits in closed form</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a fully analytical propagator for the orbits of lunar artificial satellites in a lunar gravity and third-body model sufficiently precise for a wide range of practical applications. The gravity model includes the twelve most important lunar gravity harmonics as well as the Earth's quadrupole tidal terms with a precise representation of the Earth's lunicentric ephemeris, and it gives an accuracy comparable to the way more extended semi-analytical propagator SELENA [6] for satellite orbits at altitudes from 300 to 3000 km. Extra terms of a more complete gravity model are straightforward to include using the formulas of the presently discussed analytical theory. The theory is based on deriving an approximate analytical solution of the secular part of the equations of motion using a Hamiltonian normal form in closed form. In total, we have two types of element transformations: from osculating to mean elements (as in [6]), and from mean to proper elements. The solution of the problem in proper elements is trivial, and, through the inverses of the above transformations, it allows to recover the position and velocity of a satellite analytically at any time t given initial conditions of the osculating elements at time $t_0$ without any intermediate numerical propagation. The propagator model is valid in time spans of several decades, and for every initial condition leading to no-fall on the Moon's surface, except for identified thin zones around a set of secular resonances corresponding to commensurabilities between the satellite's secular frequencies and the secular frequencies of the lunicentric Earth's orbit. Open software python and symbolic routines implementing our propagator are provided in the repository [14]. Precision tests with respect to fully numerical orbital propagation in Cartesian coordinates are reported.</description>

      <title>On the topology of the magnetic lines of large solutions to the Magnetohydrodynamic equations in $\mathbb{R}^3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The purpose of this article is twofold: first, we introduce a new class of global strong solutions to the magnetohydrodynamic system in $\mathbb{R}^3$ with initial data $(u_0,b_0)$ of arbitrarily large size in any critical space. To do so, we impose a smallness condition on the difference $u_0-b_0$. Then we use this result to prove magnetic reconnection for a suitable class of (large) solutions. With this, we mean a change of topology of the integral lines of the magnetic field $b$ under the evolution. The proof relies on counting the number of hyperbolic critical points of the solutions, and this instance is structurally stable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a probabilistic construction of imaginary Liouville Field Theory based on a real (non-compactified) Gaussian Free Field. We argue that our theory is the first explicit Lagrangian field theory that reproduces the imaginary DOZZ structure constants without requiring a neutrality constraint. Our proposal is supported by exact results for the imaginary Gaussian Multiplicative Chaos on the circle, and by numerical simulations on the sphere. In particular, we show that the three-point functions of the theory agree remarkably well with the imaginary DOZZ structure constants.</description>

      <title>The Magnus expansion for non-Hermitian Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Magnus expansion offers a method to express a time-ordered exponential as an ordinary operatorial exponential. This representation has advantageous theoretical properties, while still solving the original differential equation. For any finite dimensional Hermitian Hamiltonians, the standard Magnus expansion guarantees a manifestly unitary representation. However, this property is no longer preserved if the Hamiltonian is infinite dimensional or non-Hermitian. In this work, we derive a generalized expansion that maintains the property of unitarity for all bounded finite dimensional Hamiltonians.</description>

Abstract: The notion of complexity of quantum states is quite different from uncertainty or information contents, and involves the tradeoff between its classical and quantum features. In this work, we we introduce a quantifier of complexity of continuous-variable states, e.g. quantum optical states, based on the Husimi quasiprobability distribution. This quantity is built upon two functions of the state: the Wehrl entropy, capturing the spread of the distribution, and the Fisher information with respect to location parameters, which captures the opposite behaviour, i.e. localization in phase space. We analyze the basic properties of the quantifier and illustrate its features by evaluating complexity of Gaussian states and some relevant non-Gaussian states. We further generalize the quantifier in terms of s-ordered phase-space distributions and illustrate its implications.</description>

      <title>Bifurcation sequences in the secular 3D planetary 3-Body problem: a geometric approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10134v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We implement the geometric method proposed in ([7], [3], [12]) to analytically predict the sequence of bifurcations leading to a change of stability and/or the appearance of new periodic orbits in the secular 3D planetary three body problem. Stemming from the analysis in [13], we examine various normal form models as regards the extent to which they lead to a phase space dynamics qualitatively similar as that in the complete system. For fixed total angular momentum, the phase space in Hopf variables is the 3D sphere, and the complete sequence of bifurcations of new periodic orbits can be recovered through formulas yielding the tangencies or degenerate intersections between the sphere and the surfaces of a constant second integral of motion of the normal form flow. In particular, we find the critical values of the second integral giving rise to pitchfork and saddle-node bifurcations of new periodic orbits in the system. This analysis renders possible to predict the most important structural changes in the phase space, as well as the emergence of new possible stable periodic planetary orbital configurations which can take place as the mutual inclination between the two planets is allowed to increase.</description>

      <title>Epstein curves and holography of the Schwarzian action</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05690v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by the duality between Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity and Schwarzian field theory, we show identities between the Schwarzian action of a circle diffeomorphism and (1) the length and the hyperbolic area enclosed by the Epstein curve in the hyperbolic disk $\mathbb{D}$, (2) the asymptotic excess in the isoperimetric inequality for the equidistant Epstein foliation, (3) the variation of the Loewner energy along its equipotential foliation, and (4) the asymptotic change in hyperbolic area under a conformal distortion near the circle.
  Together with the isoperimetric inequality and the monotonicity of the Loewner energy, our identities immediately imply two new proofs of the non-negativity of the Schwarzian action for circle diffeomorphisms. Moreover, we extend the identity (1) to the dual Epstein curve in de Sitter $2$-space, to the Schwarzian action for the coadjoint orbits $\mathrm{M\"{o}b}_n (\mathbb{S}^1) \backslash \mathrm{Diff}(\mathbb{S}^1)$, and to piecewise M\"obius circle diffeomorphisms which are only $C^{1,1}$ regular.
  We also show that the horocycle truncation used in the construction of the Epstein curve defines a renormalized length of hyperbolic geodesics in $\mathbb{D}$, which coincides with the log of the bi-local observable. From this, we show that the bi-local observables on the edges of any ideal triangulation of $\mathbb{D}$ determine the circle diffeomorphism.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2008.07801v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Lukash metric is a homogeneous gravitational wave which at late times approximates the behaviour of a generic class of spatially homogenous cosmological models with monotonically decreasing energy density. The transcription from Brinkmann to Baldwin-Jeffery-Rosen (BJR) to Bianchi coordinates is presented and the relation to a Sturm-Liouville equation is explained. The 6-parameter isometry group is derived. In the Bianchi VII range of parameters we have two BJR transciptions. However using either of them induces a mere relabeling of the geodesics and isometries. Following pioneering work of Siklos, we provide a self-contained account of the geometry and global structure of the spacetime. The latter contains a Killing horizon to the future of which the spacetime resembles an anisotropic version of the Milne cosmology and to the past of which it resemble the Rindler wedge.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04149v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a general framework for multi-type interacting particle systems on graphs, where particles move one at a time by random walk steps, different types may have different speeds, and may interact, possibly randomly, when they meet. We study the equilibrium time of the process, by which we mean the number of steps taken until no further interactions can occur. Under a rather general framework, we obtain high probability upper and lower bounds on the equilibrium time that match up to a constant factor and are of order $n\log n$ if there are order $n$ vertices and particles. We also obtain similar results for the balanced two-type annihilation model of chemical reactions; here, the balanced case (equal density of types) does not fit into our general framework and makes the analysis considerably more difficult. Our models do not admit any exact solution as for integrable systems or the duality approach available for some other particle systems, so we develop a variety of combinatorial tools for comparing processes in the absence of monotonicity.</description>

      <title>Time-dependent conserved operators for autonomous systems and quantization of resistance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05115v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two systems for a charged particle are studied, the first one when it is under the effect of a constant electric field, and the second one when it is under the effect of a constant electromagnetic field. For both systems, it is possible to find time-dependent conserved operators that can be used to derive time-dependent wave functions to the complete Schr\"odinger equation, such that the time variable is not separable from the space coordinates. At the same time, these conserved operators are used to build up a unitary operators, which define the symmetries of the systems. Then, it is shown that the invariance of the wave function under the action of these unitary operators leads to the quantization of resistance as integer multiples of the Klitzing's constant.</description>

      <title>Strong well-posedness and separation properties for a bulk-surface convective Cahn--Hilliard system with singular potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14089v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the well-posedness of a general class of bulk-surface convective Cahn--Hilliard systems with singular potentials. For this model, we first prove the existence of a global-in-time weak solution by approximating the singular potentials via a Yosida regularization, applying the corresponding results for regular potentials, and eventually passing to the limit in this approximation scheme. Then, we prove the uniqueness of weak solutions and their continuous dependence on the velocity fields and the initial data. Afterwards, assuming additional regularity of the domain as well as the velocity fields, we establish higher regularity properties of weak solutions and eventually the existence of strong solutions. In the end, we discuss strict separation properties for logarithmic type potentials in both two and three dimensions.</description>

      <title>Quantum Hall edges beyond the plasma analogy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19013v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the widely used plasma analogy is unreliable at predicting edge properties of quantum Hall states. This discrepancy arises from a fundamental difference between quantum Hall droplets and plasmas (Coulomb gases): the former are incompressible liquids subject to area-preserving deformations, while the latter are governed by electrostatics and thus involve conformal transformations. Consequently, the plasma analogy fails at the edge, except in fine-tuned geometries, as it does not account for the emergent local edge velocity. We quantitatively show how the analogy's failure affects physical quantities, such as fluctuations of local observables and absorption rates in microwave spectroscopy, measurable in both solid-state experiments and quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Towards celestial chiral algebras of self-dual black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14324v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this note, we show that several self-dual spacetimes previously studied in the context of celestial and twisted holography arise as limits of a certain Taub-NUT AdS$_4$ metric, the Pedersen metric, in which their Mass, NUT charge and cosmological constant obey a self-duality relation. In particular, self-dual Taub-NUT, a singular double cover of Eguchi-Hanson space, Euclidean AdS$_4$, and non-compact $\mathbb{CP}^2$, which is conformally equivalent to Burns space, arise as special limits of the Pedersen metric. The Pedersen metric can be derived from a curved twistor space which we conjecture to arise from a backreaction of self-dual gravity in the presence of a cosmological constant when coupled to a defect operator wrapping a certain $\mathbb{CP}^1$ at infinity. The curved twistor space gives rise to a $2$-parameter deformation of the celestial symmetry algebra $Lw_\wedge$ which reduces to previously studied algebras in various limits.</description>

      <title>On the physical and mathematical foundations of quantum physics via functional integrals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16404v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In order to preserve the leading role of the action principle in formulating all field theories one needs quantum field theory, with the associated BRST symmetry, and Feynman-DeWitt-Faddeev-Popov ghost fields. Such fields result from the fibre-bundle structure of the space of histories, but the physics-oriented literature used them formally because a rigorous theory of measure and integration was lacking. Motivated by this framework, this paper exploits previous work of Gill and Zachary, where the use of Banach spaces for the Feynman integral was proposed. The Henstock-Kurzweil integral is first introduced, because it makes it possible to integrate functions like the exponential of (i times x squared). The Lebesgue measure on R(infinity) is then built and used to define the measure on every separable Hilbert space. The subsequent step is the construction of a new Hilbert space KS2, which contains square-integrable functions on R**n as a continuous dense embedding, and contains both the test functions and their dual, the Schwartz space of distributions, as continuous embeddings. This space allows us to construct the Feynman path integral in a manner that maintains its intuitive and computational advantages. We also extend this space to KS2[H], where H is any separable Banach space. Last, the existence of a unique universal definition of time, tau(h), that we call historical time, is proved. We use tau(h) as the order parameter for our construction of Feynman's time ordered operator calculus, which in turn is used to extend the path integral in order to include all time dependent groups and semigroups with a kernel.</description>

Abstract: We consider a radiation solution $\psi$ for the Helmholtz equation in an exterior region in $\mathbb R^2$. We show that $\psi$ in the exterior region is uniquely determined by its imaginary part $Im(\psi)$ on an interval of a line $L$ lying in the exterior region. This result has holographic prototype in the recent work Nair, Novikov (2025, J. Geom. Anal. 35, 123). Some other curves for measurements instead of the lines $L$ are also considered. Applications to the Gelfand-Krein-Levitan inverse problem (from boundary values of the spectral measure in $\mathbb R^2$) and to passive imaging are also indicated.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14329v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The particle with first-order dynamics proposed by Dunne, Jackiw and Trugenberger (DJT) to justify the ``Peierls substitution" is obtained by reduction from both of the planar two-parameter centrally extended Galilean and Carroll systems. In the latter case the extension parameters $\kappa_{exo}$ and $\kappa_{mag}$ generate non-commutativity of the coordinates resp. behave as an internal magnetic field. The position and momentum follow uncoupled anomalous Hall motions. Consistently with partial immobility, one of the Carroll boost generators is broken but the other remains a symmetry. Switching off $\kappa_{exo}$, the immobility of unextended Carroll particles is recovered. The Carroll system is dual to an uncharged anyon on the horizon of a black hole which exhibits the spin-Hall effect. Physical applications are shortly reviewed.</description>

      <title>Phase transition and critical behavior in hierarchical integer-valued Gaussian and Coulomb gas models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08964v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a square box $\Lambda_n\subseteq\mathbb Z^2$ of side length $L^n$ with $L,n&gt;1$, we study hierarchical random fields $\{\phi_x\colon x\in\Lambda_n\}$ with law proportional to ${\rm e}^{\frac12\beta(\phi,\Delta_n\phi)}\prod_{x\in\Lambda_n}\nu({\rm d}\phi_x)$, where $\beta&gt;0$ is the inverse temperature, $\Delta_n$ is a hierarchical Laplacian on $\Lambda_n$, and $\nu$ is a non-degenerate $1$-periodic measure on $\mathbb R$. Our setting includes the integer-valued Gaussian field (a.k.a. DG model or Villain Coulomb gas) and the sine-Gordon model. Relying on renormalization group analysis we derive sharp asymptotic formulas, in the limit as $n\to\infty$, for the covariance $\langle\phi_x\phi_y\rangle$ and the fractional charge $\langle {\rm e}^{2\pi {\rm i}\alpha(\phi_x-\phi_y)}\rangle$ in the subcritical $\beta&lt;\beta_{\rm c}:=\pi^2/\log L$, critical $\beta=\beta_{\rm c}$ and slightly supercritical $\beta&gt;\beta_{\rm c}$ regimes. The field exhibits logarithmic correlations throughout albeit with a distinct $\beta$-dependence of both the covariance scale and the fractional-charge exponents in the sub/supercritical regimes. Explicit logarithmic corrections appear at the critical point.</description>

Abstract: We describe the scattering of particles by a sandwich gravitational wave generated during a flyby using an analytical approach. The derivative-of-the-Gaussian profile proposed by Gibbons and Hawking is approximated by the hyperbolic scarf potential, which allows for an exact analytic solution via the Nikiforov-Uvarov method. Our results confirm the prediction of Zel'dovich and Polnarev about certain ``magical" amplitudes of the potential.</description>

      <title>Explicit Pfaffian Formula for Amplitudes of Fermionic Gaussian Pure States in Arbitrary Pauli Bases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04857v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The explicit computation of amplitudes for fermionic Gaussian pure states in arbitrary Pauli bases is a long-standing challenge in quantum many-body physics, with significant implications for quantum tomography, experimental studies, and quantum dynamics. These calculations are essential for analyzing complex properties beyond traditional measures, such as formation probabilities, global entanglement, and entropy in non-standard bases, where exact and computationally efficient methods remain underdeveloped. In addition to these physical applications, having explicit formulas is crucial for optimizing negative log-likelihood functions in quantum tomography, a key task in the NISQ era. In this work, we present an explicit Pfaffian formula (Theorem 1) for determining these amplitudes in arbitrary Pauli bases, utilizing a matrix whose structure reflects the qubit parity. Additionally, we introduce a recursive relation (Theorem 2) that connects amplitudes for systems with varying qubit numbers, enabling scalable computations for large systems. Together, these results provide a versatile framework for studying global entanglement, Shannon-R\'enyi entropies, formation probabilities, and performing efficient quantum tomography, thereby significantly expanding the computational toolkit for analyzing complex quantum systems. Finally, we utilize our formalism to determine the post-measurement entanglement entropy, reflecting how local measurements alter entanglement, and compare the outcomes with conformal field theory predictions.</description>

      <title>Thermal origin of the attractor-to-general-relativity in scalar-tensor gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18272v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The convergence of scalar-tensor gravity to general relativity, or the departure from it, are described in a new analogy with heat dissipation in a viscous fluid. This new thermal picture is applied to cosmology, shedding light on whether gravity deviates from general relativity early on and approaches it later in the cosmic history.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic correlation inequalities for finite times and transients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10599v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, a thermodynamic bound on correlation times was formulated in [A. Dechant, J. Garnier-Brun, S.-i. Sasa, Phys. Rev. Lett. 131, 167101 (2023)], showing how the decay of correlations in Langevin dynamics is bounded by short-time fluctuations and dissipation. Whereas these original results only address very long observation times in steady-state dynamics, we here generalize the respective inequalities to finite observations and general initial conditions. We utilize the connection between correlations and the fluctuations of time-integrated density functionals and generalize the direct stochastic calculus approach from [C. Dieball and A. Godec, Phys. Rev. Lett. 130, 087101 (2023)] which paves the way for further generalizations. We address the connection between short and long time scales, as well as the saturation of the bounds via complementary spectral-theoretic arguments. Motivated by the spectral insight, we formulate all results also for complex-valued observables.</description>

      <title>Beyond Robertson-Schr\"odinger: A General Uncertainty Relation Unveiling Hidden Noncommutative Trade-offs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20404v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report a universal strengthening of the Robertson-Schr\''odinger uncertainty relation, revealing a previously overlooked trade-off of genuinely quantum origin, particularly as the state becomes more mixed. Remarkably, this generalized bound supplements the standard commutator term and the covariance term with an additional positive contribution that depends on the commutator of observables. The relation also rigorously proves and extends a conjectured uncertainty relation previously proposed in [Phys. Rev. A 110, 062215 (2024)]. For two-level quantum systems, the inequality becomes an exact equality for any state and any pair of observables, establishing that the bound is tight in the strongest possible sense.</description>
