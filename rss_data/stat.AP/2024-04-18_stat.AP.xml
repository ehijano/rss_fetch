      <title>Decomposition of Longitudinal Disparities: an Application to the Fetal Growth-Singletons Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Addressing health disparities among different demographic groups is a key challenge in public health. Despite many efforts, there is still a gap in understanding how these disparities unfold over time. Our paper focuses on this overlooked longitudinal aspect, which is crucial in both clinical and public health settings. In this paper, we introduce a longitudinal disparity decomposition method that decomposes disparities into three components: the explained disparity linked to differences in the exploratory variables' conditional distribution when the modifier distribution is identical between majority and minority groups, the explained disparity that emerges specifically from the unequal distribution of the modifier and its interaction with covariates, and the unexplained disparity. The proposed method offers a dynamic alternative to the traditional Peters-Belson decomposition approach, tackling both the potential reduction in disparity if the covariate distributions of minority groups matched those of the majority group and the evolving nature of disparity over time. We apply the proposed approach to a fetal growth study to gain insights into disparities between different race/ethnicity groups in fetal developmental progress throughout the course of pregnancy.</description>

      <title>Associations between pain-management treatments and opioid use disorder risk among Medicaid patients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Introduction: Chronic pain patients are at increased risk of opioid-misuse. Less is known about the unique risk conferred by each pain-management treatment, as treatments are typically implemented together, confounding their independent effects. We estimated the extent to which pain-management strategies were associated with risk of incident opioid use disorder (OUD) for those with chronic pain, controlling for baseline demographic and clinical confounding variables and holding other pain-management treatments at their observed levels.
  Methods: We used data from two chronic pain subgroups within a cohort of non-pregnant Medicaid patients aged 35-64 years, 2016-2019, from 25 states: 1) those with a chronic pain condition co-morbid with physical disability (N=6,133) or 2) those with chronic pain without disability (N=67,438). We considered 9 pain-management treatments: prescription opioid i) dose and ii) duration; iii) number of opioid prescribers; opioid co-prescription with iv) benzodiazepines, v) muscle relaxants, and vi) gabapentinoids; vii) non-opioid pain prescription, viii) physical therapy, and ix) other pain treatment modality. Our outcome was incident OUD.
  Results: Having an opioid and gabapentin co-prescription or an opioid and benzodiazepine co-prescription was statistically significantly associated with a 16-46% increased risk of OUD. Opioid dose and duration also were significantly associated with increased risk of OUD. Physical therapy was significantly associated with an 11% decreased risk of OUD in the subgroup with chronic pain but no disability.
  Conclusions: Co-prescription of opioids with either gabapentin or benzodiazepines may substantially increase risk of OUD. More positively, physical therapy may be a relatively accessible and safe pain-management strategy.</description>

      <title>Corrected Correlation Estimates for Meta-Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Meta-analysis allows rigorous aggregation of estimates and uncertainty across multiple studies. When a given study reports multiple estimates, such as log odds ratios (ORs) or log relative risks (RRs) across exposure groups, accounting for within-study correlations improves accuracy and efficiency of meta-analytic results. Canonical approaches of Greenland-Longnecker and Hamling estimate pseudo cases and non-cases for exposure groups to obtain within-study correlations. However, currently available implementations for both methods fail on simple examples.
  We review both GL and Hamling methods through the lens of optimization. For ORs, we provide modifications of each approach that ensure convergence for any feasible inputs. For GL, this is achieved through a new connection to entropic minimization. For Hamling, a modification leads to a provably solvable equivalent set of equations given a specific initialization. For each, we provide implementations a guaranteed to work for any feasible input.
  For RRs, we show the new GL approach is always guaranteed to succeed, but any Hamling approach may fail: we give counter-examples where no solutions exist. We derive a sufficient condition on reported RRs that guarantees success when reported variances are all equal.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric canonical correlation analysis of Riemannian and high-dimensional data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel statistical model for the integrative analysis of Riemannian-valued functional data and high-dimensional data. We apply this model to explore the dependence structure between each subject's dynamic functional connectivity -- represented by a temporally indexed collection of positive definite covariance matrices -- and high-dimensional data representing lifestyle, demographic, and psychometric measures. Specifically, we employ a reformulation of canonical correlation analysis that enables efficient control of the complexity of the functional canonical directions using tangent space sieve approximations. Additionally, we enforce an interpretable group structure on the high-dimensional canonical directions via a sparsity-promoting penalty. The proposed method shows improved empirical performance over alternative approaches and comes with theoretical guarantees. Its application to data from the Human Connectome Project reveals a dominant mode of covariation between dynamic functional connectivity and lifestyle, demographic, and psychometric measures. This mode aligns with results from static connectivity studies but reveals a unique temporal non-stationary pattern that such studies fail to capture.</description>
