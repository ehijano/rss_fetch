      <title>A Personalised Learning Tool for Physics Undergraduate Students Built On a Large Language Model for Symbolic Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interleaved practice enhances the memory and problem-solving ability of students in undergraduate courses. We introduce a personalized learning tool built on a Large Language Model (LLM) that can provide immediate and personalized attention to students as they complete homework containing problems interleaved from undergraduate physics courses. Our tool leverages the dimensional analysis method, enhancing students' qualitative thinking and problem-solving skills for complex phenomena. Our approach combines LLMs for symbolic regression with dimensional analysis via prompt engineering and offers students a unique perspective to comprehend relationships between physics variables. This fosters a broader and more versatile understanding of physics and mathematical principles and complements a conventional undergraduate physics education that relies on interpreting and applying established equations within specific contexts. We test our personalized learning tool on the equations from Feynman's lectures on physics. Our tool can correctly identify relationships between physics variables for most equations, underscoring its value as a complementary personalized learning tool for undergraduate physics students.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Faculty Online Learning Community Interactions Using Social Network Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Expanding on other work in the Physics Education Community, we apply Social Network Analysis to a Faculty Online Learning Community focused on facilitating the integration of computation into physics courses. The Partnership for Integration of Computation into Undergraduate Physics (PICUP) uses Slack as a mechanism for continued communication beyond face-to-face meetings. Through our analysis, we use networks to represent the Slack channels, identify lurkers, and use metrics to quantify pariticipation. Additionally, we use randomization techniques to understand how similar our metric values are to networks of similar size and distribution. We highlight the need for using the appropriate randomization model and assumption checking. We characterize participation amongst users in the network and provide potential reasonings for their actions.</description>

      <title>Student reasoning about quantum mechanics while working with physical experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Instruction in quantum mechanics is becoming increasingly important as the field is not only a key part of modern physics research, but is also important for emerging technologies. However, many students regard quantum mechanics as a particularly challenging subject, in part because it is considered very mathematical and abstract. One potential way to help students understand and contextualize unintuitive quantum ideas is to provide them opportunities to work with physical apparatus demonstrating these phenomena. In order to understand how working with quantum experiments affects students' reasoning, we performed think-aloud lab sessions of two pairs of students as they worked through a sequence of quantum optics experiments that demonstrated particle-wave duality of photons. Analyzing the in-the-moment student thinking allowed us to identify the resources students activated while reasoning through the experimental evidence of single-photon interference, as well as student ideas about what parts of the experiments were quantum versus classical. This work will aid instructors in helping their students construct an understanding of these topics from their own ideas and motivate future investigations into the use of hands-on opportunities to facilitate student learning about quantum mechanics.</description>
