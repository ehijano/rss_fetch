      <title>Bis(stearoyl) Sulfide: A Stable, Odor-free Sulfur Precursor for High-Efficiency Metal Sulfide Quantum Dot Photovoltaics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The synthesis of metal sulfide nanocrystals is a crucial step in the fabrication of quantum dot (QD) photovoltaics. Control over the quantum dot size during synthesis allows for precise tuning of their optical and electronic properties, making them an appealing choice for electronic applications. This flexibility has led to the implementation of quantum dots in both highly-efficient single junction solar cells and other optoelectronic devices including photodetectors and transistors. Most commonly, metal sulfide quantum dots are synthesized using the hot-injection method utilizing toxic, and air- and moisture sensitive sulfur source: bis(trimethylsilyl) sulfide (TMS)2S. Here, we present bis(stearoyl) sulfide (St2S) as a new type of air-stable sulfur precursor for the synthesis of sulfide-based QDs, which yields uniform, pure, and stable nanocrystals. Photovoltaic devices based on these QDs are equally efficient as those fabricated by (TMS)2S but exhibit an enhanced operational stability. These results highlight that St2S can be widely adopted for the synthesis of metal sulfide quantum dots for a range of optoelectronic applications.</description>

      <title>Remarkable performance recovery in highly defective perovskite solar cells by photo-oxidation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exposure to environmental factors is generally expected to cause degradation in perovskite films and solar cells. Herein, we show that films with certain defect profiles can display the opposite effect, healing upon exposure to oxygen under illumination. We tune the iodine content of methylammonium lead triiodide perovskite from understoichiometric to overstoichiometric and expose them to oxygen and light prior to the addition of the top layers of the device, thereby examining the defect dependence of their photooxidative response in the absence of storage-related chemical processes. The contrast between the photovoltaic properties of the cells with different defects is stark. Understoichiometric samples indeed degrade, demonstrating performance at 33% of their untreated counterparts, while stoichiometric samples maintain their performance levels. Surprisingly, overstoichiometric samples, which show low current density and strong reverse hysteresis when untreated, heal to maximum performance levels (the same as untreated, stoichiometric samples) upon the photooxidative treatment. A similar, albeit smaller-scale, effect is observed for triple cation and methylammonium-free compositions, demonstrating the general application of this treatment to state-of-the-art compositions. We examine the reasons behind this response by a suite of characterization techniques, finding that the performance changes coincide with microstructural decay at the crystal surface, reorientation of the bulk crystal structure for the understoichiometric cells, and a decrease in the iodine-to-lead ratio of all films. These results indicate that defect engineering is a powerful tool to manipulate the stability of perovskite solar cells.</description>

      <title>Towards low-temperature processing of efficient $\gamma$-CsPbI$_3$ perovskite solar cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inorganic cesium lead iodide (CsPbI$_3$) perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted enormous attention due to their excellent thermal stability and optical bandgap (~1.73 eV), well-suited for tandem device applications. However, achieving high-performing photovoltaic devices processed at low temperatures is still challenging. Here we reported a new method to fabricate high-efficiency and stable $\gamma$-CsPbI$_3$ PSCs at lower temperatures than was previously possible by introducing the long-chain organic cation salt ethane-1,2-diammonium iodide (EDAI2) and regulating the content of lead acetate (Pb(OAc)2) in the perovskite precursor solution. We find that EDAI2 acts as an intermediate that can promote the formation of $\gamma$-CsPbI$_3$, while excess Pb(OAc)2 can further stabilize the $\gamma$-phase of CsPbI$_3$ perovskite. Consequently, improved crystallinity and morphology and reduced carrier recombination are observed in the CsPbI$_3$ films fabricated by the new method. By optimizing the hole transport layer of CsPbI$_3$ inverted architecture solar cells, we demonstrate up to 16.6% efficiencies, surpassing previous reports examining $\gamma$-CsPbI$_3$ in inverted PSCs. Notably, the encapsulated solar cells maintain 97% of their initial efficiency at room temperature and dim light for 25 days, demonstrating the synergistic effect of EDAI2 and Pb(OAc)2 on stabilizing $\gamma$-CsPbI$_3$ PSCs.</description>

      <title>Solvent-antisolvent interactions in metal halide perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fabrication of metal halide perovskite films using the solvent-engineering method is increasingly common. In this method, the crystallisation of the perovskite layer is triggered by the application of an antisolvent during the spin-coating of a perovskite precursor solution. Herein, we introduce the current state of understanding of the processes involved in the crystallisation of perovskite layers formed by solvent engineering, focusing in particular on the role of antisolvent properties and solvent-antisolvent interactions. By considering the impact of the Hansen solubility parameters, we propose guidelines for selecting the appropriate antisolvent and outline open questions and future research directions for the fabrication of perovskite films by this method.</description>

      <title>Robust Quasi-Bound States in the continuum: Accidental and Symmetry-Protected Variants in Dielectric Metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, man-made dielectric materials composed of finite-sized dielectric constituents have emerged as a promising platform for quasi-bound states in the continuum (QBICs). These states allow for an extraordinary confinement of light within regions smaller than the wavelength scale. Known for their exceptional quality factors, they have become crucial assets across a diverse array of applications. Given the circumstances, there is a compelling drive to find meta-designs that can possess multiple QBICs. Here, we demonstrate the existence of two different types of QBICs in silicon-based metasurfaces: accidental QBIC and symmetry-protected QBIC. The accidental QBIC evinces notable resilience to variations in geometrical parameters and symmetry, underscoring its capacity to adeptly navigate manufacturing tolerances while consistently upholding a distinguished quality factor of $10^5$. Conversely, the symmetry-protected QBIC inherently correlates with the disruption of unit cell symmetry. As a result, a phase delay yields an efficient channel for substantial energy transference to the continuum, endowing this variant with an exceedingly high quality factor, approaching $10^8$. Moreover, the manifestation of these QBICs stems from the intricate interplay among out-of-plane electric and magnetic dipoles, alongside in-plane quadrupoles exhibiting odd parities.</description>

      <title>Tunable magnetism in bilayer transition metal dichalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Twist between neighboring layers and variation of interlayer distance are two extra ways to control the physical properties of stacked two-dimensional van der Waals materials without alteration of chemical compositions or application of external fields, compared to their monolayer counterparts. In this work, we explored the dependence of the magnetic states of the untwisted and twisted bilayer 1T-VX$_2$ (X = S, Se) on the interlayer distance by density functional theory calculations. We find that, while a magnetic phase transition occurs from interlayer ferromagnetism to interlayer antiferromagnetism either as a function of decreasing interlayer distance for the untwisted bilayer 1T-VX$_2$ or after twist, richer magnetic phase transitions consecutively take place for the twisted bilayer 1T-VX$_2$ as interlayer distance is gradually reduced. Besides, the critical pressures for the phase transition are greatly reduced in twisted bilayer 1T-VX$_2$ compared with the untwisted case. We derived the Heisenberg model with intralayer and interlayer exchange couplings to comprehend the emergence of various magnetic states. Our results point out an easy access towards tunable two-dimensional magnets.</description>

      <title>Quantum simulation of honeycomb lattice model by high-order moir\'e pattern</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Moir\'e superlattices have become an emergent solid-state platform for simulating quantum lattice models. However, in single moir\'e device, Hamiltonians parameters like lattice constant, hopping and interaction terms can hardly be manipulated, limiting the controllability and accessibility of moire quantum simulator. Here, by combining angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that high-order moir\'e patterns in graphene-monolayered xenon/krypton heterostructures can simulate honeycomb model in mesoscale, with in-situ tunable Hamiltonians parameters. The length scale of simulated lattice constant can be tuned by annealing processes, which in-situ adjusts intervalley interaction and hopping parameters in the simulated honeycomb lattice. The sign of the lattice constant can be switched by choosing xenon or krypton monolayer deposited on graphene, which controls sublattice degree of freedom and valley arrangment of Dirac fermions. Our work establishes a novel path for experimentally simulating the honeycomb model with tunable parameters by high-order moir\'e patterns.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised learning approach to quantum wavepacket dynamics from coupled temporal-spatial correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding complex quantum dynamics in realistic materials requires insight into the underlying correlations dominating the interactions between the participating particles. Due to the wealth of information involved in these processes, applying artificial intelligence methods is compelling. Yet, unsupervised data-driven approaches typically focus on maximal variations of the individual components, rather than considering the correlations between them. Here we present an approach that recognizes correlation patterns to explore convoluted dynamical processes. Our scheme is using singular value decomposition (SVD) to extract dynamical features, unveiling the internal temporal-spatial interrelations that generate the dynamical mechanisms. We apply our approach to study light-induced wavepacket propagation in organic crystals, of interest for applications in material based quantum computing and quantum information science. We show how transformation from the input momentum and time coordinates onto a new correlation-induced coordinate space allows direct recognition of the relaxation and dephasing components dominating the dynamics and demonstrate their dependence on the initial pulse shape. Entanglement of the dynamical features is suggested as a pathway to reproduce the information required for further explainability of these mechanisms. Our method offers a route for elucidating complex dynamical processes using unsupervised AI-based analysis in multi-component systems.</description>

      <title>First-principles study of phase transition in cadmium titanate by molecular dynamics incorporating nuclear quantum effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: First-principles molecular dynamics (FPMD) simulations were applied for the paraelectric-ferroelectric phase transition in the perovskite-type cadmium titanate, CdTiO3. Since the phase transition is reported to occur at the low temperature around 80 K, the quantum thermal bath (QTB) method was utilized in this study, which incorporates the nuclear quantum effects (NQEs). The structural evolutions in the QTB-FPMD simulations are in reasonable agreement with the experimental results, by contrast in the conventional FPMD simulations using the classical thermal bath (CTB-FPMD). According to our phonon calculations, volume expansion is the key in the stabilization of the ferroelectric phase at low temperatures, which was well reproduced in the QTB-FPMD with the NQEs. Thus, the NQEs are of importance in phase transitions at low temperatures, particularly below the room temperature, and the QTB is useful in that it incorporates the NQEs in MD simulations with low computational costs comparable to the conventional CTB.</description>

      <title>Green and Solid State Reduction of GO Monolayers Sandwiched between Arachidic Acid LB Layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel, single step and environment friendly solid state approach for reduction of graphene oxide (GO) monolayers has been demonstrated, in which, arachidic acid-GO-arachidic acid (AA-GO-AA) sandwich structure obtained by Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) technique was heat treated at moderate temperatures to obtain RGO sheets. Heat treatment of AA-GO-AA sandwich structure at 200 C results in substantial reduction of GO, with concurrent removal of AA molecules. Such developed RGO sheets possess sp2-C content of 69%, O/C ratio of 0.17 and significantly reduced I(D) and I(G) ratio of ~1.1. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) studies on RGO sheets evidenced significant increase in density of states in immediate vicinity of Fermi level and decrease in work function after reduction. Bottom gated field effect transistors fabricated with isolated RGO sheets displayed charge neutrality point at a positive gate voltage, indicating p-type nature, consistent with UPS and electrostatic force microscopy (EFM) measurement results.The RGO sheets obtained by heat treatment of AA-GO-AA sandwich structure exhibited conductivity in the range of 2-7Scm-1 and field effect mobility of 0.03-2cm2V-1s-1, which are consistent with values reported for RGO sheets obtained by various chemical or thermal reduction procedures.The extent of GO reduction is determined primarily by proximity of AA molecules and found to be unaltered with either escalation of heat treatment temperature or increase of AA content in sandwich structure. The single-step GO reduction approach demonstrated in this work is an effective way for development of RGO monolayers with high structural quality towards graphene-based electronic device applications.</description>

      <title>Optical anisotropy of the kagome magnet FeSn: Dominant role of excitations between kagome and Sn layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Antiferromagnetic FeSn is considered to be a close realization of the ideal two-dimensional (2D) kagome lattice, hosting Dirac cones, van Hove singularities, and flat bands, as it comprises Fe$_3$Sn kagome layers well separated by Sn buffer layers. We observe a pronounced optical anisotropy, with the low-energy optical conductivity being surprisingly higher perpendicular to the kagome planes than along the layers. This finding contradicts the prevalent picture of dominantly 2D electronic structure for FeSn. Our material-specific theory reproduces the measured conductivity spectra remarkarbly well. A site-specific decomposition of the optical response to individual excitation channels shows that the optical conductivity for polarizations both parallel and perpendicular to the kagome plane is dominated by interlayer transitions between kagome layers and adjacent Sn-based layers. Moreover, the matrix elements corresponding to these transitions are highly anisotropic, leading to larger out-of-plane conductivity. Our results evidence the crucial role of interstitial layers in charge dynamics even in seemingly 2D systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical manipulation of magnetism holds promise for future ultrafast spintronics, especially with lanthanides and their huge, localized 4f magnetic moments. These moments interact indirectly via the conduction electrons (RKKY exchange), influenced by interatomic orbital overlap, and the conduction electron susceptibility. Here, we study this influence in a series of 4f antiferromagnets, GdT2Si2 (T=Co, Rh, Ir), using ultrafast resonant X-ray diffraction. We observe a twofold increase in ultrafast angular momentum transfer between the materials, originating from modifications in the conduction electron susceptibility, as confirmed by first-principles calculations.</description>

      <title>TMM$-$Sim: A Versatile Tool for Optical Simulation of Thin$-$Film Solar Cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Transfer Matrix Method (TMM) has become a prominent tool for the optical simulation of thin$-$film solar cells, particularly among researchers specializing in organic semiconductors and perovskite materials. As the commercial viability of these solar cells continues to advance, driven by rapid developments in materials and production processes, the importance of optical simulation has grown significantly. By leveraging optical simulation, researchers can gain profound insights into photovoltaic phenomena, empowering the implementation of device optimization strategies to achieve enhanced performance. However, existing TMM$-$based packages exhibit limitations, such as requiring programming expertise, licensing fees, or lack of support for bilayer device simulation. In response to these gaps and challenges, we present the TMM Simulator (TMM$-$Sim), an intuitive and user$-$friendly tool to calculate essential photovoltaic parameters, including the optical electric field profile, exciton generation profile, fraction of light absorbed per layer, photocurrent, external quantum efficiency, internal quantum efficiency, and parasitic losses. An additional advantage of TMM$-$Sim lies in its capacity to generate outcomes suitable as input parameters for electro$-$optical device simulations. In this work, we offer a comprehensive guide, outlining a step$-$by$-$step process to use TMM$-$Sim, and provide a thorough analysis of the results. TMM$-$Sim is freely available, accessible through our web server (nanocalc.org), or downloadable from the TMM$-$Sim repository (for \textit{Unix}, \textit{Windows}, and \textit{macOS}) on \textit{GitHub}. With its user$-$friendly interface and powerful capabilities, TMM$-$Sim aims to facilitate and accelerate research in thin$-$film solar cells, fostering advancements in renewable energy technologies.</description>

      <title>Attosecond dynamics of electron scattering by an absorbing layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Attosecond dynamics of electron reflection from a thin film is studied based on a one-dimensional jellium model. Following the Eisenbud-Wigner-Smith concept, the reflection time delay $\Delta\tau_{\rm R}$ is calculated as the energy derivative of the phase of the complex reflection amplitude $r$. For a purely elastic scattering by a jellium slab of a finite thickness $d$ the transmission probability $T$ oscillates with the momentum $K$ in the solid with a period $\pi/d$, and $\Delta\tau_{\rm R}$ closely follows these oscillations. The reflection delay averaged over an energy interval grows with $d$, but in the limit of $d\to\infty$ the amplitude $r$ becomes real, so $\Delta\tau_{\rm R}$ vanishes. This picture changes substantially with the inclusion of an absorbing potential $-iV_{\rm i}$: As expected, for a sufficiently thick slab the reflection amplitude now tends to its asymptotic value for a semi-infinite crystal. Interestingly, for $V_{\rm i} \ne 0$, around the $T(E)$ maxima, the $\Delta\tau_{\rm R}(E)$ curve strongly deviates from $T(E)$, showing a narrow dip just at the $\Delta\tau_{\rm R}(E)$ maximum for $V_{\rm i}=0$. An analytical theory of this counterintuitive behavior is developed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe a method for modeling the geometry of porous materials. The approach enables the independent selection of crucial parameters, including porosity, pore size distribution, pore shape, and connectivity. Consequently, it can effectively model a wide range of porous systems. Due to the diverse and systematic variation possibilities, the method is suitable for developing and optimizing porous structures. The geometries can be exported as triangular meshes, facilitating their immediate use in numerical simulation and further digital processing. We showcase the method's capabilities by minimizing the foam structure's thermal conductivity through geometry optimization.</description>

      <title>Spin-Valve-Like Magnetoresistance and Anomalous Hall Effect in Magnetic Weyl Metal Mn$_2$PdSn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Realization of noncentrosymmetric magnetic Weyl metals is expected to exhibit anomalous transport properties stemming from the interplay of unusual bulk electronic topology and magnetism. Here, we present spin-valve-like magnetoresistance at room temperature in ferrimagneticWeyl metal Mn$_2$PdSn that crystallizes in the inverse Heusler structure. Anomalous magnetoresistance display dominant asymmetric component attributed to domain wall electron scattering, indicative of spin-valve-like behavior. Ab initio calculations confirm the topologically non-trivial nature of the band structure, with three pairs of Weyl nodes proximate to the Fermi level, providing deeper insights into the observed intrinsic Berry curvature mediated substantial anomalous Hall conductivity. Our results underscore the inverse Heusler compounds as promising platform to realize magnetic Weyl metals/semimetals and leverage emergent transport properties for electronic functionalities.</description>

      <title>Investigation of Spin-Pumping and -Transport in the Ni80Fe20/Pt/Co Asymmetric Trilayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: FM1/NM/FM2 trilayers have garnered considerable attention because of their potential in spintronic applications. A thorough investigation of the spin transport properties of these trilayers is therefore important. Asymmetric trilayers, particularly those including Platinum (Pt) as a spacer are less explored. Pt mediates exchange coupling between the two FM layers and thus offers a unique platform to investigate the spin-transport properties under indirect exchange coupling conditions through the spin-pumping mechanism. Our analytical focus on the acoustic mode of the ferromagnetic resonance spectrum, facilitated by the distinct magnetizations of the Ni80Fe20 and Co layers, allows for the isolation of individual layer resonances. The derived spin-pumping induced damping of the Ni80Fe20 and Co layers reveals a direct dependence on the Pt spacer thickness. Furthermore, fitting of the weighted average of the damping parameters to the spin-pumping induced damping of acoustic mode reveals that the observed FMR spectra is indeed a result of the in-phase precession of the magnetizations in two FM layers. The extracted effective spin-mixing conductance varies with the FM/NM interface, specifically 1.72x10^19 m^(-2) at the Ni80Fe20/Pt and 4.07x10^19 m^(-2) at the Co/Pt interface, indicating a strong correlation with interfacial characteristics. Additionally, we deduce the spin diffusion length in Pt to be between 1.02 and 1.55 nm and calculate the interfacial spin transparency and spin current densities, highlighting significant disparities between the Ni80Fe20/Pt and Co/Pt interfaces. This detailed analysis enhances our understanding of spin transport in Ni80Fe20/Pt/Co trilayers. It offers insights important for advancing spintronic device design and lays the groundwork for future theoretical investigations of trilayer system.</description>

      <title>Hot Carrier Organic Solar Cells</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hot-carrier solar cells use the photon excess energy, that is, the energy exceeding the absorber bandgap, to do additional work. These devices have the potential to beat the upper limit for the photovoltaic power conversion efficiency set by near-equilibrium thermodynamics. However, since their conceptual inception in 1982, making this concept work under practical conditions has proven a tremendous hurdle, mostly due to the fast thermalization of photo-generated charges in typical semiconductor materials like silicon. Here, we use noise spectroscopy in combination with numerical modelling to show that common bulk heterojunction organic solar cells actually work as hot-carrier devices. Due to static energetic disorder, thermalization of photo-generated electrons and holes in the global density of states is slow compared to the charge carrier lifetime, leading to thermal populations of localized charge carriers that have an electronic temperature exceeding the lattice temperature. Since charge extraction takes place in a high-lying, narrow energy window around the transport energy, the latter takes the role of an energy filter. For common disorder values, this leads to substantial enhancements in open circuit voltage. We expect these results to inspire new strategies to more efficiently convert solar energy into electricity.</description>

      <title>Information theory unifies atomistic machine learning, uncertainty quantification, and materials thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An accurate description of information is relevant for a range of problems in atomistic modeling, such as sampling methods, detecting rare events, analyzing datasets, or performing uncertainty quantification (UQ) in machine learning (ML)-driven simulations. Although individual methods have been proposed for each of these tasks, they lack a common theoretical background integrating their solutions. Here, we introduce an information theoretical framework that unifies predictions of phase transformations, kinetic events, dataset optimality, and model-free UQ from atomistic simulations, thus bridging materials modeling, ML, and statistical mechanics. We first demonstrate that, for a proposed representation, the information entropy of a distribution of atom-centered environments is a surrogate value for thermodynamic entropy. Using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we show that information entropy differences from trajectories can be used to build phase diagrams, identify rare events, and recover classical theories of nucleation. Building on these results, we use this general concept of entropy to quantify information in datasets for ML interatomic potentials (IPs), informing compression, explaining trends in testing errors, and evaluating the efficiency of active learning strategies. Finally, we propose a model-free UQ method for MLIPs using information entropy, showing it reliably detects extrapolation regimes, scales to millions of atoms, and goes beyond model errors. This method is made available as the package QUESTS: Quick Uncertainty and Entropy via STructural Similarity, providing a new unifying theory for data-driven atomistic modeling and combining efforts in ML, first-principles thermodynamics, and simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The fractional diffraction optics theory has been elaborated using the Green function technique. The optics-fractional equation describing the diffraction X-ray scattering by imperfect crystals has been derived as the fractional matrix integral Fredholm--Volterra equation of the second kind. In the paper, to solve the Cauchy problems, the Liouville--Neumann-type series formalism has been used to build up the matrix Resolvent-function solution. In the case when the imperfect crystal-lattice elastic displacement field is the linear function $f({\bf R}) = a x+b$, $a, b = const,$ the explicit solution of the diffraction-optics Cauchy problem has been obtained and analyzed for arbitrary fractional-order-parameter $\alpha$, $\alpha\in (0, 1].$</description>

      <title>Quantized Acoustoelectric Floquet Effect in Quantum Nanowires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: External coherent fields can drive quantum materials into non-equilibrium states, revealing exotic properties that are unattainable under equilibrium conditions -- an approach known as ``Floquet engineering.'' While optical lasers have commonly been used as the driving fields, recent advancements have introduced nontraditional sources, such as coherent phonon drives. Building on this progress, we demonstrate that driving a metallic quantum nanowire with a coherent wave of terahertz phonons can induce an electronic steady state characterized by a persistent quantized current along the wire. The quantization of the current is achieved due to the coupling of electrons to the nanowire's vibrational modes, providing the low-temperature heat bath and energy relaxation mechanisms. Our findings underscore the potential of using non-optical drives, such as coherent phonon sources, to induce non-equilibrium phenomena in materials. Furthermore, our approach suggests a new method for the high-precision detection of coherent phonon oscillations via transport measurements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze both the general symmetry-related and more microscopic considerations that govern the Josephson tunneling across a finite planar junction between a known $s$-wave superconductor and a candidate unconventional superconductor (e.g., $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave). Due to the finite size of the probe, the Josephson current possesses an edge contribution, which is shown to be the dominant contribution under certain conditions. Thus, the dependence of the edge contribution on the geometry of the junction can serve as a direct probe of the symmetry of the order parameter in the unconventional superconductor.</description>

      <title>Magnetic structure and component-separated transitions of HoNiSi$_{3}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: HoNiSi$_{3}$ is an intermetallic compound characterized by two successive antiferromagnetic transitions at $T_{N1} = 6.3$ K and $T_{N2} = 10.4$ K. Here, its zero-field microscopic magnetic structure is inferred from resonant x-ray magnetic diffraction experiments on a single crystalline sample that complement previous bulk magnetic susceptibility data. For $T &lt; T_{N2}$, the primitive magnetic unit cell matches the chemical cell. The magnetic structure features ferromagnetic {\it ac} planes stacked in an antiferromagnetic $\uparrow \downarrow \uparrow \downarrow$ pattern. For $T_{N1} &lt; T &lt; T_{N2}$, the ordered magnetic moment points along $\vec{a}$, and for $T &lt; T_{N1}$ a component along $\vec{c}$ also orders. A symmetry analysis indicates that the magnetic structure for $T&lt;T_{N1}$ is not compatible with the presumed orthorhombic $Cmmm$ space group of the chemical structure, and therefore a slight lattice distortion is implied. Mean-field calculations using a simplified magnetic Hamiltonian, including a reduced set of three independent exchange coupling parameters determined by density functional theory calculations and two crystal electric field terms taken as free-fitting parameters, are able to reproduce the main experimental observations. An alternative approach using a more complete model including seven exchange coupling and nine crystal electric field terms is also explored, where the search of the ground state magnetic structure compatible with the available anisotropic magnetic susceptibility and magnetization data is carried out with the help of an unsupervised machine learning algorithm. The possible magnetic configurations are grouped into five clusters, and the cluster that yields the best comparison with the experimental macroscopic data contains the parameters previously found with the simplified model and also predicts the correct ground-state magnetic structure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Dyakonov-Perel (DP) mechanism of spin relaxation has long been considered irrelevant in centrosymmetric systems since it was developed originally for non-centrosymmetric ones. We investigate whether this conventional understanding extends to the realm of orbital relaxation, which has recently attracted significant attention. Surprisingly, we find that orbital relaxation in centrosymmetric systems exhibits the DP-like behavior in the weak scattering regime. Moreover, the DP-like orbital relaxation can make the spin relaxation in centrosymmetric systems DP-like through the spin-orbit coupling. We also find that the DP-like orbital and spin relaxations are anisotropic even in materials with high crystal symmetry (such as face-centered cubic structure) and may depend on the orbital and spin nature of electron wavefunctions.</description>

      <title>Scanning Tunneling Microscopy for Molecules: Manipulating Electrons and Photons by Varying Buffer Layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In scanning tunneling microscopy of molecules, an insulating buffer layer is often introduced to reduce interaction between the molecules and the substrate. Focusing on tunneling through the molecule's electronic transport gap, we demonstrate that the buffer itself strongly influences the wave function of the tunneling electron at the molecule. This is exemplified for an adsorbed platinum phthalocyanine molecule by varying the composition and thickness of the buffer. We find that, in particular, the buffer's lattice parameter is crucial. By expanding the wave function of the tunneling electron in molecular orbitals (MOs), we illustrate how one can strongly vary the relative weights of different MOs, such as the highest occupied MO versus some low-lying MOs with few nodal surfaces. The set of MOs with significant weight are important for processes used to manipulate the state of the molecule by a tunneling electron, such as molecular luminescence. The choice of buffer therefore provides an important tool for manipulating these processes.</description>

      <title>Transport of orbital currents in systems with strong intervalley coupling: the case of Kekul\'e distorted graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that orbital currents can describe the transport of orbital magnetic moments of Bloch states in models where the formalism based on valley current is not applicable. As a case study, we consider Kekul\'e distorted graphene. We begin by analyzing the band structure in detail and obtain the orbital magnetic moment operator for this model within the framework of the modern theory of magnetism. Despite the simultaneous presence of time-reversal and spatial-inversion symmetries, such operator may be defined, although its expectation value at a given energy is zero. Nevertheless, its presence can be exposed by the application of an external magnetic field. We then proceed to study the transport of these quantities. In the Kekul\'e-$O$ distorted graphene model, the strong coupling between different valleys prevents the definition of a bulk valley current. However, the formalism of the orbital Hall effect together with the non-Abelian description of the magnetic moment operator can be directly applied to describe its transport in these types of models. We show that the Kekul\'e-$O$ distorted graphene model exhibits an orbital Hall insulating plateau whose height is inversely proportional to the energy band gap produced by intervalley coupling. Our results strengthen the perspective of using the orbital Hall effect formalism as a preferable alternative to the valley Hall effect</description>

      <title>Effects of Reduced Interlayer Interactions on the K-point Excitons of MoS$_2$ Nanoscrolls</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) nanoscrolls (NS) exhibit significant photoluminescence (PL) signals despite their multilayer structure, which cannot be explained by the strained multilayer description of NS. Here, we investigate the interlayer interactions in NS to address this discrepancy. The reduction of interlayer interactions in NS is attributed to two factors: (1) the symmetry-broken mixed stacking order between neighbouring layers due to misalignment, and (2) the high inhomogeneity in the strain landscape resulting from the unique Archimedean spiral-like geometry with positive eccentricity. These were confirmed through transmission electron microscopy, field emission scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy. To probe the effect of reduction of interlayer interactions in multilayered MoS$_2$ nanoscrolls, low-temperature PL spectroscopy was employed investigating the behaviour of K-point excitons. The effects of reduced interlayer interactions on exciton-phonon coupling (EXPC), exciton energy, and exciton oscillator strength are discussed, providing insights into the unique properties of TMD nanoscrolls.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The next generation of soft electronics will expand to the third dimension. This will require the integration of mechanically-compliant three-dimensional functional structures with stretchable materials. This study demonstrates omnidirectional direct ink writing (DIW) of Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) aerogels with tunable electrical and mechanical performance, which can be integrated with soft substrates. Several PEDOT:PSS hydrogels were formulated for DIW and freeze-dried directly on stretchable substrates to form integrated aerogels displaying high shape fidelity and minimal shrinkage. The effect of additives and processing in the PEDOT:PSS hydro and aerogels morphology, and the link with their electromechanical properties was elucidated. This technology demonstrated 3D-structured stretchable interconnects and planar thermoelectric generators (TEGs) for skin electronics, as well as vertically-printed high aspect ratio thermoelectric pillars with a high ZT value of 3.2 10^-3 and ultra-low thermal conductivity of 0.065 W/(m K). Despite their comparatively low ZT, the aerogel pillars outpowered their dense counterparts in realistic energy harvesting scenarios where contact resistances cannot be ignored, and produced up to 26 nW/cm2 (corresponding to a gravimetric power density of 0.76 mW/kg) for a difference of temperature of 15 K. This work suggests promising advancements in soft and energy-efficiency electronic systems relevant to soft robotics and wearable.</description>

Abstract: Axion insulators possess a quantized axion field $\theta=\pi$ protected by combined lattice and time-reversal symmetry, holding great potential for device applications in layertronics and quantum computing. Here, we propose a high-spin axion insulator (HSAI) defined in large spin-$s$ representation, which maintains the same inherent symmetry but possesses a notable axion field $\theta=(s+1/2)^2\pi$. Such distinct axion field is confirmed independently by the direct calculation of the axion term using hybrid Wannier functions, layer-resolved Chern numbers, as well as the topological magneto-electric effect. We show that the guaranteed gapless quasi-particle excitation is absent at the boundary of the HSAI despite its integer surface Chern number, hinting an unusual quantum anomaly violating the conventional bulk-boundary correspondence. Furthermore, we ascertain that the axion field $\theta$ can be precisely tuned through an external magnetic field, enabling the manipulation of bonded transport properties. The HSAI proposed here can be experimentally verified in ultra-cold atoms by the quantized non-reciprocal conductance or topological magnetoelectric response. Our work enriches the understanding of axion insulators in condensed matter physics, paving the way for future device applications.</description>

Abstract: The Kondo lattice physics, describing the hybridization of localized spin matrix with dispersive conduction electrons, breeds numerous discoveries in the realm of strongly correlated quantum matter. Generally observed in lanthanide and actinide compounds, increasing attention has been directed towards alternative pathways for achieving flat band structures, such as Morie superlattices and Kagome metals. However, fine control of Kondo interaction outside of heterostructures remains elusive. Here we report the discovery of a van der Waals (vdW) kagome antiferromagnet CsCr6Sb6. Angle-resolved photoemission spectra and theoretical analysis show clear flat bands, consisting of half-filled 3dxz and 3dyz orbitals of Cr, situated 50 meV below the Fermi level. Importantly, we observe the emergence of anomalous Hall effect with remarkable tunability by simple reduction the sample thickness. The effective control of kondo interaction in CsCr6Sb6 render it an ideal platform for exploring unpresented phenomena using the vast toolkit of vdW structures.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of Angstrom resolution exit-waves by the application of drift-corrected phase-shifting off-axis electron holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16054</link>

Abstract: Phase-shifting electron holography is an excellent method to reveal electron wave phase information with very high phase sensitivity over a large range of spatial frequencies. It circumvents the limiting trade-off between fringe spacing and visibility of standard off-axis holography. Previous implementations have been limited by the independent drift of biprism and sample. We demonstrate here an advanced drift correction scheme for the hologram series that exploits the presence of an interface of the TEM specimen to the vacuum area in the hologram. It allows to obtain reliable phase information up to 2{\pi}/452 at the 1 {\AA} information limit of the Titan 80-300 kV environmental transmission electron microscope used, by applying a moderate voltage of 250 V to a single biprism for a fringe spacing of 1 {\AA}. The obtained phase and amplitude information is validated at a thin Pt sample by use of multislice image simulation with the frozen lattice approximation and shows excellent agreement. The presented method is applicable in any TEM equipped with at least one electron biprism and thus enables achieving high resolution off-axis holography in various instruments including those for in-situ applications. A software implementation for the acquisition, calibration and reconstruction is provided.</description>

      <title>Crystallization Dynamics of Amorphous Yttrium Iron Garnet Thin Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.00412v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Yttrium iron garnet (YIG) is a prototypical material in spintronics due to its exceptional magnetic properties. To exploit these properties high quality thin films need to be manufactured. Deposition techniques like sputter deposition or pulsed laser deposition at ambient temperature produce amorphous films, which need a post annealing step to induce crystallization. However, not much is known about the exact dynamics of the formation of crystalline YIG out of the amorphous phase. Here, we conduct extensive time and temperature series to study the crystallization behavior of YIG on various substrates and extract the crystallization velocities as well as the activation energies needed to promote crystallization. We find that the type of crystallization as well as the crystallization velocity depend on the lattice mismatch to the substrate. We compare the crystallization parameters found in literature with our results and find an excellent agreement with our model. Our results allow us to determine the time needed for the formation of a fully crystalline film of arbitrary thickness for any temperature.</description>

      <title>Identification of electronic dimensionality reduction in semiconductor quantum well structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.12423v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) systems, such as high-temperature superconductors, surface states of topological insulators, and layered materials, have been intensively studied using vacuum-ultraviolet (VUV) angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). In semiconductor films (heterostructures), quantum well (QW) states arise due to electron/hole accumulations at the surface (interface). The quantized states due to quantum confinement can be observed by VUV-ARPES, while the periodic intensity modulations along the surface normal (kz) direction of these quantized states are also observable by varying incident photon energy, resembling three-dimensional (3D) band dispersion. We have conducted soft X-ray (SX) ARPES measurements on thick and ultrathin III-V semiconductor InSb(001) films to investigate the electronic dimensionality reduction in semiconductor QWs. In addition to the dissipation of the kz dispersion, the SX-ARPES observations demonstrate the changes of the symmetry and periodicity of the Brillouin zone in the ultrathin film as 2D QW compared with these of the 3D bulk one, indicating the electronic dimensionality reduction of the 3D bulk band dispersion caused by the quantum confinement. The results provide a critical diagnosis using SX-ARPES for the dimensionality reduction in semiconductor QW structures.</description>

      <title>Charge and spin current pumping by ultrafast demagnetization dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00779v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The surprising discovery of ultrafast demagnetization -- where electric field of femtosecond laser pulse couples to electrons of a ferromagnetic (FM) layer causing its magnetization vector {\em to shrink while not rotating}, is also assumed to be accompanied by generation of spin current in the direction orthogonal to electric field. However, understanding of the microscopic origin of such spin current and how efficiently it can be converted into charge current, as the putative source of THz radiation, is lacking despite nearly three decades of intense studies. Here we connect the standard pumping phenomena driven by microwave precession of magnetization vector replacing periodic time-dependence of magnetization precession with nonperiodic time-dependence of demagnetization, as obtained from experiments on ultrafast-light-driven Ni layer. Applying time-dependent nonequilibrium Green's functions, able to evolve such setup with arbitrary time dependence, reveals how demagnetization dynamics pumps both charge and spin currents in directions both parallel and orthogonal to electric field of laser pulse, even in the absence of spin-orbit coupling and thereby induced spin-to-charge conversion mechanisms. Although pumped currents follow $dM_z/dt$ in some setups, this becomes obscured when NM layers are disconnected and pumped currents start to reflect from FM boundaries (as is the case of experimental setups). Finally, we use the Jefimenko equations to compute electromagnetic radiation by charge current pumped in disconnected setup during demagnetization, or later during its slow recovery, unraveling that radiated electric field only in the former time interval exhibits features in 0.1--30 THz frequency range probed experimentally or explored for applications of spintronic THz emitters.</description>

      <title>Intricate magnetic interactions and topological Hall effect observed in itinerant room-temperature layered ferromagnet Cr0.83Te</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07237v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the magnetic, electrical, and magnetotransport (Hall effect) properties of the hexagonal itinerant ferromagnet Cr$_{0.83}$Te. Further, a comprehensive study of the magneto-entropy scaling behavior has been done around the Curie temperature of $T_C \approx$ 338 K. A maximum entropy change (-$\Delta S_{m}^{max}$) of 2.77 $J/kg-K$ and relative cooling power (RCP) of 88.29 $J/kg$ near the T$_C$ have been achieved under an applied magnetic field of 5 Tesla. The critical exponents, $\beta$ = 0.4739(4), $\gamma$ = 1.2812(3), and $\delta$ = 3.7037(5), have been extracted using the magneto-entropy scaling analysis. The obtained critical exponents indicate the presence of intricate magnetic interactions in Cr$_{0.83}$Te. On the other hand, the magnetotransport study reveals a topological Hall effect attributed to the noncoplanar spin structure coexisting with a robust magnetocrystalline anisotropy. Further, we observe that the extrinsic skew-scattering mechanism originated anomalous Hall effect. Our experimental findings of the anomalous and topological Hall effect properties in the presence of intriguing high-temperature itinerant ferromagnetism and magnetocaloric effect in Cr$_{0.83}$Te can offer potential technological applications at room temperature.</description>

      <title>Roles of band gap and Kane electronic dispersion in the THz-frequency nonlinear optical response in HgCdTe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10582v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Materials with linear electronic dispersion often feature high carrier mobilities and unusually strong nonlinear optical interactions. In this work, we investigate the THz nonlinear dynamics of one such material, HgCdTe, with an electronic band dispersion heavily dependent on both temperature and stoichiometry. We show how the band gap, carrier concentration and band shape together determine the nonlinear response of the system. At low temperatures, carrier generation from Zener tunneling dominates the nonlinear response with a reduction in the overall transmission. At room temperature, quasi-ballistic electronic dynamics drive the largest observed nonlinear optical interactions, leading to a transmission increase. Our results demonstrate the sensitivity of these nonlinear optical properties of narrow-gap materials to small changes in the electronic dispersion and carrier concentration.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic Nonsaturating Magnetoresistance Observed in HoMn$_6$Ge$_6$: A Kagome Dirac Semimetal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11414v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the magnetic and magnetotransport properties and electronic band structure of the kagome Dirac semimetal HoMn$_6$Ge$_6$. Temperature-dependent electrical resistivity demonstrates various magnetic-transition-driven anomalies. Notably, a crossover from negative to positive magnetoresistance (MR) is observed at around 150 K. While the linear nonsaturating positive MR in the low-temperature region is mainly driven by the linear Dirac-like band dispersions as predicted by the first-principles calculations, the negative MR observed in the high-temperature region is due to the spin-flop type magnetic transition. Consistent with anisotropic Fermi surface topology, we observe anisotropic magnetoresistance at low temperatures. A significant anomalous Hall effect has been noticed at high temperatures in addition to a switching of the dominant charge carrier from electron to hole at around 215 K.</description>

      <title>Low-Temperature Multi-Mode Microwave Spectroscopy of Paramagnetic and Rare-Earth Ion Spin Impurities in Single Crystal Calcium Tungstate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.05199v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present experimental observations of dilute ion spin ensembles in an undoped low-loss single crystal cylindrical sample of CaWO$_4$ cooled to 30 mK in temperature. Crystal field perturbations were elucidated by constructing a dielectrically loaded microwave cavity resonator from the crystal. The resonator exhibited numerous whispering gallery modes with high Q-factors of up to $3\times 10^7$, equivalent to a low loss tangent of $\sim 3\times 10^{-8}$. The low-loss allowed precision multi-mode spectroscopy of numerous high Q-factor photon\hyp{}spin interactions. Measurements between 7 to 22 GHz revealed the presence of Gd$^{3+}$, Fe$^{3+}$, and another trace species, inferred to be rare\hyp{}earth, at concentrations on the order of parts per billion. These findings motivate further exploration of prospective uses of this low-loss dielectric material for applications regarding precision and quantum metrology, as well as tests for beyond standard model physics.</description>

      <title>Theory of superconductivity in thin films under an external electric field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13059v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The supercurrent field effect is experimentally realized in various nano-scale devices, based on the superconductivity suppression by external electric fields being effective for confined systems. In spite of intense research, a microscopic theory and explanation of this effect is missing. Here, a microscopic theory of phonon-mediated superconductivity in thin films is presented, which accounts for the effect of quantum confinement on the electronic density of states, on the Fermi energy, and on the topology of allowed states in momentum space. By further accounting for the interplay between quantum confinement, the external static electric field, the Thomas-Fermi screening in the electron-phonon matrix element, and the effect of confinement on the Coulomb repulsion parameter, the theory predicts the critical value of the external electric field as a function of the film thickness, above which superconductivity is suppressed. In particular, this critical value of the electric field is the lower the thinner the film, in agreement with recent experimental observations. Crucially, this effect is predicted by the theory when both Thomas-Fermi screening and the Coulomb pseudopotential are taken into account, along with the respective dependence on thin film thickness. This microscopic theory of the supercurrent field-effect opens up new possibilities for electric-field gated quantum materials.</description>
