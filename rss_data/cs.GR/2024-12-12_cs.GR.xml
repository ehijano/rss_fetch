      <title>ProGDF: Progressive Gaussian Differential Field for Controllable and Flexible 3D Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D editing plays a crucial role in editing and reusing existing 3D assets, thereby enhancing productivity. Recently, 3DGS-based methods have gained increasing attention due to their efficient rendering and flexibility. However, achieving desired 3D editing results often requires multiple adjustments in an iterative loop, resulting in tens of minutes of training time cost for each attempt and a cumbersome trial-and-error cycle for users. This in-the-loop training paradigm results in a poor user experience. To address this issue, we introduce the concept of process-oriented modelling for 3D editing and propose the Progressive Gaussian Differential Field (ProGDF), an out-of-loop training approach that requires only a single training session to provide users with controllable editing capability and variable editing results through a user-friendly interface in real-time. ProGDF consists of two key components: Progressive Gaussian Splatting (PGS) and Gaussian Differential Field (GDF). PGS introduces the progressive constraint to extract the diverse intermediate results of the editing process and employs rendering quality regularization to improve the quality of these results. Based on these intermediate results, GDF leverages a lightweight neural network to model the editing process. Extensive results on two novel applications, namely controllable 3D editing and flexible fine-grained 3D manipulation, demonstrate the effectiveness, practicality and flexibility of the proposed ProGDF.</description>

      <title>Textured Mesh Saliency: Bridging Geometry and Texture for Human Perception in 3D Graphics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Textured meshes significantly enhance the realism and detail of objects by mapping intricate texture details onto the geometric structure of 3D models. This advancement is valuable across various applications, including entertainment, education, and industry. While traditional mesh saliency studies focus on non-textured meshes, our work explores the complexities introduced by detailed texture patterns. We present a new dataset for textured mesh saliency, created through an innovative eye-tracking experiment in a six degrees of freedom (6-DOF) VR environment. This dataset addresses the limitations of previous studies by providing comprehensive eye-tracking data from multiple viewpoints, thereby advancing our understanding of human visual behavior and supporting more accurate and effective 3D content creation. Our proposed model predicts saliency maps for textured mesh surfaces by treating each triangular face as an individual unit and assigning a saliency density value to reflect the importance of each local surface region. The model incorporates a texture alignment module and a geometric extraction module, combined with an aggregation module to integrate texture and geometry for precise saliency prediction. We believe this approach will enhance the visual fidelity of geometric processing algorithms while ensuring efficient use of computational resources, which is crucial for real-time rendering and high-detail applications such as VR and gaming.</description>

      <title>SyncViolinist: Music-Oriented Violin Motion Generation Based on Bowing and Fingering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automatically generating realistic musical performance motion can greatly enhance digital media production, often involving collaboration between professionals and musicians. However, capturing the intricate body, hand, and finger movements required for accurate musical performances is challenging. Existing methods often fall short due to the complex mapping between audio and motion, typically requiring additional inputs like scores or MIDI data. In this work, we present SyncViolinist, a multi-stage end-to-end framework that generates synchronized violin performance motion solely from audio input. Our method overcomes the challenge of capturing both global and fine-grained performance features through two key modules: a bowing/fingering module and a motion generation module. The bowing/fingering module extracts detailed playing information from the audio, which the motion generation module uses to create precise, coordinated body motions reflecting the temporal granularity and nature of the violin performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SyncViolinist with significantly improved qualitative and quantitative results from unseen violin performance audio, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Extensive subjective evaluations involving professional violinists further validate our approach. The code and dataset are available at https://github.com/Kakanat/SyncViolinist.</description>

      <title>ConvMesh: Reimagining Mesh Quality Through Convex Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mesh generation has become a critical topic in recent years, forming the foundation of all 3D objects used across various applications, such as virtual reality, gaming, and 3D printing. With advancements in computational resources and machine learning, neural networks have emerged as powerful tools for generating high-quality 3D object representations, enabling accurate scene and object reconstructions. Despite these advancements, many methods produce meshes that lack realism or exhibit geometric and textural flaws, necessitating additional processing to improve their quality. This research introduces a convex optimization programming called disciplined convex programming to enhance existing meshes by refining their texture and geometry with a conic solver. By focusing on a sparse set of point clouds from both the original and target meshes, this method demonstrates significant improvements in mesh quality with minimal data requirements. To evaluate the approach, the classical dolphin mesh dataset from Facebook AI was used as a case study, with optimization performed using the CVXPY library. The results reveal promising potential for streamlined and effective mesh refinement.</description>

      <title>Design2GarmentCode: Turning Design Concepts to Tangible Garments Through Program Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08603v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sewing patterns, the essential blueprints for fabric cutting and tailoring, act as a crucial bridge between design concepts and producible garments. However, existing uni-modal sewing pattern generation models struggle to effectively encode complex design concepts with a multi-modal nature and correlate them with vectorized sewing patterns that possess precise geometric structures and intricate sewing relations. In this work, we propose a novel sewing pattern generation approach Design2GarmentCode based on Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), to generate parametric pattern-making programs from multi-modal design concepts. LMM offers an intuitive interface for interpreting diverse design inputs, while pattern-making programs could serve as well-structured and semantically meaningful representations of sewing patterns, and act as a robust bridge connecting the cross-domain pattern-making knowledge embedded in LMMs with vectorized sewing patterns. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can flexibly handle various complex design expressions such as images, textual descriptions, designer sketches, or their combinations, and convert them into size-precise sewing patterns with correct stitches. Compared to previous methods, our approach significantly enhances training efficiency, generation quality, and authoring flexibility. Our code and data will be publicly available.</description>

      <title>PointTalk: Audio-Driven Dynamic Lip Point Cloud for 3D Gaussian-based Talking Head Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Talking head synthesis with arbitrary speech audio is a crucial challenge in the field of digital humans. Recently, methods based on radiance fields have received increasing attention due to their ability to synthesize high-fidelity and identity-consistent talking heads from just a few minutes of training video. However, due to the limited scale of the training data, these methods often exhibit poor performance in audio-lip synchronization and visual quality. In this paper, we propose a novel 3D Gaussian-based method called PointTalk, which constructs a static 3D Gaussian field of the head and deforms it in sync with the audio. It also incorporates an audio-driven dynamic lip point cloud as a critical component of the conditional information, thereby facilitating the effective synthesis of talking heads. Specifically, the initial step involves generating the corresponding lip point cloud from the audio signal and capturing its topological structure. The design of the dynamic difference encoder aims to capture the subtle nuances inherent in dynamic lip movements more effectively. Furthermore, we integrate the audio-point enhancement module, which not only ensures the synchronization of the audio signal with the corresponding lip point cloud within the feature space, but also facilitates a deeper understanding of the interrelations among cross-modal conditional features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior high-fidelity and audio-lip synchronization in talking head synthesis compared to previous methods.</description>

      <title>Physics Based Differentiable Rendering for Inverse Problems and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics-based differentiable rendering (PBDR) has become an efficient method in computer vision, graphics, and machine learning for addressing an array of inverse problems. PBDR allows patterns to be generated from perceptions which can be applied to enhance object attributes like geometry, substances, and lighting by adding physical models of light propagation and materials interaction. Due to these capabilities, distinguished rendering has been employed in a wider range of sectors such as autonomous navigation, scene reconstruction, and material design. We provide an extensive overview of PBDR techniques in this study, emphasizing their creation, effectiveness, and limitations while managing inverse situations. We demonstrate modern techniques and examine their value in everyday situations.</description>

      <title>Mirror-3DGS: Incorporating Mirror Reflections into 3D Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01168v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has significantly advanced 3D scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis. However, like Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), 3DGS struggles with accurately modeling physical reflections, particularly in mirrors, leading to incorrect reconstructions and inconsistent reflective properties. To address this challenge, we introduce Mirror-3DGS, a novel framework designed to accurately handle mirror geometries and reflections, thereby generating realistic mirror reflections. By incorporating mirror attributes into 3DGS and leveraging plane mirror imaging principles, Mirror-3DGS simulates a mirrored viewpoint from behind the mirror, enhancing the realism of scene renderings. Extensive evaluations on both synthetic and real-world scenes demonstrate that our method can render novel views with improved fidelity in real-time, surpassing the state-of-the-art Mirror-NeRF, especially in mirror regions.</description>

      <title>AniClipart: Clipart Animation with Text-to-Video Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12347v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Clipart, a pre-made art form, offers a convenient and efficient way of creating visual content. However, traditional workflows for animating static clipart are laborious and time-consuming, involving steps like rigging, keyframing, and inbetweening. Recent advancements in text-to-video generation hold great potential in resolving this challenge. Nevertheless, direct application of text-to-video models often struggles to preserve the visual identity of clipart or generate cartoon-style motion, resulting in subpar animation outcomes. In this paper, we introduce AniClipart, a computational system that converts static clipart into high-quality animations guided by text-to-video priors. To generate natural, smooth, and coherent motion, we first parameterize the motion trajectories of the keypoints defined over the initial clipart image by cubic B\'ezier curves. We then align these motion trajectories with a given text prompt by optimizing a video Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) loss and a skeleton fidelity loss. By incorporating differentiable As-Rigid-As-Possible (ARAP) shape deformation and differentiable rendering, AniClipart can be end-to-end optimized while maintaining deformation rigidity. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed AniClipart consistently outperforms the competing methods, in terms of text-video alignment, visual identity preservation, and temporal consistency. Additionally, we showcase the versatility of AniClipart by adapting it to generate layered animations, which allow for topological changes.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Score Distillation as a Bridge Between Image Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09417v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Score distillation sampling (SDS) has proven to be an important tool, enabling the use of large-scale diffusion priors for tasks operating in data-poor domains. Unfortunately, SDS has a number of characteristic artifacts that limit its usefulness in general-purpose applications. In this paper, we make progress toward understanding the behavior of SDS and its variants by viewing them as solving an optimal-cost transport path from a source distribution to a target distribution. Under this new interpretation, these methods seek to transport corrupted images (source) to the natural image distribution (target). We argue that current methods' characteristic artifacts are caused by (1) linear approximation of the optimal path and (2) poor estimates of the source distribution. We show that calibrating the text conditioning of the source distribution can produce high-quality generation and translation results with little extra overhead. Our method can be easily applied across many domains, matching or beating the performance of specialized methods. We demonstrate its utility in text-to-2D, text-based NeRF optimization, translating paintings to real images, optical illusion generation, and 3D sketch-to-real. We compare our method to existing approaches for score distillation sampling and show that it can produce high-frequency details with realistic colors.</description>
