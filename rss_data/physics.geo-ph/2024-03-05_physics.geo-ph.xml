      <title>Seismogenic Potential of the Subduction Zone in Northern Chile</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The northern Chile region of the Nazca subduction zone ruptured in an Mw$\sim$8.5--9.0 earthquake in 1877, which induced a tsunami. The various magnitude estimates of this event are based on the evaluation of historical records, seismic intensities, and/or tide gauge information; however, its actual along-strike extent is debated. Based on geodetic data, the previous studies have suggested that this region has the potential for an Mw8.2--8.8 event. We re-evaluate the seismic potential of the region, accounting for the buildup rate of moment deficit along the megathrust, the earthquake magnitude--frequency distribution, and the physics of earthquakes. We combine an improved probabilistic estimate of moment deficit rate with results from dynamic models of the earthquake cycle, testing, in particular, the influence of a potential aseismic barrier near the city of Iquique, which may influence the extent and magnitude of large events in this region. We find that Mw8.8 is the most probable maximum magnitude earthquake in the region, and that the potential barrier likely has a limited impact considering uncertainties. We discuss the effect of the moment deficit rate on the fault, the b-value, and the importance of postseismic processes on our results.</description>

      <title>Zonostrophic turbulence in the subsurface oceans of the Jovian and Saturnian moons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02277v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In order to characterize the global circulation of the subsurface ocean of Jovian and Saturnian moons, we analyze the properties of 21 three-dimensional simulations of Boussinesq thermal convection in a rapidly rotating spherical shell. Flow is driven by an adverse temperature contrast imposed across the domain, and is subjected to no-slip boundary conditions. We cover a region of parameter space previously unexplored by global simulations, both in terms of rapid rotation and vigor of convective forcing, closer to, yet still admittedly far from, the conditions appropriate for the subsurface ocean of Ganymede, Europa, Enceladus, and Titan. Our most extreme simulations exhibit a dynamic global circulation that combines powerful east-west zonal jets, planetary waves, and vortices. A spectral analysis of the kinetic energy distribution performed in cylindrical geometry reveals a high degree of anisotropy of the simulated flows. Specifically, the axisymmetric zonal energy spectra follow a steep $-5$ slope in wavenumber space, with the energy amplitude exclusively controlled by the rotation rate. In contrast, the non-axisymmetric residual spectra display a gentle $-5/3$ slope, with the energy amplitude controlled by the thermal buoyancy input power. This spectral behavior conforms with the theory of zonostrophic turbulence and allows us to propose tentative extrapolations of these findings to the more extreme conditions of icy satellites. By assuming that kinetic energy dissipates via Ekman friction we predict an upper bound for the zonal velocity ranging from a few centimeters per second for Enceladus to about one meter per second for Ganymede, with residual velocities smaller than the zonal velocity by an order of magnitude on each moon. These predictions yield typical jets size approaching the ocean depth of Titan, Ganymede and Europa and $10$ to $40\%$ of the ocean depth on Enceladus.</description>

      <title>A stable deep adversarial learning approach for geological facies generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.13318v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The simulation of geological facies in an unobservable volume is essential in various geoscience applications. Given the complexity of the problem, deep generative learning is a promising approach to overcome the limitations of traditional geostatistical simulation models, in particular their lack of physical realism. This research aims to investigate the application of generative adversarial networks and deep variational inference for conditionally simulating meandering channels in underground volumes. In this paper, we review the generative deep learning approaches, in particular the adversarial ones and the stabilization techniques that aim to facilitate their training. The proposed approach is tested on 2D and 3D simulations generated by the stochastic process-based model Flumy. Morphological metrics are utilized to compare our proposed method with earlier iterations of generative adversarial networks. The results indicate that by utilizing recent stabilization techniques, generative adversarial networks can efficiently sample from target data distributions. Moreover, we demonstrate the ability to simulate conditioned simulations through the latent variable model property of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>On the relative abundances of Cavansite and Pentagonite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.06825v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cavansite is a visually stunning blue vanadosilicate mineral with limited occurrences worldwide, whereas Pentagonite is a closely related dimorph with similar physical and chemical properties, yet is extremely rare compared to Cavansite. The reasons behind Pentagonite's exceptional rarity remain largely unknown.
  In this study, (a) density functional theory (DFT) is utilized to investigate the electronic structures of Cavansite and Pentagonite at ground state and finite pressures; (b) a two-state Boltzmann probability model is then employed to construct a comprehensive phase diagram that reveals the abundance of each species across a wide range of pressure and temperature conditions; and (c) dehydration characteristics of these two minerals are explored.
  The present analysis reveals the key factors that contribute to the relative scarcity of Pentagonite, including differences in structural arrangement and electronic configurations between the two minerals. Specifically, it shows that (a) because of the peculiar arrangements of SiO4 polyhedra, Cavansite forms a compact structure (about 2.7% less in volume) resulting in lower energy; (b) at a temperature of about 650K only about 1% Pentagonite can form; (c) vanadium induces a highly localized state in both of these otherwise large-band-gap insulators resulting in an extremely weak magnetic phase that is unlikely to be observed at any reasonable finite temperature; and (d) water molecules are loosely bound inside the microporous crystals of Cavansite and Pentagonite, suggesting potential applications of these minerals in various technological fields.</description>
