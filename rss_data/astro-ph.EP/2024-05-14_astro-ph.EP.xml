      <title>Occurrence Rates of Exosatellites Orbiting 3-30M$_{\rm Jup}$ Hosts from 44 Spitzer Light Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conduct a comprehensive search for transiting exomoons and exosatellites within 44 archival Spitzer light curves of 32 substellar worlds with estimated masses ranging between 3-30M$_{\rm Jup}$. This sample's median host mass is 16M$_{\rm Jup}$, inclusive of 14 planetary-mass objects, among which one is a wide-orbit exoplanet. We search the light curves for exosatellite signatures and implement a transit injection-recovery test, illustrating our survey's capability to detect $&gt;$0.7R$_{\oplus}$ exosatellites. Our findings reveal no substantial ($&gt;$5$\sigma$) evidence for individual transit events. However, an unusual fraction of light curves favor the transit model at the 2-3$\sigma$ significance level, with fitted transit depths consistent with terrestrial-sized (0.7-1.6R$_{\oplus}$) bodies. Comparatively, fewer than 2.2% of randomly generated normal distributions from an equivalent sample size exhibit a similar prevalence of outliers. Should one or two of these outliers represent a real exosatellite transit, it would imply an occurrence rate of $\eta = 0.61^{+0.49}_{-0.34}$ short-period terrestrial exosatellites per system, consistent with the known occurrences rates for both solar system moons and mid M-dwarf exoplanets. We explore alternative astrophysical interpretations for these outliers, underscoring that transits are not the only plausible explanation. For orbital periods $&lt;$0.8 days, the typical duration of the light curves, we constrain the occurrence rate of sub-Neptunes to $\eta&lt;$0.35 (95% confidence) and, if none of the detected outlier signals are real, the occurrence rate of terrestrial ($\sim$Earth-sized) exosatellites to $\eta&lt;$0.51 (95% confidence). Forthcoming JWST observations of substellar light curves will enable detection of sub-Io-sized exosatellites, allowing for much stronger constraints on this exosatellite population.</description>

      <title>Comparing the dynamics of Jupiter-family Comets and comet-like fireballs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Jupiter-family comets (JFCs), which originate from the Kuiper belt and scattered disk, exhibit low-inclination and chaotic trajectories due to close encounters with Jupiter. Despite their typically short incursions into the inner solar system, a notable number of them are on Earth-crossing orbits, with fireball networks detecting many objects on ``JFC-like'' (2 &lt; TJ &lt; 3) orbits. Aims. This investigation aims to examine the orbital dynamics of JFCs and comet-like fireballs over 10,000 yr timescales, focusing on the trajectories and stability of these objects in the context of gravitational interactions within the solar system. Methods. We employed an extensive fireball dataset from the Desert Fireball Network (DFN), European Fireball Network (EFN), Fireball Recovery and InterPlanetary Observation Network (FRIPON), and Meteorite Observation and Recovery Project (MORP), alongside telescopically observed cometary ephemeris from the NASA HORIZONS database. The study integrates 646 fireball orbits with 661 JFC orbits for a comparative analysis of their orbital stability and evolution. Results. The analysis confirms frequent Jupiter encounters among most JFCs, inducing chaotic orbital behavior with limited predictability and short Lyapunov lifetimes (about 120 years), underscoring Jupiter`s significant dynamical influence. In contrast, ``JFC-like'' meteoroids detected by fireball networks largely exhibit dynamics divergent from genuine JFCs, with 79-92% on ``JFC-like'' orbits shown not to be prone to frequent Jupiter encounters; in particular, only 1-5% of all fireballs detected by the four networks exhibit dynamics similar to that of actual JFCs. In addition, 22% (16 of 72) of near-Earth JFCs are on highly stable orbits, suggesting a potential main belt origin for some of the bodies.</description>

      <title>Ejection and Dynamics of Aggregates in the Coma of Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The process of cometary activity continues to pose a challenging question in cometary science. The activity modeling of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, based on data from the Rosetta mission, has significantly enhanced our comprehension of cometary activity. But thermophysical models have difficulties in simultaneously explaining the production rates of various gas species and dust. It has been suggested that different gas species might be responsible for the ejection of refractory material in distinct size ranges. This work focuses on investigating abundance and the ejection mechanisms of large ($\gtrsim$ 1 cm) aggregates from the comet nucleus. We aim to determine their properties and map the distribution of their source regions across the comet surface. This can place constraints on activity models for comets. We examined 189 images acquired at five epochs by the OSIRIS/NAC instrument. Our goal was to identify bright tracks produced by individual aggregates as they traversed the camera field of view. We generated synthetic images based on the output of dynamical simulations involving various types of aggregates. By comparing these synthetic images with the observations, we determine the characteristics of the simulated aggregates that most closely resembled the observations. We identified over 30000 tracks present in the OSIRIS images, derived constraints on the characteristics of the aggregates and mapped their origins on the nucleus surface. The aggregates have an average radius of $\simeq5$ cm, and a bulk density consistent with that of the comet's nucleus. Due to their size, gas drag exerts only a minor influence on their dynamical behavior, so an initial velocity is needed in order to bring them into the camera field of view. The source regions of these aggregates are predominantly located near the boundaries of distinct terrains on the surface.</description>

      <title>Planet formation regulated by galactic-scale interstellar turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Planets form from protoplanetary discs of dust and gas that surround stars younger than a few million years. The properties of these discs dictate how planets grow, determining the nature, architecture and composition of the observed exoplanet population. The nature of (turbulent) angular momentum transport through the disc in particular is critical for planet growth and migration. While the dominant physical processes in disc evolution remain unknown, theoretical studies widely assume an isolated star-disc system. Here we challenge this conventional assumption by showing that, far from being isolated systems, discs in typical star forming environments are constantly replenished by capturing new material from the interstellar medium (ISM). We show that this in-fall alone explains observed disc masses, outer radii and stellar accretion rates as a function of time and stellar mass. ISM capture is also capable of driving disc turbulence corresponding to viscosity in the range $\alpha_\mathrm{SS} \sim 10^{-5}{-}10^{-1}$, as observationally inferred. We find that $20{-}70$~percent of discs are composed of material captured in the most recent half of their life-time, implying their properties are not direct probes of internal disc physics. Our results suggest that planet formation is driven by the turbulent cascade of energy from galactic-scales down to the protoplanetary disc and that recent evidence of in-fall from the ISM onto mature protoplanetary discs are part of an important, general process. This represents a far-reaching shift in our understanding of every stage of planet formation, from dust aggregation to the migration of giant planets through the disc.</description>

      <title>A library of meteoroid environments encountered by spacecraft in the inner solar system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: NASA's Meteoroid Engineering Model (MEM) is designed to provide aerospace engineers with an accurate description of potentially hazardous meteoroids. It accepts a spacecraft trajectory as input and its output files describe the flux, speed, directionality, and density of microgram- to gram-sized meteoroids relative to the provided trajectory. MEM provides this information at a fairly fine level of detail in order to support detailed risk calculations. However, engineers and scientists in the very early planning stages of a mission may not yet have developed a trajectory or acquired the tools to analyze environment data. Therefore, we have developed an online library of sample MEM runs that allow new users or overloaded mission planners to get a quick feel for the characteristics of the meteoroid environment. This library provides both visualizations of these runs and input files that allow users to replicate them exactly. We also discuss the number of state vectors needed to obtain an accurate representation of the environment encountered along our sample trajectories, and outline a process for verifying that any given trajectory is adequately sampled.</description>

      <title>Observations of Water Frost on Mars with THEMIS: Application to the Presence of Brines and the Stability of (Sub)Surface Water Ice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Characterizing the exchange of water between the Martian atmosphere and the (sub)surface is a major challenge for understanding the mechanisms that regulate the water cycle. Here we present a new dataset of water ice detected on the Martian surface with the Thermal Emission Imaging System (THEMIS). The detection is based on the correlation between bright blue-white patterns in visible images and a temperature measured in the infrared that is too warm to beassociated with CO2 ice and interpreted instead as water ice. Using this method, we detect ice down to 21.4{\deg}S, 48.4{\deg}N, on the pole-facing slopes at mid-latitudes, and on any surface orientation poleward of 45{\deg} latitude. Water ice observed with THEMIS is most likely seasonal rather than diurnal. Our dataset is consistent with near-infrared spectroscopic data predictions by the Mars Planetary Climate Model. The water frost average temperature is 170 K, and the maximum temperature measured is 243 K, lower than the water ice melting point. We show that the melting of pure water ice on the surface is unlikely due to cooling by latent heat during its sublimation. However, 243 THEMIS images show frosts that are hot enough to form brines if salts are present on the surface. The water vapor pressure at the surface, calculated from the ice temperature, indicates a dry atmosphere in early spring, during the recession of the CO2 ice cap. When it sublimes, the frost acts as a vapor source that is wetter than the near-surface atmosphere, which stabilizes the subsurface ice.</description>

      <title>Stellar Characterization and a Chromospheric Activity Analysis of a K2 Sample of Planet-Hosting Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effective temperatures, surface gravities, and iron abundances were derived for 109 stars observed by the K2 mission using equivalent width measurements of Fe I and Fe II lines. Calculations were carried out in LTE using Kurucz model atmospheres. Stellar masses and radii were derived by combining the stellar parameters with Gaia DR3 parallaxes, V-magnitudes, and isochrones. The derived stellar and planetary radii have median internal precision of 1.8%, and 2.3%, respectively. The radius gap near $\rm R_{planet}\sim 1.9 R_\oplus$ was detected in this K2 sample. Chromospheric activity was measured from the Ca II H and K lines using the Values of $\log R^\prime_{\rm HK}$ were investigated as a function of stellar rotational period (P$_{rot}$) and we found that chromospheric activity decreases with increasing P$_{rot}$, although there is a large scatter in $\log R^\prime_{\rm HK}$ ($\sim$0.5) for a given P$_{rot}$. Activity levels in this sample reveal a paucity of F &amp; G dwarfs with intermediate activity levels (Vaughan-Preston gap). The effect that stellar activity might have on the derivation of stellar parameters was investigated by including magnetically-sensitive Fe I lines in the analysis and we find no significant differences between parameters with and without magnetically-sensitive lines, although the more active stars ($\log R^\prime _{\rm HK}&gt;-5.0$) exhibit a larger scatter in the differences in $T_{\rm eff}$ and [Fe/H].</description>

      <title>Rotation and Abundances of the Benchmark Brown Dwarf HD 33632 Ab from Keck/KPIC High-resolution Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the projected rotational velocity and molecular abundances for HD 33632 Ab obtained via Keck Planet Imager and Characterizer high-resolution spectroscopy. HD 33632 Ab is a nearby benchmark brown dwarf companion at a separation of $\sim$20 au that straddles the L/T transition. Using a forward-modeling framework with self-consistent substellar atmospheric and retrieval models for HD 33632 Ab, we derive a projected rotational velocity of 53 $\pm$ 3 km/s and water plus carbon monoxide mass fractions of log CO = $-$2.3 $\pm$ 0.3 and log H$_2$O = $-$2.7 $\pm$ 0.2. The inferred carbon-to-oxygen ratio (C/O = 0.58 $\pm$ 0.14), molecular abundances, and metallicity ([C/H] = 0.0 $\pm$ 0.2 dex) of HD 33632 Ab are consistent with its host star. Although detectable methane opacities are expected in L/T transition objects, we did not recover methane in our KPIC spectra, partly due to the high $v\sin{i}$ and to disequilibrium chemistry at the pressures we are sensitive to. We parameterize the spin as the ratio of rotation over break-up velocity, and compare HD 33632 Ab to a compilation of &gt;200 very low-mass objects (M$\lesssim$0.1 M$_{\odot}$) that have spin measurements in the literature. There appears to be no clear trend for the isolated field low-mass objects versus mass, but a tentative trend is identified for low-mass companions and directly imaged exoplanets, similar to previous findings. A larger sample of close-in gas giant exoplanets and brown dwarfs will critically examine our understanding of their formation and evolution through rotation and chemical abundance measurements.</description>

      <title>Neuromorphic Robust Estimation of Nonlinear Dynamical Systems Applied to Satellite Rendezvous</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08392v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: State estimation of nonlinear dynamical systems has long aimed to balance accuracy, computational efficiency, robustness, and reliability. The rapid evolution of various industries has amplified the demand for estimation frameworks that satisfy all these factors. This study introduces a neuromorphic approach for robust filtering of nonlinear dynamical systems: SNN-EMSIF (spiking neural network-extended modified sliding innovation filter). SNN-EMSIF combines the computational efficiency and scalability of SNNs with the robustness of EMSIF, an estimation framework designed for nonlinear systems with zero-mean Gaussian noise. Notably, the weight matrices are designed according to the system model, eliminating the need for a learning process. The framework's efficacy is evaluated through comprehensive Monte Carlo simulations, comparing SNN-EMSIF with EKF and EMSIF. Additionally, it is compared with SNN-EKF in the presence of modeling uncertainties and neuron loss, using RMSEs as a metric. The results demonstrate the superior accuracy and robustness of SNN-EMSIF. Further analysis of runtimes and spiking patterns reveals an impressive reduction of 85% in emitted spikes compared to possible spikes, highlighting the computational efficiency of SNN-EMSIF. This framework offers a promising solution for robust estimation in nonlinear dynamical systems, opening new avenues for efficient and reliable estimation in various industries that can benefit from neuromorphic computing.</description>

      <title>Using autoencoders and deep transfer learning to determine the stellar parameters of 286 CARMENES M dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08703v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning (DL) techniques are a promising approach among the set of methods used in the ever-challenging determination of stellar parameters in M dwarfs. In this context, transfer learning could play an important role in mitigating uncertainties in the results due to the synthetic gap (i.e. difference in feature distributions between observed and synthetic data). We propose a feature-based deep transfer learning (DTL) approach based on autoencoders to determine stellar parameters from high-resolution spectra. Using this methodology, we provide new estimations for the effective temperature, surface gravity, metallicity, and projected rotational velocity for 286 M dwarfs observed by the CARMENES survey. Using autoencoder architectures, we projected synthetic PHOENIX-ACES spectra and observed CARMENES spectra onto a new feature space of lower dimensionality in which the differences between the two domains are reduced. We used this low-dimensional new feature space as input for a convolutional neural network to obtain the stellar parameter determinations. We performed an extensive analysis of our estimated stellar parameters, ranging from 3050 to 4300 K, 4.7 to 5.1 dex, and -0.53 to 0.25 dex for Teff, logg, and [Fe/H], respectively. Our results are broadly consistent with those of recent studies using CARMENES data, with a systematic deviation in our Teff scale towards hotter values for estimations above 3750 K. Furthermore, our methodology mitigates the deviations in metallicity found in previous DL techniques due to the synthetic gap. We consolidated a DTL-based methodology to determine stellar parameters in M dwarfs from synthetic spectra, with no need for high-quality measurements involved in the knowledge transfer. These results suggest the great potential of DTL to mitigate the differences in feature distributions between the observations and the PHOENIX-ACES spectra.</description>

      <title>Analytical capability of K-Ar isochron dating on Mars: assessment from mineral compositions of Martian meteorites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.11370v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dating rocks with a precision of $\pm$200 Myr (2$\sigma$) has been required to understand the Martian habitability and volcanic history around 4000 Myr ago. In situ potassium-argon (K-Ar) dating techniques employing spot-by-spot laser ablation have been developed for isochron dating on Mars. The precision of isochron ages is predominantly determined by the relationship between the laser spot diameter and the mineral grain size. However, the achievable age precisions for the realistic mineralogy of Martian rocks were not investigated yet. This study simulates isochrons under various conditions, including laser spot size, measurement errors for K and Ar, the number of isochron points, and the mineral compositions of representative Martian meteorites (NWA 817, Zagami, and NWA 1068) analyzed with an electron microprobe. We find that attaining the 200 Myr precision necessitates an isochron data range wider than 6, a laser spot diameter of 250 $\mu$m, and measurement errors of 10% for both K and Ar. Furthermore, minimizing the variance in measurement errors between K and Ar is essential for increasing age accuracy. This investigation demonstrates that the required precision for Mars missions is achievable with realistic instrument settings, thus supporting the viability of in situ K-Ar geochronology on Mars.</description>

      <title>Evidence of grain alignment by magnetically enhanced radiative torques from multi-wavelength dust polarization modeling of HL Tau</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00220v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) has revolutionized the field of dust polarization in protoplanetary disks across multiple wavelengths. Previous observations and empirical modeling suggested multiple mechanisms of dust polarization toward HL Tau, including grain alignment and dust scattering. However, a detailed modeling of dust polarization based on grain alignment physics is not yet available. Here, using our updated POLARIS code, we perform numerical modeling of dust polarization arising from both grain alignment by Magnetically Enhanced Radiative Torque (MRAT) mechanism and self-scattering to reproduce the HL Tau polarization observed at three wavelengths 0.87, 1.3, and 3.1$\,$mm. Our modeling results show that the observed multi-wavelength polarization could be reproduced only when large grains contain embedded iron inclusions and those with slow internal relaxation must have wrong internal alignment (i.e., the grain's major axis parallel to its angular momentum). The abundance of iron embedded inside grains in the form of clusters is constrained to be $\gtrsim 16$%, and the number of iron atoms per cluster is $N_{\rm cl} \sim 9\times10^2$.

Abstract: We present an updated version of GRASS (the GRanulation And Spectrum Simulator, Palumbo et al. 2022) which now uses an expanded library of 22 solar lines to empirically model time-resolved spectral variations arising from solar granulation. We show that our synthesis model accurately reproduces disk-integrated solar line profiles and bisectors, and we quantify the intrinsic granulation-driven radial-velocity (RV) variability for each of the 22 lines studied. We show that summary statistics of bisector shape (e.g., bisector inverse slope) are strongly correlated with the measured anomalous, variability-driven RV at high pixel signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and spectral resolution. Further, the strength of the correlations vary both line by line and with the summary statistic used. These correlations disappear for individual lines at the typical spectral resolutions and SNRs achieved by current EPRV spectrographs; so we use simulations from GRASS to demonstrate that they can, in principle, be recovered by selectively binning lines that are similarly affected by granulation. In the best-case scenario (high SNR and large number of binned lines), we find that a $\lesssim$30$\%$ reduction in the granulation-induced root mean square (RMS) RV can be achieved, but that the achievable reduction in variability is most strongly limited by the spectral resolution of the observing instrument. Based on our simulations, we predict that existing ultra-high-resolution spectrographs, namely ESPRESSO and PEPSI, should be able to resolve convective variability in other, bright stars.</description>
