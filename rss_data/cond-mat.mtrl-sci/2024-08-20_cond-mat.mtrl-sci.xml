      <title>Covariant Jacobi-Legendre expansion for total energy calculations within the projector-augmented-wave formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine-learning models can be trained to predict the converged electron charge density of a density functional theory (DFT) calculation. In general, the value of the density at a given point in space is invariant under global translations and rotations having that point as a centre. Hence, one can construct locally invariant machine-learning density predictors. However, the widely used projector augmented wave (PAW) implementation of DFT requires the evaluation of the one-center augmentation contributions, that are not rotationally invariant. Building on our recently proposed Jacobi-Legendre charge-density scheme, we construct a covariant Jacobi-Legendre model capable of predicting the local occupancies needed to compose the augmentation charge density. Our formalism is then applied to the prediction of the energy barrier for the 1H-to-1T phase transition of two-dimensional MoS$_2$. With extremely modest training, the model is capable of performing a non-self-consistent nudged elastic band calculation at virtually the same accuracy as a fully DFT-converged one, thus saving thousands of self-consistent DFT steps. Furthermore, at variance with machine-learning force fields, the charge density is here available for any nudged elastic band image, so that we can trace the evolution of the electronic structure across the phase transition.</description>

      <title>How to cleave cubic perovskite oxides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surfaces of cubic perovskite oxides attract significant attention for their physical tunability and high potential for technical applications. Bulk-terminated surfaces are desirable for theoretical modelling and experimental reproducibility, yet there is a lack of methods for preparing such well-defined surfaces. We discuss a method for strain-assisted cleaving of perovskite single crystals, using a setup easily transferable between different experimental systems. The details of the cleaving device and the procedure were optimized in a systematic study on the model SrTiO$_3$. The large-area morphology and typical distribution of surface terminations on cleaved SrTiO$_3$(001) is presented, with specific guidelines on how to distinguish well-cleaved surfaces from conchoidally fractured ones. The cleaving is applicable to other cubic perovskites, as demonstrated on KTaO$_3$(001) and BaTiO$_3$(001). This approach opens up a pathway for obtaining high-quality surfaces of this promising class of materials.</description>

      <title>Altermagnetism in Two Dimensional Ca-Ru-O Perovskite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose and characterize a novel two-dimensional material, 2D-CRO, derived from bulk calcium-based ruthenates (CROs) of the Ruddlesden-Popper family, Ca$_{n+1}$Ru$_n$O$_{3n+1}$ ($n = 1$ and $2$). Using density functional theory, we demonstrate that 2D-CRO maintains structural stability down to the monolayer limit, exhibiting a tight interplay between structural and electronic properties. Notably, 2D-CRO displays altermagnetic behavior, characterized by zero net magnetization and strong spin-dependent phenomena, stabilized through dimensionality reduction. This stability is achieved by breaking inversion symmetry along the z-axis, favoring altermagnetic properties even in the absence of van der Waals interactions. Through theoretical models and computational analysis, we explore the altermagnetic behavior of 2D-CRO, both with and without spin-orbit coupling. We identify the spin components that contribute to the altermagnetic character and highlight the potential of 2D-CRO as a promising material for investigating altermagnetic phenomena and topological features.</description>

      <title>Second-Order Raman Scattering in Exfoliated Black Phosphorus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Second-order Raman scattering has been extensively studied in carbon-based nanomaterials, \emph{e.g.} nanotube and graphene, because it activates normally forbidden Raman modes that are sensitive to crystal disorder, such as defects, dopants, strain, etc. The sp$^2$-hybridized carbon systems are, however, the exception among most nanomaterials, where first-order Raman processes usually dominate. Here we report the identification of four second-order Raman modes, named $D_1$, $D_1'$, $D_2$ and $D_2'$, in exfoliated black phosphorus (P(black)), an elemental direct-gap semiconductor exhibiting strong mechanical and electronic anisotropies. Located in close proximity to the $A^1_g$ and $A^2_g$ modes, these new modes dominate at an excitation wavelength of 633 nm. Their evolutions as a function of sample thickness, excitation wavelength, and defect density indicate that they are defect-activated and involve high-momentum phonons in a doubly-resonant Raman process. \emph{Ab initio} simulations of a monolayer reveal that the $D'$ and $D$ modes occur through intravalley scatterings with split contributions in the armchair and zigzag directions, respectively. The high sensitivity of these $D$ modes to disorder helps explaining several discrepancies found in the literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present work, we study the structural, electronic and optical properties of Sodium Based Cubic Fluoro-perovskites: NaBF$_3$ (B= Ca, Mg or Zn) using DFT and TDDFT methods. We performed the density functional theory DFT calculations under the mBJ-GGA approximation. In addition, we applied the norm-conserving pseudo-potentials without spin-orbit coupling (SOC) approximations. In addition, we used the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof generalized gradient approximation (GGA-PBE) to deduce the physical properties of these alloys. Moreover, the Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory (TDDFT) method has been performed to deduce the optical properties, in an excited state, of the studied Sodium Based Cubic Fluoro-perovskites: NaBF$_3$ (B= Ca, Mg or Zn) materials.</description>

      <title>Complexions at the Iron-Magnetite Interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synthesizing distinct phases and controlling the crystalline defects in them are key concepts in materials and process design. These approaches are usually described by decoupled theories, with the former resting on equilibrium thermodynamics and the latter on nonequilibrium kinetics. By combining them into a holistic form of defect phase diagrams, we can apply phase equilibrium models to the thermodynamic evaluation of defects such as vacancies, dislocations, surfaces, grain boundaries, and phase boundaries, placing the understanding of material imperfections and their role on properties on solid thermodynamic and theoretical grounds. In this study, we characterize an interface-stabilized phase between Fe and Fe3O4 (magnetite) with differential phase contrast (DPC) imaging in scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). This method uniquely enables the simultaneous imaging of both heavy Fe atoms and light O atoms, providing precise mapping of the atomic structure and chemical composition at this heterogeneous metal-oxide interface. We identify a well-ordered two-layer interface-stabilized phase state (referred to as complexion) at the Fe[001]/Fe3O4[001] interface. Using density-functional theory (DFT), we not only explain the observed complexion but also map out various interface-stabilized phases as a function of the O chemical potential. We show that the formation of complexions influences the properties of the interface, increasing its adhesion by 20 % and changing the charge transfer between adjacent materials, also leveraging impact on the transport properties across such interfaces. Our findings highlight the potential of tunable phase states at defects as a new asset in advanced materials design, paving the way for knowledge-based and optimized corrosion protection, catalysis, magnetism, and redox-driven phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Out-of-distribution materials property prediction using adversarial learning based fine-tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accurate prediction of material properties is crucial in a wide range of scientific and engineering disciplines. Machine learning (ML) has advanced the state of the art in this field, enabling scientists to discover novel materials and design materials with specific desired properties. However, one major challenge that persists in material property prediction is the generalization of models to out-of-distribution (OOD) samples,i.e., samples that differ significantly from those encountered during training. In this paper, we explore the application of advancements in OOD learning approaches to enhance the robustness and reliability of material property prediction models. We propose and apply the Crystal Adversarial Learning (CAL) algorithm for OOD materials property prediction,which generates synthetic data during training to bias the training towards those samples with high prediction uncertainty. We further propose an adversarial learning based targeting finetuning approach to make the model adapted to a particular OOD dataset, as an alternative to traditional fine-tuning. Our experiments demonstrate the success of our CAL algorithm with its high effectiveness in ML with limited samples which commonly occurs in materials science. Our work represents a promising direction toward better OOD learning and materials property prediction.</description>

      <title>Atomic Engineering of Triangular Nanopores in Monolayer hBN: A Decoupled Seeding and Growth Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanopores in 2D materials are of significant interest in advanced membrane technologies aimed at the sensing and separation of ions and molecules. These applications necessitate 2D nanopores that are precise in size and shape, and abundant in number. However, conventional fabrication techniques often struggle to achieve both high precision and throughput. In this study, we introduce a decoupled seeding and growth approach designed to overcome this limitation. The method allows the controlled fabrication of ensembles of nanopores with narrow size distribution and is demonstrated for free-standing monolayer hexagonal boron nitride. Using light ion showering, we first create vacancy defect seeds. These seeds are then expanded into triangular nanopores through element-specific preferential atom removal under broad-beam electron irradiation in a transmission electron microscope. Nanopore density and size are controlled by the ion and electron irradiation doses, respectively. During the electron irradiation step, high-resolution imaging allows real-time tracking of the nanopore formation process, enabling the highest level of control. An additional workflow is introduced using thermal annealing in air for the nanopore growth step, delivering the most flexible platform for nanopore fabrication over larger areas with the significant benefit of concurrently removing surface hydrocarbon contamination to mitigate pore clogging and distortion. This study provides researchers with a novel approach to create ensembles of meticulously designed nanopores with well-controlled size and geometry, facilitating the development of next-generation membrane devices that will demand high precision and high throughput nanopore fabrication pipelines.</description>

      <title>A computational study of how surfaces affect slip family activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plastic deformation behavior is most conveniently assessed by characterization on a surface, but whether such observations are representative of bulk properties is uncertain. Motivated by reported inconsistencies in slip resistance probed at different depths, we investigated (i) whether the average slip family activity is affected by the presence of a surface and (ii) how the kinematic nature of available slip families influences a potential surface effect. The slip family activity as a function of distance from the surface was extracted from full-field crystal plasticity simulations of random polycrystalline hexagonal close-packed (HCP) and body-centered cubic (BCC) metals as examples of mixed in contrast to universally-high numbers of slip systems per family. Under certain conditions, a deviation from bulk slip activity is observed up to about two grains from the surface. For the easiest (least slip-resistant) family, a surface effect of decreasing activity with depth emerges if the number of slip systems falls below about six. For harder families, slip activity always increases with depth. These phenomena are explained on the basis of varying constraints with depth in connection with the kinematic properties of slip families in the material.</description>

      <title>Interplay of phonon directionality and emission polarization in two-dimensional layered metal halide perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With polarized and angle-resolved Raman spectroscopy studies on single two-dimensional layered perovskites (2DLP) flakes with different ammonium molecules as organic cations, in 2020 we revealed the very rich phonon spectra in the low-frequency regime. Although the phonon bands at low frequency can generally be attributed to the vibrations of the inorganic lattice, we found very different phonon spectra for the same lead-bromide octahedra composition by only changing the type of the organic cations. In addition, the intensity of the different phonon modes depended strongly on the angle of the linearly polarized excitation beam with respect to the in-plane axes of the octahedra lattice. In 2022, we mapped this angular dependence of the phonon modes, which enabled to identify the directionality of the different lattice vibrations. By correlating the phonon spectra with the temperature-dependent emission for a set of 2DLPs that featured very different STE emission, we demonstrated that the exciton relaxation cannot be related to coupling with a single (longitudinal optical) phonon band, and that several phonon bands should be involved in the emission process. We performed angle-resolved polarized emission and Raman spectroscopy on the same two-dimensional lead iodide perovskite microcrystals, which revealed the impact of the organic cations on the linear polarization of the emission, and corroborated our interpretation that multiple phonon bands should be involved in the radiative recombination process. Our studies revealed a wealth of highly directional low-frequency phonons in 2DLPs from which several bands are involved in the emission process, which leads to diverse optical and vibrational properties depending on the type of organic cation in the material.</description>

      <title>Nuclear spin polarization in silicon carbide at room temperature in the Earth's magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coupled electron-nuclear spins represent a promising quantum system, where the optically induced electron spin polarization can be dynamically transferred to nuclear spins via the hyperfine interaction. Most experiments on dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) are performed at cryogenic temperatures and/or in moderate external magnetic fields, the latter approach being very sensitive to the magnetic field orientation. Here, we demonstrate that the $^{29}$Si nuclear spins in SiC can be efficiently polarized at room temperature even in the Earth's magnetic field. We exploit the asymmetric splitting of the optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) lines inherent to half-integer $S = 3/2$ electron spins, such that the certain transitions involving $^{29}$Si nuclei can be clearly separated and selectively addressed using radiofrequency (RF) fields. As a model system, we use the V3 silicon vacancy in 6H-SiC, which has the zero-filed splitting parameter comparable with the hyperfine interaction constant. Our theoretical model considers DNP under optical excitation in combination with RF driving and agrees very well with the experimental data. In the case of high-fidelity electron spin polarization, the proposed DNP protocol leads to ultra-deep optical cooling of nuclear spins with an effective temperature of about 50 nK. These results provide a straightforward approach for controlling the nuclear spin under ambient conditions, representing an important step toward realizing nuclear hyperpolarization for magnetic resonance imaging and long nuclear spin memory for quantum logic gates.</description>

      <title>Deconvoluting Thermomechanical Effects in X-ray Diffraction Data using Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray diffraction is ideal for probing sub-surface state during complex or rapid thermomechanical loading of crystalline materials. However, challenges arise as the size of diffraction volumes increase due to spatial broadening and inability to deconvolute the effects of different lattice deformation mechanisms. Here we present a novel approach to use combinations of physics-based modeling and machine learning to deconvolve thermal and mechanical elastic strains for diffraction data analysis. The method builds on a previous effort to extract thermal strain distribution information from diffraction data. The new approach is applied to extract the evolution of thermomechanical state during laser melting of an Inconel 625 wall specimen which produces significant residual stress upon cooling. A combination of heat transfer and fluid flow, elasto-plasticity, and X-ray diffraction simulations are used to generate training data for machine-learning (Gaussian Process Regression, GPR) models that map diffracted intensity distributions to underlying thermomechanical strain fields. First-principles density functional theory is used to determine accurate temperature-dependent thermal expansion and elastic stiffness used in the elasto-plasticity modeling. The trained GPR models are found to be capable of deconvoluting the effects of thermal and mechanical strains, in addition to providing information about underlying strain distributions, even from complex diffraction patterns with irregularly shaped peaks.</description>

      <title>Efficient spin to charge conversion and spin memory loss mitigation in oriented $\text{RuO}_2$ films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $\text{RuO}_2$, a transition metal oxide, is attracting attention in spintronics for its unique altermagnetic properties, which influence spin currents. Its ability to produce large spin-orbit torques and spin Hall effects is key for energy-efficient magnetic memory and logic devices. Additionally, the tunable thickness and crystallinity of $\text{RuO}_2$ thin films optimize torque efficiency for low-power switching. Spin pumping, a versatile method for investigating spin dynamics in $\text{RuO}_2$ thin films, has garnered considerable interest because of its straightforward, non-invasive and uncomplicated approach to addressing impedance mismatch and direct measurement of spintronic parameters. Here we present a systematic and detailed analysis on the efficient spin to charge conversion in (110)-oriented $\text{RuO}_2$ films with amorphous CoFeB as spin source. The spin Hall angle, and spin diffusion length were estimated to be 0.14 $\pm$ 0.01 and 4.58 $\pm$ 0.40 nm, respectively. The spin Hall conductivity of 998.89 $\pm$ 58.23 $\hbar \cdot \frac{\Omega^{-1} \, \text{cm}^{-1}}{e}$ has been estimated which is theoretically predicted to be of the similar order. The interfacial spin transparency has been achieved to be 90%. We have shown that the spin memory loss at the $\text{RuO}_2$/CoFeB interface is 15%, which is very small.</description>

      <title>Giant magnetic anisotropy of Pb atoms in 3d-based magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electronic structure analysis is performed to study the properties of several Pb-containing 3d-intermetallics. Our study reveals that binary metastable Co3Pb and Fe3Pb intermetallic compounds exhibit very attractive intrinsic magnetic properties. We primarily focus on the magnetic anisotropic properties arising from the high spin-orbit coupling of the Pb atom. Decomposing the total anisotropy into intra- and interatomic contributions reveals a significant deviation from single ion anisotropy model with strong symmetric anisotropic pair interactions present. Furthermore, we consider magnetic properties of ternary Pb-based 3d-intermetallics which recently have been reported as stable or metastable. Giant magnetic anisotropy is found on Pb atoms in these systems. The origin of such strong anisotropy in La18Co28Pb3 appears from two sources: spin-orbit and interelectronic Breit couplings. The significance of Breit interaction for magnetic anisotropy in bulk systems has not been reported previously. It is expected that Breit coupling induced anisotropy is dominating in magnetic Pb-based magnets with lower dimensionality including thin films.</description>

      <title>Entropy-induced confinement in two-dimensional magnetic monopole gases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic monopole quasiparticles in spin ice materials hold the potential for exploring new frontiers of physics that extend beyond Maxwell's equations. We have previously proposed a two-dimensional magnetic monopole gas (2DMG), confined at the interface between spin-ice ($R_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$, $R$ = Dy, Ho) and antiferromagnetic iridate ($R_2$Ir$_2$O$_7$, $R$ = Dy, Ho), which hosts monopoles with a net charge. The mechanism behind the 2D confinement of the monopole gas remains unclear. In this work, we demonstrate that entropy is a key factor in the 2D confinement of this monopole gas. We reveal that the competition between the entropy of spin-ice, which favors the 2D confinement, and the entropy of the monopoles' random walks, which favors the deconfinement, dictates the distribution of the monopoles within a few layers close to the interface. Our entropy-based model accurately reproduces the monopole distribution obtained from the spin model, affirming that 2D confinement is entropy-driven. We further employ both models to show that the monopole distribution can be manipulated by an external magnetic field and temperature, holding promise for next-generation devices based on magnetic monopoles. Our findings reveal the entropic mechanisms in 2DMG, enabling the manipulation of emergent quasiparticles at material interfaces.</description>

      <title>Imaging ferroelectric domains with soft X-ray ptychography at the oxygen K-edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ferroelectric domain structure of a freestanding BiFeO$_3$ film was visualized by ptychographic dichroic imaging with linearly polarized X-rays at the O K-edge around 530 eV. The dichroic contrast is maximized at the energy of the hybridization of the O 2p state and the Fe 3d orbitals, which is split by the octahedral crystal field of the perovskite structure. The thus obtained microscopy images compliment the ptychographic imaging of the antiferromagnetic contribution at the Fe L$_3$-edge. The approach is extendible to the separation of different ferroic contributions in other multiferroic oxides.</description>

      <title>Room-Temperature Multiferroic Skyrmions in LiNbO3 with enhancement in electric-optical property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LiNbO3 (LN) is renowned for its exceptional ferroelectric properties, particularly its notable linear electro-optical (EO) effect, which is highly advantageous for various applications such as high-speed communication, optical computation, and quantum information processing. Compared to its ferroelectric properties, the magnetism of LN is not attractive enough due to its weak ferromagnetic nature. Theoretical studies suggest that LN may exhibit a novel magnetoelectric coupling via ferroelectrically-induced ferromagnetism. However, this mechanism has not yet been experimentally validated in any materials, presenting significant challenges for research. In this study, we provide the first experimental evidence supporting the mechanism of ferroelectrically-induced ferromagnetism in LN, including observations of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) and magnetoelectric coupling. Additionally, we have identified various multiferroic skyrmions, within which ferroelectric polarization signals are detectable. These signals can be influenced by the magnetic vortex structures, indicating a magnetoelectric coupling nature. Currently, they are the only multiferroic skyrmions that can keep stable at room temperature. Moreover, these magnetic textures significantly affect the ferroelectric properties, as demonstrated by an enhancement of the linear electro-optic effect of LN by over 200%. Given the novel magnetoelectric coupling mechanism, the potential of multiferroic skyrmions in spintronics and advanced data storage, and the extensive use of LN EO modulators, our research has significant implications for condensed matter physics, multiferroic materials, and optoelectronics.</description>

      <title>Topological phase transitions in perovskite superlattices driven by temperature, electric field, and doping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many dipolar topological structures have been experimentally demonstrated in (PbTiO$_3$)$_n$/(SrTiO$_3$)$_n$ superlattices, such as flux-closure, vortice, and skyrmion. In this work, we employ deep potential molecular dynamics (MD) to investigate the dynamical response of the (PbTiO$_3$)$_{10}$/(SrTiO$_3$)$_{10}$ superlattice, supporting polar vortex arrays, to temperature and electric field at the atomic level. Our simulations reveal a unique phase transition sequence from ferroelectric-like to antiferroelectric-like to paraelectric in the in-plane direction as temperature increases.In the ferroelectric-like state, we observe field-driven reversible switching of in-plane polarization coupled with out-of-plane movements of vortex cores during MD simulations. In the antiferroelectric-like region, the polarization-electric field hysteresis loop exhibits a superparaelectric feature, showing nearly no loss. This behavior is attributed to a strong recovering force to form polar vortex arrays, dictated by the electrical and mechanical boundary conditions within the superlattice. The (PbTiO$_3$)$_{10}$/(SrTiO$_3$)$_{10}$ superlattice in the antiferroelectric-like state also demonstrates large in-plane susceptibility and tunability. The effect of Pb doping in the SrTiO$_3$ layer on the topological structural transition in the superlattice is investigated. The weakened depolarization field in the PbTiO$_3$ layers leads to new dipolar configurations, such as enlarged skyrmion bubble within $c$ domains in (PbTiO$_3$)$_{10}$/(Pb$_{0.4}$Sr$_{0.6}$TiO$_3$)$_{10}$, and we quantify their thermal and electrical responses through MD simulations. These quantitative atomistic insights will be useful for the controlled optimization of perovskite superlattices for various device applications.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Mechanism of Phonon-Polariton Damping in \alpha-MoO_3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phonon polaritons (PhPs) (light coupled to lattice vibrations) in the highly anisotropic polar layered material molybdenum trioxide (\alpha-MoO_3) are currently the focus of intense research efforts due to their extreme subwavelength field confinement, directional propagation and unprecedented low losses. Nevertheless, prior research has primarily concentrated on exploiting the squeezing and steering capabilities of \alpha-MoO_3 PhPs, without inquiring much into the dominant microscopic mechanism that determines their long lifetimes, key for their implementation in nanophotonic applications. This study delves into the fundamental processes that govern PhP damping in \alpha-MoO_3 by combining ab initio calculations with scattering-type scanning near-field optical microscopy (s-SNOM) and Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy measurements across a broad temperature range (from 8 to 300 K). The remarkable agreement between our theoretical predictions and experimental observations allows us to identify third-order anharmonic phonon-phonon scattering as the main damping mechanism of \alpha-MoO_3 PhPs. These findings shed light on the fundamental limits of low-loss PhPs, a crucial factor for assessing their implementation into nanophotonic devices.</description>

      <title>Crystallite size and microstrain in the structure of SrTiO3 formed by magnetron deposition with and without O2 flow through the deposition chambre</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transition metal oxides, which have a perovskite structure, have received much attention in recent decades. This is because of the very suitable properties that can be used in various industries. One of the fields where the properties of Perovskites can and have already been applied is in the power industry. Experimental studies of the last few years have reliably demonstrated that, using simple modifications, perovskite oxides can be used in applications utilizing direct sunlight and photocatalytic applications. The original strontium titanate oxide SrTiO3 (abbreviated STO) is only able to use the UV component of incident radiation and is inactive in visible light, remaining transparent to visible light. The reason for this state is its wide band gap, which at room temperature has a value of 3.2 - 3.25 eV. Studies have shown that doping the structure of these oxides with transition metals (TM) can cause a shift in the valence and/or conduction band. This is because of the 3d dopant bands that create new energy levels in the mentioned band gap, effectively reducing it. One of the elements of the TM group is nickel. According to some studies, it is likely that the Ni ion occurs in the cubic structure of STO in the form of Ni2+ and substitutes the Ti4+ sites. In the case of using this dopant, the shift of the absorption edge of STO:Nix relative to NiO was found to be 1.1 eV. The present work investigates the differences in the structure of STO:Nix prepared by magnetron deposition method with different dopant amount settings. At the same time, the difference in structure was observed when prepared under vacuum with Ar working gas and when O2 was flowed through the deposition chamber. The premise of this experiment was to verify the formation of oxygen vacancies in the STO structure on which the photocatalytic phenomenon could occur.</description>

      <title>Oxygen redox in battery cathodes: A brief overview</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The participation of oxygen or other anionic species in redox activities in cathode materials for lithium and sodium-ion battery systems is known to play a role in governing the useful capacity of these batteries. Directly probing anionic redox mechanisms is not possible, rather the computational analysis by density functional theory poses the main approach towards gleaning insights into anionic redox activity and harnessing these effects to maximize capacity in future electrode materials. Here we showcase material systems exhibiting this mechanism of ion insertion and removal, and present the key computational considerations in studying anionic redox activities in battery materials. Aided by new computationally derived understandings of the role of anionic redox in emerging battery materials, increasingly greater levels of useable capacities can be extracted through informed materials design.</description>

      <title>Magnetocaloric properties of single-crystalline Eu$_5$In$_2$Sb$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magnetocaloric effect (MCE) in single-crystalline Eu$_5$In$_2$Sb$_6$ was studied over broad temperature ranges and magnetic field intervals, with the magnetic field oriented parallel and perpendicular to the crystallographic $\textit{c}$-axis in the orthorhombic Ca$_5$Ga$_2$As$_6$-type unit cell of the crystals. The compound is an antiferromagnetic insulator with two subsequent magnetic phase transitions at $T_{N1} \approx$ 14.0 K and $T_{N2} \approx$ 7.1 K. The compound was found to exhibit both normal and inverse MCE. Furthermore, due to substantial magnetic anisotropy, it also exhibits a rotational MCE. For conventional MCE, the maximum value of the isothermal entropy change $\Delta S_m$ is -4.7(1) J kg$^{-1}$ K$^{-1}$ at 15(1) K for a magnetic field change of 5 T, independent of the field direction. The relative cooling power (RCP) is also almost identical for both directions, and equals 81(1) J kg$^{-1}$ for a magnetic field change of 5 T. The most significant rotational MCE was observed at about 11 K, with a maximum $\Delta S_R$ value of 2.4(1) J kg$^{-1}$ K$^{-1}$ and RCP = 17.5(6) J kg$^{-1}$ for a magnetic field change of 4 T.</description>

      <title>Tunable interfacial Rashba spin-orbit coupling in asymmetric Al$_x$In$_{1-x}$Sb/InSb/CdTe quantum well heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The manipulation of Rashba-type spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in molecular beam epitaxy-grown Al$_x$In$_{1-x}$Sb/InSb/CdTe quantum well heterostructures is reported. The effective band bending provides robust two-dimensional quantum confinement, while the unidirectional built-in electric field from the asymmetric hetero-interfaces results in pronounced Rashba SOC strength. By tuning the Al concentration in the top Al$_x$In$_{1-x}$Sb barrier layer, the optimal structure with $x = 0.15$ shows the largest Rashba coefficient of 0.23 eV-Angstrom. and the highest low-temperature electron mobility of 4400 cm$^2$/Vs . Quantitative investigations of the weak anti-localization effect further confirm the dominant D'yakonov-Perel (DP) spin relaxation mechanism during charge-to-spin conversion. These findings highlight the significance of quantum well engineering in shaping magneto-resistance responses, and narrow bandgap semiconductor-based heterostructures may offer a reliable platform for energy-efficient spintronic applications.</description>

      <title>Gapless spin excitations in nanographene-based antiferromagnetic spin-1/2 Heisenberg chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Haldane's seminal work established two fundamentally different types of excitation spectra for antiferromagnetic Heisenberg quantum spin chains: gapped excitations in integer-spin chains and gapless excitations in half-integer-spin chains. In finite-length half-integer spin chains, quantization, however, induces a gap in the excitation spectrum, with the upper bound given by the Lieb-Schulz-Mattis (LSM) theorem. Here, we investigate the length-dependent excitations in spin-1/2 Heisenberg chains obtained by covalently linking olympicenes--Olympic rings shaped nanographenes carrying spin-1/2--into one-dimensional chains. The large exchange interaction (J~38 mV) between olympicenes and the negligible magnetic anisotropy in these nanographenes make them an ideal platform for studying quantum spin excitations, which we directly measure using inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy. We observe a power-law decay of the lowest excitation energy with increasing chain length L, remaining below the LSM boundary. In a long chain with L = 50, a nearly V-shaped excitation continuum is observed, reinforcing the system's gapless nature in the thermodynamic limit. Finally, we visualize the standing wave of a single spinon confined in odd-numbered chains using low-bias current maps. Our results provide compelling evidence for the realization of a one-dimensional analog of a gapless spin liquid.</description>

      <title>The influence of magnon renormalization and interband coupling on the spin Seebeck effect in YIG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With exceptionally low magnetic damping, YIG has been extensively applied in the realm of magnetism, encompassing the researches into the spin Seebeck effect. YIG has 20 magnon bands, including 8 higher-energy bands denoted as $\alpha_{1\sim8}$, and 12 lower-energy bands denoted as $\beta_{1\sim12}$. Here, we study the impact of the complex intraband and interband magnon couplings on the transport coefficients of YIG. Four-magnon processes in YIG are considered, and a self-consistent mean-field approximation is made for these interaction terms. We find that the $\beta$ bands exhibit minimal variation with increasing temperature, whereas the $\alpha$ bands undergo a noticeable decline as the temperature rises. These counterintuitive results agree well with the observation of earlier inelastic neutron scattering experiments and the results of the theoretical calculations in recent years. We also find it sufficient to include only the contribution of magnons on the acoustic band $\beta_1$ when studying the spin conductivity ($\sigma_m$). However, when calculating the spin Seebeck coefficient ($S_m$) and the magnon thermal conductivity ($\kappa_m$), the results calculated using only $\beta_{1}$ show noticeable deviations over a large temperature range compared to the full band calculations. These deviations are well mitigated when the $\beta_{2}$ and $\beta_{3}$ bands are considered.</description>

      <title>A strategy for fabricating micro-scale freestanding single-crystalline complex oxide device arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a general fabrication strategy for freestanding single-crystalline complex oxide device arrays via wet chemical etching-based microfabrication processes and epitaxial lift-off. Here, we used 0.5Ba(Zr$_{0.2}$Ti$_{0.8}$)O$_3$-0.5Ba(Zr$_{0.7}$Ti$_{0.3}$)O$_3$ (BCZT) as a model relaxor ferroelectric oxide system and La$_{0.7}$Sr$_{0.3}$MnO$_3$ as the sacrificial layer for demonstration. Arrays of SrRuO$_3$ (SRO) / BCZT / SRO ferroelectric capacitor mesas were first defined and isolated on the growth wafer, and then they were released using epitaxial lift-off with lithography-defined surrounding etching holes, after which the freestanding device arrays were integrated onto a glass substrate. Our proposed strategy sheds light on preparing various freestanding single-crystalline oxide devices and paves the way for their heterogeneous integration onto arbitrary substates.</description>

      <title>Excitonic-trion population in two-dimensional halide perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There are many reports of a surprisingly high charge-carrier density with sizable mobility in photo-excited two-dimensional (2D) halide perovskites despite their unusually high exciton binding-energy. In this work we study the thermodynamic quasi-equilibrium of the relative population of photoexcited free quasi-electron/quasi-hole pairs, neutral-excitons and excitonic trions, in 2D materials that support such excitonic complexes with large binding energy. We derive and solve the general Saha equations which describe the detailed balance of such a system of photo-excited electronic degrees of freedom forming a multi-component fluid of excitations in thermodynamic quasi-equilibrium.The solution to these equations, for the special case of 2D perovskites where the reported exciton and excitonic trion binding-energies are of the order of 0.3-0.4 eV for the former and 30-40 meV for the latter, reveals that while the charge-neutral excitonic population dominates all other excitations, at room temperature and below, the excitonic trion component can be the dominant population among charge carriers. We also argue that trionic hopping can take place via a tunneling mechanism which is speculated to play a role in a novel charge-transport mechanism.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper reviews recent developments in material science and device physics of high-quality epitaxial films of the transparent perovskite La-doped barium stannate, La:BaSnO$_3$. It presents current efforts in the synthesis science of epitaxial La:BaSnO$_3$ films for achieving reduced defect densities and high electron mobility at room temperature. We discuss the scattering mechanisms and the route towards engineering defect-free epitaxial La:BaSnO$_3$ heterostructures. By combining chemical surface characterization and electronic transport studies, a special emphasis is laid on the proper correlation between the transport properties and the electronic band structure of La:BaSnO$_3$ films and heterostructures. For application purposes, interesting optical properties of La:BaSnO$_3$ films are discussed. Finally, for their potential application in oxide electronics, an overview of current progress in the fabrication of La:BaSnO$_3$-based thin-film field-effect transistors is presented together with recent progress in the the fundamental realization of two-dimensional electron gases with high electron mobility in La:BaSnO$_3$-based heterostructures. Future experimental studies to reveal the potential deployment of La:BaSnO$_3$ films in optoelectronic and transparent electronics are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Stacking Polymorphism of PtSe$_{2}$: Its Implication to Layer-dependent Metal-insulator Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we examined the structural stability and interlayer binding properties of PtSe$_2$, a representative transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) with strong interlayer interaction. Our DMC results for the bilayer revealed that AA and AB-r stacking modes are nearly degenerate, highlighting the significant role of interlayer hybridization in offsetting the energy cost due to larger interlayer separations in the AB-r mode. Additionally, our DMC-benchmarked DFT studies with the r$^2$SCAN+rVV10 functional demonstrated pronounced stacking polymorphism in few-layer PtSe$_2$, suggesting the potential for stacking faults and the formation of grain boundaries between different stacking domains which could develop metallic electronic structures. Thus this polymorphism, along with selenium vacancies, influences a layer-dependent metal-insulator transition observed in few-layer PtSe$_2$. Our findings emphasize the importance of both van der Waals interactions and interlayer hybridization in determining the phase stability and electronic properties of TMDs, advancing our understanding of their fundamental properties and refining theoretical models for practical applications in nanoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Tunable Hyperuniformity in Cellular Structures</title>

Abstract: Hyperuniform materials, characterized by their suppressed density fluctuations and vanishing structure factors as the wave number approaches zero, represent a unique state of matter that straddles the boundary between order and randomness. These materials exhibit exceptional optical, mechanical, and acoustic properties, making them of great interest in materials science and engineering. Traditional methods for creating hyperuniform structures, including collective-coordinate optimization and centroidal Voronoi tessellations, have primarily been computational and face challenges in capturing the complexity of naturally occurring systems. This study introduces a comprehensive theoretical framework to generate hyperuniform structures inspired by the collective organization of biological cells within an epithelial tissue layer. By adjusting parameters such as cell elasticity and interfacial tension, we explore a spectrum of hyperuniform states from fluid to rigid, each exhibiting distinct mechanical properties and types of density fluctuations. Our results not only advance the understanding of hyperuniformity in biological tissues but also demonstrate the potential of these materials to inform the design of novel materials with tailored properties.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast creation of a light induced semimetallic state in strongly excited 1T-TiSe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08997v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Screening, a ubiquitous phenomenon associated with the shielding of electric fields by surrounding charges, has been widely adopted as a means to modify a material's properties. While so far most studies have relied on static changes of screening through doping or gating, here we demonstrate that screening can also drive the onset of distinct quantum states on the ultrafast timescale. By using time and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy we show that intense optical excitation can drive 1T-TiSe$_2$, a prototypical charge density wave material, almost instantly from a gapped into a semimetallic state. By systematically comparing changes in bandstructure over time and excitation strength with theoretical calculations we find that the appearance of this state is likely caused by a dramatic reduction of the screening length. In summary, this work showcases how optical excitation enables the screening driven design of a non-equilibrium semimetallic phase in TiSe$_2$, possibly providing a general pathway into highly screened phases in other strongly correlated materials.</description>

      <title>A versatile multilayer liquid-liquid encapsulation technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hypothesis: Generating multi-layer cargo using conventional methods is challenging. We hypothesize that incorporating a Y-junction compound droplet generator to encase a target core inside a second liquid can circumvent the kinetic energy dependence of the impact-driven liquid-liquid encapsulation technique, enabling minimally restrictive multi-layer encapsulation.
  Experiments: Stable wrapping is obtained by impinging a compound droplet (generated using Y-junction) on an interfacial layer of another shell-forming liquid floating on a host liquid bath, leading to double-layered encapsulation. The underlying dynamics of the liquid-liquid interfaces are captured using high-speed imaging. To demonstrate the versatility of the technique, we used various liquids as interfacial layers, including magnetoresponsive oil-based ferrofluids. Moreover, we extended the technique to triple-layered encapsulation by overlaying a second interfacial layer atop the first floating interfacial layer.
  Findings: The encapsulating layer(s) effectively protects the water-soluble inner core (ethylene glycol) inside the water bath. A non-dimensional experimental regime is established for successful encapsulation in terms of the impact kinetic energy, interfacial layer thickness, and the viscosity ratio of the interfacial layer and the outer core liquid. Using selective fluorescent tagging, we confirm the presence of individual shell layers wrapped around the core, which presents a promising pathway to visualize the internal morphology of final encapsulated droplets.</description>

      <title>Current rectification via Photosystem I monolayers induced by their orientation on hydrophilic self-assembled monolayers on titanium nitride</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photosystem I (PSI) is a photosynthetic protein which evolved to efficiently transfer electrons through the thylakoid membrane. This remarkable process attracted the attention of the biomolecular electronics community, which aims to study and understand the underlying electronic transport through these proteins by contacting ensembles of PSI with solid-state metallic contacts. This paper extends published work of immobilizing monolayers of PSI with a specific orientation, by using organophosphonate self-assembled molecules with hydrophilic heads on ultra-flat titanium nitride. Electrical measurements carried out with eutectic GaIn top contacts showed current rectification ratios of up to ~200. The previously proposed rectification mechanism, relying on the protein's internal electric dipole, was inquired by measuring shifts in the work function. Our straightforward bottom-up fabrication method may allow for further experimental studies on PSI molecules, such as embedding them in solid-state, transparent top contact schemes for optoelectronic measurements.</description>

      <title>Mono-exponential Current Attenuation with Distance across 16 nm Thick Bacteriorhodopsin Multilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09289v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The remarkable ability of natural proteins to conduct electricity in the dry state over long distances remains largely inexplicable despite intensive research. In some cases, a (weakly) exponential length-attenuation, as in off-resonant tunneling transport, extends to thicknesses even beyond 10 nm. This report deals with such charge transport characteristics observed in self-assembled multilayers of the protein bacteriorhodopsin (bR). About 7.5 nm to 15.5 nm thick bR layers were prepared on conductive titanium nitride (TiN) substrates using aminohexylphosphonic acid and poly-diallyl-dimethylammonium electrostatic linkers. Using conical EGaIn top contacts, an intriguing, mono-exponential conductance attenuation as a function of the bR layer thickness with a small attenuation coefficient $\beta \approx 0.8 \space {\rm nm}^{-1}$ is measured at zero bias. Variable-temperature measurements using evaporated Ti/Au top contacts yield effective energy barriers of about 100 meV from fitting the data to tunneling, hopping, and carrier cascade transport models. The observed temperature-dependence is assigned to the protein-electrode interfaces. The transport length and temperature dependence of the current densities are consistent with tunneling through the protein-protein and protein-electrode interfaces, respectively. Importantly, our results call for new theoretical approaches to find the microscopic mechanism behind the remarkably efficient, long-range electron transport within bR.</description>

      <title>Surface spectroscopy and surface-bulk hybridization of Weyl semimetals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Weyl semimetal showing open-arc surface states is a prominent example of topological quantum matter in three dimensions. With the bulk-boundary correspondence present, nontrivial surface-bulk hybridization is inevitable but less understood. Spectroscopies have been often limited to verifying the existence of surface Fermi arcs, whereas its spectral shape related to the hybridization profile in energy-momentum space is not well studied. We present an exactly solvable formalism at the surface for a wide range of prototypical Weyl semimetals. The resonant surface state and the bulk influence coexist as a surface-bulk hybrid and are treated in a unified manner. Directly accessible to angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we analytically reveal universal information about the system obtained from the spectroscopy of resonant topological states. We systematically find inhomogeneous and anisotropic singular responses around the surface-bulk merging borderline crossing Weyl points, highlighting its critical role in the Weyl topology. The response in scanning tunneling spectroscopy is also discussed. The results will provide much-needed insight into the surface-bulk-coupled physical properties and guide in-depth spectroscopic investigation of the nontrivial hybrid in many topological semimetal materials.</description>

Abstract: Molecular Property Prediction (MPP) plays a pivotal role across diverse domains, spanning drug discovery, material science, and environmental chemistry. Fueled by the exponential growth of chemical data and the evolution of artificial intelligence, recent years have witnessed remarkable strides in MPP. However, the multifaceted nature of molecular data, such as molecular structures, SMILES notation, and molecular images, continues to pose a fundamental challenge in its effective representation. To address this, representation learning techniques are instrumental as they acquire informative and interpretable representations of molecular data. This article explores recent AI/-based approaches in MPP, focusing on both single and multiple modality representation techniques. It provides an overview of various molecule representations and encoding schemes, categorizes MPP methods by their use of modalities, and outlines datasets and tools available for feature generation. The article also analyzes the performance of recent methods and suggests future research directions to advance the field of MPP.</description>

      <title>Nodal higher-order topological superconductivity from C6-symmetric Dirac semimetals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Three-dimensional Dirac semimetals (DSMs) have been shown to exhibit one-dimensional hinge modes which are termed the higher-order hinge Fermi-arc (HOFA) states. They are the topological consequences of Dirac points. Superconducting states from Dirac semimetals can inherit the Dirac points to form nodal Dirac superconducting states, raising a question of whether there exists a topological superconducting bulk-hinge correspondence similar to DSMs. In this work, we discuss the nodal superconducting states from half-filled DSMs respecting non-magnetic (Type-II) Shubnikov space group (SSG) $P6/mmm1'$. We find that the BdG Dirac points can lead to higher-order topological Dirac superconducting (HOTDSC) states instead of the expected higher-order Majorana-arc (HOMA) states. The HOTDSC states can be regarded as a crossing between the HOFAs in normal states and the BdG shadow states. We demonstrate that HOTDSC states can be indicated by relative topologies of BdG Dirac points by utilizing the theory of magnetic topological quantum chemistry (MTQC).</description>

      <title>Nonlinear planar magnetotransport as a probe of the quantum geometry of topological surface states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has been recently established that transport measurements in the nonlinear regime can give direct access to the quantum metric (QM): the real part of the quantum geometric tensor characterizing the geometry of the electronic wavefunctions in a solid. In topological materials, the QM has been so far revealed in thin films of the topological antiferromagnet MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ where it provides a direct contribution to longitudinal currents quadratic in the driving electric field. Here we show that the Dirac surface states of strong three-dimensional topological insulators have a QM that can be accessed from the nonlinear transport characteristics in the presence of an externally applied planar magnetic field. A previously unknown intrinsic part of the longitudinal magnetoconductivity carries the signature of the QM while coexisting with the extrinsic part generating the so-called bilinear magnetoelectric resistance. We prove that the QM-induced nonlinear transport arise both in topological insulators of the Bi$_2$Se$_3$ materials class and in the series of cubic mercury chalcogenides as a result of the combined action of the Zeeman coupling with hexagonal warping and particle-hole symmetry breaking effects respectively.</description>

      <title>Finite Temperature Magnetism in the Triangular Lattice Antiferromagnet KErTe2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: After the discovery of the ARECh2 (A=alkali or monovalent ions, RE=rare-earth, Ch= chalcogen) triangular lattice quantum spin liquid (QSL) family, a series of its oxide, sulfide, and selenide counterparts has been consistently reported and extensively investigated. While KErTe2 represents the initial synthesized telluride member, preserving its triangular spin lattice, it was anticipated that the substantial tellurium ions could impart more pronounced magnetic attributes and electronic structures to this material class. This study delves into the magnetism of KErTe2 at finite temperatures through magnetization and electron spin resonance (ESR) measurements. Based on the angular momentum $\hat{J}$ after spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and symmetry analysis, we obtain the magnetic effective Hamiltonian to describe the magnetism of Er3+ in R-3m space group. Applying the mean-field approximation to the Hamiltonian, we can simulate the magnetization and magnetic heat capacity of KErTe2 in paramagnetic state and determine the crystalline electric field (CEF) parameters and partial exchange interactions. The relatively narrow energy gaps between CEF ground state and excited states exert a significant influence on the magnetism. For example, small CEF excitations can result in a significant broadening of the ESR linewidth at 2 K. For the fitted exchange interactions, although the values are small, given a large angular momentum J = 15/2 after SOC, they still have a noticeable effect at finite temperatures. Notably, the heat capacity data under different magnetic fields along the c-axis direction also roughly match our calculated results, further validating the reliability of our analytical approach. These derived parameters serve as crucial tools for future investigations into the ground state magnetism of KErTe2.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Layered two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors have shown enhanced ion migration capabilities along their van der Waals (vdW) gaps and on their surfaces. This effect can be employed for resistive switching (RS) in devices for emerging memories, selectors, and neuromorphic computing. To date, all lateral molybdenum disulfide (MoS${_2}$)-based volatile RS devices with silver (Ag) ion migration have been demonstrated using exfoliated, single-crystal MoS${_2}$ flakes requiring a forming step to enable RS. Here, we present volatile RS with multilayer MoS${_2}$ grown by metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) with repeatable forming-free operation. The devices show highly reproducible volatile RS with low operating voltages of approximately 2 V and fast switching times down to 130 ns considering their micrometer scale dimensions. We investigate the switching mechanism based on Ag ion surface migration through transmission electron microscopy, electronic transport modeling, and density functional theory. Finally, we develop a physics-based compact model and explore the implementation of our volatile memristors as artificial neurons in neuromorphic systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The extrinsic stacking sequence based on intrinsic crystal symmetry in multilayer two-dimensional materials plays a significant role in determining their electronic and optical properties. Compared with Bernal-stacked (ABA) multilayer graphene, rhombohedral (ABC) multilayer graphene hosts stronger electron-electron interaction due to its unique dispersion at low-energy excitations and has been utiliazed as a unique platform to explore strongly correlated physics. However, discerning the stacking sequence has always been a quite time-consuming process by scanning mapping methods. Here, we report a rapid recognition method for ABC- stacked graphene with high accuracy by infrared imaging based on the distinct optical responses at infrared range. The optical contrast of the image between ABC and ABA stacked graphene is strikingly clear, and the discernibility is comparable to traditional optical Raman microscopy but with higher consistency and throughput. We further demonstrate that the infrared imaging technique can be integrated with dry transfer techniques commonly used in the community. This rapid and convenient infrared imaging technique will significantly improve the sorting efficiency for differently stacked multilayer graphene, thereby accelerating the exploration of the novel emergent correlated phenomena in ABC stacked graphene.</description>

      <title>Sputtered Aluminum Nitride Waveguides for the Telecommunication Spectrum with less than 0.16 dB/cm Loss</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the fabrication and characterization of photonic waveguides from sputtered aluminum nitride (AlN). The AlN films were deposited on 6" silicon substrates with a 3 $\mu$m buried silicon oxide layer using reactive DC magnetron sputtering at a temperature of 700{\deg}C. The resulting uncladded polycrystalline waveguides exhibit propagation losses of 0.137 $\pm$ 0.005 dB/cm at wavelengths of 1310 nm and 0.154 $\pm$ 0.008 dB/cm at a wavelength of 1550 nm in the TE polarization. These results are the best reported for sputtered AlN waveguides in the C-band and the first report in the O-band. These performances are comparable to those of the best-reported AlN waveguides, which are epitaxially grown by metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) on sapphire substrates.

      <title>Reconfigurable Spin Logics and High-density Multistate Memory in a Single Spin-orbit Torque Device</title>

Abstract: Nonvolatile devices based on the spin-orbit torque (SOT) mechanism are highly suitable for in-memory logic operations. The current objective is to enhance the memory density of memory cells while performing logic operations within the same memory unit. Present study demonstrates that integrating SOT with an out-of-plane magnetic field effectively achieves multiple magnetic states in perpendicularly magnetized heterostructures. This study further explores this approach, experimentally demonstrating reconfigurable logic operations within a single SOT device using W/Pt/Co/AlOxheterostructures. Our results show that multistate tuning by SOT integration with out-of-plane magnetic field enables reconfigurable logic operations, including AND, OR, NOR, NAND, and Always ON, within a single device. Additionally, we found that careful selection of input logic operations allows multiple configurations to achieve the same logic function within a single memory device. To enhance multistate memory density, we proposed and experimentally verified a two-step writing process, achieving the highest reported multistate memory density in SOT-based memory devices. These findings highlight the potential of integrating SOT and magnetic field effects to realize high-density, multifunctional in-memory logic devices.</description>

      <title>Multi-Mode Lens for Momentum Microscopy and XPEEM: Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The strong electric field between the sample and the extractor is the core of cathode lenses and a pivotal determinant of high resolution. Nevertheless, fields in the range of 3-8 kV/mm can be a source of complications. Local field enhancement at sharp edges or microscopic protrusions of cleaved samples may result in field emission or flashovers. Moreover, slow background electrons are drawn into the microscope column, where they contribute to space charge effects. A novel front lens configuration, optimized through ray-tracing simulations, significantly reduces the field at the sample and allows even for zero field or retarding field, which serves to suppress space charge effects. One or several annular electrodes, situated in a concentric position relative to the extractor, serve to form an additional lens within the gap between the sample and the extractor. The refractory power of this lens, and consequently the field at the sample surface, can be modified by adjusting the potentials of the annular electrodes. The imaging properties and aberrations of this gap lens have been investigated with regard to momentum imaging and XPEEM. The study encompasses the energy range from the few-eV level for laser-ARPES to 6 keV, for hard X-ray ARPES. The additional converging lens situated in close proximity to the sample exhibits a reduced field curvature of the k-image in the backfocal plane. This allows for the acquisition of larger fields of view in both momentum and real-space imaging.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multilayer nanoscale systems incorporating buried ultrathin tunnel oxides, 2D materials, and solid electrolytes are crucial for next-generation logics, memory, quantum and neuro-inspired computing. Still, an ultrathin layer control at angstrom scale is challenging for cutting-edge applications. Here we introduce a scalable approach utilizing focused ion-beam annealing for buried ultrathin oxides engineering with angstrom-scale thickness control. Our molecular dynamics simulations of Ne+ irradiation on Al/a-AlOx/Al structure confirms the pivotal role of ion generated crystal defects. We experimentally demonstrate its performance on Josephson junction tunning in the resistance range of 2 to 37% with a standard deviation of 0.86% across 25x25 mm chip. Moreover, we showcase +-17 MHz frequency control (+-0.172 A tunnel barrier thickness) for superconducting transmon qubits with coherence times up to 500 us, which is promising for useful fault-tolerant quantum computing. This work ensures ultrathin multilayer nanosystems engineering at the ultimate scale by depth-controlled crystal defects generation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: $\require{mediawiki-texvc}$ We demonstrate that the low symmetry of armchair lateral heterojunction between transition metal dichalcogenide monolayers allows for the mixing of $\mathbf{K}_+$ and $\mathbf{K}_-$ valleys. From the tight binding model we estimate the strength of the valley coupling to be of the order of $0.2$ eV$\cdot{\AA}$ for typical heteropairs. We show that the valley mixing gives rise to the in-plane $g$-factor of localized electrons leading to the spin precession in the in-plane magnetic field. We further study the effects of the valley mixing on the fine structure and dynamics of excitons at type-II lateral heterojunctions. We find that the interplay of the valley mixing and long-range exchange interaction leads to the linear polarization of exciton photoluminescence along the armchair heterojunction with the degree of polarization up to $1/3$ under unpolarized excitation. Application of the in-plane magnetic field of the order of 10$-$100 mT in any direction leads to the depolarization of the photoluminescence.</description>

Abstract: The magnetization steps of quintet clusters, consisting of five identical magnetic ions coupled by isotropic nearest neighbors antiferromagnetic exchange interaction in the hcp lattice, have been investigated. In that model, called the $J_1$ model, there are 17 types of quintets. The values of the magnetic field of the magnetization steps of the clusters have been determined by the numerical diagonalization of the spin Hamiltonian. The simulations have been performed for quintets composed of individual spin $S$ = 1/2, 3/2 and 5/2. The contribution of the quintets to the effective concentration (or technical saturation) as a function of the magnetic ion concentration was also calculated.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2201.07751v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The construction of Wannier functions from Bloch orbitals offers a unitary freedom that can be exploited to yield Wannier functions with advantageous properties. Minimizing the spatial variance is a well-known choice; another, previously proposed for Wannier functions constructed from the occupied Bloch manifold, minimizes a weighted sum of spatial and energy variance. We show that this compromised dual localization constructs localized and physically reasonable orbitals from both valence and conduction bands at once. Near the Fermi energy, these dually localized Wannier functions recover bonding and antibonding orbitals for bulk silicon and molecular ethylene, as well as d-orbital character for metallic copper. Because they are both localized and retain information about the orbital energy spectrum, dually localized Wannier functions are well suited to orbital-dependent methods that associate Wannier functions with specific energy ranges.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05229v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The presence of spin-polarized charge carriers in metallic magnets provides a mechanism for spin-lattice interactions mediated by electron-phonon coupling. Here, we present a theory of this mechanism used to estimate its effect on the exchange interactions in 2D magnets. Starting from a square lattice model at half filling, we show that the presence of electron-phonon coupling with equilibrium phonon distribution leads to a notable suppression of exchange interactions with temperature. We then apply our approach to the prototypical 2D metallic ferromagnet, Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$, with moderate electron-phonon coupling. We find that the exchange interactions undergo a renormalization, leading to a softening of the magnon modes, and suppression of the Curie temperature by $\sim$10\%. We expect that this effect can be further enhanced in systems with strong electron-phonon coupling, as well as for non-equilibrium distribution of phonons induced by strong laser fields or charge currents.</description>

Abstract: One of the most viable renewable energies is solar power because of its versatility, reliability, and abundance. In the market, a majority of the solar panels are made from silicon wafers. These solar panels have an efficiency of 26.4 percent and can last more than 25 years. The perovskite solar cell is a relatively new type of solar technology that has a similar maximum efficiency and much cheaper costs, the only downside is that it is less stable and the most efficient type uses lead. The name perovskite refers to the crystal structure with an ABX3 formula of the perovskite layer of the cell. All materials possess a property called a band gap. The smaller the band gap the more conductive the material, but this does not necessarily mean that the smaller the band gap the better the solar cell. The Shockley-Queisser limit provides the optimal band gap in terms of efficiency for a single junction solar cell which is 1.34 eV for single junction cells. This research focuses on tuning the band gap of lead-free perovskites through B-site cation replacement. Through this investigation, the optical band gaps of tin and lead perovskites were re-established. However, the copper-based perovskite disagrees with existing DFT calculations. Additionally, the mixed tin and copper perovskite in this experiment contradicts the intuitive prediction.</description>

Abstract: A recent observation by Basini [Nature \textbf{628}, 534 (2024)] of a large transient magnetization induced by circularly polarized ferroelectric phonons in SrTiO3 suggests the existence of hitherto unrecognized mechanisms coupling chiral lattice dynamics with electric degrees of freedom. Here, we develop an atomistic tight-binding model demonstrating a possible contribution to this effect arising from the pumping of atomic electron orbital angular momentum of Ti by chiral motion of oxygen atoms coordinating it, and facilitated by the degeneracy of its t2g orbitals allowing unquenched transient orbital moments. The proposed mechanism may be relevant to other materials with orbitally degenerate or quasi-degenerate electron states, and is attractive for efficient orbital moment generation in orbitronic applications without electric currents.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.08596v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Steady illumination of a non-centrosymmetric semiconductor results in a bulk photovoltaic current, which is contributed by real-space displacements (`shifts') of charged quasiparticles as they transit between Bloch states. The shift induced by interband excitation via absorption of photons has received the prevailing attention. However, this excitation-induced shift can be far outweighed ($\ll$) by the shift induced by intraband relaxation, or by the shift induced by radiative recombination of electron-hole pairs. This outweighing ($\ll$) is attributed to (i) time-reversal-symmetric, intraband Berry curvature, which results in an anomalous shift of quasiparticles as they scatter with phonons, as well as to (ii) topological singularities in the interband Berry phase (`optical vortices'), which makes the photovoltaic current extraordinarily sensitive to the linear polarization vector of the light source. Both (i-ii) potentially lead to nonlinear conductivities of order $mAV^{-2}$, without finetuning of the incident radiation frequency, band gap, or joint density of states. A case study of BiTeI showcases the anomalous shift and optical vorticity in a realistic material.</description>

Abstract: We introduce the elEmBERT model for chemical classification tasks. It is based on deep learning techniques, such as a multilayer encoder architecture. We demonstrate the opportunities offered by our approach on sets of organic, inorganic and crystalline compounds. In particular, we developed and tested the model using the Matbench and Moleculenet benchmarks, which include crystal properties and drug design-related benchmarks. We also conduct an analysis of vector representations of chemical compounds, shedding light on the underlying patterns in structural data. Our model exhibits exceptional predictive capabilities and proves universally applicable to molecular and material datasets. For instance, on the Tox21 dataset, we achieved an average precision of 96%, surpassing the previously best result by 10%.</description>

      <title>Quantum and classical spin dynamics across temperature scales in the S = 1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08897v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using the framework of semi-classical Landau-Lifshitz dynamics (LLD), we conduct a systematic investigation of the temperature-dependent spin dynamics in the S = 1/2 Heisenberg square-lattice antiferromagnet (SqAF). By performing inelastic neutron scattering measurements on Zn2VO(PO4)2 (ZVPO) and corresponding finite-temperature spin dynamics simulations based on LLD, we present a comprehensive analysis that bridges quantum and classical spin dynamics over a broad temperature range. First, a remarkable agreement between experimental data and LLD simulations is found in the paramagnetic phase of ZVPO, demonstrating the capability of LLD in accurately determining the spin Hamiltonian of S = 1/2 systems and capturing the quantum-to-classical crossover of their spin dynamics. Second, by analyzing the discrepancies between the experimental data and the LLD simulations at lower temperatures, we determine the experimental temperature dependence of the quantum effects in the excitation spectrum of the S = 1/2 SqAF: the quantum renormalization factor for the magnon energies and the quantum continuum above the one-magnon bands. Notably, the emergence of each quantum effect is found to correlate with the formation of three-dimensional long-range order. This work demonstrates the utility of LLD in gaining experimental insights into the temperature-induced modifications of quantum spin dynamics and their convergence towards classical expectations at higher temperatures. This motivates further applications to more challenging quantum antiferromagnets dominated by stronger quantum fluctuations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11159v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Semiconductor moir\'e systems, characterized by their periodic spatial light emission, unveil a new paradigm of active metasurfaces. Here, we show that ferroelectric moir\'e domains formed in a twisted hexagonal boron nitride (t-hBN) substrate can modulate light emission from an adjacent semiconductor MoSe$_2$ monolayer, enhancing its functionality as an active metasurface. The electrostatic potential at the surface of the t-hBN substrate provides a simple way to confine excitons in the MoSe$_2$ monolayer. The excitons confined within the domains and at the domain walls are spectrally separated due to a pronounced Stark shift. Moreover, the patterned light emission can be dynamically controlled by electrically gating the ferroelectric domains, introducing a novel functionality beyond conventional semiconductor moir\'e systems. Our findings chart an exciting pathway for integrating nanometer-scale moir\'e ferroelectric domains with various optically active functional layers, paving the way for advanced nanophotonic applications.</description>

      <title>Utilizing frustration in Gd- and Yb-based oxides for milli-Kelvin adiabatic demagnetization refrigeration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15697v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The manifold of energetically degenerate configurations arising from competing interactions in frustrated magnets gives rise to an enhanced entropy at lowest temperatures, which can be utilized for adiabatic demagnetization refrigeration (ADR). We review structural and magnetic properties of various Yb- and Gd-based oxides featuring frustration related to different triangular moment configurations and (in some cases) structural randomness. In comparison to paramagnetic hydrated salts, which have traditionally been employed for mK-ADR, these novel ADR materials enable cooling to temperatures several times lower than the magnetic interaction strength, significantly enhancing the entropy density and cooling power at a given target temperature. A further advantage is their chemical stability, allowing for a much simpler ADR pill design and ultra-high vacuum applications. For the temperature range between 0.02 and 2 K, a systematic comparison of the field-induced entropy density change is provided, that illustrates the advantages of frustrated magnets for low-temperature ADR.</description>

      <title>Signature of point nodal superconductivity in the Dirac semimetal PdTe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00216v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent Angle-Resolved Photo-emission Spectroscopy (ARPES) experiments [Phys. Rev. Lett. 130, 046402 (2023)] on PdTe, a 3D-Dirac semimetal and a superconductor with the transition temperature Tc ~ 4.3 K, have revealed compelling evidence of the presence of bulk nodes in the superconducting order parameter. To investigate the validity of this proposition, here we present a detailed investigation of the magnetic field dependence of the specific heat of PdTe down to temperatures ~ 58 mK. We observed that the low temperature specific heat of PdTe with an externally applied magnetic field exhibits a power-law field dependence, a characteristic of unconventional superconductivity. Furthermore, the zero-field low-temperature electronic specific heat follows a cubic temperature dependence, which is a signature of the presence of bulk point nodes in PdTe. These intriguing observations suggest that PdTe is a rare and fascinating topological material that exhibits both Dirac semimetallic properties and superconductivity with point nodal gap symmetry.</description>
