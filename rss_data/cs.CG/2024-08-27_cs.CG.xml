      <title>Approximation Algorithms for Minimum Sum of Moving-Distance and Opening-Costs Target Coverage Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the Minimum Sum of Moving-Distance and Opening-Costs Target Coverage problem (MinMD$+$OCTC). Given a set of targets and a set of base stations on the plane, an opening cost function for every base station, the opened base stations can emit mobile sensors with a radius of $r$ from base station to cover the targets. The goal of MinMD$+$OCTC is to cover all the targets and minimize the sum of the opening cost and the moving distance of mobile sensors. We give the optimal solution in polynomial time for the MinMD$+$OCTC problem with targets on a straight line, and present a 8.928 approximation algorithm for a special case of the MinMD$+$OCTC problem with the targets on the plane.</description>

      <title>Monotone Arc Diagrams with few Biarcs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that every planar graph has a monotone topological 2-page book embedding where at most (4n-10)/5 (of potentially 3n-6) edges cross the spine, and every edge crosses the spine at most once; such an edge is called a biarc. We can also guarantee that all edges that cross the spine cross it in the same direction (e.g., from bottom to top). For planar 3-trees we can further improve the bound to (3n-9)/4, and for so-called Kleetopes we obtain a bound of at most (n-8)/3 edges that cross the spine. The bound for Kleetopes is tight, even if the drawing is not required to be monotone. A Kleetope is a plane triangulation that is derived from another plane triangulation T by inserting a new vertex v_f into each face f of T and then connecting v_f to the three vertices of f.</description>

      <title>From Tutte to Floater and Gotsman: On the Resolution of Planar Straight-line Drawings and Morphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.09483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.09483v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The algorithm of Tutte for constructing convex planar straight-line drawings and the algorithm of Floater and Gotsman for constructing planar straight-line morphs are among the most popular graph drawing algorithms. In this paper, focusing on maximal plane graphs, we prove tight bounds on the resolution of the planar straight-line drawings produced by Floater's algorithm, which is a broad generalization of Tutte's algorithm. Further, we use such a result in order to prove a lower bound on the resolution of the drawings of maximal plane graphs produced by Floater and Gotsman's morphing algorithm. Finally, we show that such a morphing algorithm might produce drawings with exponentially-small resolution, even when transforming drawings with polynomial resolution.</description>

      <title>Ten Problems in Geobotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12657v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Robots sense, move and act in the physical world. It is therefore natural that algorithmic problems in robotics and automation have a geometric component, often central to the problem. Below we review ten challenging problems at the intersection of robotics and computational geometry -- let's call this intersection Geobotics. What is common to most of these problems is that the prevalent algorithmic techniques used in robotics do not seem suitable for solving them, or at least do not suggest quality guarantees for the solution. Solving some of them, even partially, can shed light on less well-understood aspects of computation in robotics.</description>
