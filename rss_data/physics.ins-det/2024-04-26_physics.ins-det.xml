      <title>Reciprocity in laser ultrasound revisited: Is wavefield characterisation by scanning laser excitation strictly reciprocal to that by scanning laser detection?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The common believe about strict measurement reciprocity between scanning laser detection and scanning laser excitation is disproved by a simple experiment. Nevertheless, a deeper study based on the reciprocity relation reveals correct reciprocal measurement set-ups for both the probe-excitation / laser-detection and the laser-excitation / probe-detection case. Similarly, the all-laser measurement, that is thermoelastic laser excitation with laser vibrometer detection, is not in general reciprocal with respect to the exchange of excitation and detection positions. Again, a substitute for the laser doppler vibrometer out-of-plane displacement measurement was found which ensures measurement reciprocity together with laser excitation. The apparent confusion in literature about strict validity/non-validity of measurement reciprocity is mitigated by classifying the measurement situations systematically.</description>

      <title>Stimulated Emission Depletion (STED) Magnetic Particle Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic particle imaging (MPI) is an in-vivo imaging method to detect magnetic nanoparticles for blood vessel imaging and molecular target imaging. Compared with conventional molecular imaging devices (such as nuclear medicine imaging PET and SPECT), magnetic nanoparticles have longer storage periods than radionuclides without ionizing radiation. MPI has higher detection sensitivity compared with MRI. To accurately locate molecular probes in living organisms, high-resolution images are needed to meet the requirements of precision medicine. The spatial resolution of the latest domestic and international MPI equipment is 1-6 mm and has not yet met the requirements of medical imaging detection. We previously studied the spatial encoding technology based on pulsed square wave stimulation, which significantly improved the image resolution along the field free line (FFL) direction. This study proposes an innovative idea of high-resolution MPI based on stimulated emission depletion (STED) of magnetic nanoparticle signals. The stimulated emission was implemented by using cosine stimulation on FFL-based MPI scanner systems. The STED signal was generated by adding an offset magnetic field parallel to the FFL, which may form a donut-shaped focal spot or a regular Gaussian focal spot depending on the offset field strength. Focal spot modulation techniques and deconvolution algorithms were developed to improve image resolution.</description>

      <title>Status of the MUonE experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.13177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.13177v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The MUonE experiment has been proposed to measure the differential cross section of $\mu e$ elastic scattering, by colliding the 160 GeV muons of the CERN M2 beam with atomic electrons of thin target plates. From a very precise measurement of the shape one can achieve a competitive determination of the leading hadronic contribution to the muon magnetic moment, independent from the other existing ones. In preparation for the Test Run with a reduced setup the detector geometry has been optimised. Expected yields for a first physics run with limited statistics are discussed, together with prospects for the assessment of the main systematic uncertainties.</description>
