      <title>Controlled diffusion processes in an adiabatic model of a bouncing ball</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the integration of a diffusion control parameter into the chaotic dynamics of a modified bouncing ball model. By extending beyond simple elastic collisions, the model introduces elements that affect the diffusive behavior of kinetic energy, offering insights into the interplay between deterministic chaos and stochastic diffusion. The research reinterprets the bouncing ball's interactions with the surface as short-distance collisions that mimic random thermal fluctuations of particles. This refined model reveals complex dynamics, highlighting the synergistic effects between chaos and diffusion in shaping the evolution of the system.</description>

      <title>Keplerian billiards in three dimensions: stability of equilibrium orbits and conditions for chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents some results regarding three-dimensional billiards having a non-constant potential of Keplerian type inside a regular domain $D\subset \mathcal R^3$. Two models will be analysed: in the first one, only an inner Keplerian potential is present, and every time the particle encounters the boundary of $D$ is reflected back by keeping constant its tangential component to $\partial D$. The second model is a refractive billiard, where the inner Keplerian potential is coupled with a harmonic outer one; in this case, the interaction with $\partial D$ results in a generalised refraction Snell's law. In both cases, the analysis of a particular type of straight equilibrium trajectories, called \emph{homothetic}, is carried on, and their presence is linked to the topological chaoticity of the dynamics for large inner energies.</description>

      <title>Partial suppression of chaos in relativistic 3-body problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent numerical results seem to suggest that in certain regimes of typical particle velocities the gravitational $N-$body problem (for $3\leq N\lesssim 10^3$) is intrinsically less chaotic when the post-Newtonian (PN) force terms are included, with respect to its classical counterpart that exhibits a slightly larger maximal Lyapunov exponent $\Lambda_{\rm max}$. In this work we explore the dynamics of wildly chaotic, regular and nearly regular configurations of the 3-body problem with and without the PN corrective terms aiming at shedding some light on the behaviour of the Lyapunov spectra under the effect of said corrections. Because the interaction of the tangent-space dynamics in gravitating systems, needed to evaluate the Lyapunov exponents, becomes rapidly computationally heavy due to the complexity of the higher order force derivatives involving multiple powers of $v/c$, we introduce a technique to compute a proxy of the Lyapunov spectrum based on the time-dependent diagonalization of the inertia tensor of a cluster of trajectories in phase-space. We find that, for a broad range of orbital configurations, the relativistic 3-body problem has a smaller $\Lambda_{\rm max}$ than its classical counterpart starting with the exact same initial condition. However, the rest of the Lyapunov spectrum can be either lower or larger in the classical case, suggesting that the relativistic precession effectively reduces chaos only along one (or few) directions in phase-space. As a general trend, the dynamical entropy of the relativistic simulations as function of the rescaled speed of light always has a regime in which falls below the classical value.} We observe that, the sole analysis of $\Lambda_{\rm max}$ could induce possibly misleading conclusions on the chaoticity of systems with small (and possibly large $N$.</description>

      <title>Symmetry breaking in two-dimensional turbulence induced by out-of-equilibrium fluxes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the self-organization of two-dimensional turbulence in a fluid with local interactions. Using simulations and theoretical arguments, we show that the out-of-equilibrium flux to small scales, corresponding to the direct cascade, imposes a constraint on the large-scale emergent flow. As a result, instead of the unique state found in other two-dimensional models, a rich phase diagram of large-scale configurations emerges. We explain what sets the boundaries between the different phases, and show that in the infinite box limit when the range of the direct cascade is kept finite, the large-scale flow exhibits spontaneous symmetry breaking.</description>

      <title>State Estimation Using Sparse DEIM and Recurrent Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Discrete Empirical Interpolation Method (DEIM) estimates a function from its pointwise incomplete observations. In particular, this method can be used to estimate the state of a dynamical system from observational data gathered by sensors. However, when the number of observations are limited, DEIM returns large estimation errors. Sparse DEIM (S-DEIM) was recently developed to address this problem by introducing a kernel vector which previous DEIM-based methods had ignored. Unfortunately, estimating the optimal kernel vector in S-DEIM is a difficult task. Here, we introduce a data-driven method to estimate this kernel vector from sparse observational time series using recurrent neural networks. Using numerical examples, we demonstrate that this machine learning approach together with S-DEIM leads to nearly optimal state estimations.</description>

      <title>Chaotic fields out of equilibrium are observable independent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11976v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chaotic dynamics is always characterized by swarms of unstable trajectories, unpredictable individually, and thus generally studied statistically. It is often the case that such phase-space densities relax exponentially fast to a limiting distribution, that rules the long-time average of every observable of interest. Before that asymptotic timescale, the statistics of chaos is generally believed to depend on both the initial conditions and the chosen observable. I show that this is not the case for a widely applicable class of models, that feature a phase-space (`field') distribution common to all pushed-forward or integrated observables, while the system is still relaxing towards statistical equilibrium or a steady state. This universal profile is determined by both leading and first subleading eigenfunctions of the transport operator (Koopman or Perron-Frobenius) that maps phase-space densities forward or backward in time.</description>

      <title>Turbulent cascade arrests and the formation of intermediate-scale condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06169v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Energy cascades lie at the heart of the dynamics of turbulent flows. In a recent study of turbulence in fluids with odd-viscosity [de Wit \textit{et al.}, Nature \textbf{627}, 515 (2024)], the two-dimensionalization of the flow at small scales leads to the arrest of the energy cascade and selection of an intermediate scale, between the forcing and the viscous scales. To investigate the generality of this phenomenon, we study a shell model that is carefully constructed to have three-dimensional turbulent dynamics at small wavenumbers and two-dimensional turbulent dynamics at large wavenumbers. The large scale separation that we can achieve in our shell model allows us to examine clearly the interplay between these dynamics, which leads to an arrest of the energy cascade at a transitional wavenumber and an associated accumulation of energy at the same scale. Such pile-up of energy around the transitional wavenumber is reminiscent of the formation of condensates in two-dimensional turbulence, \textit{but, in contrast, it occurs at intermediate wavenumbers instead of the smallest wavenumber</description>

      <title>Higher-order gap ratios of singular values in open quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08590v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding open quantum systems using information encoded in its complex eigenvalues has been a subject of growing interest. In this paper, we study higher-order gap ratios of the singular values of generic open quantum systems. We show that $k$-th order gap ratio of the singular values of an open quantum system can be connected to the nearest-neighbor spacing ratio of positions of classical particles of a harmonically confined log-gas with inverse temperature $\beta'(k)$ where $\beta'(k)$ is an analytical function that depends on $k$ and the Dyson's index $\beta=1,2,$ and $4$ that characterizes the properties of the associated Hermitized matrix. Our findings are crucial not only for understanding long-range correlations between the eigenvalues but also provide an excellent way of distinguishing different symmetry classes in an open quantum system. To highlight the universality of our findings, we demonstrate the higher-order gap ratios using different platforms such as non-Hermitian random matrices, random dissipative Liouvillians, Hamiltonians coupled to a Markovian bath, and Hamiltonians with in-built non-Hermiticity.</description>
