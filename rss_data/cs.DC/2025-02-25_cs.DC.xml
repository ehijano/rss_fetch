      <title>A Statistical Learning Approach for Feature-Aware Task-to-Core Allocation in Heterogeneous Platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimizing task-to-core allocation can substantially reduce power consumption in multi-core platforms without degrading user experience. However, many existing approaches overlook critical factors such as parallelism, compute intensity, and heterogeneous core types. In this paper, we introduce a statistical learning approach for feature selection that identifies the most influential features - such as core type, speed, temperature, and application-level parallelism or memory intensity - for accurate environment modeling and efficient energy optimization. Our experiments, conducted with state-of-the-art Linux governors and thermal modeling techniques, show that correlation-aware task-to-core allocation lowers energy consumption by up to 10% and reduces core temperature by up to 5 degrees Celsius compared to random core selection. Furthermore, our compressed, bootstrapped regression model improves thermal prediction accuracy by 6% while cutting model parameters by 16%, yielding an overall mean square error reduction of 61.6% relative to existing approaches. We provided results based on superscalar Intel Core i7 12th Gen processors with 14 cores, but validated our method across a diverse set of hardware platforms and effectively balanced performance, power, and thermal demands through statistical feature evaluation.</description>

      <title>BSODiag: A Global Diagnosis Framework for Batch Servers Outage in Large-scale Cloud Infrastructure Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cloud infrastructure is the collective term for all physical devices within cloud systems. Failures within the cloud infrastructure system can severely compromise the stability and availability of cloud services. Particularly, batch servers outage, which is the most fatal failure, could result in the complete unavailability of all upstream services. In this work, we focus on the batch servers outage diagnosis problem, aiming to accurately and promptly analyze the root cause of outages to facilitate troubleshooting. However, our empirical study conducted in a real industrial system indicates that it is a challenging task. Firstly, the collected single-modal coarse-grained failure monitoring data (i.e., alert, incident, or change) in the cloud infrastructure system is insufficient for a comprehensive failure profiling. Secondly, due to the intricate dependencies among devices, outages are often the cumulative result of multiple failures, but correlations between failures are difficult to ascertain. To address these problems, we propose BSODiag, an unsupervised and lightweight diagnosis framework for batch servers outage. BSODiag provides a global analytical perspective, thoroughly explores failure information from multi-source monitoring data, models the spatio-temporal correlations among failures, and delivers accurate and interpretable diagnostic results. Experiments conducted on the Alibaba Cloud infrastructure system show that BSODiag achieves 87.5% PR@3 and 46.3% PCR, outperforming baseline methods by 10.2% and 3.7%, respectively.</description>

      <title>Cache-Craft: Managing Chunk-Caches for Efficient Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is often used with Large Language Models (LLMs) to infuse domain knowledge or user-specific information. In RAG, given a user query, a retriever extracts chunks of relevant text from a knowledge base. These chunks are sent to an LLM as part of the input prompt. Typically, any given chunk is repeatedly retrieved across user questions. However, currently, for every question, attention-layers in LLMs fully compute the key values (KVs) repeatedly for the input chunks, as state-of-the-art methods cannot reuse KV-caches when chunks appear at arbitrary locations with arbitrary contexts. Naive reuse leads to output quality degradation. This leads to potentially redundant computations on expensive GPUs and increases latency. In this work, we propose Cache-Craft, a system for managing and reusing precomputed KVs corresponding to the text chunks (we call chunk-caches) in RAG-based systems. We present how to identify chunk-caches that are reusable, how to efficiently perform a small fraction of recomputation to fix the cache to maintain output quality, and how to efficiently store and evict chunk-caches in the hardware for maximizing reuse while masking any overheads. With real production workloads as well as synthetic datasets, we show that Cache-Craft reduces redundant computation by 51% over SOTA prefix-caching and 75% over full recomputation. Additionally, with continuous batching on a real production workload, we get a 1.6X speed up in throughput and a 2X reduction in end-to-end response latency over prefix-caching while maintaining quality, for both the LLaMA-3-8B and LLaMA-3-70B models.</description>

      <title>DistrEE: Distributed Early Exit of Deep Neural Network Inference on Edge Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributed DNN inference is becoming increasingly important as the demand for intelligent services at the network edge grows. By leveraging the power of distributed computing, edge devices can perform complicated and resource-hungry inference tasks previously only possible on powerful servers, enabling new applications in areas such as autonomous vehicles, industrial automation, and smart homes. However, it is challenging to achieve accurate and efficient distributed edge inference due to the fluctuating nature of the actual resources of the devices and the processing difficulty of the input data. In this work, we propose DistrEE, a distributed DNN inference framework that can exit model inference early to meet specific quality of service requirements. In particular, the framework firstly integrates model early exit and distributed inference for multi-node collaborative inferencing scenarios. Furthermore, it designs an early exit policy to control when the model inference terminates. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that DistrEE can efficiently realize efficient collaborative inference, achieving an effective trade-off between inference latency and accuracy.</description>

      <title>A Performance Analysis of You Only Look Once Models for Deployment on Constrained Computational Edge Devices in Drone Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advancements in embedded systems and Artificial Intelligence (AI) have enhanced the capabilities of Unmanned Aircraft Vehicles (UAVs) in computer vision. However, the integration of AI techniques o-nboard drones is constrained by their processing capabilities. In this sense, this study evaluates the deployment of object detection models (YOLOv8n and YOLOv8s) on both resource-constrained edge devices and cloud environments. The objective is to carry out a comparative performance analysis using a representative real-time UAV image processing pipeline. Specifically, the NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano, Orin NX, and Raspberry Pi 5 (RPI5) devices have been tested to measure their detection accuracy, inference speed, and energy consumption, and the effects of post-training quantization (PTQ). The results show that YOLOv8n surpasses YOLOv8s in its inference speed, achieving 52 FPS on the Jetson Orin NX and 65 fps with INT8 quantization. Conversely, the RPI5 failed to satisfy the real-time processing needs in spite of its suitability for low-energy consumption applications. An analysis of both the cloud-based and edge-based end-to-end processing times showed that increased communication latencies hindered real-time applications, revealing trade-offs between edge (low latency) and cloud processing (quick processing). Overall, these findings contribute to providing recommendations and optimization strategies for the deployment of AI models on UAVs.</description>

      <title>Light Virtualization: a proof-of-concept for hardware-based virtualization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Virtualization has become widespread across all computing environments, from edge devices to cloud systems. Its main advantages are resource management through abstraction and improved isolation of platform resources and processes. However, there are still some important tradeoffs as it requires significant support from the existing hardware infrastructure and negatively impacts performance. Additionally, the current approaches to resource virtualization are inflexible, using a model that doesn't allow for dynamic adjustments during operation. This research introduces Light Virtualization (LightV), a new virtualization method for commercial platforms. LightV uses programmable hardware to direct cache coherence traffic, enabling precise and seamless control over which resources are virtualized. The paper explains the core principles of LightV, explores its capabilities, and shares initial findings from a basic proof-of-concept module tested on commercial hardware.</description>

      <title>LoXR: Performance Evaluation of Locally Executing LLMs on XR Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The deployment of large language models (LLMs) on extended reality (XR) devices has great potential to advance the field of human-AI interaction. In the case of direct, on-device model inference, selecting the appropriate model and device for specific tasks remains challenging. In this paper, we deploy 17 LLMs across four XR devices--Magic Leap 2, Meta Quest 3, Vivo X100s Pro, and Apple Vision Pro, and conduct a comprehensive evaluation. We devise an experimental setup and evaluate performance on four key metrics: performance consistency, processing speed, memory usage, and battery consumption. For each of the 68 model-device pairs, we assess performance under varying string lengths, batch sizes, and thread counts, analyzing the trade-offs for real-time XR applications. We finally propose a unified evaluation method based on the Pareto Optimality theory to select the optimal device-model pairs from the quality and speed objectives. We believe our findings offer valuable insights to guide future optimization efforts for LLM deployment on XR devices. Our evaluation method can be followed as standard groundwork for further research and development in this emerging field.

      <title>SmartEdge: Smart Healthcare End-to-End Integrated Edge and Cloud Computing System for Diabetes Prediction Enabled by Ensemble Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) revolutionizes smart city domains such as healthcare, transportation, industry, and education. The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is gaining prominence, particularly in smart hospitals and Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM). The vast volume of data generated by IoMT devices should be analyzed in real-time for health surveillance, prognosis, and prediction of diseases. Current approaches relying on Cloud computing to provide the necessary computing and storage capabilities do not scale for these latency-sensitive applications. Edge computing emerges as a solution by bringing cloud services closer to IoMT devices. This paper introduces SmartEdge, an AI-powered smart healthcare end-to-end integrated edge and cloud computing system for diabetes prediction. This work addresses latency concerns and demonstrates the efficacy of edge resources in healthcare applications within an end-to-end system. The system leverages various risk factors for diabetes prediction. We propose an Edge and Cloud-enabled framework to deploy the proposed diabetes prediction models on various configurations using edge nodes and main cloud servers. Performance metrics are evaluated using, latency, accuracy, and response time. By using ensemble machine learning voting algorithms we can improve the prediction accuracy by 5% versus a single model prediction.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Offline-online Scheduling Method for Large Language Model Inference Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the development of large language models (LLMs), it has become increasingly important to optimize hardware usage and improve throughput. In this paper, we study the inference optimization of the serving system that deploys LLMs. To optimize system throughput and maximize hardware utilization, we formulate the inference optimization problem as a mixed-integer programming (MIP) model and propose a hybrid offline-online method as solution. The offline method improves large-scale inference systems by introducing a Minimizing Makespan Bin Packing Problem. We further provide a theoretical lower bound computation method. Then, we propose an online sorting and preemptive scheduling method to better utilize hardware. In the online iteration scheduling process, a Lagrangian method is applied to evaluate the cost efficiency of inserting prefill stages versus decode stages at each iteration and dynamically determine when to preempt decoding tasks and insert prefill tasks. Experiments using real-world data from the LLaMA-65B model and the GSM8K dataset demonstrate that system utilization improves from 80.2% to 89.1%, and the total inference time decreases from 201.00 to 190.58 seconds. A 100-cases study shows that our method consistently outperforms the baseline method and improves the utilization rate by 8.0% on average. Finally, we discuss potential future extensions, including stochastic modeling, reinforcement learning-based schedulers, and dynamic decision-making strategies for system throughput and hardware utilization.</description>

      <title>JExplore: Design Space Exploration Tool for Nvidia Jetson Boards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nvidia Jetson boards are powerful systems for executing artificial intelligence workloads in edge and mobile environments due to their effective GPU hardware and widely supported software stack. In addition to these benefits, Nvidia Jetson boards provide large configurability by giving the user the choice to modify many hardware parameters. This large space of configurability creates the need of searching the optimal configurations based on the user's requirements. In this work, we propose JExplore, a multi-board software and hardware design space exploration tool. JExplore can be integrated with any search tool, hence creating a common benchmarking ground for the search algorithms. Moreover, it accelerates the exploration of user application and Nvidia Jetson configurations for researchers and engineers by encapsulating host-client communication, configuration management, and metric measurement.</description>

      <title>FairKV: Balancing Per-Head KV Cache for Fast Multi-GPU Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: KV cache techniques in Transformer models aim to reduce redundant computations at the expense of substantially increased memory usage, making KV cache compression an important and popular research topic. Recently, state-of-the-art KV cache compression methods implement imbalanced, per-head allocation algorithms that dynamically adjust the KV cache budget for each attention head, achieving excellent performance in single-GPU scenarios. However, we observe that such imbalanced compression leads to significant load imbalance when deploying multi-GPU inference, as some GPUs become overburdened while others remain underutilized. In this paper, we propose FairKV, a method designed to ensure fair memory usage among attention heads in systems employing imbalanced KV cache compression. The core technique of FairKV is Fair-Copying, which replicates a small subset of memory-intensive attention heads across GPUs using data parallelism to mitigate load imbalance. Our experiments on popular models, including LLaMA 70b and Mistral 24b model, demonstrate that FairKV increases throughput by 1.66x compared to standard tensor parallelism inference. Our code will be released as open source upon acceptance.</description>

      <title>GenAI at the Edge: Comprehensive Survey on Empowering Edge Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) applies models and algorithms such as Large Language Model (LLM) and Foundation Model (FM) to generate new data. GenAI, as a promising approach, enables advanced capabilities in various applications, including text generation and image processing. In current practice, GenAI algorithms run mainly on the cloud server, leading to high latency and raising security concerns. Consequently, these challenges encourage the deployment of GenAI algorithms directly on edge devices. However, the large size of such models and their significant computational resource requirements pose obstacles when deploying them in resource-constrained systems. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of recent proposed techniques that optimize GenAI for efficient deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. For this aim, this work highlights three main categories for bringing GenAI to the edge: software optimization, hardware optimization, and frameworks. The main takeaways for readers of this survey will be a clear roadmap to design, implement, and refine GenAI systems for real-world implementation on edge devices.</description>

      <title>Computation Offloading Strategies in Integrated Terrestrial and Non-Terrestrial Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid growth of computation-intensive applications like augmented reality, autonomous driving, remote healthcare, and smart cities has exposed the limitations of traditional terrestrial networks, particularly in terms of inadequate coverage, limited capacity, and high latency in remote areas. This chapter explores how integrated terrestrial and non-terrestrial networks (IT-NTNs) can address these challenges and enable efficient computation offloading. We examine mobile edge computing (MEC) and its evolution toward multiple-access edge computing, highlighting the critical role computation offloading plays for resource-constrained devices. We then discuss the architecture of IT-NTNs, focusing on how terrestrial base stations, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), high-altitude platforms (HAPs), and LEO satellites work together to deliver ubiquitous connectivity. Furthermore, we analyze various computation offloading strategies, including edge, cloud, and hybrid offloading, outlining their strengths and weaknesses. Key enabling technologies such as NOMA, mmWave/THz communication, and reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) are also explored as essential components of existing algorithms for resource allocation, task offloading decisions, and mobility management. Finally, we conclude by highlighting the transformative impact of computation offloading in IT-NTNs across diverse application areas and discuss key challenges and future research directions, emphasizing the potential of these networks to revolutionize communication and computation paradigms.</description>

Abstract: Cloud computing is continually evolving, enhancing hardware technologies, improving software and enhancing business processes. A payroll management system deployed on the Cloud harnesses on-demand of delivery of computational power and database storage using cloud computing technologies. This project aims to develop and deploy a cloud-based payroll management system. The objectives of this study are: to carry out a study on the existing cloud-based payroll management system, to design a payroll data model for calculating basic salary and enables retrieval of payroll history when needed from the database, to develop and deploy a payroll management system, on the Cloud that generates earning statements, filling the gap between security infrastructure and optimal system performance harnessing cloud computing technologies. The focus was on the design, implementation and deployment, using UML diagrams to illustrate the payroll application and Google App Engine for deployment. The system analysis in comparison of a conventional payroll system and the cloud-based system is endless in terms of speed, processing power, storage capacity, universalization and pricing. The cloud-based payroll has an infinite number of advantages; all conventional payroll system is rendered obsolete as it mends all the cons.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient virtual machine load balancing scheduling is crucial in cloud computing to optimize resource utilization and system performance. To address this issue, several load balancing scheduling algorithms have been proposed, including Particle Swarm Optimization, Multi-objective Optimization, and the Active Monitoring Algorithm. This paper provides an analytical overview of these three algorithms, discussing their key features, advantages, and limitations. It contains an analysis of VM Load Balancing Scheduling Algorithms, examining their advantages, disadvantages, and applications. As the industry shifts towards adopting Cloud Technologies, optimally load balancing client requests to servers becomes essential. It is crucial for cloud providers to adapt technologies that prevent latency issues for their customers. The algorithms most commonly used in load balancers are analytically discussed.</description>

      <title>SUperman: Efficient Permanent Computation on GPUs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The {\em permanent} is a function, defined for a square matrix, with applications in various domains including quantum computing, statistical physics, complexity theory, combinatorics, and graph theory. Its formula is similar to that of the determinant, however unlike the determinant, its exact computation is \#P-complete, i.e., there is no algorithm to compute the permanent in polynomial time unless P=NP. For an $n \times n$ matrix, the fastest algorithm has a time complexity of $O(2^{n-1}n)$. Although supercomputers have been employed for permanent computation before, there is no work and more importantly, no publicly available software that leverages cutting-edge, yet widely accessible, High-Performance Computing accelerators such as GPUs. In this work, we designed, developed, and investigated the performance of \acro, a complete software suite that can compute matrix permanents on multiple nodes/GPUs on a cluster while handling various matrix types, e.g., real/complex/binary and sparse/dense etc., with a unique treatment for each type. Compared to a state-of-the-art parallel algorithm on 44 cores, \acro can be $86\times$ faster on a single Nvidia A100 GPU. Combining multiple GPUs, we also showed that \acro can compute the permanent of a $56 \times 56$ matrix which is the largest reported in the literature.</description>

      <title>CRIUgpu: Transparent Checkpointing of GPU-Accelerated Workloads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning training at scale is resource-intensive and time-consuming, often running across hundreds or thousands of GPUs for weeks or months. Efficient checkpointing is crucial for running these workloads, especially in multi-tenant environments where compute resources are shared, and job preemptions or interruptions are common. However, transparent and unified GPU snapshots are particularly challenging because of the hardware architecture differences between CPU and GPU, including memory subsystems, dynamic parallelism, and thread synchronization. State-of-the-art GPU checkpointing techniques typically leverage mechanisms that intercept, log, and replay device API calls. However, this approach adds performance overhead and requires hardware-specific implementation that is difficult to test, maintain, and integrate with existing container platforms. In this paper, we present CRIUgpu - a novel approach for transparent checkpointing of GPU-accelerated workloads that builds on recently introduced driver capabilities, enabling support for CUDA and ROCm applications. Our evaluation results show that CRIUgpu works with a variety of deep learning and high-performance computing workloads running across multiple GPUs, completely eliminating steady-state performance overheads, and significantly reducing recovery times compared to state-of-the-art transparent GPU checkpointing mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Can Tensor Cores Benefit Memory-Bound Kernels? (No!)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tensor cores are specialized processing units within GPUs that have demonstrated significant efficiency gains in compute-bound applications such as Deep Learning Training by accelerating dense matrix operations. Given their success, researchers have attempted to extend tensor core capabilities beyond dense matrix computations to other computational patterns, including memory-bound kernels. Recent studies have reported that tensor cores can outperform traditional CUDA cores even on memory-bound kernels, where the primary performance bottleneck is not computation. In this research, we challenge these findings through both theoretical and empirical analysis. Our theoretical analysis reveals that tensor cores can achieve a maximum speedup of only 1.33x over CUDA cores for memory-bound kernels in double precision (for V100, A100, and H100 GPUs). We validate this theoretical limit through empirical analysis of three representative memory-bound kernels-STREAM Scale, SpMV, and stencil. We demonstrate that optimizing memory-bound kernels using tensor cores does not yield sound performance improvements over CUDA cores.</description>

      <title>Revisited Convergence of Dolev et al BFS Spanning Tree Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a constructive proof for the convergence of Dolev et al's BFS spanning tree algorithm running under the general assumption of an unfair daemon. Already known proofs of this algorithm are either using non-constructive principles (e.g., proofs by contradiction) or are restricted to less general execution daemons (e.g., weakly fair). In this work, we address these limitations by defining the well-founded orders and potential functions ensuring convergence in the general case. The proof has been fully formalized in PADEC, a Coq-based framework for certification of self-stabilization algorithm.</description>

      <title>Robust Federated Learning in Unreliable Wireless Networks: A Client Selection Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising distributed learning paradigm for training deep neural networks (DNNs) at the wireless edge, but its performance can be severely hindered by unreliable wireless transmission and inherent data heterogeneity among clients. Existing solutions primarily address these challenges by incorporating wireless resource optimization strategies, often focusing on uplink resource allocation across clients under the assumption of homogeneous client-server network standards. However, these approaches overlooked the fact that mobile clients may connect to the server via diverse network standards (e.g., 4G, 5G, Wi-Fi) with customized configurations, limiting the flexibility of server-side modifications and restricting applicability in real-world commercial networks. This paper presents a novel theoretical analysis about how transmission failures in unreliable networks distort the effective label distributions of local samples, causing deviations from the global data distribution and introducing convergence bias in FL. Our analysis reveals that a carefully designed client selection strategy can mitigate biases induced by network unreliability and data heterogeneity. Motivated by this insight, we propose FedCote, a client selection approach that optimizes client selection probabilities without relying on wireless resource scheduling. Experimental results demonstrate the robustness of FedCote in DNN-based classification tasks under unreliable networks with frequent transmission failures.</description>

      <title>FedOC: Optimizing Global Prototypes with Orthogonality Constraints for Enhancing Embeddings Separation in Heterogeneous Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as an essential framework for distributed machine learning, especially with its potential for privacy-preserving data processing. However, existing FL frameworks struggle to address statistical and model heterogeneity, which severely impacts model performance. While Heterogeneous Federated Learning (HtFL) introduces prototype-based strategies to address the challenges, current approaches face limitations in achieving optimal separation of prototypes. This paper presents FedOC, a novel HtFL algorithm designed to improve global prototype separation through orthogonality constraints, which not only increase intra-class prototype similarity but also significantly expand the inter-class angular separation. With the guidance of the global prototype, each client keeps its embeddings aligned with the corresponding prototype in the feature space, promoting directional independence that integrates seamlessly with the cross-entropy (CE) loss. We provide theoretical proof of FedOC's convergence under non-convex conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FedOC outperforms seven state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to a 10.12% accuracy improvement in both statistical and model heterogeneity settings.</description>

      <title>Revolutionizing Datacenter Networks via Reconfigurable Topologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the popularity of cloud computing and data-intensive applications such as machine learning, datacenter networks have become a critical infrastructure for our digital society. Given the explosive growth of datacenter traffic and the slowdown of Moore's law, significant efforts have been made to improve datacenter network performance over the last decade. A particularly innovative solution is reconfigurable datacenter networks (RDCNs): datacenter networks whose topologies dynamically change over time, in either a demand-oblivious or a demand-aware manner. Such dynamic topologies are enabled by recent optical switching technologies and stand in stark contrast to state-of-the-art datacenter network topologies, which are fixed and oblivious to the actual traffic demand. In particular, reconfigurable demand-aware and 'self-adjusting' datacenter networks are motivated empirically by the significant spatial and temporal structures observed in datacenter communication traffic. This paper presents an overview of reconfigurable datacenter networks. In particular, we discuss the motivation for such reconfigurable architectures, review the technological enablers, and present a taxonomy that classifies the design space into two dimensions: static vs. dynamic and demand-oblivious vs. demand-aware. We further present a formal model and discuss related research challenges. Our article comes with complementary video interviews in which three leading experts, Manya Ghobadi, Amin Vahdat, and George Papen, share with us their perspectives on reconfigurable datacenter networks.</description>

      <title>Orchestrating Joint Offloading and Scheduling for Low-Latency Edge SLAM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16495v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (vSLAM) is a prevailing technology for many emerging robotic applications. Achieving real-time SLAM on mobile robotic systems with limited computational resources is challenging because the complexity of SLAM algorithms increases over time. This restriction can be lifted by offloading computations to edge servers, forming the emerging paradigm of edge-assisted SLAM. Nevertheless, the exogenous and stochastic input processes affect the dynamics of the edge-assisted SLAM system. Moreover, the requirements of clients on SLAM metrics change over time, exerting implicit and time-varying effects on the system. In this paper, we aim to push the limit beyond existing edge-assist SLAM by proposing a new architecture that can handle the input-driven processes and also satisfy clients' implicit and time-varying requirements. The key innovations of our work involve a regional feature prediction method for importance-aware local data processing, a configuration adaptation policy that integrates data compression/decompression and task offloading, and an input-dependent learning framework for task scheduling with constraint satisfaction. Extensive experiments prove that our architecture improves pose estimation accuracy and saves up to 47% of communication costs compared with a popular edge-assisted SLAM system, as well as effectively satisfies the clients' requirements.</description>

      <title>Toward Responsible Federated Large Language Models: Leveraging a Safety Filter and Constitutional AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent research has increasingly focused on training large language models (LLMs) using federated learning, known as FedLLM. However, responsible AI (RAI), which aims to ensure safe responses, remains underexplored in the context of FedLLM. In FedLLM, client data used for training may contain harmful content, leading to unsafe LLMs that generate harmful responses. Aggregating such unsafe LLMs into the global model and distributing them to clients may result in the widespread deployment of unsafe LLMs. To address this issue, we incorporate two well-known RAI methods into FedLLM: the safety filter and constitutional AI. Our experiments demonstrate that these methods significantly enhance the safety of the LLM, achieving over a 20% improvement on AdvBench, a benchmark for evaluating safety performance.</description>

      <title>Analyzing a Two-Tier Disaggregated Memory Protection Scheme Based on Memory Replication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As memory technologies continue to shrink and memory error rates increase, the demand for stronger reliability becomes increasingly critical. Fine-grain memory replication has emerged as an appealing approach to improving memory fault tolerance by augmenting conventional memory protection based on error-correcting codes with an additional layer of redundancy that replicates data across independent failure domains, such as replicating memory pages across different NUMA sockets. This method can tolerate a broad spectrum of memory errors, from individual memory cell failures to more complex memory controller failures. However, applying memory replication without a holistic consideration of the interaction between error-correcting codes and replication can result in redundant duplication and unnecessary storage overhead. We propose Replication-Aware Memory-error Protection (RAMP), a model that helps explore error protection strategies to improve the storage efficiency of memory protection in memory systems that utilize memory replication for performance and availability. We use RAMP to determine a protection strategy that can lower the storage cost of individual replicas while still ensuring robust protection through the collective protection conferred by multiple replicas. Our evaluation shows that a solution derived with RAMP enhances the storage efficiency of a state-of-the-art memory protection mechanism when paired with rack-level replication for disaggregated memory. Specifically, we can reduce the storage cost of memory protection from 27% down to 17.7% with minimal performance overhead.</description>

      <title>Order Fairness Evaluation of DAG-based ledgers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Order fairness in distributed ledgers refers to properties that relate the order in which transactions are sent or received to the order in which they are eventually finalized, i.e., totally ordered. The study of such properties is relatively new and has been especially stimulated by the rise of Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) attacks in blockchain environments. Indeed, in many classical blockchain protocols, leaders are responsible for selecting the transactions to be included in blocks, which creates a clear vulnerability and opportunity for transaction order manipulation.
  Unlike blockchains, DAG-based ledgers allow participants in the network to independently propose blocks, which are then arranged as vertices of a directed acyclic graph. Interestingly, leaders in DAG-based ledgers are elected only after the fact, once transactions are already part of the graph, to determine their total order. In other words, transactions are not chosen by single leaders; instead, they are collectively validated by the nodes, and leaders are only elected to establish an ordering. This approach intuitively reduces the risk of transaction manipulation and enhances fairness.
  In this paper, we aim to quantify the capability of DAG-based ledgers to achieve order fairness. To this end, we define new variants of order fairness adapted to DAG-based ledgers and evaluate the impact of an adversary capable of compromising a limited number of nodes (below the one-third threshold) to reorder transactions. We analyze how often our order fairness properties are violated under different network conditions and parameterizations of the DAG algorithm, depending on the adversary's power.
  Our study shows that DAG-based ledgers are still vulnerable to reordering attacks, as an adversary can coordinate a minority of Byzantine nodes to manipulate the DAG's structure.</description>

      <title>CloudNativeSim: a toolkit for modeling and simulation of cloud-native applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05093v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cloud-native applications are increasingly becoming popular in modern software design. Employing a microservice-based architecture into these applications is a prevalent strategy that enhances system availability and flexibility. However, cloud-native applications also introduce new challenges, such as frequent inter-service communication and the complexity of managing heterogeneous codebases and hardware, resulting in unpredictable complexity and dynamism. Furthermore, as applications scale, only limited research teams or enterprises possess the resources for large-scale deployment and testing, which impedes progress in the cloud-native domain. To address these challenges, we propose CloudNativeSim, a simulator for cloud-native applications with a microservice-based architecture. CloudNativeSim offers several key benefits: (i) comprehensive and dynamic modeling for cloud-native applications, (ii) an extended simulation framework with new policy interfaces for scheduling cloud-native applications, and (iii) support for customized application scenarios and user feedback based on Quality of Service (QoS) metrics. CloudNativeSim can be easily deployed on standard computers to manage a high volume of requests and services. Its performance was validated through a case study, demonstrating higher than 94.5% accuracy in terms of response time. The study further highlights the feasibility of CloudNativeSim by illustrating the effects of various scaling policies.</description>

      <title>SHRINK: Data Compression by Semantic Extraction and Residuals Encoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06713v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The distributed data infrastructure in Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystems requires efficient data-series compression methods, along with the ability to feed different accuracy demands. However, the compression performance of existing compression methods degrades sharply when calling for ultra-accurate data recovery. In this paper, we introduce SHRINK, a novel highly accurate data compression method that offers a higher compression ratio and also lower runtime than prior compressors. SHRINK extracts data semantics in the form of linear segments to construct a compact knowledge base, using a dynamic error threshold that it adapts to data characteristics. Then, it captures the remaining data details as residuals to support lossy compression at diverse resolutions as well as lossless compression. As SHRINK identifies repeated semantics, its compression ratio increases with data size. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that SHRINK outperforms state-of-art methods with an up to threefold improvement in compression ratio.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11845v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing with their exceptional understanding, synthesizing, and reasoning capabilities. However, deploying LLMs on resource-constrained edge devices presents significant challenges due to computational limitations, memory constraints, and edge hardware heterogeneity. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of recent advancements in edge LLMs, covering the entire lifecycle: from resource-efficient model design and pre-deployment strategies to runtime inference optimizations. It also explores on-device applications across various domains. By synthesizing state-of-the-art techniques and identifying future research directions, this survey bridges the gap between the immense potential of LLMs and the constraints of edge computing.</description>

      <title>BlockEmulator: An Emulator Enabling to Test Blockchain Sharding Protocols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.03612v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Numerous blockchain simulators have been proposed to allow researchers to simulate mainstream blockchains. However, we have not yet found a testbed that enables researchers to develop and evaluate their new consensus algorithms or new protocols for blockchain sharding systems. To fill this gap, we developed BlockEmulator, which is designed as an experimental platform, particularly for emulating blockchain sharding mechanisms. BlockEmulator adopts a lightweight blockchain architecture so developers can only focus on implementing their new protocols or mechanisms. Using layered modules and useful programming interfaces offered by BlockEmulator, researchers can implement a new protocol with minimum effort. Through experiments, we test various functionalities of BlockEmulator in two steps. Firstly, we prove the correctness of the emulation results yielded by BlockEmulator by comparing the theoretical analysis with the observed experiment results. Secondly, other experimental results demonstrate that BlockEmulator can facilitate measuring a series of metrics, including throughput, transaction confirmation latency, cross-shard transaction ratio, the queuing status of transaction pools, workload distribution across blockchain shards, etc. We have made BlockEmulator open-source in Github.</description>

      <title>Communication-Efficient Federated Optimization over Semi-Decentralized Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.18787v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In large-scale federated and decentralized learning, communication efficiency is one of the most challenging bottlenecks. While gossip communication -- where agents can exchange information with their connected neighbors -- is more cost-effective than communicating with the remote server, it often requires a greater number of communication rounds, especially for large and sparse networks. To tackle the trade-off, we examine the communication efficiency under a semi-decentralized communication protocol, in which agents can perform both agent-to-agent and agent-to-server communication in a probabilistic manner. We design a tailored communication-efficient algorithm over semi-decentralized networks, referred to as PISCO, which inherits the robustness to data heterogeneity thanks to gradient tracking and allows multiple local updates for saving communication. We establish the convergence rate of PISCO for nonconvex problems and show that PISCO enjoys a linear speedup in terms of the number of agents and local updates. Our numerical results highlight the superior communication efficiency of PISCO and its resilience to data heterogeneity and various network topologies.</description>

      <title>Communication-efficient Vertical Federated Learning via Compressed Error Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14420v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Communication overhead is a known bottleneck in federated learning (FL). To address this, lossy compression is commonly used on the information communicated between the server and clients during training. In horizontal FL, where each client holds a subset of the samples, such communication-compressed training methods have recently seen significant progress. However, in their vertical FL counterparts, where each client holds a subset of the features, our understanding remains limited. To address this, we propose an error feedback compressed vertical federated learning (EF-VFL) method to train split neural networks. In contrast to previous communication-compressed methods for vertical FL, EF-VFL does not require a vanishing compression error for the gradient norm to converge to zero for smooth nonconvex problems. By leveraging error feedback, our method can achieve a $\mathcal{O}(1/T)$ convergence rate for a sufficiently large batch size, improving over the state-of-the-art $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{T})$ rate under $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{T})$ compression error, and matching the rate of uncompressed methods. Further, when the objective function satisfies the Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz inequality, our method converges linearly. In addition to improving convergence, our method also supports the use of private labels. Numerical experiments show that EF-VFL significantly improves over the prior art, confirming our theoretical results. The code for this work can be found at https://github.com/Valdeira/EF-VFL.</description>

      <title>Cache Coherence Over Disaggregated Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02088v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Disaggregating memory from compute offers the opportunity to better utilize stranded memory in cloud data centers. It is important to cache data in the compute nodes and maintain cache coherence across multiple compute nodes. However, the limited computing power on disaggregated memory servers makes traditional cache coherence protocols suboptimal, particularly in the case of stranded memory. This paper introduces SELCC; a Shared-Exclusive Latch Cache Coherence protocol that maintains cache coherence without imposing any computational burden on the remote memory side. It aligns the state machine of the shared-exclusive latch protocol with the MSI protocol , thereby ensuring both atomicity of data access and cache coherence with sequential consistency. SELCC embeds cache-ownership metadata directly into the RDMA latch word, enabling efficient cache ownership management via RDMA atomic operations. SELCC can serve as an abstraction layer over disaggregated memory with APIs that resemble main-memory accesses. A concurrent B-tree and three transaction concurrency control algorithms are realized using SELCC's abstraction layer. Experimental results show that SELCC significantly outperforms Remote-Procedure-Call-based protocols for cache coherence under limited remote computing power. Applications on SELCC achieve comparable or superior performance over disaggregated memory compared to competitors.</description>

      <title>Revisiting LocalSGD and SCAFFOLD: Improved Rates and Missing Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04443v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: LocalSGD and SCAFFOLD are widely used methods in distributed stochastic optimization, with numerous applications in machine learning, large-scale data processing, and federated learning. However, rigorously establishing their theoretical advantages over simpler methods, such as minibatch SGD (MbSGD), has proven challenging, as existing analyses often rely on strong assumptions, unrealistic premises, or overly restrictive scenarios.
  In this work, we revisit the convergence properties of LocalSGD and SCAFFOLD under a variety of existing or weaker conditions, including gradient similarity, Hessian similarity, weak convexity, and Lipschitz continuity of the Hessian. Our analysis shows that (i) LocalSGD achieves faster convergence compared to MbSGD for weakly convex functions without requiring stronger gradient similarity assumptions; (ii) LocalSGD benefits significantly from higher-order similarity and smoothness; and (iii) SCAFFOLD demonstrates faster convergence than MbSGD for a broader class of non-quadratic functions. These theoretical insights provide a clearer understanding of the conditions under which LocalSGD and SCAFFOLD outperform MbSGD.</description>

      <title>SafeSplit: A Novel Defense Against Client-Side Backdoor Attacks in Split Learning (Full Version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06650v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Split Learning (SL) is a distributed deep learning approach enabling multiple clients and a server to collaboratively train and infer on a shared deep neural network (DNN) without requiring clients to share their private local data. The DNN is partitioned in SL, with most layers residing on the server and a few initial layers and inputs on the client side. This configuration allows resource-constrained clients to participate in training and inference. However, the distributed architecture exposes SL to backdoor attacks, where malicious clients can manipulate local datasets to alter the DNN's behavior. Existing defenses from other distributed frameworks like Federated Learning are not applicable, and there is a lack of effective backdoor defenses specifically designed for SL.
  We present SafeSplit, the first defense against client-side backdoor attacks in Split Learning (SL). SafeSplit enables the server to detect and filter out malicious client behavior by employing circular backward analysis after a client's training is completed, iteratively reverting to a trained checkpoint where the model under examination is found to be benign. It uses a two-fold analysis to identify client-induced changes and detect poisoned models. First, a static analysis in the frequency domain measures the differences in the layer's parameters at the server. Second, a dynamic analysis introduces a novel rotational distance metric that assesses the orientation shifts of the server's layer parameters during training. Our comprehensive evaluation across various data distributions, client counts, and attack scenarios demonstrates the high efficacy of this dual analysis in mitigating backdoor attacks while preserving model utility.</description>

      <title>Optimal Distributed Replacement Paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15378v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the replacement paths problem in the $\mathsf{CONGEST}$ model of distributed computing. Given an $s$-$t$ shortest path $P$, the goal is to compute, for every edge $e$ in $P$, the shortest-path distance from $s$ to $t$ avoiding $e$. For unweighted directed graphs, we establish the tight randomized round complexity bound for this problem as $\widetilde{\Theta}(n^{2/3} + D)$ by showing matching upper and lower bounds. Our upper bound extends to $(1+\epsilon)$-approximation for weighted directed graphs. Our lower bound applies even to the second simple shortest path problem, which asks only for the smallest replacement path length. These results improve upon the very recent work of Manoharan and Ramachandran (SIROCCO 2024), who showed a lower bound of $\widetilde{\Omega}(n^{1/2} + D)$ and an upper bound of $\widetilde{O}(n^{2/3} + \sqrt{n h_{st}} + D)$, where $h_{st}$ is the number of hops in the given $s$-$t$ shortest path $P$.</description>
