      <title>Advancing Financial Forecasting: A Comparative Analysis of Neural Forecasting Models N-HiTS and N-BEATS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the rapidly evolving field of financial forecasting, the application of neural networks presents a compelling advancement over traditional statistical models. This research paper explores the effectiveness of two specific neural forecasting models, N-HiTS and N-BEATS, in predicting financial market trends. Through a systematic comparison with conventional models, this study demonstrates the superior predictive capabilities of neural approaches, particularly in handling the non-linear dynamics and complex patterns inherent in financial time series data. The results indicate that N-HiTS and N-BEATS not only enhance the accuracy of forecasts but also boost the robustness and adaptability of financial predictions, offering substantial advantages in environments that require real-time decision-making. The paper concludes with insights into the practical implications of neural forecasting in financial markets and recommendations for future research directions.</description>

      <title>Credit Scores: Performance and Equity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Credit scores are critical for allocating consumer debt in the United States, yet little evidence is available on their performance. We benchmark a widely used credit score against a machine learning model of consumer default and find significant misclassification of borrowers, especially those with low scores. Our model improves predictive accuracy for young, low-income, and minority groups due to its superior performance with low quality data, resulting in a gain in standing for these populations. Our findings suggest that improving credit scoring performance could lead to more equitable access to credit.</description>
