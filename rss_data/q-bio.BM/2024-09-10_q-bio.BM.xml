      <title>Technical Report of HelixFold3 for Biomolecular Structure Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16975v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The AlphaFold series has transformed protein structure prediction with remarkable accuracy, often matching experimental methods. AlphaFold2, AlphaFold-Multimer, and the latest AlphaFold3 represent significant strides in predicting single protein chains, protein complexes, and biomolecular structures. While AlphaFold2 and AlphaFold-Multimer are open-sourced, facilitating rapid and reliable predictions, AlphaFold3 remains partially accessible through a limited online server and has not been open-sourced, restricting further development. To address these challenges, the PaddleHelix team is developing HelixFold3, aiming to replicate AlphaFold3's capabilities. Using insights from previous models and extensive datasets, HelixFold3 achieves an accuracy comparable to AlphaFold3 in predicting the structures of conventional ligands, nucleic acids, and proteins. The initial release of HelixFold3 is available as open source on GitHub for academic research, promising to advance biomolecular research and accelerate discoveries. We also provide online service at PaddleHelix website at https://paddlehelix.baidu.com/app/all/helixfold3/forecast.</description>

      <title>Improving Antibody Design with Force-Guided Sampling in Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05832v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Antibodies, crucial for immune defense, primarily rely on complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) to bind and neutralize antigens, such as viruses. The design of these CDRs determines the antibody's affinity and specificity towards its target. Generative models, particularly denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs), have shown potential to advance the structure-based design of CDR regions. However, only a limited dataset of bound antibody-antigen structures is available, and generalization to out-of-distribution interfaces remains a challenge. Physics based force-fields, which approximate atomic interactions, offer a coarse but universal source of information to better mold designs to target interfaces. Integrating this foundational information into diffusion models is, therefore, highly desirable. Here, we propose a novel approach to enhance the sampling process of diffusion models by integrating force field energy-based feedback. Our model, DiffForce, employs forces to guide the diffusion sampling process, effectively blending the two distributions. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our method guides the model to sample CDRs with lower energy, enhancing both the structure and sequence of the generated antibodies.</description>

      <title>FreeCG: Free the Design Space of Clebsch-Gordan Transform for Machine Learning Force Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02263v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine Learning Force Fields (MLFFs) are of great importance for chemistry, physics, materials science, and many other related fields. The Clebsch-Gordan Transform (CG transform) effectively encodes many-body interactions and is thus an important building block for many models of MLFFs. However, the permutation-equivariance requirement of MLFFs limits the design space of CG transform, that is, intensive CG transform has to be conducted for each neighboring edge and the operations should be performed in the same manner for all edges. This constraint results in reduced expressiveness of the model while simultaneously increasing computational demands. To overcome this challenge, we first implement the CG transform layer on the permutation-invariant abstract edges generated from real edge information. We show that this approach allows complete freedom in the design of the layer without compromising the crucial symmetry. Developing on this free design space, we further propose group CG transform with sparse path, abstract edges shuffling, and attention enhancer to form a powerful and efficient CG transform layer. Our method, known as FreeCG, achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in force prediction for MD17, rMD17, MD22, and is well extended to property prediction in QM9 datasets with several improvements greater than 15% and the maximum beyond 20%. The extensive real-world applications showcase high practicality. FreeCG introduces a novel paradigm for carrying out efficient and expressive CG transform in future geometric neural network designs. To demonstrate this, the recent SOTA, QuinNet, is also enhanced under our paradigm. Code will be publicly available.</description>
