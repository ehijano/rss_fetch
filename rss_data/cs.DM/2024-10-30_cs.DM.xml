      <title>Algorithmic methods of finite discrete structures. Graph clique problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The monography presents a new algorithm for finding the clique of maximal length in a nonseparable graph. The algorithm is based on the properties of the representation of a clique as a subset of the set of cycles with a length of three, the ring sum of which is an empty set. As a result of selecting the cycles of the length of three, two vectors are formed: the vector of cycles passing through the edges and the vector of cycles passing through the vertices. The numerical values of the components of these vectors determine the weights of the vertices and edges. The iterative process of constructing the set of vectors of cycles passing through the edges allows identifying the main vector of cycles passing through the edges. In turn, the construction of the main vector allows finding the clicks of the graph. The computational complexity of the presented algorithm is analyzed.</description>

      <title>Sum-of-squares lower bounds for Non-Gaussian Component Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Gaussian Component Analysis (NGCA) is the statistical task of finding a non-Gaussian direction in a high-dimensional dataset. Specifically, given i.i.d.\ samples from a distribution $P^A_{v}$ on $\mathbb{R}^n$ that behaves like a known distribution $A$ in a hidden direction $v$ and like a standard Gaussian in the orthogonal complement, the goal is to approximate the hidden direction. The standard formulation posits that the first $k-1$ moments of $A$ match those of the standard Gaussian and the $k$-th moment differs. Under mild assumptions, this problem has sample complexity $O(n)$. On the other hand, all known efficient algorithms require $\Omega(n^{k/2})$ samples. Prior work developed sharp Statistical Query and low-degree testing lower bounds suggesting an information-computation tradeoff for this problem.
  Here we study the complexity of NGCA in the Sum-of-Squares (SoS) framework. Our main contribution is the first super-constant degree SoS lower bound for NGCA. Specifically, we show that if the non-Gaussian distribution $A$ matches the first $(k-1)$ moments of $\mathcal{N}(0, 1)$ and satisfies other mild conditions, then with fewer than $n^{(1 - \varepsilon)k/2}$ many samples from the normal distribution, with high probability, degree $(\log n)^{{1\over 2}-o_n(1)}$ SoS fails to refute the existence of such a direction $v$. Our result significantly strengthens prior work by establishing a super-polynomial information-computation tradeoff against a broader family of algorithms. As corollaries, we obtain SoS lower bounds for several problems in robust statistics and the learning of mixture models.
  Our SoS lower bound proof introduces a novel technique, that we believe may be of broader interest, and a number of refinements over existing methods.</description>

      <title>On the stability of solutions to random optimization problems under small perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider the Euclidean traveling salesman problem with $n$ random points on the plane. Suppose that one of the points is shifted to a new random location. This gives us a new optimal path. Consider such shifts for each of the $n$ points. Do we get $n$ very different optimal paths? In this article, we show that this is not the case - in fact, the number of truly different paths can be at most $\mathcal{O}(1)$ as $n\to \infty$. The proof is based on a general argument which allows us to prove similar stability results in a number of other settings, such as branching random walk, the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model of mean-field spin glasses, the Edwards-Anderson model of short-range spin glasses, and the Wigner ensemble of random matrices.</description>

      <title>A Method for Constructing Wavelet Functions on the Real Number Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A general method to construct wavelet function on real number ffeld is proposed in this article,which is based on finite length sequence.This finite length sequence is called the seed sequence, and the corresponding wavelet function is called the seed sequence wavelet function.The seed sequence wavelet function is continuous and energy concentrated in both time and frequency domains,That is, it has a finite support set in both time and frequency domains. It is proved that if and only if the seed sequence has 0 mean value, the interpolation function satisfy the admissible condition of wavelet function. The conditions corresponding to the higher order vanishing moment of the seed sequence wavelet function are also given in this article. On this basis, the concept of random wavelet function is proposed, and the condition of the regularity of random wavelet is discussed.</description>

      <title>Maximal Independent Sets in Planar Triangulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that every planar triangulation on $n$ vertices has a maximal independent set of size at most $n/3$. This affirms a conjecture by Botler, Fernandes and Guti\'errez [Electron.\ J.\ Comb., 2024], which in turn would follow if an open question of Goddard and Henning [Appl.\ Math.\ Comput., 2020] which asks if every planar triangulation has three disjoint maximal independent sets were answered in the affirmative. Since a maximal independent set is a special type of dominating set (independent dominating set), this is a structural strengthening of a major result by Matheson and Tarjan [Eur.\ J.\ Comb., 1996] that every triangulated disc has a dominating set of size at most $n/3$, but restricted to triangulations.</description>

      <title>Cop numbers of periodic graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.13616v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A \emph{periodic graph} ${\cal G}=(G_0, G_1, G_2, \dots)$ with period $p$ is an infinite periodic sequence of graphs $G_i = G_{i + p} = (V,E_i)$, where $i \geq 0$. The graph $G=(V,\cup_i E_i)$ is called the footprint of ${\cal G}$. Recently, the arena where the Cops and Robber game is played has been extended from a graph to a periodic graph; in this case, the \emph{cop number} is also the minimum number of cops sufficient for capturing the robber. We study the connections and distinctions between the cop number $c({\cal G})$ of a periodic graph ${\cal G}$ and the cop number $c(G)$ of its footprint $G$ and establish several facts. For instance, we show that the smallest periodic graph with $c({\cal G}) = 3$ has at most $8$ nodes; in contrast, the smallest graph $G$ with $c(G) = 3$ has $10$ nodes.
  We push this investigation by generating multiple examples showing how the cop numbers of a periodic graph ${\cal G}$, the subgraphs $G_i$ and its footprint $G$ can be loosely tied.
  Based on these results, we derive upper bounds on the cop number of a periodic graph from properties of its footprint such as its treewidth.</description>

      <title>Finding $d$-Cuts in Graphs of Bounded Diameter, Graphs of Bounded Radius and $H$-Free Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11389v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The $d$-Cut problem is to decide if a graph has an edge cut such that each vertex has at most $d$ neighbours at the opposite side of the cut. If $d=1$, we obtain the intensively studied Matching Cut problem. The $d$-Cut problem has been studied as well, but a systematic study for special graph classes was lacking. We initiate such a study and consider classes of bounded diameter, bounded radius and $H$-free graphs. We prove that for all $d\geq 2$, $d$-Cut is polynomial-time solvable for graphs of diameter $2$, $(P_3+P_4)$-free graphs and $P_5$-free graphs. These results extend known results for $d=1$. However, we also prove several NP-hardness results for $d$-Cut that contrast known polynomial-time results for $d=1$. Our results lead to full dichotomies for bounded diameter and bounded radius and to almost-complete dichotomies for $H$-free graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17349v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rectangulations are decompositions of a square into finitely many axis-aligned rectangles. We describe realizations of $(n-1)$-dimensional polytopes associated with two combinatorial families of rectangulations composed of $n$ rectangles. They are defined as quotientopes of natural lattice congruences on the weak Bruhat order on permutations in $\mathfrak{S}_n$, and their skeleta are flip graphs on rectangulations. We give simple vertex and facet descriptions of these polytopes, in particular elementary formulas for computing the coordinates of the vertex corresponding to each rectangulation, in the spirit of J.-L. Loday's realization of the associahedron.</description>

      <title>Optimal Multilevel Slashing for Blockchains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08135v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the notion of multilevel slashing, where proof-of-stake blockchain validators can obtain gradual levels of assurance that a certain block is bound to be finalized in a global consensus procedure, unless an increasing and optimally large number of Byzantine processes have their staked assets slashed -- that is, deducted -- due to provably incorrect behavior. Our construction is a highly parameterized generalization of combinatorial intersection systems based on finite projective spaces, with asymptotic high availability and optimal slashing properties. Even under weak conditions, we show that our construction has asymptotically optimal slashing properties with respect to message complexity and validator load; this result also illustrates a fundamental trade off between message complexity, load, and slashing. In addition, we show that any intersection system whose ground elements are disjoint subsets of nodes (e.g. "committees" in committee-based consensus protocols) has asymptotic high availability under similarly weak conditions. Finally, our multilevel construction gives the flexibility to blockchain validators to decide how many "levels" of finalization assurance they wish to obtain. This functionality can be seen either as (i) a form of an early, slashing-based block finalization; or (ii) a service to support reorg tolerance.</description>

      <title>Algebraic Geometric Rook Codes for Coded Distributed Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09746v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend coded distributed computing over finite fields to allow the number of workers to be larger than the field size. We give codes that work for fully general matrix multiplication and show that in this case we serendipitously have that all functions can be computed in a distributed fault-tolerant fashion over finite fields. This generalizes previous results on the topic. We prove that the associated codes achieve a recovery threshold similar to the ones for characteristic zero fields but now with a factor that is proportional to the genus of the underlying function field. In particular, we have that the recovery threshold of these codes is proportional to the classical complexity of matrix multiplication by a factor of at most the genus.</description>

      <title>Randomized Greedy Online Edge Coloring Succeeds for Dense and Randomly-Ordered Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13000v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vizing's theorem states that any graph of maximum degree $\Delta$ can be properly edge colored with at most $\Delta+1$ colors. In the online setting, it has been a matter of interest to find an algorithm that can properly edge color any graph on $n$ vertices with maximum degree $\Delta = \omega(\log n)$ using at most $(1+o(1))\Delta$ colors. Here we study the na\"{i}ve random greedy algorithm, which simply chooses a legal color uniformly at random for each edge upon arrival. We show that this algorithm can $(1+\epsilon)\Delta$-color the graph for arbitrary $\epsilon$ in two contexts: first, if the edges arrive in a uniformly random order, and second, if the edges arrive in an adversarial order but the graph is sufficiently dense, i.e., $n = O(\Delta)$. Prior to this work, the random greedy algorithm was only known to succeed in trees.
  Our second result is applicable even when the adversary is adaptive, and therefore implies the existence of a deterministic edge coloring algorithm which $(1+\epsilon)\Delta$ edge colors a dense graph. Prior to this, the best known deterministic algorithm for this problem was the simple greedy algorithm which utilized $2\Delta-1$ colors.</description>
