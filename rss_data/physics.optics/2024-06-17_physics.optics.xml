      <title>Investigation of Q degradation in low-loss Si3N4 from heterogeneous laser integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-performance, high-volume-manufacturing Si3N4 photonics requires extremely low waveguide losses augmented with heterogeneously integrated lasers for applications beyond traditional markets of high-capacity interconnects. State-of-the-art quality factors (Q) over 200 million at 1550 nm have been shown previously; however, maintaining high Qs throughout laser fabrication has not been shown. Here, Si3N4 resonator intrinsic Qs over 100 million are demonstrated on a fully integrated heterogeneous laser platform. Qi is measured throughout laser processing steps, showing degradation down to 50 million from dry etching, metal evaporation, and ion implant steps, and controllable recovery to over 100 million from annealing at 250C - 350C.</description>

      <title>Reciprocity-assisted ghost imaging through dynamic random media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ghost imaging enables the imaging of an object using intensity correlations between a single-pixel detector placed behind the object and a camera that records light that did not interact with the object. The object and the camera are often placed at conjugate planes to ensure correlated illumination patterns. Here, we show how the combined effect of optical reciprocity and the memory effect in a random medium gives rise to correlations between two beams that traverse the random medium in opposite directions. Using these correlations, we demonstrate a ghost imaging scheme in which the object and camera are placed at opposite ends of the random medium and illuminated by counter-propagating beams that can potentially be emitted by two different sources.</description>

      <title>Numerical Modeling of Transient Absorption in Hybrid Dual-Plasmonic Au/CuS Nanostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transient absorption in plasmonic materials has recently attracted attention of the chemistry and optics communities as a technique to understand dynamic processes and hot carriers generation on ultrafast timescales. In this context, hybrid Au/CuS nanostructures were recently investigated via ultrafast pump-probe transient absorption spectroscopy revealing an exotic dual-plasmonic behavior. Namely, the excitation of a localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) in Au (pump at 551 nm) or CuS (pump at 1051 nm), leads to a transient response in the counterpart. This phenomenon was attributed to Landau damping, which stems from hot carrier generation and injection mechanisms at the interface between the two materials. Here, we employ numerical modeling to further clarify the origin of such response in hybrid Au/CuS nanostructures. The geometry of the hybrid nanostructures is first investigated via steady-state simulations (only probe), confirming an UFO-shaped configuration. We provide clarification on the role of the size ratio between Au and CuS. Finally, we present the simulation of transient absorption in the pump-probe regime, which qualitatively replicates our experimental observations, thus identifying the plasmonic response modified via Landau damping as the main governing mechanism. Our numerical approach provides an important tool for the modeling of transient absorption spectroscopy and can support experimental research on dual-plasmonic materials for applications in spectroscopy, photocatalysis, thermoplasmonics, sensing, and energy harvesting.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear chiral metasurfaces based on structured van der Waals materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear chiral photonics explores nonlinear response of chiral structures, and it offers a pathway to novel optical functionalities not accessible through linear or achiral systems. Here we present the first application of nanostructured van der Waals materials to nonlinear chiral photonics. We demonstrate the three orders of magnitude enhancement of the third-harmonic generation from hBN metasurfaces driven by quasi-bound states in the continuum, accompanied by a strong nonlinear circular dichroism in the resonant metasurface varying from the values -0.5 to +0.5. This novel platform for chiral metaphotonics can be employed for achieving large circular dichroism combined with high-efficiency harmonic generation in a broad frequency range.</description>

      <title>Quantitative phase imaging verification in large field-of-view lensless holographic microscopy via two-photon 3D printing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large field-of-view (FOV) microscopic imaging with high lateral resolution (1-2 microns for high space-bandwidth product) plays a pivotal role in biomedicine and biophotonics, especially within the label-free regime, e.g., for whole slide tissue quantitative analysis and live cell culture imaging. In this context, lensless digital holographic microscopy (LDHM) holds substantial promise. However, one intriguing challenge has been the fidelity of computational quantitative phase imaging (QPI) with LDHM in large FOV. While photonic phantoms, 3D printed by two-photon polymerization (TPP), have facilitated calibration and verification in small FOV lens-based QPI systems, an equivalent evaluation for lensless techniques remains elusive, compounded by issues such as twin-image and beam distortions, particularly towards the detector edges. To tackle this problem, we propose an application of TPP over large area to examine phase consistency in LDHM. In our research, we crafted widefield calibration phase test targets, fabricated them with galvo and piezo scanning, and scrutinized them under single-shot twin-image corrupted conditions and multi-frame iterative twin-image minimization scenarios. By displacing the structures toward the edges of the sensing area, we verified LDHM phase imaging errors across the entire field-of-view, showing less than 12 percent of phase value difference between investigated areas. Interestingly, our research revealed that the TPP technique, following LDHM and Linnik interferometry cross-verification, requires novel design considerations for successful large-area precise photonic manufacturing. Our work thus unveils important avenues toward the quantitative benchmarking of large FOV lensless phase imaging, advancing our mechanistic understanding of LDHM techniques and contributing to their further development and optimization of both phase imaging and fabrication.</description>

      <title>Retiming dynamics of harmonically modelocked laser solitons in a self-driven optomechanical lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Harmonic mode-locking, realized actively or passively, is an effective technique for increasing the repetition rate of lasers, with important applications in optical sampling, laser micro-machining and frequency metrology. It is critically important to understand how a harmonically mode-locked pulse train responds to external perturbations and noise, so as to make sure that it is stable and resistant to noise. Here, in a series of carefully designed experiments, we elucidate the retiming dynamics of laser pulses generated in a soliton fiber laser harmonically mode-locked at ~2 GHz to the acoustic resonance in a photonic crystal fiber (PCF) core. We characterize the self-driven optomechanical lattice along the PCF using a homodyne set-up, and reveal that each soliton undergoes damped oscillatory retiming within its trapping potential after an abrupt perturbation. In addition we show, through statistical analysis of the intra-cavity pulse spacing, how the trapping potentials are effective for suppressing timing jitter. The experimental results are well described using a dynamic model including dissipation, which provides valuable insight into the stability and noise performance of optomechanically mode-locked laser systems, and may also be useful for studying complex inter-soliton interactions.</description>

      <title>In-situ aligned all-polarization-maintaining Er-doped fiber laser mode-locked by a nonlinear amplifying loop mirror</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the wide applications for high-repetition-rate mode-locked fiber lasers, challenges persist in shortening the cavity length and coupling the fiber collimators for most existing techniques. Here, we introduce a novel collimator alignment method and demonstrate an all-polarization-maintaining erbium-doped fiber laser that contains a nonlinear amplifying loop mirror with a repetition rate of 213 MHz. Compared to the conventional method, we achieve in-situ alignment of the collimators in a simplified two-step process. Besides, through a comparison of the spectra from the output ports of the laser, we assess their quality and establish the spectral evolution relationships among these ports. It is found that, in addition to the widely believed large nonlinear effects, spectral interference also plays a significant role in spectral distortion. Moreover, a transition between different stability states is observed from the power variation of the single pulse.</description>

      <title>High-efficiency generation of vectorial holograms with metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Holography plays a crucial role in optics applications, but it traditionally requires complex setup and bulky devices, being unfavourable for optics integration. While metasurface-based holograms are ultra-compact and easy to realize, holographic images generated are mostly restricted to scalar ones, with a few recent attempts on vectorial holograms suffering from complex meta-structures and low efficiencies. Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate an efficient meta-platform to generate vectorial holograms with arbitrarily designed wave fronts and polarization distributions based on ultra-compact metaatoms. Combining GS algorithm and the wave-decomposition technique, we establish a generic strategy to retrieve the optical property, i.e., the distributions of reflection phase and polarization-conversion capability of the metasurface to generate a target vectorial holographic image. We next design a series of high-efficiency and deep-subwavelength metaatoms exhibiting arbitrarily designed reflection phases and polarization-conversion capabilities, and experimentally characterize their optical properties. Based on these metaatoms, we finally realize a series of meta-holograms that can generate pre-designed vectorial holographic images upon external illuminations, and experimentally characterize their working performances. Our work provides a high-efficiency and ultra-thin platform to generate vectorial holographic images, which can find many applications in onchip photonics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present a physical and theoretical description of the significant degradation of X-ray spatial coherence properties due to the use of grating monochromators at synchrotron facilities. We present a comprehensive study of the effects of spatial coherence degradation as a function of grating parameters under different focusing and propagation conditions. The focus is on the effect of spatial coherence degradation caused by the grating alone, starting from a fully coherent incident photon beam generated by a filament source. The mathematical description and theoretical analysis of the spatial coherence degradation is presented in the framework of statistical optics.</description>

      <title>Universal scaling of Green's functions in disordered non-Hermitian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The competition between non-Hermitian skin effect and Anderson localization leads to various intriguing phenomena concerning spectrums and wavefunctions. Here, we study the linear response of disordered non-Hermitian systems, which is precisely described by the Green's function. We find that the average maximum value of matrix elements of Green's functions, which quantifies the maximum response against an external perturbation, exhibits different phases characterized by different scaling behaviors with respect to the system size. Whereas the exponential-growth phase is also seen in the translation-invariant systems, the algebraic-growth phase is unique to disordered non-Hermitian systems. We explain the findings using the large deviation theory, which provides analytical insights into the algebraic scaling factors of non-Hermitian disordered Green's functions. Furthermore, we show that these scaling behaviors can be observed in the steady states of disordered open quantum systems, offering a quantum-mechanical avenue for their experimental detection. Our work highlights an unexpected interplay between non-Hermitian skin effect and Anderson localization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generation of quantum entanglement between a pair of qubits is studied in a cavity-QED platform. The qubit pair is placed inside a common cavity environment. We show that the relative strength of qubit-photon couplings is crucial for establishing inter-qubit entanglement. Resonance as well as off-resonance between the qubits and photon are considered . For off-resonant case we detect a threshold value of coupling ratio, beyond which maximally entangled state is always available. The resonant case displays interesting non-monotonic behavior, where the maximum entanglement peaks at an intermediate coupling ratio. The driven-dissipative dynamics of our model exhibits non-trivial dependence of steady-state entanglement on the drive strength.</description>

      <title>Resonant analogue configurations in atomic condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10027v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As a contribution to a memorial volume, we provide a comprehensive discussion of resonant configurations in analogue gravity, focusing on its implementation in atomic condensates and combining review features with original insights and calculations. In particular, we analyze the analogues of the Andreev and Hawking effects using a microscopic description based on the Bogoliubov approximation. We contemplate several resonant scenarios whose efficiency to enhance anomalous scattering processes is compared to that of non-resonant setups. The presence of quantum signatures in analogue configurations, such as the violation of Cauchy-Schwarz inequalities or entanglement, is analyzed, observing that resonant configurations highly increase the entanglement signal, especially for the Andreev effect. We also discuss how these results have served as inspiration for the rapidly expanding field of quantum information in high-energy colliders. Finally, we study the physics of black-hole lasers as further examples of resonant analogue structures, distinguishing three stages in its time evolution. For short times, we compute the linear and non-linear spectrum for different models. For intermediate times, we generalize the current analysis of the BHL-BCL crossover. For long times, we discuss the emerging concept of spontaneous Floquet state and its potential implications.</description>

      <title>Intepretative Deep Learning using Domain Adaptation for Fluorescence Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fluorescence spectroscopy is a fundamental tool in life sciences and chemistry, widely used for applications such as environmental monitoring, food quality control, and biomedical diagnostics. However, analysis of spectroscopic data with deep learning, in particular of fluorescence excitation-emission matrices (EEMs), presents significant challenges due mainly to the typically small and sparse datasets available. Furthermore, the analysis of EEMs is difficult due to their high dimensionality and overlapping spectral features. This study proposes a new approach that exploits domain adaptation with pretrained vision models, alongside a novel interpretability algorithm to address these challenges. Thanks to specialised feature engineering of the neural networks described in this work, we are now able to provide deeper and meaningful insights into the physico-chemical processes underlying the data. The proposed approach is demonstrated through the analysis of the oxidation process in extra virgin olive oil (EVOO), showing its effectiveness in predicting quality indicators and identifying relevant spectral bands. This work describes significantly innovative results in the use of deep learning for spectroscopy, transforming it from a black box into a tool for understanding complex biological and chemical processes.</description>

      <title>Fluidic Approach to Corrective Eyewear Manufacturing in Low-Resource Settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Limited access to corrective eyewear remains a significant medical, societal, and economic challenge, even in the 21st century. More than 1 billion people suffer from uncorrected vision impairment, with the vast majority residing in developing countries. Decades of philanthropic efforts failed to supply even a small fraction of the demand, whereas local manufacturing using standard machining technologies remains out of reach due to inadequate resources. We here show that the Fluidic Shaping approach can be utilized to create a new manufacturing modality for high-quality ophthalmic lenses that entirely eliminates the need for machining, and instead uses surface tension to shape liquid polymer volumes into prescription lenses. We present a compact device wherein a liquid photopolymer is injected into an elliptical frame submerged within an immersion liquid of equal density, resulting in two liquid surfaces whose minimum-energy states correspond to two lens surfaces. After several minutes of curing, a complete solid lens is obtained, requiring no post-processing. We provide an analytical model and experimental validation, showing that all spherical and cylindrical corrections can be attained by simply controlling the volume of the polymer and the frame's eccentricity. We demonstrate the fabrication of complete eyeglasses that meet and exceed industry standards, relying solely on a 1 gallon water container integrated with an array of low-power LEDs.</description>

      <title>Near-field Imaging of Optical Resonances in Silicon Metasurfaces Using Photoelectron Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.12825v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Precise control of light-matter interactions at the nanoscale lies at the heart of nanophotonics. Experimental examination at this length scale is challenging, however, since the corresponding electromagnetic near-field is often confined within volumes below the resolution of conventional optical microscopy. In semiconductor nanophotonics electromagnetic fields are further restricted within the confines of individual subwavelength resonators, limiting access to critical light-matter interactions in these structures. In this work, we demonstrate that photoelectron emission microscopy (PEEM) can be used for polarization resolved near-field spectroscopy and imaging of electromagnetic resonances supported by broken-symmetry silicon metasurfaces. We find that the photoemission results, enabled through an in-situ potassium surface layer, are consistent with full-wave simulations and far-field reflectance measurements across visible and near-infrared wavelengths. In addition, we uncover a polarization dependent evolution of collective resonances near the metasurface array edge taking advantage of the far-field excitation and full-field imaging of PEEM. Here, we deduce that coupling between eight resonators or more establishes the collective excitations of this metasurface. All told, we demonstrate that the high-spatial resolution hyperspectral imaging and far-field illumination of PEEM can be leveraged for the metrology of collective, non-local, optical resonances in semiconductor nanophotonic structures.</description>

Abstract: A recently introduced theoretical framework for modeling the dynamics of X-ray amplified spontaneous emission is based on stochastic sampling of the density matrix of quantum emitters and the radiation field, similarly to other phase-space sampling techniques. While based on first principles and providing valuable theoretical insights, the original stochastic differential equations exhibit divergences and numerical instabilities. Here, we resolve this issue by accounting the stochastic components perturbatively. The refined formalism accurately reproduces the properties of spontaneous emission and proves universally applicable for describing all stages of collective X-ray emission in paraxial geometry, including spontaneous emission, amplified spontaneous emission, and the non-linear regime. Through numerical examples, we analyze key features of superfluorescence in one-dimensional approximation. Importantly, single realizations of the underlying stochastic equations can be fully interpreted as individual experimental observations of superfluorescence.</description>

      <title>For sky-facing passive radiative cooling, are wavelength-selective emitters the best choice?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00572v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For passive cooling via thermal radiation toward the sky, it is known that an ideal selective emitter (SE) with high emissivity only in the 8-13 um atmospheric transparency window can reach a lower equilibrium temperature than an ideal broadband emitter (BE) across the mid infrared. Here, we evaluate whether this principle should guide the development of practical passive radiative cooling technologies. We model and compare the cooling performance of sky-facing SEs and BEs at various locations on Earth, accounting for the distributions of atmospheric temperature and gas composition at specific dates and times. We find that for emitter temperatures at or higher than the ambient temperature, an ideal broadband emitter always provides higher net cooling power, while for sub-ambient cooling, an ideal selective emitter is usually slightly better, but the difference in cooling power is small, at most 1-2% of the incident solar power during daytime. Our conclusion is that large-scale deployment of passive radiative cooling technologies should focus on design and manufacturing of scalable low-cost surfaces with the lowest possible solar absorption without worrying too much whether the emitter is broadband or selective.</description>

      <title>Stochastic modeling of x-ray superfluorescence</title>

Abstract: An approach to modeling the dynamics of x-ray amplified spontaneous emission and superfluorescence -- the phenomenon of collective x-ray emission initiated by intense pulses of X-ray Free Electron Lasers -- is developed based on stochastic partial differential equations. The equations are derived from first principles, and the relevant approximations, derivation steps, and extensions specific to stimulated x-ray emission are presented. The resulting equations take the form of three-dimensional generalized Maxwell-Bloch equations augmented with noise terms for both field and atomic variables. The derived noise terms possess specific correlation properties that enable the correct reconstruction of spontaneous emission. Consequently, the developed theoretical formalism is universally suitable for describing all stages of stimulated x-ray emission: spontaneous emission, amplified spontaneous emission, and superfluorescence. We present numerical examples that illustrate various properties of the emitted field, including spatio-temporal coherence, spectral-angular and polarization characteristics. We anticipate that the proposed theoretical framework will establish a robust foundation for interpreting measurements in stimulated x-ray emission spectroscopy, modeling x-ray laser oscillators, and describing other experiments leveraging x-ray superfluorescence.</description>

      <title>Single-photon emitters in WSe$_2$: Critical role of phonons on excitation schemes and indistinguishability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10897</link>

Abstract: Within optical quantum information processing, single-photon sources based on a two-level system in a semiconductor material allow for on-demand generation of single photons. To initiate the spontaneous emission process, it is necessary to efficiently populate the excited state. However, reconciling the requirement for on-demand excitation with both high efficiency and high photon indistinguishability remains a challenge due to the presence of charge noise and phonon-induced decoherence in the solid-state environment. Here, we propose a method for reconstructing the phonon spectral density experienced by WSe$_{2}$ quantum emitters in the emission process. Using the reconstructed phonon spectral density, we analyze the performance of the resonant, phonon-assisted, and Swing-UP of the quantum EmitteR population (SUPER) swing-up excitation schemes. Under resonant excitation, we obtain an exciton preparation fidelity limited to $\sim$0.80 by the strong phonon coupling, which improves to 0.96 for the SUPER scheme (or 0.89, depending on the type of emitter considered). Under near-resonant phonon-assisted excitation, we observe near-unity excitation fidelity up to 0.976 (0.997). Additionally, we demonstrate that, assuming the suppression of the phonon sidebands, residual dephasing mechanisms such as charge/spin fluctuations are the dominating decoherence mechanisms undermining the photon indistinguishability.</description>

      <title>Compressed Meta-Optical Encoder for Image Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06534v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optical and hybrid convolutional neural networks (CNNs) recently have become of increasing interest to achieve low-latency, low-power image classification and computer vision tasks. However, implementing optical nonlinearity is challenging, and omitting the nonlinear layers in a standard CNN comes at a significant reduction in accuracy. In this work, we use knowledge distillation to compress modified AlexNet to a single linear convolutional layer and an electronic backend (two fully connected layers). We obtain comparable performance to a purely electronic CNN with five convolutional layers and three fully connected layers. We implement the convolution optically via engineering the point spread function of an inverse-designed meta-optic. Using this hybrid approach, we estimate a reduction in multiply-accumulate operations from 17M in a conventional electronic modified AlexNet to only 86K in the hybrid compressed network enabled by the optical frontend. This constitutes over two orders of magnitude reduction in latency and power consumption. Furthermore, we experimentally demonstrate that the classification accuracy of the system exceeds 93% on the MNIST dataset.</description>
