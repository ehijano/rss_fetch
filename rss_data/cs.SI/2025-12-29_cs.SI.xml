      <title>SENTINEL: A Multi-Modal Early Detection Framework for Emerging Cyber Threats using Telegram</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cyberattacks pose a serious threat to modern sociotechnical systems, often resulting in severe technical and societal consequences. Attackers commonly target systems and infrastructure through methods such as malware, ransomware, or other forms of technical exploitation. Most traditional mechanisms to counter these threats rely on post-hoc detection and mitigation strategies, responding to cyber incidents only after they occur rather than preventing them proactively. Recent trends reveal social media discussions can serve as reliable indicators for detecting such threats. Malicious actors often exploit online platforms to distribute attack tools, share attack knowledge and coordinate. Experts too, often predict ongoing attacks and discuss potential breaches in online spaces. In this work, we present SENTINEL, a framework that leverages social media signals for early detection of cyber attacks. SENTINEL aligns cybersecurity discussions to realworld cyber attacks leveraging multi modal signals, i.e., combining language modeling through large language models and coordination markers through graph neural networks. We use data from 16 public channels on Telegram related to cybersecurity and open source intelligence (OSINT) that span 365k messages. We highlight that social media discussions involve active dialogue around cyber threats and leverage SENTINEL to align the signals to real-world threats with an F1 of 0.89. Our work highlights the importance of leveraging language and network signals in predicting online threats.</description>

      <title>ALETHEIA: Combating Social Media Influence Campaigns with Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Influence campaigns are a growing concern in the online spaces. Policymakers, moderators and researchers have taken various routes to fight these campaigns and make online systems safer for regular users. To this end, our paper presents ALETHEIA, a system that formalizes the detection of malicious accounts (or troll accounts) used in such operations and forecasts their behaviors within social media networks. We analyze influence campaigns on Reddit and X from different countries and highlight that detection pipelines built over a graph-based representation of campaigns using a mix of topological and linguistic features offer improvement over standard interaction and user features. ALETHEIA uses state-of-the-art Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for detecting malicious users that can scale to large networks and achieve a 3.7% F1-score improvement over standard classification with interaction features in prior work. Furthermore, ALETHEIA employs a first temporal link prediction mechanism built for influence campaigns by stacking a GNN over a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), which can predict future troll interactions towards other trolls and regular users with an average AUC of 96.6%. ALETHEIA predicts troll-to-troll edges (TTE) and troll-to-user edges (TUE), which can help identify regular users being affected by malicious influence efforts. Overall, our results highlight the importance of utilizing the networked nature of influence operations (i.e., structural information) when predicting and detecting malicious coordinated activity in online spaces.</description>

      <title>Multiconnectivity for SAGIN: Current Trends, Challenges, AI-driven Solutions, and Opportunities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Space-air-ground-integrated network (SAGIN)-enabled multiconnectivity (MC) is emerging as a key enabler for next-generation networks, enabling users to simultaneously utilize multiple links across multi-layer non-terrestrial networks (NTN) and multi-radio access technology (multi-RAT) terrestrial networks (TN). However, the heterogeneity of TN and NTN introduces complex architectural challenges that complicate MC implementation. Specifically, the diversity of link types, spanning air-to-air, air-to-space, space-to-space, space-to-ground, and ground-to-ground communications, renders optimal resource allocation highly complex. Recent advancements in reinforcement learning (RL) and agentic artificial intelligence (AI) have shown remarkable effectiveness in optimal decision-making in complex and dynamic environments. In this paper, we review the current developments in SAGIN-enabled MC and outline the key challenges associated with its implementation. We further highlight the transformative potential of AI-driven approaches for resource optimization in a heterogeneous SAGIN environment. To this end, we present a case study on resource allocation optimization enabled by agentic RL for SAGIN-enabled MC involving diverse radio access technologies (RATs). Results show that learning-based methods can effectively handle complex scenarios and substantially enhance network performance in terms of latency and capacity while incurring a moderate increase in power consumption as an acceptable tradeoff. Finally, open research problems and future directions are presented to realize efficient SAGIN-enabled MC.</description>

      <title>Beyond Content: How Author Network Centrality Drives Citation Disparities in Top AI Conferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While scholarly citations are pivotal for assessing academic impact, they often reflect systemic biases beyond research quality. This study examines a critical yet underexplored driver of citation disparities: authors' structural positions within scientific collaboration networks. Through a large-scale analysis of 17,942 papers from three top-tier machine learning conferences (NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR) published between 2005 and 2024, we quantify the influence of author centrality on citations. Methodologically, we advance the field by employing beta regression to model citation percentiles, which appropriately accounts for the bounded nature of citation data. We also propose a novel centrality metric, Harmonic Closeness with Temporal and Collaboration Count Decay (HCTCD), which incorporates temporal decay and collaboration intensity. Our results robustly demonstrate that long-term centrality exerts a significantly stronger effect on citation percentiles than short-term metrics, with closeness centrality and HCTCD emerging as the most potent predictors. Importantly, team-level centrality aggregation, particularly through exponentially weighted summation, explains citation variance more effectively than conventional rank-based approaches, underscoring the primacy of collective network connectivity over individual prominence. Integrating centrality features into machine learning models yields a 2.4% to 4.8% reduction in prediction error (MSE), confirming their value beyond content-based benchmarks. These findings challenge entrenched evaluation paradigms and advocate for network-aware assessment frameworks to mitigate structural inequities in scientific recognition.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneous fragmentation of empty sites promotes cooperation in phenotypically diverse populations with tag-mediated interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Habitat loss and fragmentation have often been viewed as major threats to species interaction and global biodiversity conservation. However, habitat degradation can also give rise to positive ecological and behavioral responses, challenging the notion that its consequences are entirely detrimental. While controlling for the degree of total habitat loss, we studied the influence of habitat fragmentation and phenotypic diversity on the evolution of tag-based cooperation in structured populations with multiple strategies. We developed a spatially explicit agent-based model with empty sites in which phenotypically diverse artificial decision makers engaged into pairwise Snowdrift-game interactions and imitated strategies of their opponent co-players. We systematically varied the number of phenotypic features in the population, the clustering degree of empty sites unsuitable for habitation, as well as the cost-to-benefit ratio $r$, and we measured the resulting equilibrium densities of conditional and unconditional strategies. Our Monte Carlo simulations revealed a complex interplay between the three investigated factors, such that higher phenotypic diversity in combination with lower $r$ and low to intermediate clustering degrees of empty sites markedly suppressed ethnocentric cooperation but simultaneously boosted unconditional, pure altruism. This dominance of unconditional cooperation was remarkably robust to variation in the initial conditions, suggesting that heterogeneous fragmentation of empty sites in moderately degraded habitats can function as a potent cooperation-promoting mechanism even in the presence of initially more favorable strategies. Our study showcases anti-fragility of cooperators in spatially fragmented but phenotypically diverse populations, as they were also able to benefit from harsh environmental conditions emerging in sparsely connected habitat remnants.</description>

      <title>Certainly Bot Or Not? Trustworthy Social Bot Detection via Robust Multi-Modal Neural Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09626v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Social bot detection is crucial for mitigating misinformation, online manipulation, and coordinated inauthentic behavior. While existing neural network-based detectors perform well on benchmarks, they struggle with generalization due to distribution shifts across datasets and frequently produce overconfident predictions for out-of-distribution accounts beyond the training data. To address this, we introduce a novel Uncertainty Estimation for Social Bot Detection (UESBD) framework, which quantifies the predictive uncertainty of detectors beyond mere classification. For this task, we propose Robust Multi-modal Neural Processes (RMNP), which aims to enhance the robustness of multi-modal neural processes to modality inconsistencies caused by social bot camouflage. RMNP first learns unimodal representations through modality-specific encoders. Then, unimodal attentive neural processes are employed to encode the Gaussian distribution of unimodal latent variables. Furthermore, to avoid social bots stealing human features to camouflage themselves thus causing certain modalities to provide conflictive information, we introduce an evidential gating network to explicitly model the reliability of modalities. The joint latent distribution is learned through the generalized product of experts, which takes the reliability of each modality into consideration during fusion. The final prediction is obtained through Monte Carlo sampling of the joint latent distribution followed by a decoder. Experiments on three real-world benchmarks show the effectiveness of RMNP in classification and uncertainty estimation, as well as its robustness to modality conflicts.</description>
