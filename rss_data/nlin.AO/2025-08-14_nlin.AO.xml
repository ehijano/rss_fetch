      <title>Reinforcement learning in densely recurrent biological networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Training highly recurrent networks in continuous action spaces is a technical challenge: gradient-based methods suffer from exploding or vanishing gradients, while purely evolutionary searches converge slowly in high-dimensional weight spaces. We introduce a hybrid, derivative-free optimization framework that implements reinforcement learning by coupling global evolutionary exploration with local direct search exploitation. The method, termed ENOMAD (Evolutionary Nonlinear Optimization with Mesh Adaptive Direct search), is benchmarked on a suite of food-foraging tasks instantiated in the fully mapped neural connectome of the nematode \emph{Caenorhabditis elegans}. Crucially, ENOMAD leverages biologically derived weight priors, letting it refine--rather than rebuild--the organism's native circuitry. Two algorithmic variants of the method are introduced, which lead to either small distributed adjustments of many weights, or larger changes on a limited number of weights. Both variants significantly exceed the performance of the untrained connectome (in what can be interpreted as an example of transfer learning) and of existing training strategies. These findings demonstrate that integrating evolutionary search with nonlinear optimization provides an efficient, biologically grounded strategy for specializing natural recurrent networks towards a specified set of tasks.</description>

      <title>Time delay as the origin of oscillations in anodic Si electrodissolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09827v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Silicon is the most important semiconductor electrode with applications in photoelectrochemistry and sensor technology. Yet its electrochemistry exhibits many poorly understood phenomena, including oscillations during the anodic dissolution of silicon electrodes.
  In this article, we present a mathematical model based on physicochemical steps that captures these oscillations and enables a thorough understanding of the underlying mechanism. The model describes the formation and dissolution of an oxide layer, and determines the oxide composition and the electrostatic potential in the direction perpendicular to the electrode.
  Oscillations occur if the following conditions are fulfilled:
  1. The etching speed increases with defects in the oxide layer
  2. The number of defects decreases with increasing electric field strength at the Si-oxide interface.
  3. There is a sufficient time delay between the production and the etching of the oxide.
  Numerical simulations reproduce experimental results well, including the dependence of the oscillation amplitude and period on the potential, as well as the hysteresis behavior observed in cyclic voltammetry. Based on these results, we derive a simplified time-delay differential equation model. Using linear stability analysis, we confirm the essential role of the time delay for the oscillatory oxide-layer dynamics. The basic steps of the model are general and in line with the point defect model for growth and dissolution of passive films on metal electrodes. Therefore, it is likely applicable to a variety of oscillating anodic metal or semiconductor dissolution reactions.</description>
