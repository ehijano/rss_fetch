      <title>The Renormalization Group for Large-Scale Structure: Origin of Galaxy Stochasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The renormalization group equations for large-scale structure (RG-LSS) describe how the bias and stochastic (noise) parameters -- both of matter and biased tracers such as galaxies -- evolve as a function of the cutoff $\Lambda$ of the effective field theory. In previous work, we derived the RG-LSS equations for the bias parameters using the Wilson-Polchinski framework. Here, we extend these results to include stochastic contributions, corresponding to terms in the effective action that are higher order in the current $J$. We show that the RG equations exhibit an interesting, previously unnoticed structure at all orders in $J$, which implies that a single nonlinear bias term immediately generates all stochastic moments through RG evolution. We then derive the nonlinear RG evolution of the (leading-derivative) stochastic parameters for all $n$-point functions, and show that this evolution is controlled by a different, lower scale than the nonlinear scale. This has implications for the optimal choice of the renormalization scale when comparing the theory with data to obtain cosmological constraints.</description>

      <title>The galaxy-galaxy strong lensing cross section and the internal distribution of matter in {\Lambda}CDM substructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong gravitational lensing offers a powerful probe of the detailed distribution of matter in lenses, while magnifying and bringing faint background sources into view. Observed strong lensing by massive galaxy clusters, which are often in complex dynamical states, has also been used to map their dark matter substructures on smaller scales. Deep high resolution imaging has revealed the presence of strong lensing events associated with these substructures, namely galaxy-scale sub-halos. However, an inventory of these observed galaxy-galaxy strong lensing (GGSL) events is noted to be discrepant with state-of-the-art {\Lambda}CDM simulations. Cluster sub-halos appear to be over-concentrated compared to their simulated counterparts yielding an order of magnitude higher value of GGSL. In this paper, we explore the possibility of resolving this observed discrepancy by redistributing the mass within observed cluster sub-halos in ways that are consistent within the {\Lambda}CDM paradigm of structure formation. Lensing mass reconstructions from data provide constraints on the mass enclosed within apertures and are agnostic to the detailed mass profile within them. Therefore, as the detailed density profile within cluster sub-halos currently remains unconstrained by data, we are afforded the freedom to redistribute the enclosed mass. We investigate if rearranging the mass to a more centrally concentrated density profile helps alleviate the GGSL discrepancy. We report that refitting cluster sub-halos to the ubiquitous {\Lambda}CDM-motivated Navarro-Frenk-White profile, and further modifying them to include significant baryonic components, does not resolve this tension. A resolution to this persisting GGSL discrepancy may require more careful exploration of alternative dark matter models.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Bounds on Primordial Black Hole as Dark Matter with X-ray Backgroun</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the mass range of $10^{16}-5\times 10^{18}$ g, primordial black holes (PBHs) persist as plausible candidates for dark matter. Our study involves a reassessment of the constraints on PBHs through a comparative analysis of the cosmic X-ray background (CXB) and the emissions arising from their Hawking evaporation. We identify previously overlooked radiation processes across the relevant energy bands, potentially refining the bounds on PBHs. These processes encompass the direct emission from Hawking radiation, in-flight annihilation, the final state of radiation, and positronium annihilation. Thorough consideration is given to all these processes and their respective emission fractions, followed by a precise calculation of the $\mathcal{D}$ factor for observations directed towards the high-latitude Galactic contribution. Furthermore, we integrate the flux originating from extragalactic sources, both of which contribute to the measured isotropic flux. Through a comparative analysis of data derived from previous CXB observations utilizing an Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) double power-law model, we establish the most stringent constraints for PBHs, thereby excluding the possibility of PBHs constituting the entire dark matter mass within the range of $2.5\times 10^{17}-3 \times 10^{17} $g.</description>

      <title>Improving flux ratio anomaly precision by measuring gravitational lens multipole moments with extended arcs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a strong gravitational lens, perturbations by low-mass dark matter halos can be detected by differences between the measured image fluxes relative to the expectation from a smooth model for the mass distribution which contains only the gravitational effects of the main deflector. The abundance of these low-mass structures can be used to constrain the properties of dark matter. Traditionally only the lensed quasar positions have been to predict the smooth-model flux ratios. We demonstrate that significant additional information can be gained by using the lensed quasar host galaxy which appears as an extended arc and constrains the smooth-model over a much larger angular area. We simulate Hubble Space Telescope-quality mock observations based on the lensing system WGD2038-4008 and we compare the model-predicted flux ratio precision and accuracy for two cases; one of which the inference is based only on the lensed quasar image positions, and the other based on the extended arcs as well as lensed quasar image positions. For our mock lens systems we include both elliptical, and higher order m=3 and m=4 multipole terms in the smooth-mass distributions with amplitudes based on the optically measured shapes of massive elliptical galaxies. We find that the extended arcs improve the precision of the model-predicted flux ratios by a factor of 6-8, depending on the strength of the multipole terms. Furthermore, with the extended arcs, we are also able to accurately recover the m=3, 4 mass multipole strengths and angles $a_3/a$, $a_4/a$, $\phi_3-\phi_0$, and $\phi_4-\phi_0$ to a precision of 0.002, 0.002, $3^\circ$ and $3^\circ$, respectively. This work implies that lensed arcs can constrain deviations from ellipticity in strong lens systems, and potentially lead to more robust constraints on substructure properties from flux ratios.</description>

      <title>Cosmology-independent Photon Mass Limits from Localized Fast Radio Bursts by using Artificial Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A hypothetical photon mass, $m_{\gamma}$, can produce a frequency-dependent vacuum dispersion of light, which leads to an additional time delay between photons with different frequencies when they propagate through a fixed distance. The dispersion measure--redshift measurements of fast radio bursts (FRBs) have been widely used to constrain the rest mass of the photon. However, all current studies analyzed the effect of the frequency-dependent dispersion for massive photons in the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmological context. In order to alleviate the circularity problem induced by the presumption of a specific cosmological model based on the fundamental postulate of the masslessness of photons, here we employ a new model-independent smoothing technique, Artificial Neural Network (ANN), to reconstruct the Hubble parameter $H(z)$ function from 34 cosmic-chronometer measurements. By combining observations of 32 well-localized FRBs and the $H(z)$ function reconstructed by ANN, we obtain an upper limit of $m_{\gamma} \le 3.5 \times 10^{-51}\;\rm{kg}$, or equivalently $m_{\gamma} \le 2.0 \times 10^{-15}\;\rm{eV/c^2}$ ($m_{\gamma} \le 6.5 \times 10^{-51}\;\rm{kg}$, or equivalently $m_{\gamma} \le 3.6 \times 10^{-15}\;\rm{eV/c^2}$) at the $1\sigma$ ($2\sigma$) confidence level. This is the first cosmology-independent photon mass limit derived from extragalactic sources.</description>

      <title>From infinite to infinitesimal: Using the Universe as a dataset to probe Casimir corrections to the vacuum energy from fields inhabiting the dark dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Promptly after high-resolution experiments harbinger the field of precision cosmology low- and high-redshift observations abruptly gave rise to a tension in the measurement of the present-day expansion rate of the Universe ($H_0$) and the clustering of matter ($S_8$). The statistically significant discrepancies between the locally measured values of $H_0$ and $S_8$ and the ones inferred from observations of the cosmic microwave background assuming the canonical $\Lambda$ cold dark matter (CDM) cosmological model have become a new cornerstone of theoretical physics. $\Lambda_s$CDM is one of the many beyond Standard Model setups that have been proposed to simultaneously resolve the cosmological tensions. This setup relies on an empirical conjecture, which postulates that $\Lambda$ switched sign (from negative to positive) at a critical redshift $z_c \sim 2$. We reexamine a stringy model that can describe the transition in the vacuum energy hypothesized in $\Lambda_s$CDM. The model makes use of the Casimir forces driven by fields inhabiting the incredible bulk of the dark dimension scenario. Unlike the $\Lambda_s$CDM setup the model deviates from $\Lambda$CDM in the early universe due to the existence of relativistic neutrino-like species. Using the Boltzmann solver CLASS in combination with MontePython we confront predictions of the stringy model to experimental data (from the Planck mission, Pantheon+ supernova type Ia, BAO, and KiDS-1000). We show that the string-inspired model provides a satisfactory fit to the data and can resolve the cosmological tensions.</description>

      <title>The SRG/eROSITA All-Sky Survey: Exploring halo assembly bias with X-ray selected superclusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore halo assembly bias on cluster scales using large samples of superclusters. Leveraging the largest-ever X-ray galaxy cluster and supercluster samples obtained from the first SRG/eROSITA all-sky survey, we construct two subsamples of galaxy clusters which consist of supercluster members (SC) and isolated clusters (ISO) respectively. After correcting the selection effects on redshift, mass, and survey depth, we compute the excess in the concentration of the intracluster gas of isolated clusters with respect to supercluster members, defined as $\delta c_{\rm gas} \equiv c_{\rm gas,ISO}/c_{\rm gas,SC}-1$, to investigate the environmental effect on the concentration of clusters, an inference of halo assembly bias on cluster scales. We find that the average gas mass concentration of isolated clusters is a few percent higher than that of supercluster members, with a significance of $2\sigma$. The result on $\delta c_{\rm gas}$ varies with the overdensity ratio $f$ in supercluster identification, cluster mass proxies, and mass ranges, but remains positive in all the measurements. We measure slightly larger $\delta c_{\rm gas}$ when adopting a higher $f$ in supercluster identification. $\delta c_{\rm gas}$ is also larger for low-mass clusters, and almost negligible for high-mass clusters. We perform weak lensing analyses to compare the total mass concentration of the two classes and find a similar trend as obtained from gas mass concentration. Our results are consistent with the prediction of HAB on cluster scales, where halos located in denser environments are less concentrated, and this trend is stronger for low-mass halos than for massive halos. These phenomena can be interpreted by the fact that clusters in denser environments such as superclusters have experienced more mergers than isolated clusters in their assembling history.</description>

      <title>Probing intergalactic intergalactic magnetic fields with LOFAR LoTSS DR2 data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use Faraday rotation measurements from the latest catalog LoTSS DR2 from LOFAR to probe intergalactic magnetic fields. To identify the extragalactic component of the observed rotation measure (RM) we use two different techniques: residual rotation measure (RRM) and close radio pairs. For the RRM approach, we conclude that, despite smaller measurement errors in the LOFAR data, robust and conservative treatment of the systematic uncertainties in the Galactic contribution to RM results in the constraint on a homogeneous volume-filling magnetic field at the level 2.4 nG, slightly weaker than previous constraints from NVSS data, and does not allow to probe the presence of over-magnetized bubbles predicted by the AGN feedback model of the IllustrisTNG. Analyzing close radio pairs we found that in only 0.5% of our mock realizations of observed data, the expected contribution from the over-magnetized bubbles does not exceed LoTSS DR2 data.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity-Improved Polarization Maps at 40 GHz with CLASS and WMAP data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Improved polarization measurements at frequencies below 70 GHz with degree-level angular resolution are crucial for advancing our understanding of the Galactic synchrotron radiation and the potential polarized anomalous microwave emission and ultimately benefiting the detection of primordial $B$ modes. In this study, we present sensitivity-improved 40 GHz polarization maps obtained by combining the CLASS 40 GHz and WMAP $Q$-band data through a weighted average in the harmonic domain. The decision to include WMAP $Q$-band data stems from similarities in the bandpasses. Leveraging the accurate large-scale measurements from WMAP $Q$ band and the high-sensitivity information from CLASS 40 GHz band at intermediate scales, the noise level at $\ell\in[30, 100]$ is reduced by a factor of $2-3$ in the map space. A pixel domain analysis of the polarized synchrotron spectral index ($\beta_s$) using WMAP $K$ band and the combined maps (mean and 16/84th percentile across the $\beta_s$ map: $-3.08_{-0.20}^{+0.20}$) reveals a stronger preference for spatial variation (PTE for a uniform $\beta_s$ hypothesis smaller than 0.001) than the results obtained using WMAP $K$ and $Ka$ bands ($-3.08_{-0.14}^{+0.14}$). The cross-power spectra of the combined maps follow the same trend as other low-frequency data, and validation through simulations indicates negligible bias introduced by the combination method (sub-percent level in the power spectra). The products of this work are publicly available on $\mathtt{LAMBDA}$.</description>

      <title>The Open Effective Field Theory of Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In our quest to understand the generation of cosmological perturbations, we face two serious obstacles: we do not have direct information about the environment experienced by primordial perturbations during inflation, and our observables are practically limited to correlators of massless fields, heavier fields and derivatives decaying exponentially in the number of e-foldings. The flexible and general framework of open systems has been developed precisely to face similar challenges. Building on previous work, we develop a Schwinger-Keldysh path integral description for an open effective field theory of inflation, describing the possibly dissipative and non-unitary evolution of the Goldstone boson of time translations interacting with an unspecified environment, under the key assumption of locality in space and time. Working in the decoupling limit, we study the linear and interacting theory in de Sitter and derive predictions for the power spectrum and bispectrum that depend on a finite number of effective couplings organised in a derivative expansion. The smoking gun of interactions with the environment is an enhanced but finite bispectrum close to the folded kinematical limit. We demonstrate the generality of our approach by matching our open effective theory to an explicit model. Our construction provides a standard model to simultaneously study phenomenological predictions as well as quantum information aspects of the inflationary dynamics.</description>

      <title>Type-I two-Higgs-doublet model and gravitational waves from domain walls bounded by strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spontaneous breaking of a $U(1)$ symmetry via an intermediate discrete symmetry may yield a hybrid topological defect of "domain walls bounded by cosmic strings". The decay of this defect network leads to a unique gravitational wave signal spanning many orders in observable frequencies, that can be distinguished from signals generated by other sources. We investigate the production of gravitational waves from this mechanism in the context of the type-I two-Higgs-doublet model extended by a $U(1)_R$ symmetry, that simultaneously accommodates the seesaw mechanism, anomaly cancellation, and eliminates flavour-changing neutral currents. The gravitational wave spectrum produced by the string-bounded-wall network can be detected for $U(1)_R$ breaking scale from $10^{12}$ to $10^{15}$ GeV in forthcoming interferometers including LISA and Einstein Telescope, with a distinctive $f^{3}$ slope and inflexion in the frequency range between microhertz and hertz.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave signatures of post-fragmentation reheating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: After cosmic inflation, coherent oscillations of the inflaton field about a monomial potential $V(\phi)\sim \phi^k$ result in an expansion phase characterized by a stiff equation-of-state $w\simeq(k-2)/(k+2)$. Sourced by the oscillating inflaton condensate, parametric (self)resonant effects can induce the exponential growth of inhomogeneities eventually backreacting and leading to the fragmentation of the condensate. In this work, we investigate realizations of inflation giving rise to such dynamics, assuming an inflaton weakly coupled to its decay products. As a result, the transition to a radiation-dominated universe, i.e. reheating, occurs after fragmentation. We estimate the consequences on the production of gravitational waves by computing the contribution induced by the stiff equation-of-state era in addition to the signal generated by the fragmentation process for $k=4,6,8,10$. Our results are independent of the reheating temperature provided that reheating is achieved posterior to fragmentation. Our work shows that the dynamics of such weakly-coupled inflaton scenario can actually result in characteristic gravitational wave spectra with frequencies from Hz to GHz, in the reach of future gravitational wave observatories, in addition to the complementarity between upcoming detectors in discriminating (post)inflation scenarios. We advocate the need of developing high-frequency gravitational wave detectors to gain insight into the dynamics of inflation and reheating.</description>

      <title>Dirac leptogenesis from asymmetry wash-in via scatterings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Leptogenesis typically requires the introduction of heavy particles whose out-of-equilibrium decays are essential for generating a matter-antimatter asymmetry, according to one of Sakharov's conditions. We demonstrate that in Dirac leptogenesis, scatterings between the light degrees of freedom - Standard Model particles plus Dirac neutrinos - are sufficient to generate the asymmetry. Due to its vanishing source term in the Boltzmann equations, the asymmetry of right-handed neutrinos solely arises through wash-in processes. Sakharov's conditions are satisfied because the right-handed neutrino partners are out of equilibrium. Consequently, heavy degrees of freedom never needed to be produced in the early universe, allowing for a reheating temperature well below their mass scale. Considering a minimal leptoquark model, we discuss the viable parameter space along with the observational signature of an increased number of effective neutrinos in the early universe.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the effective four-dimensional dynamics of the extra-dimensional moduli fields in curved braneworlds having nested warping, with particular emphasis on the doubly warped model which is interesting in the light of current collider constraints on the mass of the Kaluza-Klein graviton. The presence of a non-zero brane cosmological constant ($\Omega$) naturally induces an effective moduli potential in the four-dimensional action, which shows distinct features in dS ($\Omega&gt;0$) and AdS ($\Omega&lt;0$) branches. For the observationally interesting case of dS 4-branes, a metastable minimum in the potential arises along the first modulus, with no minima along the higher moduli. The underlying nested geometry also leads to interesting separable forms of the non-canonical kinetic terms in the Einstein frame, where the brane curvature directly impacts the kinetic properties of only the first modulus. We subsequently explore the ability of curved multiply warped geometries to drive inflation with an in-built exit mechanism, by assuming predominant slow roll along each modular direction on a case-by-case basis. We find slow roll on top of the metastable plateau along the first modular direction to be the most viable scenario, with the higher-dimensional moduli parametrically tuning the height of the potential without significant impact on the inflationary observables. On the other hand, while slow roll along the higher moduli can successfully inflate the background and eventually lead to an exit, consistency with observations seemingly requires unphysical hierarchies among the extra-dimensional radii, thus disfavouring such scenarios.</description>

      <title>Lens Stochastic Diffraction: A Signature of Compact Structures in Gravitational-Wave Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Every signal propagating through the universe is diffracted by the gravitational fields of intervening objects, aka gravitational lenses. Diffraction is most efficient when caused by compact lenses, which invariably produce additional images of a source. The signals associated with additional images are generically faint, but their collective effect may be detectable with coherent sources, such as gravitational waves (GWs), where both amplitude and phase are measured. Here, I describe lens stochastic diffraction (LSD): Poisson-distributed fluctuations after GW events caused by compact lenses. The amplitude and temporal distribution of these signals encode crucial information about the mass and abundance of compact lenses. Through the collective stochastic signal, LSD offers an order-of-magnitude improvement over single lens analysis for objects with mass $\gtrsim 10^3 M_\odot$. This gain can improve limits on compact dark-matter halos and allows next-generation instruments to detect supermassive black holes, given the abundance inferred from quasar luminosity studies.</description>

      <title>An Online Framework for Fitting Fast Transient Lightcurves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The identification of extragalactic fast optical transients (eFOTs) as potential multi-messenger sources is one of the main challenges in time-domain astronomy. However, recent developments have allowed for probes of rapidly-evolving transients. With the increasing number of alert streams from optical time-domain surveys, the next paradigm is building technologies to rapidly identify the most interesting transients for follow-up. One effort to make this possible is the fitting of objects to a variety of eFOT lightcurve models such as kilonovae and $\gamma$-ray burst (GRB) afterglows. In this work, we describe a new framework designed to efficiently fit transients to light curve models and flag them for further follow-up. We describe the pipeline's workflow and a handful of performance metrics, including the nominal sampling time for each model. We highlight as examples ZTF20abwysqy, the shortest long gamma ray burst discovered to date, and ZTF21abotose, a core-collapse supernova initially identified as a potential kilonova candidate.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Background Interpretation of Pulsar Timing Array Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.02399v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the interpretation of the detected signal by Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) observations as a gravitational wave background (GWB) of cosmological origin. We combine NANOGrav 15-years and EPTA-DR2new data sets and confront them against backgrounds from supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs), and cosmological signals from inflation, cosmic (super)strings, first-order phase transitions, Gaussian and non-Gaussian large scalar fluctuations, and audible axions. We find that scalar-induced, and to a lesser extent audible axion and cosmic superstring signals, provide a better fit than SMBHBs. These results depend, however, on modeling assumptions, so further data and analysis are needed to reach robust conclusions. Independently of the signal origin, the data strongly constrain the parameter space of cosmological signals, for example, setting an upper bound on primordial non-Gaussianity at PTA scales as $|f_{nl}| \lesssim 2.34$ at 95% CL.</description>

      <title>Tip of the Red Giant Branch Distances with JWST: An Absolute Calibration in NGC 4258 and First Applications to Type Ia Supernova Hosts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04776v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) allows for the measurement of precise and accurate distances to nearby galaxies, based on the brightest ascent of low-mass red giant branch stars before they undergo the helium flash. With the advent of JWST, there is great promise to utilize the technique to measure galaxy distances out to at least 50 Mpc, significantly further than HST's reach of 20 Mpc. However, with any standard candle, it is first necessary to provide an absolute reference. Here we use Cycle 1 data to provide an absolute calibration in the F090W filter. F090W is most similar to the F814W filter commonly used for TRGB measurements with HST, which had been adopted by the community due to minimal dependence from the underlying metallicities and ages of stars. The imaging we use was taken in the outskirts of NGC 4258, which has a direct geometrical distance measurement from the Keplerian motion of its water megamaser. Utilizing several measurement techniques, we find $M_{TRGB}^{F090W}$ = -4.362 $\pm$ 0.033 (stat) $\pm$ 0.045 (sys) mag (Vega) for the metal-poor TRGB. We also perform measurements of the TRGB in two Type Ia supernova hosts, NGC 1559, and NGC 5584. We find good agreement between our TRGB distances and previous distance determinations to these galaxies from Cepheids ($\Delta$ = 0.01 $\pm$ 0.06 mag), with these differences being too small to explain the Hubble tension ($\sim$0.17 mag). As a final bonus, we showcase the serendipitous discovery of a faint dwarf galaxy near NGC 5584.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing the recombination history by combining early and late cosmological probes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05715v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop and apply a new framework for reconstructing the ionization history during the epoch of recombination with combinations of cosmic microwave background (CMB), baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) and supernova data. We find a wide range of ionization histories that are consistent with current CMB data, and also that cosmological parameter constraints are significantly weakened once freedom in recombination is introduced. BAO data partially break the degeneracy between cosmological parameters and the recombination model, and are therefore important in these reconstructions. The 95% confidence upper limits on H0 are 80.1 (70.7) km/s/Mpc given CMB (CMB+BAO) data, assuming no other changes are made to the standard cosmological model. Including Cepheid-calibrated supernova data in the analysis drives a preference for non-standard recombination histories with visibility functions that peak early and exhibit appreciable skewness. Forthcoming measurements from SPT-3G will reduce the uncertainties in our reconstructions by about a factor of two.</description>

      <title>Quintessential interpretation of the evolving dark energy in light of DESI</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05722v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent result of Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) in combination with other cosmological data shows evidence of the evolving dark energy parameterized by $w_0w_a$CDM model. We interpret this result in terms of a quintessential scalar field and demonstrate that it can explain the DESI result even though it becomes eventually phantom in the past. Relaxing the assumption on the functional form of the equation-of-state parameter $w=w(a)$, we also discuss a more realistic quintessential model. The implications of the DESI result for Swampland conjectures, cosmic birefringence, and the fate of the Universe are discussed as well.</description>

      <title>New perspectives on future rip scenarios with holographic dark energy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08912v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the asymptotic future evolution of holographic dark energy (HDE) models, in which the density of the dark energy is a function of a cutoff scale $L$. We develop a general methodology to determine which models correspond to future big rip, little rip, and pseudo-rip (de Sitter) evolution, and we apply this methodology to a variety of well-studied HDE models. None of these HDE models display little rip evolution, and we are able to show, under very general assumptions, that HDE models with a Granda-Oliveros cutoff almost never evolve toward a future little rip. We extend these results to HDE models with nonstandard Friedman equations and show that a similar conclusion applies: little rip evolution is a very special case that is almost never realized in such models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.13061v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Predictivity of many non-thermal dark matter (DM) models is marred by the gravitational production background. This problem is ameliorated in models with lower reheating temperature $T_R$, which allows for dilution of gravitationally produced relics. We study the freeze-in dark matter production mechanism in the thermal bath with the electroweak scale temperature. The process is Boltzmann-suppressed if the dark matter mass is above $T_R$. In this case, the coupling to the thermal bath has to be significant to account for the observed dark matter relic density. As a result, the direct DM detection experiments already probe such freeze-in models, excluding significant parts of parameter space. The forthcoming experiments will explore this framework further, extending to lower couplings and higher reheating temperatures.</description>

      <title>Primordial black hole formation from a nonspherical density profile with a misaligned deformation tensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11147v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform the numerical simulation of primordial black hole formation from a nonspherical profile of the initial curvature perturbation $\zeta$. We consider the background expanding universe filled with the perfect fluid with the linear equation of state $p=w\rho$ ($w=1/3$ or $1/5$), where $p$ and $\rho$ are the pressure and the energy density, respectively. The initial condition is set in a way such that the principal directions of the second derivatives of $\zeta$ and $\triangle \zeta$ at the central peak are misaligned, where $\triangle$ is the Laplacian. In this setting, since the linearized density is proportional to $\triangle \zeta$, the inertia tensor and deformation tensor $\partial_i\partial_j \zeta$ are misaligned. Thus tidal torque may act and the spin of a resultant primordial black hole would be non-zero in general, although it is estimated to be very small from previous perturbative analyses. As a result, we do not find a finite value of the spin within our numerical precision, giving support for the negligibly small value of the black hole spin for $1/5\lesssim w \lesssim 1/3$. More specifically, our results suggest that the dimensionless PBH spin $s$ is typically so small that $s\ll0.1$ for $w\gtrsim0.2$.</description>

      <title>Exploring Supermassive Compact Dark Matter with the Millilensing Effect of Gamma-Ray Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11053v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational lensing effect is one of most significant observational probes to investigate compact dark matter/objects over a wide mass range. In this work, we first propose to derive the population information and the abundance of supermassive compact dark matter in the mass range $\sim10^5-10^7~M_{\odot}$ from 6 millilensed gamma-ray burst (GRB) candidates in 3000 Fermi GRB events using the hierarchical Bayesian inference method. We obtain that, for the mass range $\sim10^5-10^7~M_{\odot}$, the abundance of supermassive compact dark matter is $f_{\rm CO}=10^{-1.60}$ in the log-normal mass distribution scenario. This result is in obvious tension with some other observational constraints, e.g. ultra-faint dwarfs and dynamical friction. However, it also was argued that there is only one system in these 6 candidates has been identified as lensed GRB event with fairly high confidence. In this case, the tension would be significantly alleviated. Therefore, it would be an interesting clue for both the millilensed GRB identification and the formation mechanism of supermassive compact dark matter.</description>
