      <title>Pulmonary electrical impedance tomography based on deep recurrent neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) is a non-invasive functional imaging technology. In order to enhance the quality of lung EIT images, novel algorithms, namely LSTM-LSTM, LSTM-BiLSTM, BiLSTM-LSTM, and BiLSTM-BiLSTM, leveraging LSTM or BiLSTM networks, were developed. Simulation results demonstrate that the optimized deep recurrent neural network significantly enhanced the quality of the reconstructed images. Specifically, the correlation coefficients of the LSTM-LSTM and the LSTM-BiLSTM algorithms exhibited maximum increases of 27.5% and 25.4% over the LSTM algorithm, respectively. Moreover, in comparison to the BiLSTM algorithm, the correlation coefficients of the BiLSTM-LSTM and BiLSTM-BiLSTM algorithms increased by 11.7% and 13.4%, respectively. Overall, the quality of EIT images showed notable enhancement. This research offers a valuable approach for enhancing EIT image quality and presents a novel application of LSTM networks in EIT technology.</description>

      <title>Path sampling challenges in large biomolecular systems: RETIS and REPPTIS for ABL-imatinib kinetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting the kinetics of drug-protein interactions is crucial for understanding drug efficacy, particularly in personalized medicine, where protein mutations can significantly alter drug residence times. This study applies Replica Exchange Transition Interface Sampling (RETIS) and its Partial Path variant (REPPTIS) to investigate the dissociation kinetics of imatinib from Abelson nonreceptor tyrosine kinase (ABL) and mutants relevant to chronic myeloid leukemia therapy. These path-sampling methods offer a bias-free alternative to conventional approaches requiring qualitative predefined reaction coordinates. Nevertheless, the complex free-energy landscape of ABL-imatinib dissociation presents significant challenges. Multiple metastable states and orthogonal barriers lead to parallel unbinding pathways, complicating convergence in TIS-based methods. Despite employing computational efficiency strategies such as asynchronous replica exchange, full convergence remained elusive. This work provides a critical assessment of path sampling in high-dimensional biological systems, discussing the need for enhanced initialization strategies, advanced Monte Carlo path generation moves, and machine learning-derived reaction coordinates to improve kinetic predictions of drug dissociation with minimal prior knowledge.</description>

      <title>Maximum Entropy Production Principle of Thermodynamics for the Birth and Evolution of Life</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Research on the birth and evolution of life are reviewed with reference to the maximum entropy production principle (MEPP). It has been shown that this principle is essential for consistent understanding of the birth and evolution of life. First, a recent work for the birth of a self-replicative system as pre-RNA life is reviewed in relation to the MEPP. A critical condition of polymer concentration in a local system is reported by a dynamical system approach, above which, an exponential increase of entropy production is guaranteed. Secondly, research works of early stage of evolutions are reviewed; experimental research for the numbers of cells necessary for forming a multi-cellular organization, and numerical research of differentiation of a model system and its relation with MEPP. It is suggested by this review article that the late stage of evolution is characterized by formation of society and external entropy production. A hypothesis on the general route of evolution is discussed from the birth to the present life which follows the MEPP. Some examples of life which happened to face poor thermodynamic condition are presented with thermodynamic discussion. It is observed through this review that MEPP is consistently useful for thermodynamic understanding of birth and evolution of life, subject to a thermodynamic condition far from equilibrium.</description>

      <title>The Effect of Hydration and Dynamics on the Mass Density of Single Proteins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The density of a protein molecule is a key property within a variety of experimental techniques. We present a computational method for determining protein mass density that explicitly incorporates hydration effects. Our approach uses molecular dynamics simulations to quantify the volume of solvent excluded by a protein. Applied to a dataset of 260 soluble proteins, this yields an average density of 1.296 g cm-3, notably lower than the widely cited value of 1.35 g cm-3. Contrary to previous suggestions, we find no correlation between protein density and molecular weight. We instead find correlations with residue composition, particularly with hydrophobic amino acid content. Using these correlations, we train a regressor capable of accurately predicting protein density from sequence-derived features alone. Examining the effect of incorporating water molecules on the measured density, we find that water molecules buried in internal cavities have a negligible effect, whereas those at the surface have a profound impact. Furthermore, by calculating the density of a titin domain and of the Bovine Pancreatic Trypsin over molecular dynamics trajectories, we show that individual proteins can occupy states with close but distinguishable densities. Finally, we analyse the density of water in the vicinity of proteins, showing that the first two hydration shells exhibit higher density than bulk water. When included in cumulative density calculations, these hydration layers contribute to a net increase in local solvent density. Overall, we find that proteins are less dense than previously reported, which is offset by their ability to induce a higher density of water in their vicinity.</description>

      <title>Extended mean-field theories for networks of real neurons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If the behavior of a system with many degrees of freedom can be captured by a small number of collective variables, then plausibly there is an underlying mean-field theory. We show that simple versions of this idea fail to describe the patterns of activity in networks of real neurons. An extended mean-field theory that matches the distribution of collective variables is at least consistent, though shows signs that these networks are poised near a critical point, in agreement with other observations. These results suggest a path to analysis of emerging data on ever larger numbers of neurons.</description>

      <title>Impulsive pattern recognition of a myoelectric hand via Dynamic Time Warping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although myoelectric prosthetic hands provide amputees with intuitive control, their reliance on many EMG sensors limits accessibility and makes them complex and expensive. To address this problem, this work presents a different perspective that makes use of a single EMG sensor and brief impulse signals in conjunction with Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) for accurate pattern detection. Conventional techniques rely on real-time data from multiple sensors, which can be costly and bulky. The method presents high accuracy while lowering hardware complexity and expense. A DTW-based system that reliably identifies muscle activation patterns from short EMG signals was created and tested. Results show that this single-sensor approach obtained an accuracy rate of 92%, which is similar to that of conventional multi-sensor systems. This research provides a more straightforward and economical approach that can be used to obtain enhanced myoelectric control. These findings provide a different perspective on more easily accessible and user-friendly prosthetic devices, which will be especially helpful in disaster-affected areas where quick deployment is essential. Future improvements would investigate this system's dependability over time and wider implementations in real situations, to take prosthetic technology one step further.</description>

      <title>Continuous and discrete compartmental models for infectious disease</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of infectious disease propagation is essential for understanding and controlling epidemics. One of the most useful tools for gaining insights into the spread of infectious diseases is mathematical modelling. In terms of mathematical epidemiology, the main models are based on compartments, such as SI, SIR, and SEIR. These models offer mathematical frameworks for representing the proliferation dynamics of various diseases, for instance flu and smallpox. In this work, we explore these models using two distinct mathematical approaches, Cellular Automata (CA) and ODEs. They are able to reproduce the spread dynamics of diseases with their own individuality. CA models incorporate the local interaction among individuals with discrete time and space, while ODEs provide a continuous and simplified view of a disease propagation in large and homogeneous populations. By comparing these two approaches, we find that the shape of the curves of all models is similar for both representations. Although, the growth rates differ between CA and ODE. One of our results is to show that the CA yields a power-law growth, while the ODE growth rate is well-represented by an exponential function. Furthermore, a substantial contribution of our work is using a hyperbolic tangent to fit the initial growth of infected individuals for all the considered models. Our results display a strong correlation between simulated data and adjusted function. We mainly address this successful result by the fact that the hyperbolic function captures both growing: the power-law (when considered the first terms of infinite sums) and combinations of exponential (when the hyperbolic function is written via exponential). Therefore, our work shows that when modelling a disease the choice of mathematical representation is crucial, in particular to model the onset of an
  epidemic.</description>

      <title>Bacteria exploit torque-induced buckling instability for flagellar wrapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in microscopy techniques has uncovered unique aspects of flagella-driven motility in bacteria. A remarkable example is the discovery of flagellar wrapping, a phenomenon whereby a bacterium wraps its flagellum (or flagellar bundle) around its cell body and propels itself like a corkscrew, enabling locomotion in highly viscous or confined environments. For certain bacterial species, this flagellar-wrapping mode is crucial for establishing selective symbiotic relationships with their hosts. The transformation of a flagellum from an extended to a folded (wrapped) state is triggered by a buckling instability driven by the motor-generated torque that unwinds the helical filament. This study investigated this biologically inspired, novel buckling mechanism through a combination of macroscale physical experiments, numerical simulations, and scaling theory to reveal its underlying physical principles. Excellent quantitative agreement between experiments and numerical results showed that long-range hydrodynamic interactions (HIs) are essential for accurate quantitative descriptions of the geometrically nonlinear deformation of the helical filament during wrapping. By systematically analyzing extensive experimental and numerical data, we constructed a stability diagram that rationalized the stability boundary through an elastohydrodynamic scaling analysis. Leveraging the scaling nature of this study, we compared our physical results with available biological data and demonstrated that bacteria exploit motor-induced buckling instability to initiate their flagellar wrapping. Our findings indicate that this mechanically-driven process is essential to bacterial-wrapping motility and consequently, plays a critical role in symbiosis and infection.</description>

      <title>Multifractional Brownian motion with telegraphic, stochastically varying exponent</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The diversity of diffusive systems exhibiting long-range correlations characterized by a stochastically varying Hurst exponent calls for a generic multifractional model. We present a simple, analytically tractable model which fills the gap between mathematical formulations of multifractional Brownian motion and empirical studies. In our model, called telegraphic multifractional Brownian motion, the Hurst exponent is modelled by a smoothed telegraph process which results in a stationary beta distribution of exponents as observed in biological experiments. We also provide a methodology to identify our model in experimental data and present concrete examples from biology, climate and finance to demonstrate the efficacy of our approach.</description>

Abstract: In this work we show how a network inspired by a coarse-grained description of actomyosin cytoskeleton can learn - in a contrastive learning framework - from environmental perturbations if it is endowed with mechanosensitive proteins and motors. Our work is a proof of principle for how force-sensitive proteins and molecular motors can form the basis of a general strategy to learn in biological systems. Our work identifies a minimal biologically plausible learning mechanism and also explores its implications for commonly occuring phenomenolgy such as adaptation and homeostatis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02944v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Growth in bacterial populations generally depends on the environment (availability and quality of nutrients, presence of a toxic inhibitor, product inhibition..). Here, we build a general model to describe the action of a bacteriostatic antibiotic, assuming that this drug inhibits essential autocatalytic cycles involved in the cell metabolism. The model can describe various types of antibiotics and confirms the existence of two distinct regimes of growth-dependent susceptibility, previously identified only for ribosome targeting antibiotics. Interestingly, below a certain threshold, a coexistence of two values of the growth rate is possible, which has also been observed experimentally.</description>

      <title>Effective single particle theory for active particles using local density fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.02247v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We characterize the dynamic non-equilibrium steady state behavior of active particles using density fluctuations in the system. We analyze the effective local density around a particle in the steady state and numerically calculate its mean, variance and autocorrelation. Thus, using local density and its statistical properties as a temporally correlated stochastic variable, we develop an effective single-particle theoretical model and analytically derive an expression for the particle's diffusivity as a function of the global packing density in the system. Our theory accurately predicts the transport properties of an active particle, validated against numerical simulations. Unlike mean-field theory, which fails at high packing densities due to significant density fluctuations from dynamic cluster formation, our model remains effective across all densities. It also captures the well-known phase transition beyond a critical packing density. The key novelty of our model lies in the introduction of a stochastic local density field, which encapsulates the effect of steric interactions on an active particle and helps predict single-particle behavior in a collection, a feature often absent in standard active matter models. This approach could be useful in experimental setups where fluctuations in local density around a tagged particle are measurable.</description>

      <title>SynLlama: Generating Synthesizable Molecules and Their Analogs with Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12602v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative machine learning models for small molecule drug discovery have shown immense promise, but many molecules they generate are too difficult to synthesize, making them impractical for further investigation or development. In this work, we present a novel approach by fine-tuning Meta's Llama3 Large Language Models (LLMs) to create SynLlama, which generates full synthetic pathways made of commonly accessible building blocks and robust organic reaction templates. SynLlama explores a large synthesizable space using significantly less data compared to other state-of-the-art methods, and offers strong performance in bottom-up synthesis, synthesizable analog generation, and hit expansion, offering medicinal chemists a valuable tool for drug discovery developments. We find that SynLlama, even without training on external building blocks, can effectively generalize to unseen yet purchasable building blocks, meaning that its reconstruction capabilities extend to a broader synthesizable chemical space than the training data. We also demonstrate the use of SynLlama in a pharmaceutical context for synthesis planning of analog molecules and hit expansion leads for proposed inhibitors of target proteins.</description>

      <title>Mechanical Characterization of Brain Tissue: Experimental Techniques, Human Testing Considerations, and Perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12346v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the mechanical behavior of brain tissue is crucial for advancing both fundamental neuroscience and clinical applications. Yet, accurately measuring these properties remains challenging due to the brain unique mechanical attributes and complex anatomical structures. This review provides a comprehensive overview of commonly used techniques for characterizing brain tissue mechanical properties, covering both invasive methods such as atomic force microscopy, indentation, axial mechanical testing, and oscillatory shear testing and noninvasive approaches like magnetic resonance elastography and ultrasound elastography. Each technique is evaluated in terms of working principles, applicability, representative studies, and experimental limitations. We further summarize existing publications that have used these techniques to measure human brain tissue mechanical properties. With a primary focus on invasive studies, we systematically compare their sample preparation, testing conditions, reported mechanical parameters, and modeling strategies. Key sensitivity factors influencing testing outcomes (e.g., sample size, anatomical location, strain rate, temperature, conditioning, and post-mortem interval) are also discussed. Additionally, selected noninvasive studies are reviewed to assess their potential for in vivo characterization. A comparative discussion between invasive and noninvasive methods, as well as in vivo versus ex vivo testing, is included. This review aims to offer practical guidance for researchers and clinicians in selecting appropriate mechanical testing approaches and contributes a curated dataset to support constitutive modeling of human brain tissue.</description>
