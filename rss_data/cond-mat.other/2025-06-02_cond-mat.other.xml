      <title>Cryogenic scanning photocurrent spectroscopy for materials responses to structured optical fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Circular dichroism spectroscopy is known to provide important insights into the interplay of different degrees of freedom in quantum materials, and yet spectroscopic study of the optoelectronic responses of quantum materials to structured optical fields, such as light with finite spin and orbital angular momentum, has not yet been widely explored, particularly at cryogenic temperature. Here we demonstrate the design and application of a novel instrument that integrates scanning spectroscopic photocurrent measurements with structured light of controlled spin and orbital angular momentum. For structured photons with wavelengths between 500 nm to 700 nm, this instrument can perform spatially resolved photocurrent measurements of two-dimensional materials or thin crystals under magnetic fields up to $\pm$ 14 Tesla, at temperatures from 300 K down to 3 K, with either spin angular momentum $\pm \hbar$ ororbital angular momentum $\pm \ell \hbar$ (where $\ell$=1,2,3... is the topological charge), and over a (35 $\times$ 25) $\mu m^2$ area with ~ 1 $\mu m$ spatial resolution. These capabilities of the instrument are exemplified by magneto-photocurrent spectroscopic measurements of monolayer 2H-$MoS_2$ field-effect transistors, which not only reveal the excitonic spectra but also demonstrate monotonically increasing photocurrents with increasing |$\ell $| as well as excitonic Zeeman splitting and an enhanced Land\'e g-factor due to the enhanced formation of intervalley dark excitons under magnetic field. These studies thus demonstrate the versatility of the scanning photocurrent spectrometry for investigating excitonic physics, optical selection rules, and optoelectronic responses of novel quantum materials and engineered quantum devices to structured light.</description>

      <title>Mixed state concurrence for symmetric systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a method to quantify entanglement in mixed states of highly symmetric systems. Symmetry constrains interactions between parts and predicts the degeneracies of the states. While symmetry alone produces entangled eigenstates, the thermal mixed state (density) which contains all of the eigenstate densities weighted by their Boltzmann factors is not necessarily as entangled as the eigenstates themselves because generally the mixed state can be re-expressed as a sum over densities which are less entangled. The entanglement of the mixed state is the minimum obtained by considering all such re-expressions, but there is no well-defined approach to solving this problem generally. Our method uses symmetry to explicitly construct unentangled densities, which are then optimally included in the thermal mixed state, resulting in a quantitative measure of entanglement that accounts for the reduction of entanglement arising from degenerate states. We present results for several small spin systems.</description>

      <title>Strong coupling of chiral light with chiral matter: a macroscopic study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24800v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Maximizing the interaction between chiral light and chiral matter is pivotal for the advancement of technologies enabling optical detection that distinguishes between different handedness in chiral organic molecules. One strategy involves developing a resonator that sustains photonic modes with non-zero electromagnetic handedness, which interact differently with chiral molecules of opposite enantiomers. When chiral molecules are positioned in resonator hotspots, they can alter the system's characteristics due to their inherent electric and magnetic transition dipole moments. In this study, we explore this interaction by incorporating the Lorentz pole into the macroscopic parameters of the chiral medium: dielectric permittivity, magnetic permeability, and chirality coefficient. The latter, also known as the Pasteur parameter, is a dimensionless macroscopic measure indicating the medium's chirality, interlinking electric and magnetic fields in the constitutive relations. We show that introducing the Lorentz pole into these macroscopic material parameters of the chiral medium results in chiral strong coupling between light and matter, with the strength of coupling determined by both the medium's chirality and the photonic mode's chirality.</description>
