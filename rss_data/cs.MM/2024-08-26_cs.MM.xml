      <title>Cap2Sum: Learning to Summarize Videos by Generating Captions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid growth of video data on the internet, video summarization is becoming a very important AI technology. However, due to the high labelling cost of video summarization, existing studies have to be conducted on small-scale datasets, leading to limited performance and generalization capacity. In this work, we introduce the use of dense video captions as a supervision signal to train video summarization models. Motivated by this, we propose Cap2Sum, a model that learns to summarize videos by generating captions, to exploit dense video caption annotations. This weakly-supervised approach allows us to train the models on large-scale dense video caption datasets to achieve better performance and generalization capacity. To further improve the generalization capacity, we introduce a CLIP (a strong vision-language model) Prior mechanism to enhance the learning of important objects that captions may ignore in the videos. In practice, Cap2Sum can perform zero-shot video summarization or be fine-tuned by the ground-truth summary or video caption of the target dataset. To examine the performance of Cap2Sum after weakly-supervised fine-tuning by the video captions, we propose two new datasets, TVSum-Caption and SumMe-Caption, which are derived from two common video summarization datasets and will be publicly released. We conduct extensive experiments and the results demonstrate that our method achieves significant improvements in performance and generalization capacity compared with previous methods.</description>

      <title>Ada2I: Enhancing Modality Balance for Multimodal Conversational Emotion Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal Emotion Recognition in Conversations (ERC) is a typical multimodal learning task in exploiting various data modalities concurrently. Prior studies on effective multimodal ERC encounter challenges in addressing modality imbalances and optimizing learning across modalities. Dealing with these problems, we present a novel framework named Ada2I, which consists of two inseparable modules namely Adaptive Feature Weighting (AFW) and Adaptive Modality Weighting (AMW) for feature-level and modality-level balancing respectively via leveraging both Inter- and Intra-modal interactions. Additionally, we introduce a refined disparity ratio as part of our training optimization strategy, a simple yet effective measure to assess the overall discrepancy of the model's learning process when handling multiple modalities simultaneously. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of Ada2I with state-of-the-art performance compared to baselines on three benchmark datasets, particularly in addressing modality imbalances.</description>

      <title>VCEMO: Multi-Modal Emotion Recognition for Chinese Voiceprints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emotion recognition can enhance humanized machine responses to user commands, while voiceprint-based perception systems can be easily integrated into commonly used devices like smartphones and stereos. Despite having the largest number of speakers, there is a noticeable absence of high-quality corpus datasets for emotion recognition using Chinese voiceprints. Hence, this paper introduces the VCEMO dataset to address this deficiency. The proposed dataset is constructed from everyday conversations and comprises over 100 users and 7,747 textual samples. Furthermore, this paper proposes a multimodal-based model as a benchmark, which effectively fuses speech, text, and external knowledge using a co-attention structure. The system employs contrastive learning-based regulation for the uneven distribution of the dataset and the diversity of emotional expressions. The experiments demonstrate the significant improvement of the proposed model over SOTA on the VCEMO and IEMOCAP datasets. Code and dataset will be released for research.</description>

      <title>MultiMed: Massively Multimodal and Multitask Medical Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biomedical data is inherently multimodal, consisting of electronic health records, medical imaging, digital pathology, genome sequencing, wearable sensors, and more. The application of artificial intelligence tools to these multifaceted sensing technologies has the potential to revolutionize the prognosis, diagnosis, and management of human health and disease. However, current approaches to biomedical AI typically only train and evaluate with one or a small set of medical modalities and tasks. This limitation hampers the development of comprehensive tools that can leverage the rich interconnected information across many heterogeneous biomedical sensors. To address this challenge, we present MultiMed, a benchmark designed to evaluate and enable large-scale learning across a wide spectrum of medical modalities and tasks. MultiMed consists of 2.56 million samples across ten medical modalities such as medical reports, pathology, genomics, and protein data, and is structured into eleven challenging tasks, including disease prognosis, protein structure prediction, and medical question answering. Using MultiMed, we conduct comprehensive experiments benchmarking state-of-the-art unimodal, multimodal, and multitask models. Our analysis highlights the advantages of training large-scale medical models across many related modalities and tasks. Moreover, MultiMed enables studies of generalization across related medical concepts, robustness to real-world noisy data and distribution shifts, and novel modality combinations to improve prediction performance. MultiMed will be publicly available and regularly updated and welcomes inputs from the community.</description>

      <title>SpeechEE: A Novel Benchmark for Speech Event Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09462v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Event extraction (EE) is a critical direction in the field of information extraction, laying an important foundation for the construction of structured knowledge bases. EE from text has received ample research and attention for years, yet there can be numerous real-world applications that require direct information acquisition from speech signals, online meeting minutes, interview summaries, press releases, etc. While EE from speech has remained under-explored, this paper fills the gap by pioneering a SpeechEE, defined as detecting the event predicates and arguments from a given audio speech. To benchmark the SpeechEE task, we first construct a large-scale high-quality dataset. Based on textual EE datasets under the sentence, document, and dialogue scenarios, we convert texts into speeches through both manual real-person narration and automatic synthesis, empowering the data with diverse scenarios, languages, domains, ambiences, and speaker styles. Further, to effectively address the key challenges in the task, we tailor an E2E SpeechEE system based on the encoder-decoder architecture, where a novel Shrinking Unit module and a retrieval-aided decoding mechanism are devised. Extensive experimental results on all SpeechEE subsets demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed model, offering a strong baseline for the task. At last, being the first work on this topic, we shed light on key directions for future research.</description>
