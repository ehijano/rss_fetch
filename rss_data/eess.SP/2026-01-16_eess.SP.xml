      <title>Distributed Hypothesis Testing Under A Covertness Constraint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study distributed hypothesis testing under a covertness constraint in the non-alert situation, which requires that under the null-hypothesis an external warden be unable to detect whether communication between the sensor and the decision center is taking place. We characterize the achievable Stein exponent of this setup when the channel from the sensor to the decision center is a partially-connected discrete memoryless channel (DMC), i.e., when certain output symbols can only be induced by some of the inputs. The Stein-exponent in this case, does not depend on the specific transition law of the DMC and equals Shalaby and Papamarcou's exponent without a warden but where the sensor can send $k$ noise-free bits to the decision center, for $k$ a function that is sublinear in the observation length $n$. For fully-connected DMCs, we propose an achievable Stein-exponent and show that it can improve over the local exponent at the decision center. All our coding schemes do not require that the sensor and decision center share a common secret key, as commonly assumed in covert communication. Moreover, in our schemes the divergence covertness constraint vanishes (almost) exponentially fast in the obervation length $n$, again, an atypical behaviour for covert communication.</description>

      <title>Towards Native Intelligence: 6G-LLM Trained with Reinforcement Learning from NDT Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Owing to its comprehensive understanding of upper-layer application requirements and the capabilities of practical communication systems, the 6G-LLM (6G domain large language model) offers a promising pathway toward realizing network native intelligence. Serving as the system orchestrator, the 6G-LLM drives a paradigm shift that fundamentally departs from existing rule-based approaches, which primarily rely on modular, experience-driven optimization. By contrast, the 6G-LLM substantially enhances network flexibility and adaptability. Nevertheless, current efforts to construct 6G-LLMs are constrained by their reliance on large-scale, meticulously curated, human-authored corpora, which are impractical to obtain in real-world scenarios. Moreover, purely offline-trained models lack the capacity for continual self-improvement, limiting their ability to adapt to the highly dynamic requirements of wireless communication environments. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel training paradigm termed RLDTF (Reinforcement Learning from Digital Twin Feedback) for 6G-LLMs. This framework leverages network digital twins to generate reward signals based on orchestration outcomes, while employing reinforcement learning to guide the model toward optimal decision-making dynamically. Furthermore, we introduce a weighted token mechanism to improve output accuracy. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in orchestration accuracy and solution optimality.</description>

      <title>Clustering-Based User Selection in Federated Learning: Metadata Exploitation for 3GPP Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training without sharing raw user data, but conventional simulations often rely on unrealistic data partitioning and current user selection methods ignore data correlation among users. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a metadatadriven FL framework. We first introduce a novel data partition model based on a homogeneous Poisson point process (HPPP), capturing both heterogeneity in data quantity and natural overlap among user datasets. Building on this model, we develop a clustering-based user selection strategy that leverages metadata, such as user location, to reduce data correlation and enhance label diversity across training rounds. Extensive experiments on FMNIST and CIFAR-10 demonstrate that the proposed framework improves model performance, stability, and convergence in non-IID scenarios, while maintaining comparable performance under IID settings. Furthermore, the method shows pronounced advantages when the number of selected users per round is small. These findings highlight the framework's potential for enhancing FL performance in realistic deployments and guiding future standardization.</description>

      <title>Microwave Linear Analog Computer (MiLAC)-aided Multiuser MISO: Fundamental Limits and Beamforming Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As wireless communication systems evolve toward the 6G era, ultra-massive/gigantic MIMO is envisioned as a key enabling technology. Recently, microwave linear analog computer (MiLAC) has emerged as a promising approach to realize beamforming entirely in the analog domain, thereby alleviating the scalability challenges associated with gigantic MIMO. In this paper, we investigate the fundamental beamforming flexibility and design of lossless and reciprocal MiLAC-aided beamforming for MU-MISO systems. We first provide a rigorous characterization of the set of beamforming matrices achievable by MiLAC. Based on this characterization, we prove that MiLAC-aided beamforming does not generally achieve the full flexibility of digital beamforming, while offering greater flexibility than conventional phase-shifter-based analog beamforming. Furthermore, we propose a hybrid digital-MiLAC architecture and show that it achieves digital beamforming flexibility when the number of radio frequency (RF) chains equals the number of data streams, halving that required by conventional hybrid beamforming. We then formulate the MiLAC-aided sum-rate maximization problem for MU-MISO systems. To solve the problem efficiently, we reformulate the MiLAC-related constraints as a convex linear matrix inequality and establish a low-dimensional subspace property that significantly reduces the problem dimension. Leveraging these results, we propose WMMSE-based algorithms for solving the resulting problem. Simulation results demonstrate that MiLAC-aided beamforming achieves performance close to that of digital beamforming in gigantic MIMO systems. Compared with hybrid beamforming, it achieves comparable or superior performance with lower hardware and computational complexity by avoiding symbol-level digital processing and enabling low-resolution digital-to-analog converters (DACs).</description>

      <title>P-norm based Fractional-Order Robust Subband Adaptive Filtering Algorithm for Impulsive Noise and Noisy Input</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building upon the mean p-power error (MPE) criterion, the normalized subband p-norm (NSPN) algorithm demonstrates superior robustness in $\alpha$-stable noise environments ($1 &lt; \alpha \leq 2$) through effective utilization of low-order moment hidden in robust loss functions. Nevertheless, its performance degrades significantly when processing noise input or additive noise characterized by $\alpha$-stable processes ($0 &lt; \alpha \leq 1$). To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel fractional-order NSPN (FoNSPN) algorithm that incorporates the fractional-order stochastic gradient descent (FoSGD) method into the MPE framework. Additionally, this paper also analyzes the convergence range of its step-size, the theoretical domain of values for the fractional-order $\beta$, and establishes the theoretical steady-state mean square deviation (MSD) model. Simulations conducted in diverse impulsive noise environments confirm the superiority of the proposed FoNSPN algorithm against existing state-of-the-art algorithms.</description>

      <title>Service Provisioning and Path Planning with Obstacle Avoidance for Low-Altitude Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the three-dimensional (3D) deployment of uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) as aerial base stations in heterogeneous communication networks under constraints imposed by diverse ground obstacles. Given the diverse data demands of user equipments (UEs), a user satisfaction model is developed to provide personalized services. In particular, when a UE is located within a ground obstacle, the UAV must approach the obstacle boundary to ensure reliable service quality. Considering constraints such as UAV failures due to battery depletion, heterogeneous UEs, and obstacles, we aim to maximize overall user satisfaction by jointly optimizing the 3D trajectories of UAVs, transmit beamforming vectors, and binary association indicators between UAVs and UEs. To address the complexity and dynamics of the problem, a block coordinate descent method is adopted to decompose it into two subproblems. The beamforming subproblem is efficiently addressed via a bisection-based water-filling algorithm. For the trajectory and association subproblem, we design a deep reinforcement learning algorithm based on proximal policy optimization to learn an adaptive control policy. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms baseline schemes in terms of convergence speed and overall system performance. Moreover, it achieves efficient association and accurate obstacle avoidance.</description>

      <title>BeamCKMDiff: Beam-Aware Channel Knowledge Map Construction via Diffusion Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Channel knowledge map (CKM) is emerging as a critical enabler for environment-aware 6G networks, offering a site-specific database to significantly reduce pilot overhead. However, existing CKM construction methods typically rely on sparse sampling measurements and are restricted to either omnidirectional maps or discrete codebooks, hindering the exploitation of beamforming gain. To address these limitations, we propose BeamCKMDiff, a generative framework for constructing high-fidelity CKMs conditioned on arbitrary continuous beamforming vectors without site-specific sampling. Specifically, we incorporate a novel adaptive layer normalization (adaLN) mechanism into the noise prediction network of the Diffusion Transformer (DiT). This mechanism injects continuous beam embeddings as {global control parameters}, effectively steering the generative process to capture the complex coupling between beam patterns and environmental geometries. Simulation results demonstrate that BeamCKMDiff significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving superior reconstruction accuracy in capturing main lobes and side lobes.</description>

      <title>Sim2Real Deep Transfer for Per-Device CFO Calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Carrier Frequency Offset (CFO) estimation in Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) systems faces significant performance degradation across heterogeneous software-defined radio (SDR) platforms due to uncalibrated hardware impairments. Existing deep neural network (DNN)-based approaches lack device-level adaptation, limiting their practical deployment. This paper proposes a Sim2Real transfer learning framework for per-device CFO calibration, combining simulation-driven pretraining with lightweight receiver adaptation. A backbone DNN is pre-trained on synthetic OFDM signals incorporating parametric hardware distortions (e.g., phase noise, IQ imbalance), enabling generalized feature learning without costly cross-device data collection. Subsequently, only the regression layers are fine-tuned using $1,000$ real frames per target device, preserving hardware-agnostic knowledge while adapting to device-specific impairments. Experiments across three SDR families (USRP B210, USRP N210, HackRF One) achieve $30\times$ BER reduction compared to conventional CP-based methods under indoor multipath conditions. The framework bridges the simulation-to-reality gap for robust CFO estimation, enabling cost-effective deployment in heterogeneous wireless systems.</description>

      <title>Low-Complexity Blind Estimator of SNR and MSE for mmWave Multi-Antenna Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To enhance the robustness and resilience of wireless communication and meet performance requirements, various environment-reflecting metrics, such as the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), are utilized as the system parameter. To obtain these metrics, training signals such as pilot sequences are generally employed. However, the rapid fluctuations of the millimeter-wave (mmWave) propagation channel often degrade the accuracy of such estimations. To address this challenge, various blind estimators that operate without pilot have been considered as potential solutions. However, these algorithms often involve a training phase for machine learning or a large number of iterations, which implies prohibitive computational complexity, making them difficult to employ for real-time services and the system less resilient to dynamic environment variation. In this paper, we propose blind estimators for average noise power, signal power, SNR, and mean-square error (MSE) that do not require knowledge of the ground-truth signal or involve high computational complexity. The proposed algorithm leverages the inherent sparsity of mmWave channel in beamspace domain, which makes the signal and noise power components more distinguishable.</description>

      <title>Achievable Degrees of Freedom Analysis and Optimization in Massive MIMO via Characteristic Mode Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) is esteemed as a critical technology in 6G communications, providing large degrees of freedom (DoF) to improve multiplexing gain. This paper introduces characteristic mode analysis (CMA) to derive the achievable DoF. Unlike existing works primarily focusing on the DoF of the wireless channel,the excitation and radiation properties of antennas are also involved in our DoF analysis, which influences the number of independent data streams for communication of a MIMO system. Specifically, we model the excitation and radiation properties of transceiver antennas using CMA to analyze the excitation and radiation properties of antennas. The CMA-based DoF analysis framework is established and the achievable DoF is derived. A characteristic mode optimization problem of antennas is then formulated to maximize the achievable DoF. A case study where the reconfigurable holographic surface (RHS) antennas are deployed at the transceiver is investigated, and a CMA-based genetic algorithm is later proposed to solve the above problem. By changing the characteristic modes electric field and surface current distribution of RHS, the achievable DoF is enhanced. Full-wave simulation verifies the theoretical analysis on the the achievable DoF and shows that, via the reconfiguration of RHS based on the proposed algorithm, the achievable DoF is improved.</description>

      <title>One-Cold Poisson Channel: A Simple Continuous-Time Channel with Zero Dispersion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the one-cold Poisson channel (OCPC), where the transmitter chooses one of several frequency bands to attenuate at a time. In particular, the perfect OCPC, where the number of bands is unlimited, is an extremely simple continuous-time memoryless channel. It has a capacity 1, zero channel dispersion, and an information spectrum being the degenerate distribution at 1. It is the only known nontrivial (discrete or continuous-time) memoryless channel with a closed-form formula for its optimal non-asymptotic error probability, making it the simplest channel in this sense. A potential application is optical communication with a tunable band rejection filter. Due to its simplicity, we may use it as a basic currency of information that is infinitely divisible, as an alternative to bits which are not infinitely divisible. OCPC with perfect feedback gives a generalization of prefix codes. We also study non-asymptotic coding and channel simulation results for the general OCPC.</description>

      <title>Codebook Design for Limited Feedback in Near-Field XL-MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study efficient codebook design for limited feedback in extremely large-scale multiple-input-multiple-output (XL-MIMO) frequency division duplexing (FDD) systems. It is worth noting that existing codebook designs for XL-MIMO, such as polar-domain codebook, have not well taken into account user (location) distribution in practice, thereby incurring excessive feedback overhead. To address this issue, we propose in this paper a novel and efficient feedback codebook tailored to user distribution. To this end, we first consider a typical scenario where users are uniformly distributed within a specific polar-region, based on which a sum-rate maximization problem is formulated to jointly optimize angle-range samples and bit allocation among angle/range feedback. This problem is challenging to solve due to the lack of a closed-form expression for the received power in terms of angle and range samples. By leveraging a Voronoi partitioning approach, we show that uniform angle sampling is optimal for received power maximization. For more challenging range sampling design, we obtain a tight lower-bound on the received power and show that geometric sampling, where the ratio between adjacent samples is constant, can maximize the lower bound and thus serves as a high-quality suboptimal solution. We then extend the proposed framework to accommodate more general non-uniform user distribution via an alternating sampling method. Furthermore, theoretical analysis reveals that as the array size increases, the optimal allocation of feedback bits increasingly favors range samples at the expense of angle samples. Finally, numerical results validate the superior rate performance and robustness of the proposed codebook design under various system setups, achieving significant gains over benchmark schemes, including the widely used polar-domain codebook.</description>

      <title>Breaking the Storage-Bandwidth Tradeoff in Distributed Storage with Quantum Entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work investigates the use of quantum resources in distributed storage systems. Consider an $(n,k,d)$ distributed storage system in which a file is stored across $n$ nodes such that any $k$ nodes suffice to reconstruct the file. When a node fails, any $d$ helper nodes transmit information to a newcomer to rebuild the system. In contrast to the classical repair, where helper nodes transmit classical bits, we allow them to send classical information over quantum channels to the newcomer. The newcomer then generates its storage by performing appropriate measurements on the received quantum states. In this setting, we fully characterize the fundamental tradeoff between storage and repair bandwidth (total communication cost). Compared to classical systems, the optimal storage--bandwidth tradeoff can be significantly improved with the enhancement of quantum entanglement shared only among the surviving nodes, particularly at the minimum-storage regenerating point. Remarkably, we show that when $d \geq 2k-2$, there exists an operating point at which \textit{both storage and repair bandwidth are simultaneously minimized}. This phenomenon breaks the tradeoff in the classical setting and reveals a fundamentally new regime enabled by quantum communication.</description>

      <title>Bias-VarianceTrade-off in Kalman Filter-Based Disturbance Observers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05061v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The performance of disturbance observers is strongly influenced by the level of prior knowledge about the disturbance model. The simultaneous input and state estimation (SISE) algorithm is widely recognized for providing unbiased minimum-variance estimates under arbitrary disturbance models. In contrast, the Kalman filter-based disturbance observer (KF-DOB) achieves minimum mean-square error estimation when the disturbance model is fully specified. However, practical scenarios often fall between these extremes, where only partial knowledge of the disturbance model is available. This paper investigates the inherent bias-variance trade-off in KF-DOB when the disturbance model is incomplete. We further show that SISE can be interpreted as a special case of KF-DOB, where the disturbance noise covariance tends to infinity. To address this trade-off, we propose two novel estimators: the multi-kernel correntropy Kalman filter-based disturbance observer (MKCKF-DOB) and the interacting multiple models Kalman filter-based disturbance observer (IMMKF-DOB). Simulations verify the effectiveness of the proposed methods.</description>

      <title>Rydberg Atomic Quantum Receivers for Classical Wireless Communications and Sensing: Their Models and Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05554v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The significant progress of quantum sensing technologies offer numerous radical solutions for measuring a multitude of physical quantities at an unprecedented precision. Among them, Rydberg atomic quantum receivers (RAQRs) emerge as an eminent solution for detecting the electric field of radio frequency (RF) signals, exhibiting great potential in assisting classical wireless communications and sensing. So far, most experimental studies have aimed for the proof of physical concepts to reveal its promise, while the practical signal model of RAQR-aided wireless communications and sensing remained under-explored. Furthermore, the performance of RAQR-based wireless receivers and their advantages over classical RF receivers have not been fully characterized. To fill these gaps, we introduce the RAQR to the wireless community by presenting an end-to-end reception scheme. We then develop a corresponding equivalent baseband signal model relying on a realistic reception flow. Our scheme and model provide explicit design guidance to RAQR-aided wireless systems. We next study the performance of RAQR-aided wireless systems based on our model, and compare them to classical RF receivers. The results show that Doppler broadening-free RAQRs are capable of achieving a substantial received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) gain of over $27$ decibel (dB) and $40$ dB in the photon shot limit and standard quantum limit regimes, respectively.</description>

      <title>From Ground to Sky: Architectures, Applications, and Challenges Shaping Low-Altitude Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12308v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we introduce a novel low-altitude wireless network (LAWN), which is a reconfigurable, three-dimensional (3D) layered architecture. In particular, the LAWN integrates connectivity, sensing, control, and computing across aerial and terrestrial nodes that enable seamless operation in complex, dynamic, and mission-critical environments. Different from the conventional aerial communication systems, LAWN's distinctive feature is its tight integration of functional planes in which multiple functionalities continually reshape themselves to operate safely and efficiently in the low-altitude sky. With the LAWN, we discuss several enabling technologies, such as integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), semantic communication, and fully-actuated control systems. Finally, we identify potential applications and key cross-layer challenges. This article offers a comprehensive roadmap for future research and development in the low-altitude airspace.</description>

      <title>Pulse Shaping Filter Design for Integrated Sensing &amp; Communication with Zak-OTFS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15195v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Zak-OTFS provides a framework for integrated sensing &amp; communication (ISAC) in high delay and Doppler spread environments. Pulse shaping filter design enables joint optimization of sensing and communication performance. For sensing, a localized pulse shaping filter enables input-output (I/O) relation estimates close to the physical scattering channel. For communication, orthogonality of the pulse shape on the information lattice prevents inter-symbol interference, and no time and bandwidth expansion enables full spectral efficiency. A filter simultaneously meeting all three objectives is ideal for ISAC. Existing filter designs achieve two, but not all three objectives. In this work, we design pulse shaping filters meeting all three objectives via the Isotropic Orthogonal Transform Algorithm. The proposed filters have improved spectral efficiency, data detection and sensing performance over existing filter choices.</description>

      <title>Delay Minimization in Pinching-Antenna-enabled NOMA-MEC Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16296v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This letter proposes a novel pinching antenna systems (PASS) enabled non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) multi-access edge computing (MEC) framework. An optimization problem is formulated to minimize the maximum task delay by optimizing offloading ratios, transmit powers, and pinching antenna (PA) positions, subject to constraints on maximum transmit power, user energy budgets, and minimum PA separation to mitigate coupling effects. To address the non-convex problem, a bisection search-based alternating optimization (AO) algorithm is developed, where each subproblem is iteratively solved for a given task delay. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly reduces the task delay compared to benchmark schemes.</description>

      <title>TinyMyo: a Tiny Foundation Model for Flexible EMG Signal Processing at the Edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15729v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Objective: Surface electromyography (EMG) is a non-invasive sensing modality widely used in biomechanics, rehabilitation, prosthetic control, and human-machine interfaces. Despite decades of use, achieving robust generalization across subjects, recording systems, and acquisition protocols remains challenging. While foundation models (FMs) are gaining traction for EMG, existing approaches remain limited to single downstream tasks and lack deployability on embedded platforms. This work addresses these limitations. Methods: We present TinyMyo, a lightweight FM based on a Transformer encoder architecture. The model is pre-trained in a self-supervised manner using masked reconstruction on publicly available datasets. With only 3.6M parameters, TinyMyo is designed to support multiple downstream tasks through minimal task-specific head adaptations. Results: We demonstrate generalization across hand gesture classification, hand kinematic regression, speech production and speech recognition, with performance comparable to or surpassing the state of the art (SoA), and model size below 5M parameters. We achieve SoA results compared to previous FM-based works on the NinaPro DB5 (89.4%), UCI-EMG (97.56%), and EPN-612 (96.74%) datasets. We demonstrate the first-time deployment of an EMG FM on an ultra-low power microcontroller (GAP9), with an inference time of 0.785 s, energy of 44.91 mJ and power envelope of 57.18 mW. Conclusion: TinyMyo demonstrates that compact, self-supervised EMG FM can guarantee strong generalization across multiple downstream tasks while remaining compatible with low-power edge devices. Significance: TinyMyo is the first EMG FM for ultra-low power edge devices, enabling scalable and energy-efficient sensing for motor intent decoding, neuromuscular assessment, and biosignal driven human-machine interaction.</description>

      <title>On the Impact of Channel Aging and Doppler-Affected Clutter on OFDM ISAC Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05032v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The temporal evolution of the propagation environment plays a central role in integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. A slow-time evolution manifests as channel aging in communication links, while a fast-time one is associated with structured clutter with non-zero Doppler. Nevertheless, the joint impact of these two phenomena on ISAC performance has been largely overlooked. This addresses this research gap in a network utilizing orthogonal frequency division multiplexing waveforms. Here, a base station simultaneously serves multiple user equipment (UE) devices and performs monostatic sensing. Channel aging is captured through an autoregressive model with exponential correlation decay. In contrast, clutter is modeled as a collection of uncorrelated, coherent patches with non-zero Doppler, resulting in a Kronecker-separable covariance structure. We propose an aging-aware channel estimator that uses prior pilot observations to estimate the time-varying UE channels, characterized by a non-isotropic multipath fading structure. The clutter's structure enables a novel low-complexity sensing pipeline: clutter statistics are estimated from raw data and subsequently used to suppress the clutter's action, after which target parameters are extracted through range-angle and range-velocity maps. We evaluate the influence of frame length and pilot history on channel estimation accuracy and demonstrate substantial performance gains over block fading in low-to-moderate mobility regimes. The sensing pipeline is implemented in a clutter-dominated environment, demonstrating that effective clutter suppression can be achieved under practical configurations. Furthermore, our results show that dedicated sensing streams are required, as communication beams provide insufficient range resolution.</description>

      <title>LLM-Based Emulation of the Radio Resource Control Layer: Towards AI-Native RAN Protocols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16821v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Integrating Large AI Models (LAMs) into 6G mobile networks is a key enabler of the AI-Native Air Interface (AI-AI), where protocol intelligence must scale beyond handcrafted logic. This paper presents, to our knowledge, the first standards-compliant emulation of the Radio Resource Control (RRC) layer using a decoder-only LAM (LLAMA-class) fine-tuned with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) on a multi-vendor corpus of real-world traces spanning both 5G and 4G systems. We treat RRC as a domain-specific language and construct a segmentation-safe, question-answer (Question-and-Answer (QA)) dataset that preserves Abstract Syntax Notation (ASN.1) structure through linearization prior to Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) tokenization. The proposed approach combines parameter-efficient adaptation with schema-bounded prompting to ensure syntactic and procedural fidelity. Evaluation introduces a standards-aware triad -- ASN.1 conformance, field-level coverage analysis, and uplink-to-downlink state-machine checks -- alongside semantic similarity and latency profiling across 120 configurations. On 30k 5G request-response pairs plus an additional 4.8k QA turns from 4G sessions, our 8B model achieves a median cosine similarity of 0.97, a 61% relative gain over a zero-shot baseline, while sustaining high conformance rates. These results demonstrate that LAMs, when augmented with protocol-aware reasoning, can directly orchestrate control-plane procedures, laying the foundation for the future Artificial Intelligence (AI)-native Radio Access Network (RAN).</description>

      <title>Wavelet-based Multi-View Fusion of 4D Radar Tensor and Camera for Robust 3D Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22972v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: 4D millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar has been widely adopted in autonomous driving and robot perception due to its low cost and all-weather robustness. However, point-cloud-based radar representations suffer from information loss due to multi-stage signal processing, while directly utilizing raw 4D radar tensors incurs prohibitive computational costs. To address these challenges, we propose WRCFormer, a novel 3D object detection framework that efficiently fuses raw 4D radar cubes with camera images via decoupled multi-view radar representations. Our approach introduces two key components: (1) A Wavelet Attention Module embedded in a wavelet-based Feature Pyramid Network (FPN), which enhances the representation of sparse radar signals and image data by capturing joint spatial-frequency features, thereby mitigating information loss while maintaining computational efficiency. (2) A Geometry-guided Progressive Fusion mechanism, a two-stage query-based fusion strategy that progressively aligns multi-view radar and visual features through geometric priors, enabling modality-agnostic and efficient integration without overwhelming computational overhead. Extensive experiments on the K-Radar benchmark show that WRCFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing the best existing model by approximately 2.4% in all scenarios and 1.6% in sleet conditions, demonstrating strong robustness in adverse weather.</description>
