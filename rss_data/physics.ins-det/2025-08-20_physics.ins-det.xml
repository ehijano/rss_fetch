      <title>Quantum biosensing on a multiplexed functionalized diamond microarray</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum sensing with nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond promises to revolutionize biological research and medical diagnostics. Thanks to their high sensitivity, NV sensors could, in principle, detect specific binding events with metabolites and proteins in a massively parallel and label-free way, avoiding the complexity of mass spectrometry. Realizing this vision has been hindered by the lack of quantum sensor arrays that unite high-density spatial multiplexing with uncompromising biochemical specificity. Here, we introduce a scalable quantum biosensing platform that overcomes these barriers by integrating the first multiplexed DNA microarray directly onto a subnanometer antifouling diamond surface. The 7x7 DNA array, patterned onto a diamond chip, enables simultaneous detection of 49 distinct biomolecular features with high spatial resolution and reproducibility, as verified by fluorescence microscopy. Molecular recognition is converted into a quantum signal via a target-induced displacement mechanism in which hybridization removes a Gd$^{3+}$-tagged DNA strand, restoring NV center spin relaxation times (T$_1$) and producing a binary quantum readout. This platform establishes a new paradigm for high-throughput, multiplexed quantum biosensing and opens the door to advanced molecular diagnostics and large-scale quantum sensor networks operable in complex biological environments.</description>

      <title>Full Spectrum Modeling of In Situ Gamma-ray Detector Measurements with a Focus on Precipitation-Induced Transients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gamma-ray detectors that are deployed outdoors experience increased event rates during precipitation due to the attendant increase in Rn-222 progeny at ground level. The increased radiation due to these decay products (Pb-214 and Bi-214) has been studied for many decades in applications such as atmospheric science and radiation protection. For those applications radon progeny signatures are the signal of interest, while in the fields of radiological and nuclear security and aerial radiological mapping they are a nuisance. When searching for radiological contamination or missing sources, an analyst must take precipitation into account to reduce false alarms, in addition to accounting for static background signatures. To train advanced search algorithms, an effort has been underway to generate synthetic gamma-ray event data that represent a realistic urban area, including occasional rain events to add to the realism. This manuscript describes an effort to analyze and model gamma-ray spectra measured during rainfall by a NaI(Tl) detector located outdoors in order to derive accurate source terms for Pb-214 and Bi-214 at a high frequency (less than 1 minute). All known sources of background were quantitatively modeled across the full gamma-ray spectrum, so that the Pb-214 and Bi-214 activity concentrations on the ground could be inferred from a linear model fit to each spectrum. A physically motivated model was applied to the data to further smooth the fits, which had the benefit of yielding information about the concentrations of the progeny in rainwater and their apparent age, making this the first time full-spectrum modeling has been used for continuous measurements of radon progeny. This approach could lead to studies of radon progeny on shorter timescales than previously possible.</description>

      <title>Studies of simulation framework for N{\nu}DEx experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The N$\nu$DEx experiment aims to search for the neutrinoless double beta decay of $^{82}$Se using a high-pressure $^{82}$SeF$_6$ gas time projection chamber (TPC). Under the assumption of two kinds of charge carriers would be formed, the difference in drift velocities between these ion species enables trigger-less event reconstruction and offers the potential for excellent energy resolution through direct charge collection.
  In this study, we present a simulation framework for the N$\nu$DEx ion TPC. The reduced mobilities of SeF$_5^-$ and SeF$_6^-$ ions in SeF$_6$ were calculated using density functional theory and two-temperature theory, yielding values of $0.444 \pm 0.133$ and $0.430 \pm 0.129$ cm$^2$V$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$, respectively.
  The TPC geometry, featuring a cathode-focusing plane-anode structure and an 10,000-pixel readout array, was modeled with COMSOL to calculate the electric and weighting fields. Signal and background events were generated using BxDecay0 and Geant4. Garfield++ was used to simulate the transport of charge carriers and signal induction. The induced current was convolved with the transfer function to produce voltage signals, which were subsequently used to extract energy through amplitude. The 3D tracks are also reconstructed based on drift time differences and Breadth First search.
  To enhance signal background separation, six topological variables were extracted from the reconstructed tracks and used to define optimized selection criteria. The Boosted Decision Trees is used for a preliminary analysis. This simulation framework serves as a crucial tool for design optimization and sensitivity studies in the N$\nu$DEx experiment.</description>

      <title>Low-temperature Performance of $\mathrm{Gd_3(Ga, Al)_5O_{12}}$:Ce Scintillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The last years have seen the first cryogenic detectors to be proposed for usage on balloon-borne missions. In such missions, the instrument will be exposed to the high radiation environment of the upper atmosphere. This radiation can induce a significant background to the measurements, something which can be mitigated through the use of an anti-coincidence shield. For hard X-ray and gamma-ray detectors such a shield typically consists photomultiplier tubes or, more recently, silicon photomultipliers coupled to scintillators placed around the detector. When using cryogenic detectors, the shield can be placed around the entire cryostat which will make it large, heavy and expensive. For the ASCENT (A SuperConducting ENergetic x-ray Telescope) mission, which uses Transition Edge Detectors, it was therefore considered to instead place the shield inside. This comes with the challenge of operating it at cryogenic temperatures. For this purpose, we tested the performance of 2 different types of GAGG:Ce scintillators down to 15 mK for the first time. Although significant variations of both the decay time and the light yield were found when varying the temperature, at 4 K its performance was found to be similar to that at room temperature. Furthermore, unexpected behavior around 2 K was found for both types of GAGG:Ce, leading to more in depth studies around these temperatures. Overall, the studies show that the combination of materials will allow to produce a functional anti-coincidence shield at several Kelvin.</description>

      <title>A Bayesian approach to time-domain Photonic Doppler Velocimetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photonic Doppler Velocimetry (PDV) is an established technique for measuring the velocities of fast-moving surfaces in high-energy-density experiments. In the standard approach to PDV analysis, a short-time Fourier transform (STFT) is used to generate a spectrogram from which the velocity history of the target is inferred. The user chooses the form, duration and separation of the window function. Here we present a Bayesian approach to infer the velocity directly from the PDV oscilloscope trace, without using the spectrogram for analysis. This is clearly a difficult inference problem due to the highly-periodic nature of the data, but we find that with carefully chosen prior distributions for the model parameters we can accurately recover the injected velocity from synthetic data. We validate this method using PDV data collected at the STAR two-stage light gas gun at Sandia National Laboratories, recovering shock-front velocities in quartz that are consistent with those inferred using the STFT-based approach, and are interpolated across regions of low signal-to-noise data. Although this method does not rely on the same user choices as the STFT, we caution that it can be prone to misspecification if the chosen model is not sufficient to capture the velocity behavior. Analysis using posterior predictive checks can be used to establish if a better model is required, although more complex models come with additional computational cost, often taking more than several hours to converge when sampling the Bayesian posterior. We therefore recommend it be viewed as a complementary method to that of the STFT-based approach.</description>

      <title>Mueller Matrix Polarimetry of Fiber Bragg Grating Strain and Torsion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We experimentally demonstrate a polarimetric dual-comb spectroscopy technique for simultaneous strain and torsion sensing using a single-cavity mode-locked fiber laser and fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors. Dual-comb generation in a single-cavity fiber laser was achieved by utilizing a piece of high-birefringence fiber and adjusting the in-cavity polarization controller. Fast Fourier Transform analysis was applied to the time-domain Stokes parameters, enabling the detection of FBG spectral shifts induced by strain and torsion. To further enhance discrimination between strain and torsion, we applied a novel approach to extract Mueller matrix elements without using complex adjustable polarization components. We explored the analysis of polarimetric purity of the FBG's Mueller matrix in terms of polarizance, diattenuation, and structural polarization response as a function of FBG strain and torsion. The obtained results enabled the measurement of strain and torsion based on a single FBG, which paves the way for the development of cost-effective shape sensing technologies.</description>

      <title>Towards Non-Invasive Sediment Monitoring Using Muography: A Pilot Run at the Shanghai Outer Ring Tunnel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00582v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study demonstrates the application of cosmic-ray muography as a non-invasive method for monitoring sediment accumulation and tidal influences in the Shanghai Outer Ring Tunnel, an immersed tube tunnel located beneath the Huangpu River in Shanghai, China. A portable, dual-layer plastic scintillator detector was deployed to conduct muon flux scans along the tunnel's length and to continuously monitor muon flux, allowing for the study of tidal effects. Geant4 simulations validated the correlation between muon attenuation and overburden thickness, incorporating sediment, water, and concrete layers. Key findings include a strong anti-correlation between the measured muon flux and the water levels observed at a nearby tide gauge. The results align with geotechnical data and simulations, especially in the region of interest, confirming muography's sensitivity to sediment dynamics. This work establishes muography as a robust tool for long-term, real-time monitoring of submerged infrastructure, offering significant advantages over conventional invasive techniques. The study underscores the potential for integrating muography into civil engineering practices to enhance safety and operational resilience in tidal environments.</description>
