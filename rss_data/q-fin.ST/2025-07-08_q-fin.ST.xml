      <title>Diffusion Factor Models: Generating High-Dimensional Returns with Factor Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06566v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Financial scenario simulation is essential for risk management and portfolio optimization, yet it remains challenging especially in high-dimensional and small data settings common in finance. We propose a diffusion factor model that integrates latent factor structure into generative diffusion processes, bridging econometrics with modern generative AI to address the challenges of the curse of dimensionality and data scarcity in financial simulation. By exploiting the low-dimensional factor structure inherent in asset returns, we decompose the score function--a key component in diffusion models--using time-varying orthogonal projections, and this decomposition is incorporated into the design of neural network architectures. We derive rigorous statistical guarantees, establishing nonasymptotic error bounds for both score estimation at O(d^{5/2} n^{-2/(k+5)}) and generated distribution at O(d^{5/4} n^{-1/2(k+5)}), primarily driven by the intrinsic factor dimension k rather than the number of assets d, surpassing the dimension-dependent limits in the classical nonparametric statistics literature and making the framework viable for markets with thousands of assets. Numerical studies confirm superior performance in latent subspace recovery under small data regimes. Empirical analysis demonstrates the economic significance of our framework in constructing mean-variance optimal portfolios and factor portfolios. This work presents the first theoretical integration of factor structure with diffusion models, offering a principled approach for high-dimensional financial simulation with limited data.

      <title>High-Dimensional Learning in Finance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03780v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning have shown promising results for financial prediction using large, over-parameterized models. This paper provides theoretical foundations and empirical validation for understanding when and how these methods achieve predictive success. I examine two key aspects of high-dimensional learning in finance. First, I prove that within-sample standardization in Random Fourier Features implementations fundamentally alters the underlying Gaussian kernel approximation, replacing shift-invariant kernels with training-set dependent alternatives. Second, I establish information-theoretic lower bounds that identify when reliable learning is impossible no matter how sophisticated the estimator. A detailed quantitative calibration of the polynomial lower bound shows that with typical parameter choices, e.g., 12,000 features, 12 monthly observations, and R-square 2-3%, the required sample size to escape the bound exceeds 25-30 years of data--well beyond any rolling-window actually used. Thus, observed out-of-sample success must originate from lower-complexity artefacts rather than from the intended high-dimensional mechanism.</description>

      <title>Integration of Wavelet Transform Convolution and Channel Attention with LSTM for Stock Price Prediction based Portfolio Allocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01973v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Portfolio allocation via stock price prediction is inherently difficult due to the notoriously low signal-to-noise ratio of stock time series. This paper proposes a method by integrating wavelet transform convolution and channel attention with LSTM to implement stock price prediction based portfolio allocation. Stock time series data first are processed by wavelet transform convolution to reduce the noise. Processed features are then reconstructed by channel attention. LSTM is utilized to predict the stock price using the final processed features. We construct a portfolio consists of four stocks with trading signals predicted by model. Experiments are conducted by evaluating the return, Sharpe ratio and max drawdown performance. The results indicate that our method achieves robust performance even during period of post-pandemic downward market.</description>
