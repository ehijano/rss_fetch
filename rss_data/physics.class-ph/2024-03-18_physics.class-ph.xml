      <title>Simple circuit and experimental proposal for the detection of gauge-waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aharonov-Bohm electrodynamics predicts the existence of traveling waves of pure potentials, with zero electromagnetic fields, denoted as gauge waves, or g-waves for short. In general, these waves cannot be shielded by matter since their lack of electromagnetic fields prevents the material from reacting to them. However, a not-locally-conserved electric current present in the material does interact with the potentials in the wave, giving the possibility of its detection. In [F.M., G.M., Eur.Phys.J. C 83, 1086 (2023)] the basic theoretical description of a detecting circuit was presented, based on a phenomenological theory of materials that can sustain not-locally-conserved electric currents. In the present work we discuss how that circuit can be built in practice, and used for the effective detection of g-waves.</description>

      <title>Potentials and fields of a charge set suddenly from rest into uniform motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17652v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The fact that electromagnetic effects propagate at the speed of light suggests how the Lorenz-gauge scalar and vector potentials of a uniformly moving point charge must be modified when the charge was initially at rest and then set suddenly into uniform motion. The modified potentials are shown to satisfy the requisite inhomogeneous wave equations. The gauge function of the transformation of these potentials to the Coulomb gauge is calculated in closed form. It is validated by confirming that the Coulomb-gauge vector potential that is calculated using it yields together with the Coulomb-gauge scalar potential the same electric and magnetic fields as those calculated with the Lorenz-gauge potentials.</description>

      <title>Mechanical Optimization of Skateboard Pumping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17671v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Skateboarders perform a reciprocating motion on a curved ramp, called pumping, by moving their bodies up and down perpendicular to the ramp's surface. We propose a simple mechanical model for this pumping motion and solve the equation of motion explicitly in angular coordinates. This allows us to derive an optimal control strategy to maximize amplitude by dynamically adjusting the center of mass of the skateboarder. This optimal strategy is compared to experimental results for the motion of a skilled and an unskilled skateboarder in a half-pipe, validating that a skilled skateboarder follows the optimal control strategy more closely.</description>
