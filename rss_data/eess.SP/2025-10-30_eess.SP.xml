      <title>Distributed learning for automatic modulation recognition in bandwidth-limited networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automatic Modulation Recognition (AMR) is critical in identifying various modulation types in wireless communication systems. Recent advancements in deep learning have facilitated the integration of algorithms into AMR techniques. However, this integration typically follows a centralized approach that necessitates collecting and processing all training data on high-powered computing devices, which may prove impractical for bandwidth-limited wireless networks. In response to this challenge, this study introduces two methods for distributed learning-based AMR on the collaboration of multiple receivers to perform AMR tasks. The TeMuRAMRD 2023 dataset is employed to support this investigation, uniquely suited for multi-receiver AMR tasks. Within this distributed sensing environment, multiple receivers collaborate in identifying modulation types from the same RF signal, each possessing a partial perspective of the overall environment. Experimental results demonstrate that the centralized-based AMR, with six receivers, attains an impressive accuracy rate of 91%, while individual receivers exhibit a notably lower accuracy, at around 41%. Nonetheless, the two proposed decentralized learning-based AMR methods exhibit noteworthy enhancements. Based on consensus voting among six receivers, the initial method achieves a marginally lower accuracy. It achieves this while substantially reducing the bandwidth demands to a 1/256th of the centralized model. With the second distributed method, each receiver shares its feature map, subsequently aggregated by a central node. This approach also accompanies a substantial bandwidth reduction of 1/8 compared to the centralized approach. These findings highlight the capacity of distributed AMR to significantly enhance accuracy while effectively addressing the constraints of bandwidth-limited wireless networks.</description>

      <title>Ambient Backscatter Communication Assisted by Fluid Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the integration of a fluid reconfigurable intelligent surface (FRIS) into ambient backscatter communication (AmBC) systems. Unlike conventional reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) with fixed position elements, FRIS employs fluidic elements that can dynamically adjust their positions, offering enhanced spatial adaptability. We develop a system model where an AmBC tag communicates with a reader through an FRIS, which is particularly beneficial in scenarios where the direct tag-to-reader link is weak or blocked by obstacles. The achievable backscatter rate is analyzed, and the optimization of FRIS element positions is formulated as a non-convex problem. To address this, we employ particle swarm optimization (PSO) to obtain near-optimal configurations of the fluid elements. Simulation results demonstrate that FRIS-aided AmBC significantly outperforms conventional RIS-based AmBC systems in terms of achievable throughput.</description>

      <title>Modelling Real-Life Cycling Decisions in Real Urban Settings Through Psychophysiology and LLM-Derived Contextual Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measuring emotional states in transportation contexts is an emerging field. Methods based on self-reported emotions are limited by their low granularity and their susceptibility to memory bias. In contrast, methods based on physiological indicators provide continuous data, enabling researchers to measure changes in emotional states with high detail and accuracy. Not only are emotions important in the analysis, but understanding what triggers emotional changes is equally important. Uncontrolled variables such as traffic conditions, pedestrian interactions, and infrastructure remain a significant challenge, as they can have a great impact on emotional states. Explaining the reasons behind these emotional states requires gathering sufficient and proper contextual data, which can be extremely difficult in real-world environments. This paper addresses these challenges by applying an innovative approach, extracting contextual data (expert annotator level) from recorded multimedia using large language models (LLMs). In this paper, data are collected from an urban cycling case study of the City of Santiago, Chile. The applied models focus on understanding how different environments and traffic situations affect the emotional states and behaviors of the participants using physiological data. Sequences of images, extracted from the recorded videos, are processed by LLMs to obtain semantic descriptions of the environment. These discrete, although dense and detailed, contextual data are integrated into a hybrid model, where fatigue and arousal serve as latent variables influencing observed cycling behaviors (inferred from GPS data) like waiting, accelerating, braking, etc. The study confirms that cycling decisions are influenced by stress-related emotions and highlights the strong impact of urban characteristics and traffic conditions on cyclist behavior.</description>

      <title>Aerial RIS-Enhanced Communications: Joint UAV Trajectory, Altitude Control, and Phase Shift Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has emerged as a pivotal technology for enhancing wireless networks. Compared to terrestrial RIS deployed on building facades, aerial RIS (ARIS) mounted on quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) offers superior flexibility and extended coverage. However, the inevitable tilt and altitude variations of a quadrotor UAV during flight may lead to severe beam misalignment, significantly degrading ARIS's performance. To address this challenge, we propose a Euler angles-based ARIS control scheme that jointly optimizes the altitude and trajectory of the ARIS by leveraging the UAV's dynamic model. Considering the constraints on ARIS flight energy consumption, flight safety, and the transmission power of a base station (BS), we jointly design the ARIS's altitude, trajectory, phase shifts, and BS beamforming to maximize the system sum-rate. Due to the continuous control nature of ARIS flight and the strong coupling among variables, we formulate the problem as a Markov decision process and adopt a soft actor-critic algorithm with prioritized experience replay to learn efficient ARIS control policies. Based on the optimized ARIS configuration, we further employ the water-filling and bisection method to efficiently determine the optimal BS beamforming. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms benchmarks in both convergence and communication performance, achieving approximately 14.4\% improvement in sum-rate. Moreover, in comparison to the fixed-horizontal ARIS scheme, the proposed scheme yields more adaptive trajectories and significantly mitigates performance degradation caused by ARIS tilting, demonstrating strong potential for practical ARIS deployment.</description>

      <title>Decoding non-invasive brain activity with novel deep-learning approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This thesis delves into the world of non-invasive electrophysiological brain signals like electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG), focusing on modelling and decoding such data. The research aims to investigate what happens in the brain when we perceive visual stimuli or engage in covert speech (inner speech) and enhance the decoding performance of such stimuli. The thesis is divided into two main sections, methodological and experimental work. A central concern in both sections is the large variability present in electrophysiological recordings, whether it be within-subject or between-subject variability, and to a certain extent between-dataset variability. In the methodological sections, we explore the potential of deep learning for brain decoding. We present advancements in decoding visual stimuli using linear models at the individual subject level. We then explore how deep learning techniques can be employed for group decoding, introducing new methods to deal with between-subject variability. Finally, we also explores novel forecasting models of MEG data based on convolutional and Transformer-based architectures. In particular, Transformer-based models demonstrate superior capabilities in generating signals that closely match real brain data, thereby enhancing the accuracy and reliability of modelling the brain's electrophysiology. In the experimental section, we present a unique dataset containing high-trial inner speech EEG, MEG, and preliminary optically pumped magnetometer (OPM) data. Our aim is to investigate different types of inner speech and push decoding performance by collecting a high number of trials and sessions from a few participants. However, the decoding results are found to be mostly negative, underscoring the difficulty of decoding inner speech.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interpreting and communicating electrocardiogram (ECG) findings are crucial yet challenging tasks in cardiovascular diagnosis, traditionally requiring significant expertise and precise clinical communication. This paper introduces Cardi-GPT, an advanced expert system designed to streamline ECG interpretation and enhance clinical communication through deep learning and natural language interaction. Cardi-GPT employs a 16-residual-block convolutional neural network (CNN) to process 12-lead ECG data, achieving a weighted accuracy of 0.6194 across 24 cardiac conditions. A novel fuzzification layer converts complex numerical outputs into clinically meaningful linguistic categories, while an integrated chatbot interface facilitates intuitive exploration of diagnostic insights and seamless communication between healthcare providers.
  The system was evaluated on a diverse dataset spanning six hospitals across four countries, demonstrating superior performance compared to baseline models. Additionally, Cardi-GPT achieved an impressive overall response quality score of 73\%, assessed using a comprehensive evaluation framework that measures coverage, grounding, and coherence. By bridging the gap between intricate ECG data interpretation and actionable clinical insights, Cardi-GPT represents a transformative innovation in cardiovascular healthcare, promising to improve diagnostic accuracy, clinical workflows, and patient outcomes across diverse medical settings.</description>

      <title>StrikeWatch: Wrist-worn Gait Recognition with Compact Time-series Models on Low-power FPGAs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Running offers substantial health benefits, but improper gait patterns can lead to injuries, particularly without expert feedback. While prior gait analysis systems based on cameras, insoles, or body-mounted sensors have demonstrated effectiveness, they are often bulky and limited to offline, post-run analysis. Wrist-worn wearables offer a more practical and non-intrusive alternative, yet enabling real-time gait recognition on such devices remains challenging due to noisy Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) signals, limited computing resources, and dependence on cloud connectivity. This paper introduces StrikeWatch, a compact wrist-worn system that performs entirely on-device, real-time gait recognition using IMU signals. As a case study, we target the detection of heel versus forefoot strikes to enable runners to self-correct harmful gait patterns through visual and auditory feedback during running. We propose four compact DL architectures (1D-CNN, 1D-SepCNN, LSTM, and Transformer) and optimize them for energy-efficient inference on two representative embedded Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs): the AMD Spartan-7 XC7S15 and the Lattice iCE40UP5K. Using our custom-built hardware prototype, we collect a labeled dataset from outdoor running sessions and evaluate all models via a fully automated deployment pipeline. Our results reveal clear trade-offs between model complexity and hardware efficiency. Evaluated across 12 participants, 6-bit quantized 1D-SepCNN achieves the highest average F1 score of 0.847 while consuming just 0.350 {\mu}J per inference with a latency of 0.140 ms on the iCE40UP5K running at 20 MHz. This configuration supports up to 13.6 days of continuous inference on a 320 mAh battery. All datasets and code are available in the GitHub repository https://github.com/tianheng-ling/StrikeWatch.</description>

      <title>Comparative Analysis of Data Augmentation for Clinical ECG Classification with STAR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Clinical 12-lead ECG classification remains difficult because of diverse recording conditions, overlapping pathologies, and pronounced label imbalance hinder generalization, while unconstrained augmentations risk distorting diagnostically critical morphology. In this study, Sinusoidal Time--Amplitude Resampling (STAR) is introduced as a beat-wise augmentation that operates strictly between successive R-peaks to apply controlled time warping and amplitude scaling to each R--R segment, preserving the canonical P--QRS--T order and leaving the head and tail of the trace unchanged. STAR is designed for practical pipelines and offers: (i) morphology-faithful variability that broadens training diversity without corrupting peaks or intervals; (ii) source-resilient training, improving stability across devices, sites, and cohorts without dataset-specific tuning; (iii) model-agnostic integration with common 1D SE--ResNet-style ECG encoders backbone; and (iv) better learning on rare classes via beat-level augmentation, reducing overfitting by resampling informative beats instead of duplicating whole records. In contrast to global crops, large shifts, or additive noise, STAR avoids transformations that suppress or misalign clinical landmarks. A complete Python implementation and a transparent training workflow are released, aligned with a source-aware, stratified five-fold protocol over a multi-institutional 12-lead corpus, thereby facilitating inspection and reuse. Taken together, STAR provides a simple and controllable augmentation for clinical ECG classification where trustworthy morphology, operational simplicity, and cross-source durability are essential.</description>

      <title>PulseFi: A Low Cost Robust Machine Learning System for Accurate Cardiopulmonary and Apnea Monitoring Using Channel State Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-intrusive monitoring of vital signs has become increasingly important in a variety of healthcare settings. In this paper, we present PulseFi, a novel low-cost non-intrusive system that uses Wi-Fi sensing and artificial intelligence to accurately and continuously monitor heart rate and breathing rate, as well as detect apnea events. PulseFi operates using low-cost commodity devices, making it more accessible and cost-effective. It uses a signal processing pipeline to process Wi-Fi telemetry data, specifically Channel State Information (CSI), that is fed into a custom low-compute Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network model. We evaluate PulseFi using two datasets: one that we collected locally using ESP32 devices and another that contains recordings of 118 participants collected using the Raspberry Pi 4B, making the latter the most comprehensive data set of its kind. Our results show that PulseFi can effectively estimate heart rate and breathing rate in a seemless non-intrusive way with comparable or better accuracy than multiple antenna systems that can be expensive and less accessible.</description>

      <title>EcoScaleNet: A Lightweight Multi Kernel Network for Long Sequence 12 lead ECG Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate interpretation of 12 lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) is critical for early detection of cardiac abnormalities, yet manual reading is error prone and existing CNN based classifiers struggle to choose receptive field sizes that generalize to the long sequences typical of ECGs. Omni Scale CNN (OS CNN) addresses this by enumerating prime sized kernels inspired by Goldbach conjecture to cover every scale, but its exhaustive design explodes computational cost and blocks deeper, wider models. We present Efficient Convolutional Omni Scale Network (EcoScale-Net), a hierarchical variant that retains full receptive field coverage while eliminating redundancy. At each stage, the maximum kernel length is capped to the scale still required after down sampling, and bottleneck convolutions inserted before and after every Omni Scale block curtail channel growth and fuse multi scale features. On the large scale CODE 15% ECG dataset, EcoScaleNet reduces parameters by 90% and FLOPs by 99% compared with OS CNN, while raising macro averaged F1 score by 2.4%. These results demonstrate that EcoScaleNet delivers SOTA accuracy for long sequence ECG classification at a fraction of the computational cost, enabling real time deployment on commodity hardware. Our EcoScaleNet code is available in GitHub Link.</description>

      <title>Opportunistic Screening of Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome using Single-Lead AI-ECG Mobile System: A Real-World Study of over 3.5 million ECG Recordings in China</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome is a congenital cardiac condition associated with sudden cardiac death, with a prevalence of 0.1-0.3%. Conventional screening relies on electrophysiological testing or 12-lead electrocardiography interpreted by cardiologists, which limits large-scale and cost-effective screening. Building on our previous work developing a single-lead AI-ECG mobile system for atrial fibrillation screening, this study evaluates its efficiency and effectiveness for opportunistic detection of WPW syndrome in real-world settings. This retrospective analysis included 3,566,626 single-lead ECG recordings from 87,836 individuals in China, collected using the NMPA-approved portable ECG device WenXinWuYang. The AI system performance was validated using cardiologist annotations and random sampling. We quantified AI-assisted workload reduction and compared review efficiency across AI-positive and user-initiated workflows. The AI system achieved 45.5% sensitivity and 95.9% specificity. A positive AI result indicated about 210 times higher risk of confirmed WPW. Focusing on AI-selected positives reduced physician workload by 99.5%, requiring only 12 reviews to confirm one WPW case, compared with 909 and 875 in population-wide and user-driven approaches. In conclusion, this large-scale real-world study demonstrates that a single-lead AI-ECG system enables efficient and practical opportunistic screening for WPW syndrome, significantly reducing physician workload and supporting population-based cardiovascular prevention.</description>

      <title>A Cylindrical Nanowire Array-Based Flexure-FET Receiver for Molecular Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular communication (MC) enables biocompatible and energy-efficient information transfer through chemical signaling, forming a foundational paradigm for emerging applications in the Internet of Nano Things (IoNT) and intrabody healthcare systems. The realization of this vision critically depends on developing advanced receiver architectures that merge nanoscale communication and networking techniques with bio-cyber interfaces, ensuring energy-efficient, reliable, and low-complexity modulation and detection while maintaining biocompatibility. To address these challenges, the Flexure-FET MC receiver was introduced as a mechanically transducing design capable of detecting both charged and neutral molecular species. In this study, we present a cylindrical nanowire array-based Flexure-FET MC receiver that enhances design versatility and scalability through distributed electromechanical coupling in a suspended-gate configuration. The proposed array architecture offers additional geometric degrees of freedom, including nanowire radius, length, spacing, and array size, providing a flexible framework that can be tailored to advanced MC scenarios. An analytical end-to-end model is developed to characterize the system's electromechanical response, noise behavior, and information-theoretic performance, including signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and channel capacity. The results reveal the strong interdependence between geometry, electromechanical dynamics, and molecular binding processes, enabling tunable control over sensitivity, noise characteristics, and communication capacity. The enhanced structural tunability and array configuration of the proposed design provide a flexible foundation for future mixture-based and spatially modulated MC systems, paving the way toward scalable and multifunctional receiver architectures within the IoNT framework.</description>

Abstract: Next Generation Media Access Control (NGMA) techniques have been designed to support diverse applications with heterogeneous priorities. In industrial cyber-physical systems (CPS), the number of connected devices and systems is expected to grow significantly, demanding dependable and prompt network services. In this work, we present a novel scheme, Dynamic Fragmentation-MAC (DyFrag-MAC) that offers dynamic, differentiated channel access to the traffic of various priorities. DyFrag-MAC works on fragmenting the data of normal priority in order to support early delivery of urgent priority data. In prior work, urgent priority data either had to wait for the complete transmission of lower-priority packets or relied on multi-channel protocols to gain access. We compared the proposed fragmentation scheme with FROG-MAC and industrial Deterministic and Synchronous Multi-channel Extension (i-DSME). FROG-MAC fragmented the lower priority packets, but did not adjust the fragment size dynamically, whereas i-DSME utilized multiple channels and adaptive contention mechanisms; both protocols lack the ability to preempt ongoing lower-priority transmissions. Hence, the performance evaluation in terms of average delay and throughput reveals better performance of DyFRAG-MAC for the heterogeneous traffic.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Next Generation Wireless BAN with Prioritized Access for Heterogeneous Traffic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient management of heterogeneous traffic with varying priorities is critical in Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs). The priority mechanisms embedded in Media Access Control (MAC) schemes largely govern the performance of WBAN in terms of reliability, delay and energy efficiency. Minimizing the delay between packet generation and reception is critical for enhancing WBAN performance and associated health outcomes; however, delay optimization must be tailored to each traffic priority. In this work, we proposed a novel priority-based MAC protocol, Adaptive and Dynamic Polling MAC for Prioritized Traffic (ADP2-MAC), designed to support heterogeneous traffic in WBANs. The protocol utilizes a probabilistic approach to dynamically determine channel polling/listening intervals. ADP2-MAC not only identifies traffic arrival patterns to determine optimal polling intervals but also interrupts the transmission of lower-priority data when urgent packets are expected. The performance of ADP2-MAC has been compared with the MAC protocol for Variable Data Rates (MVDR) which supports heterogeneous traffic by assigning different data rates based on traffic priority. ADP2-MAC outperforms MVDR due to its use of probabilistic polling intervals and an interruption mechanism designed to efficiently handle urgent-priority data.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Liquid Neural Network-Random Finite Set Filtering for Robust Maneuvering Object Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work addresses the problem of tracking maneuvering objects with complex motion patterns, a task in which conventional methods often struggle due to their reliance on predefined motion models. We integrate a data-driven liquid neural network (LNN) into the random finite set (RFS) framework, leading to two LNN-RFS filters. By learning continuous-time dynamics directly from data, the LNN enables the filters to adapt to complex, nonlinear motion and achieve accurate tracking of highly maneuvering objects in clutter. This hybrid approach preserves the inherent multi-object tracking strengths of the RFS framework while improving flexibility and robustness. Simulation results on challenging maneuvering scenarios demonstrate substantial gains of the proposed hybrid approach in tracking accuracy.</description>

      <title>Spectral and Energy Efficiency Tradeoff for Pinching-Antenna Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The joint transmit and pinching beamforming design for spectral efficiency (SE) and energy efficiency (EE) tradeoff in pinching-antenna systems (PASS) is proposed. Both PASS-enabled single- and multi-user communications are considered. In the single-user scenario, it is proved that the optimal pinching antenna (PA) positions are independent of the transmit beamforming. Based on this insight, a two-stage joint beamforming design is proposed. Specifically, in the first stage, an iterative closed-form refinement (ICR) scheme is proposed to align the phases of the received signals, based on which a PA placement framework is proposed. In the second stage, the closed-form solution for the optimal transmit beamformer is derived given the optimal PA positions. In the multi-user scenario, an alternating optimization (AO)-based joint beamforming design is proposed to balance the SE-EE performance while taking the quality-of-service (QoS) requirements into account. It is proved that the proposed AO-based algorithm is guaranteed to converge when no constraints are violated in PA placement subproblem. Numerical results demonstrate that: 1) the proposed algorithms significantly improve joint SE-EE performance with fast convergence speed; 2) the SE-EE tradeoff regime gap between PASS and conventional multi-antenna system widens as the number of PAs and service coverage increase.</description>

      <title>State Space and Self-Attention Collaborative Network with Feature Aggregation for DOA Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation for sound sources is challenging due to the continuous changes in acoustic characteristics across time and frequency. In such scenarios, accurate localization relies on the ability to aggregate relevant features and model temporal dependencies effectively. In time series modeling, achieving a balance between model performance and computational efficiency remains a significant challenge. To address this, we propose FA-Stateformer, a state space and self-attention collaborative network with feature aggregation. The proposed network first employs a feature aggregation module to enhance informative features across both temporal and spectral dimensions. This is followed by a lightweight Conformer architecture inspired by the squeeze-and-excitation mechanism, where the feedforward layers are compressed to reduce redundancy and parameter overhead. Additionally, a temporal shift mechanism is incorporated to expand the receptive field of convolutional layers while maintaining a compact kernel size. To further enhance sequence modeling capabilities, a bidirectional Mamba module is introduced, enabling efficient state-space-based representation of temporal dependencies in both forward and backward directions. The remaining self-attention layers are combined with the Mamba blocks, forming a collaborative modeling framework that achieves a balance between representation capacity and computational efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FA-Stateformer achieves superior performance and efficiency compared to conventional architectures.</description>

      <title>Cram\'er-Rao Bound Optimization for Movable Antenna-Empowered Integrated Sensing and Uplink Communication System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is a promising solution for the future sixth-generation (6G) system. However, classical fixed-position antenna (FPA) ISAC systems fail to fully utilize spatial degrees of freedom (DoFs), resulting in limited gains for both radar sensing and communication functionalities. This challenge can be addressed by the emerging novel movable antenna (MA) technology, which can pursue better channel conditions and improve sensing and communication performances. In this paper, we aim to minimize the Cram\'er-Rao bound (CRB) for estimating the target's angle while guaranteeing communication performance. This involves jointly optimizing active beamforming, power allocation, receiving filters, and MA position configurations, which is a highly non-convex problem. To tackle this difficulty, we propose an efficient iterative solution that analytically optimizes all variables without relying on numerical solvers, i.e., CVX. Specifically, by leveraging cutting-edge majorization-minimization (MM) and penalty-dual-decomposition (PDD) methods, we develop a low-complexity algorithm to solve the beamformer configuration problem containing the fractional and quartic terms. Numerical simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed algorithm, highlighting significant performance improvements achieved by employing MA in the ISAC system.</description>

      <title>Fair Rate Maximization for Multi-user Multi-cell MISO Communication Systems via Novel Transmissive RIS Transceiver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores a multi-cell multiple-input single-output (MISO) downlink communication system enabled by a unique transmissive reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) transceiver (TRTC) configuration. Within this system framework, we formulate an optimization problem for the purpose of maximizing the minimum rate of users for each cell via designing the transmit beamforming of the TRTC, subject to the power constraints of each TRTC unit. Since the objective function is non-differentiable, the max-min rate problem is difficult to solve. In order to tackle this challenging optimization problem, an efficient low-complexity optimization algorithm is developed. Specifically, the log-form rate function is transformed into a tractable form by employing the fractional programming (FP) methodology. Next, the max-min objective function can be approximated using a differentiable function derived from smooth approximation theory. Moreover, by applying the majorization-minimization (MM) technique and examining the optimality conditions, a solution is proposed that updates all variables analytically without relying on any numerical solvers. Numerical results are presented to demonstrate the convergence and effectiveness of the proposed low-complexity algorithm. Additionally, the algorithm can significantly reduce the computational complexity without performance loss. Furthermore, the simulation results illustrate the clear superiority of the deployment of the TRTC over the benchmark schemes.</description>

      <title>Millimeter-Wave Radar Sensing of Wombat Respiration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.25293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study demonstrates the feasibility of radar-based non-contact respiratory monitoring for wombats. Two measurement experiments were conducted in June and December 2024 using 79-GHz millimeter-wave radar systems to monitor the respiration of two wombats. To estimate the respiratory interval, we used a method based on summing harmonic components in the autocorrelation function, capturing the quasi-periodic displacement of the body surface caused by respiration. Estimation accuracy was evaluated through simultaneous measurements from different angles using two radar units. The respiratory interval and respiratory rate were measured with errors of 47.4 ms (2.44%) and 0.81 bpm (2.21%), respectively. We also discuss the differences in respiratory rates between the two wombats, as well as seasonal variations between June and December. The results support the potential application of this method to non-contact health monitoring of wombats.</description>

      <title>Low-Overhead CSI Prediction via Gaussian Process Regression -- Part~I: Data-Driven Spatial Interpolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate channel state information (CSI) is critical for current and next-generation multi-antenna systems. Yet conventional pilot-based estimators incur prohibitive overhead as antenna counts grow. In this paper, we address this challenge by developing a novel framework based on Gaussian process regression (GPR) that predicts full CSI from only a few observed entries, thereby reducing pilot overhead. The correlation between data points in GPR is defined by the covariance function, known as kernels. In the proposed GPR-based CSI estimation framework, we incorporate three kernels, i.e., radial basis function, Mat\'ern, and rational quadratic, to model smooth and multi-scale spatial correlations derived from the antenna array geometry. The proposed approach is evaluated across Kronecker and Weichselberger channel models with three distinct pilot probing schemes. Results show that the proposed GPR with 50% pilot saving achieves the lowest prediction error, the highest empirical 95% credible-interval coverage, and the best preservation of mutual information relative to benchmarks. This enables up to 50% pilot reduction while preserving over 92% of the link capacity.</description>

      <title>Model-Free Robust Beamforming in Satellite Downlink using Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Satellite-based communications are expected to be a substantial future market in 6G networks. As satellite constellations grow denser and transmission resources remain limited, frequency reuse plays an increasingly important role in managing inter-user interference. In the multi-user downlink, precoding enables the reuse of frequencies across spatially separated users, greatly improving spectral efficiency. The analytical calculation of suitable precodings for perfect channel information is well studied, however, their performance can quickly deteriorate when faced with, e.g., outdated channel state information or, as is particularly relevant for satellite channels, when position estimates are erroneous. Deriving robust precoders under imperfect channel state information is not only analytically intractable in general but often requires substantial relaxations of the optimization problem or heuristic constraints to obtain feasible solutions. Instead, in this paper we flexibly derive robust precoding algorithms from given data using reinforcement learning. We describe how we adapt the applied Soft Actor-Critic learning algorithm to the problem of downlink satellite beamforming and show numerically that the resulting precoding algorithm adjusts to all investigated scenarios. The considered scenarios cover both single satellite and cooperative multi-satellite beamforming, using either global or local channel state information, and two error models that represent increasing levels of uncertainty. We show that the learned algorithms match or markedly outperform two analytical baselines in sum rate performance, adapting to the required level of robustness. We also analyze the mechanisms that the learned algorithms leverage to achieve robustness. The implementation is publicly available for use and reproduction of the results.</description>

      <title>Adaptive End-to-End Transceiver Design for NextG Pilot-Free and CP-Free Wireless Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advent of artificial intelligence (AI)-native wireless communication is fundamentally reshaping the design paradigm of next-generation (NextG) systems, where intelligent air interfaces are expected to operate adaptively and efficiently in highly dynamic environments. Conventional orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems rely heavily on pilots and the cyclic prefix (CP), resulting in significant overhead and reduced spectral efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose an adaptive end-to-end (E2E) transceiver architecture tailored for pilot-free and CP-free wireless systems. The architecture combines AI-driven constellation shaping and a neural receiver through joint training. To enhance robustness against mismatched or time-varying channel conditions, we introduce a lightweight channel adapter (CA) module, which enables rapid adaptation with minimal computational overhead by updating only the CA parameters. Additionally, we present a framework that is scalable to multiple modulation orders within a unified model, significantly reducing model storage requirements. Moreover, to tackle the high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) inherent to OFDM, we incorporate constrained E2E training, achieving compliance with PAPR targets without additional transmission overhead. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed framework delivers superior bit error rate (BER), throughput, and resilience across diverse channel scenarios, highlighting its potential for AI-native NextG.</description>

      <title>Learning-Based Blockage-Resilient Beam Training in Near-Field Terahertz Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Terahertz (THz) band is considered a promising candidate to meet the high-throughput requirement for future sixth-generation (6G) wireless communications due to its ultrawide bandwidth. However, due to the high penetration loss at high-frequencies, blockage becomes a serious problem in THz communications, especially in near-field indoor communications with numerous obstacles. To address this issue, this paper investigates blockage-resilient near-field beam training based on self-accelerating Airy beam, which can propagate along a curved trajectory to circumvent obstacles. Specifically, we first analyze the trajectory of the Airy beam and the beam pattern at the receiver using a discrete Fourier transform (DFT) codebook in the presence of obstacles. Interestingly, we reveal that the beam pattern not only captures the receiver's location information but also implicitly encodes the spatial relationship between the receiver and obstacle, which facilitates identifying the optimal Airy beam configuration. Based on this insight, we formulate the blockage-resilient beam training task as a multitask learning problem and propose a lightweight attention-based multi-parameter beam training network (AMPBT-Net) to jointly predict the angle, distance, and curvature parameters of the optimal Airy beam based on the beam pattern. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that the Airy beam effectively mitigates blockage effects and the proposed scheme achieves comparable performance to exhaustive beam sweeping while significantly reducing training overhead.</description>

      <title>Echo-Conditioned Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models for Multi-Target Tracking in RF Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a dynamic radio frequency sensing system aiming to spatially track multiple targets over time. We develop a conditional denoising diffusion probabilistic model (C-DDPM)-assisted framework that learns the temporal evolution of target parameters by leveraging the noisy echo observations as conditioning features. The proposed framework integrates a variational autoencoder (VAE) for echo compression and utilizes classifier-free guidance to enhance conditional denoising. In each transmission block, VAE encodes the received echo into a latent representation that conditions DDPM to predict future target states, which are then used for codebook beam selection. Simulation results show that the proposed approach outperforms classical signal processing, filtering, and deep learning benchmarks. The C-DDPM-assisted framework achieves significantly lower estimation errors in both angle and distance tracking, demonstrating the potential of generative models for integrated sensing and communications.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Channel Estimation and Quantized Feedback for RIS Assisted Optical Wireless Communication Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a unified modeling, estimation, and feedback framework for reconfigurable intelligent surface RIS-assisted optical wireless links. The key modeling element is a long-exposure pixel gain that extends the classical diffraction-limited response by statistically averaging angular jitter and mispointing; it admits an exact real-integral form and captures boresight attenuation and progressive sidelobe filling. The end-to-end system couples free-space path loss, Beer--Lambert atmospheric extinction, pixel-level diffraction, and optical efficiency with a unitary-pilot least-squares channel estimator and quantized phase feedback. Analysis closely matches Monte Carlo simulations and yields concrete design rules: with a surface of N=64 pixels, pilot length $M=2N$, and pilot SNR=20 dB, the normalized mean-squared error is0.005, implying an effective-SNR loss of about 0.5 and a capacity penalty of 0.007bits-s. Six-bit phase quantization introduces no measurable additional penalty at these operating points, setting a practical benchmark for feedback resolution. Training overhead scales strongly with pixel geometry: halving pixel width (quartering pixel area) increases the pilot length required to maintain the same NMSE by roughly fourfold. The framework reconciles physical-optics modeling with estimation-and-feedback design and provides a principled basis for scalable link budgeting in RIS-assisted optical networks.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Beamforming and Power Allocation in ISAC via Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) is a key enabler in 6G networks, where sensing and communication capabilities are designed to complement and enhance each other. One of the main challenges in ISAC lies in resource allocation, which becomes computationally demanding in dynamic environments requiring real-time adaptation. In this paper, we propose a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based approach for dynamic beamforming and power allocation in ISAC systems. The DRL agent interacts with the environment and learns optimal strategies through trial and error, guided by predefined rewards. Simulation results show that the DRL-based solution converges within 2000 episodes and achieves up to 80\% of the spectral efficiency of a semidefinite relaxation (SDR) benchmark. More importantly, it offers a significant improvement in runtime performance, achieving decision times of around 20 ms compared to 4500 ms for the SDR method. Furthermore, compared with a Deep Q-Network (DQN) benchmark employing discrete beamforming, the proposed approach achieves approximately 30\% higher sum-rate with comparable runtime. These results highlight the potential of DRL for enabling real-time, high-performance ISAC in dynamic scenarios.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by Industry 4.0 applications, we consider quickest change detection (QCD) of an abrupt change in a process when its measurements are transmitted by a sensor over a lossy wireless link to a decision maker (DM). The sensor node samples measurements using a Bernoulli sampling process, and places the measurement samples in the transmit queue of its transmitter. The transmitter uses a retransmit-until-success transmission strategy to deliver packets to the DM over the lossy link, in which the packet losses are modeled as a Bernoulli process, with different loss probabilities before and after the change. We pose the QCD problem in the non-Bayesian setting under Lorden's framework, and propose a CUSUM algorithm. By defining a suitable Markov process, involving the DM measurements and the queue length process, we show that the problem reduces to QCD in a Markov process. Characterizing the information measure per measurement sample at the DM, we establish the asymptotic optimality of our algorithm when the false alarm rate tends to zero. Further, when the DM receives incomplete data due to channel loss, we present asymptotically optimal QCD algorithms by suitably modifying the CUSUM algorithm. We then explore the last-come-first-served (LCFS) queuing discipline at the sensor transmit queue to lower detection delay in the non-asymptotic case. Next, we consider the case of multiple sensors, each with its own wireless transmitter queue, and show that our analysis extends to the case of multiple homogeneous sensors. When the sensors are heterogeneous, we present a sensor scheduling algorithm that minimizes detection delay by balancing the trade-off between the age of the observations and their information content. Numerical analysis demonstrate trade-offs that can be used to optimize system design parameters in the non-asymptotic regime.</description>

      <title>Continuous subsurface property retrieval from sparse radar observations using physics informed neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Estimating subsurface dielectric properties is essential for applications ranging from environmental surveys of soils to nondestructive evaluation of concrete in infrastructure. Conventional wave inversion methods typically assume few discrete homogeneous layers and require dense measurements or strong prior knowledge of material boundaries, limiting scalability and accuracy in realistic settings where properties vary continuously. We present a physics informed machine learning framework that reconstructs subsurface permittivity as a fully neural, continuous function of depth, trained to satisfy both measurement data and Maxwells equations. We validate the framework with both simulations and custom built radar experiments on multilayered natural materials. Results show close agreement with in-situ permittivity measurements (R^2=0.93), with sensitivity to even subtle variations (Delta eps_r=2). Parametric analysis reveals that accurate profiles can be recovered with as few as three strategically placed sensors in two layer systems. This approach reframes subsurface inversion from boundary-driven to continuous property estimation, enabling accurate characterization of smooth permittivity variations and advancing electromagnetic imaging using low cost radar systems.</description>

      <title>PyDPF: A Python Package for Differentiable Particle Filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: State-space models (SSMs) are a widely used tool in time series analysis. In the complex systems that arise from real-world data, it is common to employ particle filtering (PF), an efficient Monte Carlo method for estimating the hidden state corresponding to a sequence of observations. Applying particle filtering requires specifying both the parametric form and the parameters of the system, which are often unknown and must be estimated. Gradient-based optimisation techniques cannot be applied directly to standard particle filters, as the filters themselves are not differentiable. However, several recently proposed methods modify the resampling step to make particle filtering differentiable. In this paper, we present an implementation of several such differentiable particle filters (DPFs) with a unified API built on the popular PyTorch framework. Our implementation makes these algorithms easily accessible to a broader research community and facilitates straightforward comparison between them. We validate our framework by reproducing experiments from several existing studies and demonstrate how DPFs can be applied to address several common challenges with state space modelling.</description>

      <title>Low Probability of Detection Communication Using Noncoherent Grassmannian Signaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a noncoherent low probability of detection (LPD) communication system based on direct sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) and Grassmannian signaling. Grassmannian constellations enhance covertness because they tend to follow a noise-like distribution. Simulations showed that Grassmannian signaling provides competitive bit error rates (BER) at low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes with low probability of detection at the unintended receiver compared to coherent schemes that use QPSK or QAM modulation formats and need pilots to perform channel estimation. The results suggest the practicality and security benefits of noncoherent Grassmannian signaling for LPD communications due to their improved covertness and performance.</description>

      <title>Blockage-Aware Multi-RIS WSR Maximization via Per-RIS Indexed Synchronization Sequences and Closed-Form Riemannian Updates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Millimeter-wave (mmWave) multi-user MIMO systems are highly vulnerable to blockage, and reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) have been proposed as a remedy. However, RIS links may themselves be blocked, while most prior works assume ideal RIS availability. We propose an end-to-end blockage-aware multi-RIS weighted sum-rate (WSR) optimization framework. The BS transmits short per-RIS indexed synchronization signals, enabling each user to identify blocked panels through a simple energy detection test. Based on the detected feasible sets, we jointly optimize the BS precoder and RIS phases via a Closed-form Riemannian Phase Alignment (CRPA) algorithm. CRPA provides unit-modulus-preserving closed-form updates, requiring no projection or line search, and ensures monotone ascent. Simulations validate reliable blockage detection and notable WSR and convergence gains over existing baselines.</description>

      <title>Combining SAR Simulators to Train ATR Models with Synthetic Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work aims to train Deep Learning models to perform Automatic Target Recognition (ATR) on Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images. To circumvent the lack of real labelled measurements, we resort to synthetic data produced by SAR simulators. Simulation offers full control over the virtual environment, which enables us to generate large and diversified datasets at will. However, simulations are intrinsically grounded on simplifying assumptions of the real world (i.e. physical models). Thus, synthetic datasets are not as representative as real measurements. Consequently, ATR models trained on synthetic images cannot generalize well on real measurements. Our contributions to this problem are twofold: on one hand, we demonstrate and quantify the impact of the simulation paradigm on the ATR. On the other hand, we propose a new approach to tackle the ATR problem: combine two SAR simulators that are grounded on different (but complementary) paradigms to produce synthetic datasets. To this end, we use two simulators: MOCEM, which is based on a scattering centers model approach, and Salsa, which resorts on a ray tracing strategy. We train ATR models using synthetic dataset generated both by MOCEM and Salsa and our Deep Learning approach called ADASCA. We reach an accuracy of almost 88 % on the MSTAR measurements.</description>

      <title>Disentangling Shared and Private Neural Dynamics with SPIRE: A Latent Modeling Framework for Deep Brain Stimulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Disentangling shared network-level dynamics from region-specific activity is a central challenge in modeling multi-region neural data. We introduce SPIRE (Shared-Private Inter-Regional Encoder), a deep multi-encoder autoencoder that factorizes recordings into shared and private latent subspaces with novel alignment and disentanglement losses. Trained solely on baseline data, SPIRE robustly recovers cross-regional structure and reveals how external perturbations reorganize it. On synthetic benchmarks with ground-truth latents, SPIRE outperforms classical probabilistic models under nonlinear distortions and temporal misalignments. Applied to intracranial deep brain stimulation (DBS) recordings, SPIRE shows that shared latents reliably encode stimulation-specific signatures that generalize across sites and frequencies. These results establish SPIRE as a practical, reproducible tool for analyzing multi-region neural dynamics under stimulation.</description>

      <title>AirCNN via Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces: Architecture Design and Implementation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces AirCNN, a novel paradigm for implementing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) via over-the-air (OTA) analog computation. By leveraging multiple reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) and transceiver designs, we engineer the ambient wireless propagation environment to emulate the operations of a CNN layer. To comprehensively evaluate AirCNN, we consider two types of CNNs, namely classic two-dimensional (2D) convolution (Conv2d) and light-weight convolution, i.e., depthwise separable convolution (ConvSD). For Conv2d realization via OTA computation, we propose and analyze two RIS-aided transmission architectures: multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) and multiple-input single-output (MISO), balancing transmission overhead and emulation performance. We jointly optimize all parameters, including the transmitter precoder, receiver combiner, and RIS phase shifts, under practical constraints such as transmit power budget and unit-modulus phase shift requirements. We further extend the framework to ConvSD, which requires distinct transmission strategies for depthwise and pointwise convolutions. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed AirCNN architectures can achieve satisfactory classification performance. Notably, Conv2d MISO consistently outperforms Conv2d MIMO across various settings, while for ConvSD, MISO is superior only under poor channel conditions. Moreover, employing multiple RISs significantly enhances performance compared to a single RIS, especially in line-of-sight (LoS)-dominated wireless environments.</description>

      <title>Deep Reinforcement Learning-Based Cooperative Rate Splitting for Satellite-to-Underground Communication Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25562v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reliable downlink communication in satellite-to-underground networks remains challenging due to severe signal attenuation caused by underground soil and refraction in the air-soil interface. To address this, we propose a novel cooperative rate-splitting (CRS)-aided transmission framework, where an aboveground relay decodes and forwards the common stream to underground devices (UDs). Based on this framework, we formulate a max-min fairness optimization problem that jointly optimizes power allocation, message splitting, and time slot scheduling to maximize the minimum achievable rate across UDs. To solve this high-dimensional non-convex problem under uncertain channels, we develop a deep reinforcement learning solution framework based on the proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm that integrates distribution-aware action modeling and a multi-branch actor network. Simulation results under a realistic underground pipeline monitoring scenario demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves average max-min rate gains exceeding $167\%$ over conventional benchmark strategies across various numbers of UDs and underground conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.25609v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce BOLT-GAN, a simple yet effective modification of the WGAN framework inspired by the Bayes Optimal Learning Threshold (BOLT). We show that with a Lipschitz continuous discriminator, BOLT-GAN implicitly minimizes a different metric distance than the Earth Mover (Wasserstein) distance and achieves better training stability. Empirical evaluations on four standard image generation benchmarks (CIFAR-10, CelebA-64, LSUN Bedroom-64, and LSUN Church-64) show that BOLT-GAN consistently outperforms WGAN, achieving 10-60% lower Frechet Inception Distance (FID). Our results suggest that BOLT is a broadly applicable principle for enhancing GAN training.</description>

      <title>Physics-Guided Conditional Diffusion Networks for Microwave Image Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A conditional latent-diffusion based framework for solving the electromagnetic inverse scattering problem associated with microwave imaging is introduced. This generative machine-learning model explicitly mirrors the non-uniqueness of the ill-posed inverse problem. Unlike existing inverse solvers utilizing deterministic machine learning techniques that produce a single reconstruction, the proposed latent-diffusion model generates multiple plausible permittivity maps conditioned on measured scattered-field data, thereby generating several potential instances in the range-space of the non-unique inverse mapping. A forward electromagnetic solver is integrated into the reconstruction pipeline as a physics-based evaluation mechanism. The space of candidate reconstructions form a distribution of possibilities consistent with the conditioning data and the member of this space yielding the lowest scattered-field data discrepancy between the predicted and measured scattered fields is reported as the final solution. Synthetic and experimental labeled datasets are used for training and evaluation of the model. An innovative labeled synthetic dataset is created that exemplifies a varied set of scattering features. Training of the model using this new dataset produces high quality permittivity reconstructions achieving improved generalization with excellent fidelity to shape recognition. The results highlight the potential of hybrid generative physics frameworks as a promising direction for robust, data-driven microwave imaging.</description>

      <title>Effect of Full Common Randomness Replication in Symmetric PIR on Graph-Based Replicated Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the problem of symmetric private information retrieval (SPIR) in settings where the database replication is modeled by a simple graph. Here, each vertex corresponds to a server, and a message is replicated on two servers if and only if there is an edge between them. To satisfy the requirement of database privacy, we let all the servers share some common randomness, independent of the messages. We aim to quantify the improvement in SPIR capacity, i.e., the maximum ratio of the number of desired and downloaded symbols, compared to the setting with graph-replicated common randomness. Towards this, we develop an algorithm to convert a class of PIR schemes into the corresponding SPIR schemes, thereby establishing a capacity lower bound on graphs for which such schemes exist. This includes the class of path and cyclic graphs for which we derive capacity upper bounds that are tighter than the trivial bounds given by the respective PIR capacities. For the special case of path graph with three vertices, we identify the SPIR capacity to be $\frac{1}{2}$.</description>

      <title>Efficient Localization of Directional Emitters via Joint Beampattern Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04364v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The localization of directional RF emitters presents significant challenges for electronic warfare applications. Traditional localization methods, designed for omnidirectional emitters, experience degraded performance when applied to directional sources due to pronounced received signal strength (RSS) modulations introduced by directive beampatterns. This paper presents a robust direct position determination (DPD) approach that jointly estimates emitter position and beampattern parameters by incorporating RSS modulation from both path attenuation and directional gain alongside angle of arrival (AOA) and time difference of arrival (TDOA) information. To address the computational challenge of joint optimization over position and beampattern parameters, we develop an alternating maximization algorithm that decomposes the four-dimensional search into efficient iterative two-dimensional optimizations using a generalized beampattern model. Cramer-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) analysis establishes theoretical performance limits, and numerical simulations demonstrate substantial improvements over conventional methods. At -10 dB SNR, the proposed approach achieves 49% to 61% error reduction compared to AOA-TDOA baselines, with performance approaching the CRLB above -10 dB. The algorithm converges rapidly, requiring 3 to 4 iterations on average, and exhibits robustness to beampattern model mismatch. A contrast-expanded half-power uncertainty metric is introduced to quantify localization confidence, revealing that the proposed method produces concentrated unimodal likelihood surfaces while conventional approaches generate spurious peaks. Sensitivity analysis demonstrates that optimal performance occurs when receivers are positioned at beampattern main lobe edges where RSS gradients are maximized.</description>

      <title>Fusing Bluetooth With Pedestrian Dead Reckoning: A Floor Plan-Assisted Positioning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09905v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Floor plans can provide valuable prior information that helps enhance the accuracy of indoor positioning systems. However, existing research typically faces challenges in efficiently leveraging floor plan information and applying it to complex indoor layouts. To fully exploit information from floor plans for positioning, we propose a floor plan-assisted fusion positioning algorithm (FP-BP) using Bluetooth low energy (BLE) and pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR). In the considered system, a user holding a smartphone walks through a positioning area with BLE beacons installed on the ceiling, and can locate himself in real time. In particular, FP-BP consists of two phases. In the offline phase, FP-BP programmatically extracts map features from a stylized floor plan based on their binary masks, and constructs a mapping function to identify the corresponding map feature of any given position on the map. In the online phase, FP-BP continuously computes BLE positions and PDR results from BLE signals and smartphone sensors, where a novel grid-based maximum likelihood estimation (GML) algorithm is introduced to enhance BLE positioning. Then, a particle filter is used to fuse them and obtain an initial estimate. Finally, FP-BP performs post-position correction to obtain the final position based on its specific map feature. Experimental results show that FP-BP can achieve a real-time mean positioning accuracy of 1.14 m, representing an improvement of over 29% compared to existing floor plan-fused baseline algorithms.</description>

      <title>Extended k-u Fading Model in mmWave Communication: Statistical Properties and Performance Evaluations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15681v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel small-scale fading model, named the extended k-u model, which incorporates the imbalance of multipath clusters by adding a new parameter based on the original k-u model. The extended k-u model has more accurate modeling capability than the extended {\eta}-u model in scenarios with line-of-sight (LoS) paths. Additionally, it is mathematically more tractable than the a-k-{\eta}-u model. The extended k-u model provides an effective channel modeling tool for millimeter (mmWave) LoS scenarios. Through theoretical derivations, we obtain closed-form expressions for the key statistical characteristics of this model, including the probability density function, the cumulative distribution function, moments of arbitrary order, and the moment generating function. Based on these statistics, this study further derives and analyzes the expressions for some performance metrics of the communication system, including the amount of fading, the probability of outage, the average bit error rate, and the effective rate. Using the measured fading data extracted from literature, which cover communication scenarios at 28 GHz, 65 GHz, and 92.5645 GHz with LoS paths, we apply the proposed model in mmWave scenarios and compare it with the k-u model and the extended {\eta}-u model. The results show that the extended k-u model has better capability in characterizing such fading than the other two models, verifying that this extension enhances its ability to model LoS mmWave scenarios.</description>

      <title>Vision-Intelligence-Enabled Beam Tracking for Cross-Interface Water-Air Optical Wireless Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21290v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid expansion of oceanic applications such as underwater surveillance and mineral exploration is driving the need for real-time wireless backhaul of massive observational data. Such demands are challenging to meet using the narrowband acoustic approach. Alternatively, optical wireless communication (OWC) has emerged as a promising solution for maritime and underwater networks owing to its high potential for broadband transmission. However, implementing water-air OWC remains challenging, particularly when signals penetrate the fluctuating interface, where dynamic refraction induces severe beam misalignment with airborne stations. This necessitates real-time transceiver alignment capable of adapting to complex oceanic dynamics, which remains largely unaddressed. Against this background, this paper establishes a mathematical channel model for water-air optical transmission across a time-varying sea surface. Based on the model, a vision-based beam tracking algorithm combining convolutional neural network and bi-directional long short-term memory with an attention mechanism is developed to extract key spatio-temporal features. Simulations verify that the proposed algorithm outperforms classical methods in maintaining received signal strength and suppressing vision noise, demonstrating its robustness for water-air OWC systems.</description>

      <title>NGGAN: Noise Generation GAN Based on the Practical Measurement Dataset for Narrowband Powerline Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01850v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To effectively process impulse noise for narrowband powerline communications (NB-PLCs) transceivers, capturing comprehensive statistics of nonperiodic asynchronous impulsive noise (APIN) is a critical task. However, existing mathematical noise generative models only capture part of the characteristics of noise. In this study, we propose a novel generative adversarial network (GAN) called noise generation GAN (NGGAN) that learns the complicated characteristics of practically measured noise samples for data synthesis. To closely match the statistics of complicated noise over the NB-PLC systems, we measured the NB-PLC noise via the analog coupling and bandpass filtering circuits of a commercial NB-PLC modem to build a realistic dataset. To train NGGAN, we adhere to the following principles: 1) we design the length of input signals that the NGGAN model can fit to facilitate cyclostationary noise generation; 2) the Wasserstein distance is used as a loss function to enhance the similarity between the generated noise and training data; and 3) to measure the similarity performances of GAN-based models based on the mathematical and practically measured datasets, we conduct both quantitative and qualitative analyses. The training datasets include: 1) a piecewise spectral cyclostationary Gaussian model (PSCGM); 2) a frequency-shift (FRESH) filter; and 3) practical measurements from NB-PLC systems. Simulation results demonstrate that the generated noise samples from the proposed NGGAN are highly close to the real noise samples. The principal component analysis (PCA) scatter plots and Fr\'echet inception distance (FID) analysis have shown that NGGAN outperforms other GAN-based models by generating noise samples with superior fidelity and higher diversity.</description>

      <title>Sensing Security in Near-Field ISAC: Exploiting Scatterers for Eavesdropper Deception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20140v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore sensing security in near-field (NF) integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) scenarios by exploiting known scatterers in the sensing scene. We propose a location deception (LD) scheme where scatterers are deliberately illuminated with probing power that is higher than that directed toward targets of interest, with the goal of deceiving potential eavesdroppers (Eves) with sensing capability into misidentifying scatterers as targets. While the known scatterers can be removed at the legitimate sensing receiver, our LD approach causes Eves to misdetect targets. Notably, this deception is achieved without requiring any prior information about the Eves' characteristics or locations. To strike a flexible three-way tradeoff among communication, sensing, and sensing-security performance, the sum rate and power allocated to scatterers are weighted and maximized under a legitimate radar signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraint. We employ the fractional programming (FP) framework and semidefinite relaxation (SDR) to solve this problem. To evaluate the security of the proposed LD scheme, the Cramer-Rao Bound (CRB) and mean squared error (MSE) metrics are employed. Additionally, we introduce the Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KLD) gap between targets and scatterers at Eve to quantify the impact of the proposed LD framework on Eve's sensing performance from an information-theoretical perspective. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed LD scheme can flexibly adjust the beamforming strategy according to performance requirements, thereby achieving the desired three-way tradeoff. In particular, in terms of sensing security, the proposed scheme significantly enhances the clutter signal strength at Eve's side, leading to confusion or even missed detection of the actual target.</description>

      <title>An Adversarial-Driven Experimental Study on Deep Learning for RF Fingerprinting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14109v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Radio frequency (RF) fingerprinting, which extracts unique hardware imperfections of radio devices, has emerged as a promising physical-layer device identification mechanism in zero trust architectures and beyond 5G networks. In particular, deep learning (DL) methods have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in this domain. However, existing approaches have primarily focused on enhancing system robustness against temporal and spatial variations in wireless environments, while the security vulnerabilities of these DL-based approaches have often been overlooked. In this work, we systematically investigate the security risks of DL-based RF fingerprinting systems through an adversarial-driven experimental analysis. We observe a consistent misclassification behavior for DL models under domain shifts, where a device is frequently misclassified as another specific one. Our analysis based on extensive real-world experiments demonstrates that this behavior can be exploited as an effective backdoor to enable external attackers to intrude into the system. Furthermore, we show that training DL models on raw received signals causes the models to entangle RF fingerprints with environmental and signal-pattern features, creating additional attack vectors that cannot be mitigated solely through post-processing security methods such as confidence thresholds.</description>

      <title>AL-CoLe: Augmented Lagrangian for Constrained Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20995v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the non-convexity of most modern machine learning parameterizations, Lagrangian duality has become a popular tool for addressing constrained learning problems. We revisit Augmented Lagrangian methods, which aim to mitigate the duality gap in non-convex settings while requiring only minimal modifications, and have remained comparably unexplored in constrained learning settings. We establish strong duality results under mild conditions, prove convergence of dual ascent algorithms to feasible and optimal primal solutions, and provide PAC-style generalization guarantees. Finally, we demonstrate its effectiveness on fairness constrained classification tasks.</description>
