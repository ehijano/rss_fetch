      <title>Quasi-stationary distribution for kinetic SDEs with low regularity coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider kinetic SDEs with low regularity coefficients in the setting recently introduced in [6]. For the solutions to such equations, we first prove a Harnack inequality. Using the abstract approach of [5], this inequality then allows us to prove, under a Lyapunov condition, the existence and uniqueness (in a suitable class of measures) of a quasi-stationary distribution in cylindrical domains of the phase space. We finally exhibit two settings in which the Lyapunov condition holds: general kinetic SDEs in domains which are bounded in position, and Langevin processes with a non-conservative force and a suitable growth condition on the force.</description>

      <title>Fractal behavior for nodal lines of smooth planar Gaussian fields at criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the study of the large scale geometry of the excursion set and nodal set of a planar smooth Gaussian field at criticality $\ell=\ell_c=0$. We prove that there exists $s_1&gt;1$ such that with high probability, macroscopic nodal lines in a box of size $\lambda$ are of length at least $\lambda^{s_1}$. As an application, on the event that a box is crossed by a nodal line, then the shortest crossing is of length at least $\lambda^{s_1}$. We also prove that there exists $s_2&lt;2$ such that with high probability, the shortest crossing is non degenerated, that is, its length is at most $\lambda^{s_2}$. The argument for the lower bound is based on a celebrated paper of Aizenman and Burchard [1] that provides a general argument to show that random curves present a fractal behavior. For the upper bound, our proof relies on the polynomial decay of the probability of one-arm events which was proven in [4].</description>

      <title>Two-sided infinite self-avoiding walk in high dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct the two-sided infinite self-avoiding walk (SAW) on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ for $d\geq5$ and use it to prove pattern theorems for the self-avoiding walk. We show that infinite two-sided SAW is the infinite-shift limit of infinite one-sided SAW and the infinite-size limit of finite two-sided SAW. We then prove that for every pattern $\zeta$, the fraction of times $\zeta$ occurs in the SAW converges to the probability that the two-sided infinite SAW starts with $\zeta$. The convergence is in probability for the finite SAW and almost surely for the infinite SAW. Along the way, we show that infinite SAW is ergodic using a coupling technique. At the end of the paper, we pose a conjecture regarding the existence of infinite SAW in low dimensions. We show that this conjecture is true in high dimensions, thus giving a new proof for the existence of infinite SAW for $d\geq5$. The proofs in this paper rely only on the asymptotics for the number of self-avoiding paths and the SAW two-point function. Although these results were shown by Hara and Slade using the lace expansion, the proofs in this paper do not use the lace expansion and might be adapted to prove existence and ergodicity of other infinite high-dimensional lattice models.</description>

      <title>Weighted $L^p~(p\geq1)$ solutions of random time horizon BSDEs with stochastic monotonicity generators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we are concerned with a multidimensional backward stochastic differential equation (BSDE) with a general random terminal time $\tau$, which may take values in $[0,+\infty]$. Firstly, we establish an existence and uniqueness result for a weighted $L^p~(p&gt;1)$ solution of the preceding BSDE with generator $g$ satisfying a stochastic monotonicity condition with general growth in the first unknown variable $y$ and a stochastic Lipschitz continuity condition in the second unknown variable $z$. Then, we derive an existence and uniqueness result for a weighted $L^1$ solution of the preceding BSDE under an additional stochastic sub-linear growth condition in $z$. These results generalize the corresponding ones obtained in \cite{Li2024} to the $L^p~(p\geq 1)$ solution case. Finally, the corresponding comparison theorems for the weighted $L^p~(p\geq1)$ solutions are also put forward and verified in the one-dimensional setting. In particular, we develop new ideas and systematical techniques in order to establish the above results.</description>

      <title>Fluctuation exponents of the half-space KPZ at stationarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the half-space KPZ equation with a Neumann boundary condition, starting from stationary Brownian initial data. We derive a variance identity that links the fluctuations of the height function to the transversal fluctuations of a half-space polymer model. Utilizing this identity, we establish optimal fluctuation exponents for the height function in both the subcritical and critical regimes, along with corresponding estimates for the polymer endpoint. Additionally, we explicitly compute the average growth rate as a function of the boundary parameter.</description>

      <title>Paths of Stochastic Processes: a Sudden Turnaround</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The commonly accepted definition of paths starts from a random field but ignores the problem of setting joint distributions of infinitely many random variables for defining paths properly afterwards. This paper provides a turnaround that starts with a given covariance function, then defines paths and finally a random field. We show how this approach retains essentially the same properties for Gaussian fields while allowing to construct random fields whose finite dimensional distributions are not Gaussian. Specifically, we start with a kernel $C$ and the associated Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space ${\cal H}(C)$, and then assign standardized random values to a deterministic orthonormal expansion in ${\cal H}(C)$. This yields paths as random functions with an explicit representation formula. Using Lo\'eve isometry, we prove that pointwise regularity notions like continuity or differentiability hold on functions of ${\cal H}(C)$, paths, and the random field $R_C$ in precisely the same way. Yet, norms of paths as functions behave differently, as we prove that paths are a.s. not in ${\cal H}(C)$, but in certain larger spaces that can partially be characterized. In case of Matern kernels generating Sobolev space $W_2^m(R^d)$, paths lie almost surely in all $W_2^{p}(R^d)$ for $p&lt;m-d/2$, but almost surely not in $W_2^{m-d/2}(R^d)$. This regularity gap between function and paths is explained easily by square summability of expansion coefficients of functions, not of paths. The required orthonormal expansions, well-known in the probabilistic and the deterministic literature, are analyzed and compared with respect to convergence rates.</description>

      <title>Dipole Formation in the Two-Component Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the two-dimensional two-component plasma, or Coulomb gas, consisting of $N$ positive and $N$ negative charges with logarithmic interaction. We introduce a suitable regularization of the interaction by smearing the charges over a small length scale $\lambda$, which allows us to give meaning to the system in the continuum at any temperature. We provide an expansion of the free energy in terms of the inverse temperature $\beta$, as $N \to \infty$ and $\lambda \to 0$. Doing so allows us to show that, for $\beta \geq 2$, the charges (for the most part) pair into neutral dipoles of very small size as $\lambda \to 0$. This complements the prior work of Lebl\'e, Zeitouni, and the second author, which proved that this does not happen for $\beta &lt; 2$, thereby implying a transition at $\beta = 2$ from free charges to dipole pairs. Moreover, we obtain an estimate on the size of linear statistics.
  The description in terms of dipoles is made via a decomposition into nearest-neighbor graphs of the point configurations, \`a la Gunson-Panta. This is combined with new energy estimates obtained via an electric reformulation of the interaction energy and a ball-growth method, which are expressed in terms of the nearest-neighbor graph distances only. In this way, the model is compared to a reduced nearest-neighbor interaction model, by showing the relative smallness of the dipole-dipole interactions.</description>

      <title>Phase Transition in Ferromagnetic $q-$state Models: Contours, Long-Range Interactions and Decaying Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the group structure of the state space of $q-$state models and a new definition of contour for long-range spin-systems in $\mathbb{Z}^d$, with $d\geq 2$, a multidimensional version of Fr\"{o}hlich-Spencer contours, we prove the phase transition for a class of ferromagnetic long-range systems which includes the Clock and Potts models. Our arguments work for the entire region of exponents of regular power-law interactions, namely $\alpha &gt; d$, and for any $q \geq 2$. As an application, we prove the phase transition for Potts models with decaying fields when the field decays fast enough.</description>

      <title>CSIM: A Copula-based similarity index sensitive to local changes for Image quality assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01411v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Image similarity metrics play an important role in computer vision applications, as they are used in image processing, computer vision and machine learning. Furthermore, those metrics enable tasks such as image retrieval, object recognition and quality assessment, essential in fields like healthcare, astronomy and surveillance. Existing metrics, such as PSNR, MSE, SSIM, ISSM and FSIM, often face limitations in terms of either speed, complexity or sensitivity to small changes in images. To address these challenges, a novel image similarity metric, namely CSIM, that combines real-time while being sensitive to subtle image variations is investigated in this paper. The novel metric uses Gaussian Copula from probability theory to transform an image into vectors of pixel distribution associated to local image patches. These vectors contain, in addition to intensities and pixel positions, information on the dependencies between pixel values, capturing the structural relationships within the image. By leveraging the properties of Copulas, CSIM effectively models the joint distribution of pixel intensities, enabling a more nuanced comparison of image patches making it more sensitive to local changes compared to other metrics. Experimental results demonstrate that CSIM outperforms existing similarity metrics in various image distortion scenarios, including noise, compression artifacts and blur. The metric's ability to detect subtle differences makes it suitable for applications requiring high precision, such as medical imaging, where the detection of minor anomalies can be of a high importance. The results obtained in this work can be reproduced from this Github repository: https://github.com/safouaneelg/copulasimilarity.</description>

      <title>Regularized e-processes: anytime valid inference with knowledge-based efficiency gains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classical statistical methods have theoretical justification when the sample size is predetermined by the data-collection plan. In applications, however, it's often the case that sample sizes aren't predetermined; instead, investigators might use the data observed along the way to make on-the-fly decisions about when to stop data collection. Since those methods designed for static sample sizes aren't reliable when sample sizes are dynamic, there's been a recent surge of interest in e-processes and the corresponding tests and confidence sets that are anytime valid in the sense that their justification holds up for arbitrary dynamic data-collection plans. But if the investigator has relevant-yet-incomplete prior information about the quantity of interest, then there's an opportunity for efficiency gain, but existing approaches can't accommodate this. Here I build a new, regularized e-process framework that features a knowledge-based, imprecise-probabilistic regularization that offers improved efficiency. A generalized version of Ville's inequality is established, ensuring that inference based on the regularized e-process remains anytime valid in a novel, knowledge-dependent sense. In addition to anytime valid hypothesis tests and confidence sets, the proposed regularized e-processes facilitate possibility-theoretic uncertainty quantification with strong frequentist-like calibration properties and other Bayesian-like features: satisfies the likelihood principle, avoids sure-loss, and offers formal decision-making with reliability guarantees.</description>

Abstract: We revisit the Bootstrap Percolation model, leveraging recent mathematical advances linking it with its local counterpart. This new perspective resolves, for the first time, historic discrepancies between Monte Carlo simulations and theoretical results: previously, those predictions disagreed even in the first-order asymptotics of the model. In contrast, our framework achieves excellent agreement between numerics and theory, which now match up to the third-order expansion, as the infection probability approaches zero. Our algorithm allows us to generate novel predictions for the model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish Krylov-Safonov type H\"older regularity theory for solutions to quite general discrete dynamic programming equations or equivalently discrete stochastic processes on random geometric graphs. Such graphs arise for example from data clouds in graph-based machine learning. The results actually hold to functions satisfying Pucci-type extremal inequalities, and thus we cover many examples including tug-of-war games on random geometric graphs. As an application we show that under suitable assumptions when the number of data points increases, the graph functions converge to a solution of a partial differential equation.</description>

      <title>Integrable Matrix Probabilistic Diffusions and the Matrix Stochastic Heat Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a matrix version of the stochastic heat equation, the MSHE, and obtain its explicit invariant measure in spatial dimension $D=1$. We show that it is classically integrable in the weak-noise regime, in terms of the matrix extension of the imaginary-time $1D$ nonlinear Schrodinger equation which allows us to study its short-time large deviations through inverse scattering. The MSHE can be viewed as a continuum limit of the matrix log Gamma polymer on the square lattice introduced recently. We also show classical integrability of that discrete model, as well as of other extensions such as of the semi-discrete matrix O'Connell-Yor polymer and the matrix strict-weak polymer. For all these models, we obtain the Lax pairs of their weak-noise regime, as well as the invariant measure, using a fluctuation--dissipation transformation on the dynamical action.</description>

      <title>On the asymptotic normality of persistent Betti numbers</title>

      <description>arXiv:1903.03280v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Persistent Betti numbers are a major tool in persistent homology, a subfield of topological data analysis. Many tools in persistent homology rely on the properties of persistent Betti numbers considered as a two-dimensional stochastic process $ (r,s) \mapsto n^{-1/2} (\beta^{r,s}_q ( \mathcal{K}(n^{1/d} \mathcal{X}_n))-\mathbb{E}[\beta^{r,s}_q ( \mathcal{K}( n^{1/d} \mathcal{X}_n))])$. So far, pointwise limit theorems have been established in different settings. In particular, the pointwise asymptotic normality of (persistent) Betti numbers has been established for stationary Poisson processes and binomial processes with constant intensity function in the so-called critical (or thermodynamic) regime, see Yogeshwaran et al. [2017] and Hiraoka et al. [2018].
  In this contribution, we derive a strong stabilization property (in the spirit of Penrose and Yukich [2001] of persistent Betti numbers and generalize the existing results on the asymptotic normality to the multivariate case and to a broader class of underlying Poisson and binomial processes. Most importantly, we show that the multivariate asymptotic normality holds for all pairs $(r,s)$, $0\le r\le s&lt;\infty$, and that it is not affected by percolation effects in the underlying random geometric graph.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic behaviour of the noisy voter model density process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.01478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.01478v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a transition matrix $P$ indexed by a finite set $V$ of vertices, the voter model is a discrete-time Markov chain in $\{0,1\}^V$ where at each time-step a randomly chosen vertex $x$ imitates the opinion of vertex $y$ with probability $P(x,y)$. The noisy voter model is a variation of the voter model in which vertices may change their opinions by the action of an external noise. The strength of this noise is measured by an extra parameter $p \in [0,1]$.
  In this work we analyse the density process, defined as the stationary mass of vertices with opinion 1, i.e. $S_t = \sum_{x\in V} \pi(x)\xi_t(x)$, where $\pi$ is the stationary distribution of $P$, and $\xi_t(x)$ is the opinion of vertex $x$ at time $t$. We investigate the asymptotic behaviour of $S_t$ when $t$ tends to infinity for different values of the noise parameter $p$. In particular, by allowing $P$ and $p$ to be functions of the size $|V|$, we show that, under appropriate conditions and small enough $p$ a normalised version of $S_t$ converges to a Gaussian random variable, while for large enough $p$, $S_t$ converges to a Bernoulli random variable. We provide further analysis of the noisy voter model on a variety of specific graphs including the complete graph, cycle, torus and hypercube, where we identify the critical rate $p$ (depending on the size $|V|$) that separates these two asymptotic behaviours.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2203.10874v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the evolution of an (infinitely large) population under recombination and additional evolutionary forces, modelled by a measure-valued ordinary differential equation. We provide a stochastic representation for the solution of this model via duality to a new labelled partitioning process with Markovian labels. In the special case of single-crossover, this leads to a recursive solution formula. This extends (and unifies) previous results on the selection-recombination equation. As a concrete example, we consider the selection-mutation-recombination equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.13831v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we discover that the class of random polynomials arising from the equilibrium analysis of random asymmetric evolutionary games is \textit{exactly} the Kostlan-Shub-Smale system of random polynomials, revealing an intriguing connection between evolutionary game theory and the theory of random polynomials. Through this connection, we analytically characterize the statistics of the number of internal equilibria of random asymmetric evolutionary games, namely its mean value, probability distribution, central limit theorem and universality phenomena. Biologically, these quantities enable prediction of the levels of social and biological diversity as well as the overall complexity in a dynamical system. By comparing symmetric and asymmetric random games, we establish that symmetry in group interactions increases the expected number of internal equilibria. Our research establishes new theoretical understanding of asymmetric evolutionary games and highlights the significance of symmetry and asymmetry in group interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.11801v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A Galton-Watson process in a varying environment is a discrete time branching process where the offspring distributions vary among generations. It is known that in the critical case, these processes have a Yaglom limit, that is, a suitable normalization of the process conditioned on non-extinction converges in distribution to a standard exponential random variable. In this manuscript, we provide the rate of convergence of the Yaglom limit with respect to the Wasserstein metric.</description>

Abstract: In classical optimal transport, the contributions of Benamou$-$Brenier and McCann regarding the time-dependent version of the problem are cornerstones of the field and form the basis for a variety of applications in other mathematical areas.
  Stretched Brownian motion provides an analogue for the martingale version of this problem. In this article we provide a characterization in terms of gradients of convex functions, similar to the characterization of optimizers in the classical transport problem for quadratic distance cost.</description>

      <title>Fitting an ellipsoid to a quadratic number of random points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.01181v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem $(\mathrm{P})$ of fitting $n$ standard Gaussian random vectors in $\mathbb{R}^d$ to the boundary of a centered ellipsoid, as $n, d \to \infty$. This problem is conjectured to have a sharp feasibility transition: for any $\varepsilon &gt; 0$, if $n \leq (1 - \varepsilon) d^2 / 4$ then $(\mathrm{P})$ has a solution with high probability, while $(\mathrm{P})$ has no solutions with high probability if $n \geq (1 + \varepsilon) d^2 /4$. So far, only a trivial bound $n \geq d^2 / 2$ is known on the negative side, while the best results on the positive side assume $n \leq d^2 / \mathrm{polylog}(d)$. In this work, we improve over previous approaches using a key result of Bartl &amp; Mendelson (2022) on the concentration of Gram matrices of random vectors under mild assumptions on their tail behavior. This allows us to give a simple proof that $(\mathrm{P})$ is feasible with high probability when $n \leq d^2 / C$, for a (possibly large) constant $C &gt; 0$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.02406v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the mixing time of the symmetric beta-binomial splitting process on finite weighted connected graphs $G=(V,E,\{r_e\}_{e\in E})$ with vertex set $V$, edge set $E$ and positive edge-weights $r_e&gt;0$ for $e\in E$. This is an interacting particle system with a fixed number of particles that updates through vertex-pairwise interactions which redistribute particles. We show that the mixing time of this process can be upper-bounded in terms of the maximal expected meeting time of two independent random walks on $G$. Our techniques involve using a process similar to the chameleon process invented by Morris (2006) to bound the mixing time of the exclusion process.</description>

      <title>Polynomial growth in degree-dependent first passage percolation on spatial random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.11880v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study a version of (non-Markovian) first passage percolation on graphs, where the transmission time between two connected vertices is non-iid, but increases by a penalty factor polynomial in their expected degrees. Based on the exponent of the penalty-polynomial, this makes it increasingly harder to transmit to and from high-degree vertices. This choice is motivated by awareness or time-limitations. For the iid part of the transmission times we allow any nonnegative distribution with regularly varying behaviour at $0$. For the underlying graph models we choose spatial random graphs that have power-law degree distributions, so that the effect of the penalisation becomes visible: (finite and infinite) Geometric Inhomogeneous Random Graphs, and Scale-Free Percolation. In these spatial models, the connection probability between two vertices depends on their spatial distance and on their expected degrees. We prove that upon increasing the penalty exponent, the transmission time between two far away vertices $x,y$ sweeps through four universal phases even for a single underlying graph: explosive (tight transmission times), polylogarithmic, polynomial but sublinear ($|x-y|^{\eta_0+o(1)}$ for an explicit $\eta_0&lt;1$), and linear ($\Theta(|x-y|)$) in their Euclidean distance. Further, none of these phases are restricted to phase boundaries, and those are non-trivial in the main model parameters: the tail of the degree-distribution, a long-range parameter, and the exponent of regular variation of the iid part of the transmission times. In this paper we present proofs of lower bounds for the latter two phases and the upper bound for the linear phase. These complement the matching upper bounds for the polynomial regime in our companion paper.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15779v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is divided into two parts. The first part reviews the formulae for f-divergences in the study of continuous-time Markov processes and explores their applications in areas such as stochastic stability, the second law of thermodynamics, and its non-equilibrium extensions. This sets the foundation for the second part, which focuses on f-divergence in the study of hidden Markov processes. In this context, we present analyses of filter stability and stochastic thermodynamics, with the latter being used to illustrate the concept of a Maxwell demon in an over-damped Langevin model with white noise observations. The paper's expository style and unified formalism for both Markov and hidden Markov processes aim to serve as a valuable resource for researchers working across related fields.</description>

Abstract: If one seeks to estimate the total variation between two product measures $||P^\otimes_{1:n}-Q^\otimes_{1:n}||$ in terms of their marginal TV sequence $\delta=(||P_1-Q_1||,||P_2-Q_2||,\ldots,||P_n-Q_n||)$, then trivial upper and lower bounds are provided by$ ||\delta||_\infty \le ||P^\otimes_{1:n}-Q^\otimes_{1:n}||\le||\delta||_1$. We improve the lower bound to $||\delta||_2\lesssim||P^\otimes_{1:n}-Q^\otimes_{1:n}||$, thereby reducing the gap between the upper and lower bounds from $\sim n$ to $\sim\sqrt $. Furthermore, we show that {\em any} estimate on $||P^\otimes_{1:n}-Q^\otimes_{1:n}||$ expressed in terms of $\delta$ must necessarily exhibit a gap of $\sim\sqrt n$ between the upper and lower bounds in the worst case, establishing a sense in which our estimate is optimal. Finally, we identify a natural class of distributions for which $||\delta||_2$ approximates the TV distance up to absolute multiplicative constants.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15728v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show marginal stability of near-ground states in spherical spin glasses is equivalent to full replica symmetry breaking at zero temperature near overlap $1$. This connection has long been implicit in the physics literature, which also links marginal stability to the performance of efficient algorithms. For even models, we prove the Hessian has no outlier eigenvalues, and obtain geometric consequences for low temperature Gibbs measures in the case that marginal stability is absent. Our proofs rely on interpolation bounds for vector spin glass models. For generic models, we give another more conceptual argument that full RSB near overlap $1$ implies marginal stability at low temperature.</description>

      <title>Simulating Simple Random Walks With a Deck of Cards</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00831v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When we want to simulate the realization of a symmetric simple random walk on $\mathbb Z^d$, we use $(2d)$-side fair dice to decide to which neighbor it jumps at each step if $d\geq 2$ or we simply use a fair coin when $d=1$. Assume that instead of using a dice or a coin we want to do a simulation using a well shuffled deck with $K$ cards of each of the $2d$ suits. In the first step the probability of jumping to each neighbor is $(2d)^{-1}$, but from the second step it becomes biased. Of course if we continue performing this simulation, the total variation distance between its law and the law of the random walk will increase until all cards are used. In this paper we investigate the minimum number of cards $N=2d K$ that a deck must contain so that the total variation distance between the law of a $n$-step simulation and the law of a $n$-step realization of the random walk is smaller than a chosen threshold $\varepsilon \in (0,1)$. More generally, we prove that when $N=cn$ this distance converges, as $n \to \infty$, to a Gaussian profile which depends on $c\geq 2d$. Furthermore, our analysis shows that this Gaussian profile vanishes as $c \to \infty$, proving the convergence of a multivariate hypergeometric distribution to a multinomial distribution in total variation.</description>

      <title>The local weak limit of $k$-dimensional hypertrees</title>

      <description>arXiv:2101.11504v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{C}(n,k)$ be the set of $k$-dimensional simplicial complexes $C$ over a fixed set of $n$ vertices such that:
  (1) $C$ has a complete $k-1$-skeleton;
  (2) $C$ has precisely ${{n-1}\choose {k}}$ $k$-faces;
  (3) the homology group $H_{k-1}(C)$ is finite.
  Consider the probability measure on $\mathcal{C}(n,k)$ where the probability of a simplicial complex $C$ is proportional to $|H_{k-1}(C)|^2$. For any fixed $k$, we determine the local weak limit of these random simplicial complexes as $n$ tends to infinity.
  This local weak limit turns out to be the same as the local weak limit of the $1$-out $k$-complexes investigated by Linial and Peled.</description>

      <title>Estimation of on- and off-time distributions in a dynamic Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14531v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we consider a dynamic Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graph in which edges, according to an alternating renewal process, change from present to absent and vice versa. The objective is to estimate the on- and off-time distributions while only observing the aggregate number of edges. This inverse problem is dealt with, in a parametric context, by setting up an estimator based on the method of moments. We provide conditions under which the estimator is asymptotically normal, and we point out how the corresponding covariance matrix can be identified. It is also demonstrated how to adapt the estimation procedure if alternative subgraph counts are observed, such as the number of wedges or triangles.</description>

      <title>Global smooth solutions by transport noise of 3D Navier-Stokes equations with small hyperviscosity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09267v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The existence of global smooth solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations (NSEs) with hyperviscosity $(-\Delta)^{\gamma}$ is open unless $\gamma $ is close to the J.-L. Lions exponent $ \frac{5}{4}$ at which the energy balance is strong enough to prevent singularity formation. If $1&lt;\gamma \ll \frac{5}{4}$, then the global well-posedness of the hyperviscous NSEs is widely open as for the usual NSEs. In this paper, for all $\gamma&gt;1$, we show the existence of a transport noise for which global smooth solutions to the stochastic hyperviscous NSEs on the three-dimensional torus exist with high probability. In particular, a suitable transport noise considerably improves the known well-posedness results in the deterministic setting.</description>

      <title>Generalized Gaussian Temporal Difference Error for Uncertainty-aware Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02295v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conventional uncertainty-aware temporal difference (TD) learning methods often rely on simplistic assumptions, typically including a zero-mean Gaussian distribution for TD errors. Such oversimplification can lead to inaccurate error representations and compromised uncertainty estimation. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for generalized Gaussian error modeling in deep reinforcement learning, applicable to both discrete and continuous control settings. Our framework enhances the flexibility of error distribution modeling by incorporating additional higher-order moment, particularly kurtosis, thereby improving the estimation and mitigation of data-dependent noise, i.e., aleatoric uncertainty. We examine the influence of the shape parameter of the generalized Gaussian distribution (GGD) on aleatoric uncertainty and provide a closed-form expression that demonstrates an inverse relationship between uncertainty and the shape parameter. Additionally, we propose a theoretically grounded weighting scheme to fully leverage the GGD. To address epistemic uncertainty, we enhance the batch inverse variance weighting by incorporating bias reduction and kurtosis considerations, resulting in improved robustness. Extensive experimental evaluations using policy gradient algorithms demonstrate the consistent efficacy of our method, showcasing significant performance improvements.</description>
