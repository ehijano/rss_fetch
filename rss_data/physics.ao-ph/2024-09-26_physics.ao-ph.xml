      <title>Identification of extreme weather events and impacts of the disasters in Brazil</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An important consequence of human-induced climate change emerges through extreme weather events. The impact of extreme weather events is quantified in some parts of the globe, but it remains underestimated in several countries. In this work we first quantify the extreme temperature and precipitation events in Brazil using data from the Brazilian Institute of Meteorology, which includes 634 meteorological stations that have worked intermittently since 1961. We show that the anomaly in temperature has increased by more than 1{\deg}C in the last 60 years and that extreme events are heterogeneously distributed in the country. In terms of precipitation, our analyses show that it is getting drier in the Northwest region of Brazil while excessive precipitation events are increasing in the South, in agreement with previous works. We then use data from S2iD, an official database that registers disasters in Brazil to estimate their impact in terms of human damage and financial costs in the last ten years. The analysis shows that the drought extreme events are the most expensive, several of them reaching a cost of over a billion USD. Although we are not able to attribute the natural disasters registered in one database to the extreme weather events identified using the meteorological data, we discuss the possible correlations between them. Finally, we present a proposal of using extreme value theory to estimate the probability of having severe extreme events of precipitation in locations where there are already some natural disasters.</description>

      <title>New Insights into Global Warming: End-to-End Visual Analysis and Prediction of Temperature Variations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Global warming presents an unprecedented challenge to our planet however comprehensive understanding remains hindered by geographical biases temporal limitations and lack of standardization in existing research. An end to end visual analysis of global warming using three distinct temperature datasets is presented. A baseline adjusted from the Paris Agreements one point five degrees Celsius benchmark based on data analysis is employed. A closed loop design from visualization to prediction and clustering is created using classic models tailored to the characteristics of the data. This approach reduces complexity and eliminates the need for advanced feature engineering. A lightweight convolutional neural network and long short term memory model specifically designed for global temperature change is proposed achieving exceptional accuracy in long term forecasting with a mean squared error of three times ten to the power of negative six and an R squared value of zero point nine nine nine nine. Dynamic time warping and KMeans clustering elucidate national level temperature anomalies and carbon emission patterns. This comprehensive method reveals intricate spatiotemporal characteristics of global temperature variations and provides warming trend attribution. The findings offer new insights into climate change dynamics demonstrating that simplicity and precision can coexist in environmental analysis.</description>

      <title>SEA-ViT: Sea Surface Currents Forecasting Using Vision Transformer and GRU-Based Spatio-Temporal Covariance Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Forecasting sea surface currents is essential for applications such as maritime navigation, environmental monitoring, and climate analysis, particularly in regions like the Gulf of Thailand and the Andaman Sea. This paper introduces SEA-ViT, an advanced deep learning model that integrates Vision Transformer (ViT) with bidirectional Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) to capture spatio-temporal covariance for predicting sea surface currents (U, V) using high-frequency radar (HF) data. The name SEA-ViT is derived from ``Sea Surface Currents Forecasting using Vision Transformer,'' highlighting the model's emphasis on ocean dynamics and its use of the ViT architecture to enhance forecasting capabilities. SEA-ViT is designed to unravel complex dependencies by leveraging a rich dataset spanning over 30 years and incorporating ENSO indices (El Ni\~no, La Ni\~na, and neutral phases) to address the intricate relationship between geographic coordinates and climatic variations. This development enhances the predictive capabilities for sea surface currents, supporting the efforts of the Geo-Informatics and Space Technology Development Agency (GISTDA) in Thailand's maritime regions. The code and pretrained models are available at \url{https://github.com/kaopanboonyuen/gistda-ai-sea-surface-currents}.</description>

      <title>Surface solar radiation: AI satellite retrieval can outperform Heliosat and generalizes well to other climate zones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate estimates of surface solar irradiance (SSI) are essential for solar resource assessments and solar energy forecasts in grid integration and building control applications. SSI estimates for spatially extended regions can be retrieved from geostationary satellites such as Meteosat. Traditional SSI satellite retrievals like Heliosat rely on physical radiative transfer modelling. We introduce the first machine-learning-based satellite retrieval for instantaneous SSI and demonstrate its capability to provide accurate and generalizable SSI estimates across Europe. Our deep learning retrieval provides near real-time SSI estimates based on data-driven emulation of Heliosat and fine-tuning on pyranometer networks. By including SSI from ground stations, our SSI retrieval model can outperform Heliosat accuracy and generalize well to regions with other climates and surface albedos in cloudy conditions (clear-sky index &lt; 0.8). We also show that the SSI retrieved from Heliosat exhibits large biases in mountain regions, and that training and fine-tuning our retrieval models on SSI data from ground stations strongly reduces these biases, outperforming Heliosat. Furthermore, we quantify the relative importance of the Meteosat channels and other predictor variables like solar zenith angle for the accuracy of our deep learning SSI retrieval model in different cloud conditions. We find that in cloudy conditions multiple near-infrared and infrared channels enhance the performance. Our results can facilitate the development of more accurate satellite retrieval models of surface solar irradiance.</description>

      <title>A Generative Diffusion Model for Probabilistic Ensembles of Precipitation Maps Conditioned on Multisensor Satellite Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A generative diffusion model is used to produce probabilistic ensembles of precipitation intensity maps at the 1-hour 5-km resolution. The generation is conditioned on infrared and microwave radiometric measurements from the GOES and DMSP satellites and is trained with merged ground radar and gauge data over southeastern United States. The generated precipitation maps reproduce the spatial autocovariance and other multiscale statistical properties of the gauge-radar reference fields on average. Conditioning the generation on the satellite measurements allows us to constrain the magnitude and location of each generated precipitation feature. The mean of the 128- member ensemble shows high spatial coherence with the reference fields with 0.82 linear correlation between the two. On average, the coherence between any two ensemble members is approximately the same as the coherence between any ensemble member and the ground reference, attesting that the ensemble dispersion is a proper measure of the estimation uncertainty. From the generated ensembles we can easily derive the probability of the precipitation intensity exceeding any given intensity threshold, at the 5-km resolution of the generation or at any desired aggregated resolution.</description>

      <title>Developing a Thailand solar irradiance map using Himawari-8 satellite imageries and deep learning models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an online platform that shows Thailand's solar irradiance map every 30 minutes. It is available at https://www.cusolarforecast.com. The methodology for estimating global horizontal irradiance (GHI) across Thailand relies on cloud index extracted from Himawari-8 satellite imagery, Ineichen clear-sky model with locally-tuned Linke turbidity, and machine learning models. The methods take clear-sky irradiance, cloud index, re-analyzed GHI and temperature data from the MERRA-2 database, and date-time as inputs for GHI estimation models, including LightGBM, LSTM, Informer, and Transformer. These are benchmarked with the estimate from the SolCast service by evaluation of 15-minute ground GHI data from 53 ground stations over 1.5 years during 2022-2023. The results show that the four models have competitive performances and outperform the SolCast service. The best model is LightGBM, with an MAE of 78.58 W/sqm and RMSE of 118.97 W/sqm. Obtaining re-analyzed MERRA-2 data for Thailand is not economically feasible for deployment. When removing these features, the Informer model has a winning performance of 78.67 W/sqm in MAE. The obtained performance aligns with existing literature by taking the climate zone and time granularity of data into consideration. As the map shows an estimate of GHI over 93,000 grids with a frequent update, the paper also describes a computational framework for displaying the entire map. It tests the runtime performance of deep learning models in the GHI estimation process.</description>

      <title>Center-fixing of tropical cyclones using uncertainty-aware deep learning applied to high-temporal-resolution geostationary satellite imagery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Determining the location of a tropical cyclone's (TC) surface circulation center -- "center-fixing" -- is a critical first step in the TC-forecasting process, affecting current and future estimates of track, intensity, and structure. Despite a recent increase in the number of automated center-fixing methods, only one such method (ARCHER-2) is operational, and its best performance is achieved when using microwave or scatterometer data, which are not available at every forecast cycle. We develop a deep-learning algorithm called GeoCenter; it relies only on geostationary IR satellite imagery, which is available for all TC basins at high frequency (10-15 min) and low latency (&lt; 10 min) during both day and night. GeoCenter ingests an animation (time series) of IR images, including 10 channels at lag times up to 3 hours. The animation is centered at a "first guess" location, offset from the true TC-center location by 48 km on average and sometimes &gt; 100 km; GeoCenter is tasked with correcting this offset. On an independent testing dataset, GeoCenter achieves a mean/median/RMS (root mean square) error of 26.9/23.3/32.0 km for all systems, 25.7/22.3/30.5 km for tropical systems, and 15.7/13.6/18.6 km for category-2--5 hurricanes. These values are similar to ARCHER-2 errors when microwave or scatterometer data are available, and better than ARCHER-2 errors when only IR data are available. GeoCenter also performs skillful uncertainty quantification (UQ), producing a well calibrated ensemble of 200 TC-center locations. Furthermore, all predictors used by GeoCenter are available in real time, which would make GeoCenter easy to implement operationally every 10-15 min.</description>

      <title>European summer weather regimes 1990-2019: Automatic classification and representation in a small global climate model ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Central Europe, the occurrence of different weather regimes (WRs) plays a major role in spatiotemporal temperature and precipitation patterns. In the context of increasingly extreme summers, this study focuses on European summer WRs (June-August, JJA) over the last three decades (1990-2019), and aims to examine the changing characteristics of these WRs and their potential implications. In addition, based on ERA5 reanalysis data, the WR representation from a carefully preselected, small ensemble of global general circulation models (GCMs) is analyzed. A methodological refinement concerns the combination of Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) with a novel GCM selection technique, which enhances the robustness of the simulated large-scale circulation patterns. WRs are defined using daily sea level pressure (SLP) and wind in the upper troposphere. Results reveal that the SOM captures predominant European summer synoptic patterns, and the salient result is a positive trend in 2 m air temperature across nearly all WRs. The selected GCMs - MPI-ESM1-2-LR r29i1p1f1, CanESM5 r1i1p1f1 and MRI-ESM2-0 r5i1p1f1 - identify WRs correctly and ERA5-based results are always within the range of this small GCM ensemble. Its members clearly show skill in representing large-scale WRs accurately and, thus, serve as valuable tools for studying synoptic weather patterns during summer in Central Europe. Therefore, we can recommend these GCMs for studies on WR-related climate projections of future summer conditions, particularly for those interested in climate impacts in Central Europe from a synoptic-scale perspective.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Spatiotemporal Modeling of Day-Ahead Wind Power Generation with Input-Warped Gaussian Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We design a Gaussian Process (GP) spatiotemporal model to capture features of day-ahead wind power forecasts. We work with hourly-scale day-ahead forecasts across hundreds of wind farm locations, with the main aim of constructing a fully probabilistic joint model across space and hours of the day. To this end, we design a separable space-time kernel, implementing both temporal and spatial input warping to capture the non-stationarity in the covariance of wind power. We conduct synthetic experiments to validate our choice of the spatial kernel and to demonstrate the effectiveness of warping in addressing nonstationarity. The second half of the paper is devoted to a detailed case study using a realistic, fully calibrated dataset representing wind farms in the ERCOT region of Texas.</description>

      <title>WeatherFormer: Empowering Global Numerical Weather Forecasting with Space-Time Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) system is an infrastructure that exerts considerable impacts on modern society.Traditional NWP system, however, resolves it by solving complex partial differential equations with a huge computing cluster, resulting in tons of carbon emission. Exploring efficient and eco-friendly solutions for NWP attracts interest from Artificial Intelligence (AI) and earth science communities. To narrow the performance gap between the AI-based methods and physic predictor, this work proposes a new transformer-based NWP framework, termed as WeatherFormer, to model the complex spatio-temporal atmosphere dynamics and empowering the capability of data-driven NWP. WeatherFormer innovatively introduces the space-time factorized transformer blocks to decrease the parameters and memory consumption, in which Position-aware Adaptive Fourier Neural Operator (PAFNO) is proposed for location sensible token mixing. Besides, two data augmentation strategies are utilized to boost the performance and decrease training consumption. Extensive experiments on WeatherBench dataset show WeatherFormer achieves superior performance over existing deep learning methods and further approaches the most advanced physical model.</description>

      <title>Effects of the internal temperature on vertical mixing and on cloud structures in Ultra Hot Jupiters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17101v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The vertical mixing in hot Jupiter atmospheres plays a critical role in the formation and spacial distribution of cloud particles in their atmospheres. This affects the observed spectra of a planet through cloud opacity, which can be influenced by the degree of cold trapping of refractory species in the deep atmosphere. We aim to isolate the effects of the internal temperature on the mixing efficiency in the atmospheres of Ultra Hot Jupiters (UHJ) and the spacial distribution of cloud particles across the globe. We couple a simplified tracer based cloud model, picket fence radiative-transfer scheme and mixing length theory to the Exo-FMS general circulation model. We run the model for five different internal temperatures at typical UHJ atmosphere system parameters. Our results show the convective eddy diffusion coefficient remains low throughout the vast majority of the atmosphere, with mixing dominated by advective flows. However, some regions can show convective mixing in the upper atmosphere for colder interior temperatures. The vertical extent of the clouds is reduced as the internal temperature is increased. Additionally, a global cloud layer gets formed below the radiative-convective boundary (RCB) in the cooler cases. Convection is generally strongly inhibited in UHJ atmospheres above the RCB due to their strong irradiation. Convective mixing plays a minor role compared to advective mixing in keeping cloud particles aloft in ultra hot Jupiters with warm interiors. Higher vertical turbulent heat fluxes and the advection of potential temperature inhibit convection in warmer interiors. Our results suggest isolated upper atmosphere regions above cold interiors may exhibit strong convective mixing in isolated regions around Rossby gyres, allowing aerosols to be better retained in these areas.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02761v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Hadley circulation describes a planetary-scale tropical atmospheric flow, which has a major influence on climate. Contemporary theoretical understanding is based upon angular momentum conservation, the basic dynamical constraint governing the state of the flow pattern. However, despite the degree of success in representing the Hadley circulation, the canonical theoretical model does not treat interactions with other regions, particularly the mid-latitudes. Here, we extend the original model of Held and Hou (1980) to include the influence of mid-latitude large-scale atmospheric dynamics, which we treat using the planetary-scale heat equation with a parameterized poleward heat flux driven by synoptic eddies. The energy flux balance within the Hadley cell includes the poleward heat flux at the poleward edge of the cell, which is controlled by the baroclinic instability of the sub-tropical jet. We find that an increase (decrease) in the poleward heat flux leads to a strengthening (weakening) of tropical convection, driving an equatorward (poleward) shift of the edge of the Hadley cell. Thus, our theoretical solutions suggest that global warming, which can reduce the baroclinicity of the subtropical jet, can lead to the poleward expansion of the Hadley cell due to the change in energy flux balance within it.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04826v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Wave propagation through random continuous media remains an important fundamental problem with applications ranging from remote sensing to quantum communication. Typically, such media are characterized by smooth refractive index fluctuations whose impact on the wave can be captured by the stochastic parabolic equation. The latter can be solved numerically by means of a split-step method, which replaces the continuous medium with a number of discrete phase screens derived from the medium's power spectrum. We introduce and benchmark highly accurate and efficient hybrid phase screens for arbitrary power spectra which are based on the combination of Zernike and Fourier phase screens.</description>

Abstract: Ocean turbulence at meso- and submesocales affects the propagation of surface waves through refraction and scattering, inducing spatial modulations in significant wave height (SWH). We develop a theoretical framework that relates these modulations to the current that induces them. We exploit the asymptotic smallness of the ratio of typical current speed to wave group speed to derive a linear map -- the U2H map -- between surface current velocity and SWH anomaly. The U2H map is a convolution, non-local in space, expressible as a product in Fourier space by a factor independent of the magnitude of the wavenumber vector. Analytic expressions of the U2H map show how the SWH responds differently to the vortical and divergent parts of the current, and how the anisotropy of the wave spectrum is key to large current-induced SWH anomalies. We implement the U2H map numerically and test its predictions against WAVEWATCH III numerical simulations for both idealised and realistic current configurations.</description>
