      <title>Condensation effect and transport on Alumina porous membranes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the adsorption of water and characterizing the water film formed within nanostructures are essential for advancements in fields such as nanofluidics, water purification, and biosensing devices. In our research, we focus on studying the condensation and transport of water through an alumina membrane with nanopores of varying wettabilities. We introduce a method to alter the membrane's wettability and enhance dissociative adsorption by varying the duration of exposure during plasma cleaning. To create different experimental environments, we modify humidity levels by controlling vapor pressure. To investigate water transport within the membrane, we apply a voltage and analyze the resulting current response. Our analysis indicates that transport properties improve with thicker water films. We use the Polanyi theory of adsorption to capture the physics of the problem. Analyzing the conductance inside the nanopores, we find that the first monolayers may stagnate due to interactions with the pore walls. This research significantly enhances our understanding of vapor condensation within nanomaterials, particularly considering the influence of different wettabilities. These findings have broad implications for applications such as water vapor capture and related technologies.</description>

      <title>Rocking, Rolling, and Hopping: Exploring the Multi-motion Capabilities of Rigid and Soft Ellipsoidal Actuators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of a rigid disk rolling down a ramp is a classic problem given to students in introductory mechanics courses. In contrast, systematic studies on the rolling behavior of an ellipse have only recently emerged. Unlike a rolling disk, here the geometric center remains at a constant height from the floor, the center of a rotating ellipse changes nonlinearly due to its eccentric shape. This eccentricity introduces new modes of motion beyond rolling, including rocking and hopping. Leveraging this multi-motion behavior, we design an ellipsoidal actuator which exhibits both rolling and hopping behaviors in response to changes in the applied angular velocity. Using a simple geometric framework, we successfully capture the motion of the actuator as a force-driven rigid ellipsoid on a non-slip flat surface, and identify the critical angular velocity for the rolling-to-hopping transition. Furthermore, by adding deformability to the actuator, we unlock new functionalities, enabling soft actuators that can climb slopes and work together to collectively ascend stairs.</description>

      <title>Interfacial fatigue fracture of pressure sensitive adhesives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pressure sensitive adhesives (PSAs) are viscoelastic polymers that can form fast and robust adhesion with various adherends under fingertip pressure. The rapidly expanding application domain of PSAs, such as healthcare, wearable electronics, and flexible displays, requires PSAs to sustain prolonged loads throughout their lifetime, calling for fundamental studies on their fatigue behaviors. However, fatigue of PSAs has remained poorly investigated. Here we study interfacial fatigue fracture of PSAs for the first time, focusing on the cyclic interfacial crack propagation due to the gradual rupture of noncovalent bonds between a PSA and an adherend. We fabricate a model PSA with a hysteresis-free elastomeric bulk and a viscoelastic sticky surface. Using cyclic and monotonic peeling tests, we characterize the interfacial fatigue and fracture behaviors. From the experimental data, we obtain the interfacial fatigue threshold (4.6 J/m2) under cyclic peeling, the slow crack threshold (33.9 J/m2) under monotonic peeling, and the adhesion toughness (~ 400 J/m2) at a finite peeling speed. We develop a modified Lake-Thomas model to describe the interfacial fatigue threshold due to noncovalent bond breaking. The theoretical prediction (2.6 J/m2) agrees well with the experimental measurement (4.6 J/m2). Finally, we discuss possible additional dissipation mechanisms involved in the larger slow crack threshold and much larger adhesion toughness. It is hoped that this study will provide new fundamental knowledge for fracture mechanics of PSAs, as well as guidance for future tough and durable PSAs.</description>

      <title>Mechanics of soft-body rolling motion without external torque</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Drosophila larva, a soft-body animal, can bend its body and roll efficiently to escape danger. However, contrary to common belief, this rolling motion is not driven by the imbalance of gravity and ground reaction forces. Through functional imaging and ablation experiments, we demonstrate that the sequential actuation of axial muscles within an appropriate range of angles is critical for generating rolling. We model the interplay between muscle contraction, hydrostatic skeleton deformation, and body-environment interactions, and systematically explain how sequential muscle actuation generates the rolling motion. Additionally, we constructed a pneumatic soft robot to mimic the larval rolling strategy, successfully validating our model. This mechanics model of soft-body rolling motion not only advances the study of related neural circuits, but also holds potential for applications in soft robotics.</description>

      <title>Active Polymer Behavior in Two Dimensions: A Comparative Analysis of Tangential and Push-Pull Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we compare the structural and dynamic behavior of active filaments in two dimensions using tangential and push-pull models, including a variant with passive end monomers. These models serve as valuable frameworks for understanding self-organization in biological polymers and synthetic materials. At low activity, all models exhibit similar behaviors. Differences emerge in the intermediate range as activity increases, though at higher activity levels, their behaviors converge. Importantly, adjusting for differences in mean active force reveals nearly identical behavior across models. Our results highlight the importance of force definitions in active polymer simulations and provide insights into phase transitions across varying filament configurations.</description>

      <title>Specific Iron Binding to Natural Sphingomyelin Membrane Induced by Non-Specific Co-Solutes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hypothesis: Sphingomyelin (SPM), a crucial phospholipid in the myelin sheath, is vital in insulating nerve fibers. We hypothesize that iron ions selectively bind to the phosphatidylcholine (PC) template within the SPM membrane under near-physiological conditions, disrupting membrane organization. These interactions could potentially contribute to the degradation of the myelin sheath, thereby playing a role in the development of neurodegenerative diseases. Experiments: We utilized synchrotron-based X-ray spectroscopy and diffraction techniques to study the interaction of iron ions with a bovine spinal cord SPM monolayer (ML) at the liquid-vapor interface under physiological conditions. The SPM ML serves as a model system, representing localized patches of lipids within a more complex membrane structure. The experiments assessed iron binding to the SPM membrane both in the presence of salts and with additional evaluation of the effects of various ion species on membrane behavior. Grazing incidence X-ray diffraction was employed to analyze the impact of iron binding on the structural integrity of the SPM membrane. Findings: Our results demonstrate that iron ions in dilute solution selectively bind to the PC template of the SPM membrane exclusively at near-physiological salt concentrations (e.g., NaCl, KCl, KI, or CaCl2) and are pH-dependent. In-significant binding was detected without these salts or at near-neutral pH with salts. The surface adsorption of iron ions is correlated with salt concentration, reaching saturation at physiological levels. In contrast, multivalent ions such as La$^{3+}$ and Ca2+ do not bind to SPM under similar conditions. Notably, iron binding to the SPM membrane disrupts its in-plane organization, suggesting that these interactions may compromise membrane integrity and contribute to myelin sheath damage associated with neurological disorders.</description>

      <title>Two-Dimensional Active Brownian Particles Crossing a Parabolic Barrier: Transition-Path Times, Survival Probability, and First-Passage time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive an analytical expression for the propagator and the transition path time distribution of a two-dimensional active Brownian particle crossing a parabolic barrier with absorbing boundary conditions at both sides. Using the passive Brownian particle as basis states and dealing with the activity as a perturbation, our solution is expressed in terms of the perturbed eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of the associated Fokker-Planck equation once the latter is reduced by taking into account only the coordinate along the direction of the barrier and the self-propulsion angle. We show that transition path times are typically shortened by the self-propulsion of the particle. Our solution also allows us to obtain the survival probability and the first-passage time distribution, which display a strong dependence on the particle's activity, while the rotational diffusivity influences them to a minor extent.</description>

      <title>Hydrogen diffusion in garnet: insights from atomistic simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Garnet has been widely used to decipher the pressure-temperature-time history of rocks, but its physical properties such as elasticity and diffusion are strongly affected by trace amounts of hydrogen. Experimental measurements of H diffusion in garnet are limited to room pressure. We use atomistic simulations to study H diffusion in perfect and defective garnet lattices, focusing on protonation defects at the Si and Mg sites, which are shown to be energetically favored. The ab-initio simulation of H diffusion is computationally challenging due to a transient trapping of H, which is overcome with machine learning techniques by training a deep neural network that encodes the interatomic potential. Our results show high mobility of hydrogen in defect free garnet lattices, whereas H diffusivity is significantly diminished in defective lattices. Tracer simulation focusing on H alone highlights the vital role of atomic vibrations of heavier atoms like Mg in the untrapping of H atoms. Two regimes of H diffusion are identified: a diffuser-dominated regime at high hydrogen content with low activation energies, due to saturation of vacancies by hydrogen, and a vacancy-dominated regime at low hydrogen content with high activation energies, due to trapping of H atoms at vacancy sites. These regimes account for experimental observations, such as a H-concentration dependent diffusivity and the discrepancy in activation energy between deprotonation and D-H exchange experiments. This study underpins the crucial role of vacancies in H diffusion and demonstrates the utility of machine-learned interatomic potentials in studying kinetic processes in the Earth's interior.</description>

      <title>First-Principles Phase-Field Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08180v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phase-field methods offer a versatile computational framework for simulating large-scale microstructure evolution. However, the applicability and predictability of phase-field models are inherently limited by their ad hoc nature, and there is currently no bottom-up theory available that enables truly first-principles predictive modeling of large-scale non-equilibrium processes. Here, we present a bottom-up framework that provides a route to the construction of mesoscopic phase-field models entirely based on atomistic information. By introducing a molecular coarse-grained system as an intermediate step, we demonstrate the approach on the example of ice nucleation dynamics, with a spatiotemporal scale-up of nearly $10^8$ times compared to the microscopic model. Our framework offers a unique approach for incorporating atomistic details into mesoscopic models, systematically bridging the gap between microscopic particle-based simulations and field-theoretic models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06638v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this note, we address several issues, including some raised in recent works and commentary, related to bending measures and energies for plates and shells, and certain of their invariance properties. We discuss overlaps and distinctions in results arising from two different definitions of stretching, correct an error and citation oversights in our prior work, reiterate some of the early history of dilation-invariant bending measures, and provide additional brief observations regarding the relative size of energetic terms and the symmetrization of bending measures. A particular point of emphasis is the distinction between dilation-invariant measures and a recently introduced non-dilation-invariant measure for shells and curved rods. In the course of this discussion, we provide a simpler presentation of the elementary, but much neglected, fact that the through-thickness derivative of tangential stretch of material near the mid-surface of a thin body is the product of the mid-surface stretch and change in curvature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00316v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Architected materials derive their properties from the geometric arrangement of their internal structural elements. Their designs rely on continuous networks of members to control the global mechanical behavior of the bulk. Here, we introduce a class of materials that consist of discrete concatenated rings or cage particles interlocked in three-dimensional networks, forming polycatenated architected materials (PAMs). We propose a general design framework that translates arbitrary crystalline networks into particles' concatenations and geometries. In response to small external loads, PAMs behave like non-Newtonian fluids, showing both shear-thinning and shear-thickening responses. At larger strains, PAMs behave like lattices and foams, with a nonlinear stress-strain relation. At microscale, we demonstrate that PAMs can change their shapes in response to applied electrostatic charges. PAM's unique properties pave the path for developing stimuli-responsive materials, energy-absorbing systems and morphing architectures.</description>

Abstract: The reptation Monte Carlo algorithm is a simple, physically motivated and efficient method for equilibrating semi-dilute solutions of linear polymers. Here we propose two simple generalizations for the analogue {\it Amoeba} algorithm for randomly branching chains, which allow to efficiently deal with random trees with controlled branching activity. We analyse the rich relaxation dynamics of Amoeba algorithms and demonstrate the existence of an unexpected scaling regime for the tree relaxation. In particular, our results suggests that the equilibration time for Amoeba algorithms scales in general like $N^2 \langle n_{\rm lin}\rangle^\Delta$, where $N$ denotes the number of tree nodes, $\langle n_{\rm lin}\rangle$ the mean number of linear segments the trees are composed of and $\Delta \simeq 0.4$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19591v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a mixture of extensile and contractile cells using a vertex model extended to include active nematic stresses. The two cell populations phase separate over time. While phase separation strengthens monotonically with an increasing magnitude of contractile activity, the dependence on extensile activity is non-monotonic, so that sufficiently high values reduce the extent of sorting. We interpret this by showing that extensile activity renders the system motile, enabling cells to undergo neighbour exchanges. Contractile cells that come into contact as a result are then more likely to stay connected due to an effective attraction arising from contractile activity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05555v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Active fluids generate spontaneous, often chaotic mesoscale flows. Harnessing these flows to drive embedded soft materials into structures with controlled length scales and lifetimes is a key challenge at the interface between the fields of active matter and nonequilibrium self-assembly. Here, we present a simple and highly efficient computational approach to model soft materials advected by active fluids, by simulating particles moving in a spatiotemporally correlated noise field. The algorithm enables orders of magnitude speed up in comparison to other methods. To illustrate our approach, we simulate the dynamical self-organization of repulsive colloids within such an active noise field in two and three dimensions. The colloids form structures whose sizes and dynamics can be tuned by the correlation time and length of the active fluid, and range from small rotating droplets to clusters with internal flows and system-spanning sizes that vastly exceed the active correlation length. Our results elucidate how the interplay between active fluid time/length scales and emergent driven assembly can be used to rationally design functional assemblies. More broadly, our approach can be used to efficiently simulate diverse active fluids and other systems with spatiotemporally correlated noise.</description>

Abstract: Quasicrystals are intriguing ordered structures characterized by the lack of translational symmetry and the existence of rotational symmetry. The tiling of different geometric units such as triangles and squares in two-dimensional space can result in a great variety of quasicrystals that could be realized by the self-assembly of liquid crystalline molecules. In this study, we introduce three self-similar dodecagonal tilings, including a novel Diamond-Square-Triangle pattern, composed of triangular and quadrangular tiles and examine their thermodynamic stability by using the self-consistent field theory applied to T-shaped liquid crystalline molecules. Specifically, we detail the inflation rules for the construction of these dodecagonal tilings and analyze their self-similarity, and show that these tilings can be viewed as projections of higher-dimensional periodic lattice points with projection windows. Using these dodecagonal tilings as initial configurations of the SCFT results in solutions corresponding to quasicrystals that could form from the T-shaped liquid crystalline molecules. The relative stability of these aperiodic phases is analyzed to obtain design rules that could stabilize quasicrystals. Meanwhile, we provide two criteria for distinguishing three dodecagonal quasicrystals and their approximants by analyzing their diffraction peaks. These findings shed new lighten on the discovery of new quasicrystals in soft materials.</description>
