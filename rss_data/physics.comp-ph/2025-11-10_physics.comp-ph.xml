      <title>Accelerating metamaterial topology optimization using deep super-resolution networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing metamaterials for extreme mechanical behavior involves the optimal selection of design parameters. However, identifying these optimal parameters through topology optimization (TO) across a large parametric space requires extensive computational resources. To address this challenge, we propose a novel deep learning framework for metamaterial topology optimization using an enhanced deep super-resolution (EDSR) approach. Generating low-resolution topologies significantly reduces computational cost compared to high-resolution designs. Therefore, an EDSR network is trained to learn the mapping between low- and high-resolution metamaterial topologies. The training dataset is generated using solid isotropic material with penalization (SIMP)-based TO. We demonstrate the proposed approach for the design of mechanical metamaterials targeting objectives such as maximization of bulk modulus, shear modulus, and elastic modulus, and minimization of Poisson's ratio. Quantitative assessments -including (i) pixel value error, (ii) objective function error, (iii) intersection over union, and (iv) volume fraction error -validate the accuracy of the EDSR-based TO. Our framework predicts high-resolution topologies of size $192 \times 192$ from optimized low-resolution topologies of size $48 \times 48$. Once trained, the proposed network predicts these high-resolution topologies with only $5-7\%$ of the computational cost required by conventional SIMP-based TO at the same resolution. Moreover, by adding upscale blocks, the framework can generate smoother, higher-resolution topologies suitable for 3D printing. This approach offers a scalable and efficient solution with strong potential for multidisciplinary metamaterial design applications.</description>

      <title>Structure Matters: A Scale-Resolved Numerical Operando Approach for Lithium-Sulfur Batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lithium-Sulfur batteries (LSBs) are believed to have a high potential for aerospace applications due to their high gravimetric energy density. However, despite decades of research and advances, they still suffer from poor rate capability and low power output, eventually preventing their practical implementation. One particular aspect we want to shed light on is the influence of the porous cathode structure on the rate performance during discharge. Therefore, we present a scale-resolved simulation methodology that aims to provide structural insights into the electrochemical cell behavior that are experimentally hardly accessible even for modern operando methods. Our numerical operando approach employs high-performance computing (HPC) and is based on a coarse-grained continuum model. The latter is spatially discretized with a Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method and advanced in time by an adaptive controller. The models and methods as well as HPC aspects of our toolbox will be critically discussed, finally showcasing the capabilities of our workflow to improve LSBs.</description>

      <title>Impact of higher-order exchange on the lifetime of skyrmions and antiskyrmions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reliable control of skyrmion lifetime is essential for realizing spintronic devices, yet the role of higher-order exchange - which can lead to skyrmion stabilization - remains largely unexplored. Here we calculate lifetimes of isolated skyrmions and antiskyrmions at transition-metal interfaces based on an atomistic spin model that includes all fourth-order exchange terms. Within harmonic transition-state theory, we evaluate both energetic and entropic contributions and find substantially enhanced lifetimes when higher-order exchange is included. The four-spin four-site interaction raises the energy barrier and lowers the curvature of the energy landscape at the collapse saddle point, increasing the pre-exponential factor. We show that skyrmions and antiskyrmions can remain thermally stable even without Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI), and that tuning the four-spin term by a small amount modulates the prefactor over orders of magnitude. Our results identify higher-order exchange as a promising route to stabilize topological magnetic textures - in particular in systems lacking DMI - and to engineer their thermally activated decay.</description>

      <title>Neural Network for Subgrid Turbulence Modeling for Large Eddy Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05103v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When simulating multiscale systems, where some fields cannot be fully prescribed despite their effects on the simulation's accuracy, closure models are needed. This behavior is observed in turbulent fluid dynamics, where Large Eddy Simulations (LES) depict global behavior while turbulence modeling introduces dissipation correspondent to smaller sub-grid scales. Recently, scientific machine learning techniques have emerged to address this problem by integrating traditional (physics-based) equations with data-driven (machine-learned) models, typically coupling numerical solvers with neural networks. This work presents a comprehensive workflow, encompassing high-fidelity data generation, a priori learning, and a posteriori learning, where data-driven models enhance differential equations. The study underscores the critical role of post-processing and effective filtering of fine-resolution fields and the implications numerical methods selection, such as the Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) or Finite Volume Method.</description>

      <title>Predicting and forecasting reactivity and flux using long short-term memory models in pebble bed reactors during run-in</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pebble bed reactor (PBR) operation presents unique advantages and challenges due to the ability to continuously change the fuel mixture and excess reactivity. Each operation parameter affects reactivity on a different timescale. For example, fuel insertion changes may take months to fully propagate, whereas control rod movements have immediate effects. In-core measurements are further limited by the high temperatures, intense neutron flux, and dynamic motion of the fuel bed. In this study, long short-term memory (LSTM) networks are trained to predict reactivity, flux profiles, and power profiles as functions of operating history and synthetic batch-level pebble measurements, such as discharge burnup distributions. The model's performance is evaluated using unseen temporal data, achieving an $R^2$ of 0.9914 on the testing set. The capability of the network to forecast reactivity responses to future operational changes is also examined, and its application for optimizing reactor running-in procedures is explored.</description>

      <title>Systematic global structure search of bismuth-based binary systems under pressure using machine learning potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning potentials (MLPs) have significantly advanced global crystal structure prediction by enabling efficient and accurate property evaluations. In this study, global structure searches are performed for 11 bismuth-based binary systems, including Na-Bi, Ca-Bi, and Eu-Bi, under pressures ranging from 0 to 20 GPa, employing polynomial MLPs developed specifically for these systems. The searches reveal numerous compounds not previously reported in the literature and identify all experimentally known compounds that are representable within the explored configurational space. These results highlight the robustness and reliability of the current MLP-based structure search. The study provides valuable insights into the discovery and design of novel bismuth-based materials under both ambient and high-pressure conditions.</description>

      <title>Fast and Scalable Evaluation of Unbiased Atomic Forces in ab initio Variational Monte Carlo via the Lagrangian Technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ab initio quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods are state-of-the-art electronic structure calculations based on highly parallelizable stochastic frameworks for accurate solutions of the many-body Schr\"{o}dinger equation, suitable for modern many-core supercomputer architectures. Despite its potential, one of the major drawbacks that still hinders QMC applications, especially when targeting dynamical properties of large systems or large amounts of configurations, is the lack of an affordable method to compute atomic forces that are consistent with the corresponding potential energy surfaces (PESs), also known as unbiased atomic forces. Recently, one of the authors in the present paper proposed a way to obtain unbiased forces with the Jastrow-correlated Slater determinant ansatz, where the determinant part is frozen to the values obtained by a mean-field method, such as DFT. However, the proposed method has a significant drawback for its applications: for a system with $N$ nuclei, one requires $3N$ additional DFT calculations to get unbiased forces, which is not negligible as the system size increases. This paper presents a way to replace the $3N$ DFT calculations with a single coupled-perturbed Kohn-Sham calculation, following the so-called Lagrangian technique established in quantum chemistry. This improves the computational cost and scalability of the method. We also demonstrate that the developed unbiased VMC force calculation improves not only the consistency with PESs, but also its accuracy, by investigating three molecules from the rMD17 benchmark set, and comparing the corrected VMC forces with those obtained by the Coupled-Cluster Singles and Doubles with perturbative Triples [CCSD(T)] calculations. We found that the bare VMC forces are significantly biased from the CCSD(T) ones, while the unbiased ones give values much closer to those of the CCSD(T) ones.</description>

      <title>Fine-Tuning Unifies Foundational Machine-learned Interatomic Potential Architectures at ab initio Accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work demonstrates that fine-tuning transforms foundational machine-learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs) to achieve consistent, near-ab initio accuracy across diverse architectures. Benchmarking five leading MLIP frameworks (MACE, GRACE, SevenNet, MatterSim, and ORB) across seven chemically diverse compounds reveals that fine-tuning universally enhances force predictions by factors of 5-15 and improves energy accuracy by 2-4 orders of magnitude. The investigated models span both equivariant and invariant, as well as conservative and non-conservative, architectures. While general-purpose foundation models are robust, they exhibit architecture-dependent deviations from ab initio reference data; fine-tuning eliminates these discrepancies, enabling quantitatively accurate predictions of atomistic and structural properties. Using datasets constructed from equidistantly sampled frames of short ab initio molecular dynamics trajectories, fine-tuning reduces force errors by an order of magnitude and harmonizes performance across all architectures. These findings establish fine-tuning as a universal route to achieving system-specific predictive accuracy while preserving the computational efficiency of MLIPs. To promote widespread adoption, we introduce the aMACEing Toolkit, which provides a unified and reproducible interface for fine-tuning workflows across multiple MLIP frameworks.</description>

      <title>Modelling the Performance of Tritium Process Monitors from First Principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ionization chamber-based, in-line tritium process monitors play an important part in determining the behavior of a tritium system. The one-liter detection volume monitor has been characterized well through experiment and to respond linearly to tritium concentrations for the range of $1 {\mu}Ci/m^3$ to $1 Ci/m^3$. Additionally, it has been shown to behave nonlinearly for low voltage on the central anode and low pressure of the carrier gas. A computational model was developed from first principles that successfully describes the behavior of the one-liter monitor for each of these regimes. Predictions from the model are compared to previously-collected experimental data in order to determine validity and tune the model. The model will be expanded to incorporate additional detector geometries and designs in the future.</description>

      <title>Diffusion-Based Electromagnetic Inverse Design of Scattering Structured Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a conditional diffusion model for electromagnetic inverse design that generates structured media geometries directly from target differential scattering cross-section profiles, bypassing expensive iterative optimization. Our 1D U-Net architecture with Feature-wise Linear Modulation learns to map desired angular scattering patterns to 2x2 dielectric sphere structure, naturally handling the non-uniqueness of inverse problems by sampling diverse valid designs. Trained on 11,000 simulated metasurfaces, the model achieves median MPE below 19% on unseen targets (best: 1.39%), outperforming CMA-ES evolutionary optimization while reducing design time from hours to seconds. These results demonstrate that employing diffusion models is promising for advancing electromagnetic inverse design research, potentially enabling rapid exploration of complex metasurface architectures and accelerating the development of next-generation photonic and wireless communication systems. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/mikzuker/inverse_design_metasurface_generation.</description>

      <title>Point Defects Limited Carrier Mobility in Janus MoSSe monolayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Point defects, often formed during the growth of Janus MoSSe, act as built-in scatterers and affect carrier transport in electronic devices based on Janus MoSSe. In this study, we employ first-principles calculations to investigate the impact of common defects, such as sulfur vacancies, selenium vacancies, and chalcogen substitutions, on electron transport, and compare their influence with that of mobility limited by phonons. Here, we define the saturation defect concentration ($C_{\mathrm{sat}}$) as the highest defect density that still allows the total mobility to remain within 90\% of the phonon-limited value, providing a direct measure of how many defects a device can tolerate. Based on $C_{\mathrm{sat}}$, we find a clear ranking of defect impact: selenium substituting for sulfur is relatively tolerant, with $C_{\mathrm{sat}}\approx2.07\times10^{-4}$, while selenium vacancies are the most sensitive, with $C_{\mathrm{sat}}\approx3.65\times10^{-5}$. Our $C_{\mathrm{sat}}$ benchmarks and defect hierarchy provide quantitative, materials-specific design rules that can guide the fabrication of high-mobility field-effect transistors, electronic devices, and sensors based on Janus MoSSe.</description>

      <title>Self-adaptive weighting and sampling for physics-informed neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics-informed deep learning has emerged as a promising framework for solving partial differential equations (PDEs). Nevertheless, training these models on complex problems remains challenging, often leading to limited accuracy and efficiency. In this work, we introduce a hybrid adaptive sampling and weighting method to enhance the performance of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). The adaptive sampling component identifies training points in regions where the solution exhibits rapid variation, while the adaptive weighting component balances the convergence rate across training points. Numerical experiments show that applying only adaptive sampling or only adaptive weighting is insufficient to consistently achieve accurate predictions, particularly when training points are scarce. Since each method emphasizes different aspects of the solution, their effectiveness is problem dependent. By combining both strategies, the proposed framework consistently improves prediction accuracy and training efficiency, offering a more robust approach for solving PDEs with PINNs.</description>

      <title>An improved update rule for probabilistic computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00818v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many hard combinatorial problems can be mapped onto Ising models, which replicate the behavior of classical spins. Recent advances in probabilistic computers are characterized by parallelization and the introduction of novel hardware platforms. An interesting application of probabilistic computers is to operate them in `reverse' mode, where the network self-organizes its behavior to find the input bits that result in an output state. This can be used, for example, as a factorizer of semiprimes. One issue with simulating probabilistic computers on standard logic devices, such as field-programmable gate arrays, is that the update rules for each spin involve many multiplications, evaluation of a hyperbolic tangent, and a high-resolution numerical comparison. We simplify these rules, which improves the spatial and temporal circuit complexity when simulating a probabilistic computer on a field-programmable gate array. Applying our method to factorizing semiprimes, we achieve at least an order-of-magnitude reduction in the on-chip resources and the time-to-solution compared to recently reported methods. For a 32-bit semiprime, we achieve an average factorization in $\sim$100 s. Our approach will inspire new physical realizations of probabilistic computers because we relax some of their update-rule requirements.</description>

Abstract: Recent high-resolution, high-Reynolds-number simulations have shown that the initial total circulation, quantified by the vorticity packing fraction (VPF), strongly influences the late-time Eulerian statistical equilibria of decaying incom- pressible two-dimensional Navier-Stokes turbulence (Biswas et al., 2022, Physics of Fluids 34, 065101), revealing a transition from point-vortex--dominated to finite-size (patch-vortex) equilibria with increasing vortex packing, and emphasizing the role of of the classical exclusion principle (i.e., incompressibility) and total circulation in determining the final statistical states. The present study examines how the associated Lagrangian tracer transport evolves with VPF across the early (linear-nonlinear turbulence onset), intermediate (turbulence development), and late (coherent dipole evolution) stages, and how it correlates with the corresponding Eulerian states. Turbulence, triggered by the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability and sustained by inverse energy cascades, forms large-scale coherent vortices that govern long-time transport. Tracer dynamics, analyzed via mean-square displacement and position-velocity probability distri- bution functions (PDFs), reveal that increasing VPF accelerates turbulence onset, drives a transition from sub- to super- diffusive transport with decreasing anisotropy in the intermediate stage, and determines late-time behavior dominated by either orbital coherent vortex trapping (sub-diffusive) or linear translational dipole motion (super-diffusive). These dis- tinct long-time transport characteristics, evolving from sub- to super-diffusive behavior with increasing vorticity pack- ing, demonstrate a strong correspondence between the transition from point-vortex- to finite-size-vortex-dominated Eulerian equilibria and the underlying Lagrangian transport in decaying incompressible 2D Navier-Stokes turbulence.</description>

Abstract: We have developed a new version of the high-performance J\"ulich universal quantum computer simulator (JUQCS-50) that leverages key features of the GH200 superchips as used in the JUPITER supercomputer, enabling simulations of a 50-qubit universal quantum computer for the first time. JUQCS-50 achieves this through three key innovations: (1) extending usable memory beyond GPU limits via high-bandwidth CPU-GPU interconnects and LPDDR5 memory; (2) adaptive data encoding to reduce memory footprint with acceptable trade-offs in precision and compute effort; and (3) an on-the-fly network traffic optimizer. These advances result in an 11.4-fold speedup over the previous 48-qubit record on the K computer.</description>
