      <title>Goal assembly as a formalism of evolvable design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the age of artificial intelligence and biotechnology, a unified understanding of technology and biology is critically needed but still lacking. A cornerstone of such unification is evolvable design. I present a formalism, called goal assembly, that unifies three key characteristics of evolvable, biology-like design: (i) hierarchical integration of small competencies into larger competencies; (ii) highly non-uniform (power-law or log-normal distributed) representation of phenotypes by genotypes; and (iii) evolution of hierarchical modularity. It does so by making the hierarchy of physical goal states corresponding to substructures explicit, focusing on their composition across scales. In particular, higher-level goal variables approximate achievable joint goal states of interacting lower-level goal variables. Mechanisms of evolvability include goal state gradient backpropagation across scales, hierarchical decision making among alternative goal states, and structural recombination of modules. In learning theory terms, goal assembly proposes architectural inductive biases of emergent engineering systems operating at a complexity regime where goals arise as necessary abstractions. Beyond asking what goals are and how they are achieved, goal assembly suggests we can almost independently talk about their compositionality.</description>

      <title>British Automobiles, Aging Theory, and the Death of Complex Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machines provide a longstanding model for how organisms accumulate damage, age, and die. However, the large-scale observation and analysis of complex machine populations under real-world conditions is routinely missing from this framework. Here, we analyze survival and repair patterns in sixty-five million complex machines to reveal fundamental challenges to our theories of biomechanical aging. We measure the reliability, survival, and mechanical failure rates of every privately registered used vehicle in Britain from 2005-2021, using comprehensive samples from 397 million mandatory annual inspections and billions of accompanying repair records. These data reveal that vehicle survival patterns are not a fixed outcome of mechanical reliability or accumulated physical 'wear-and-tear' but display non-aging and anti-aging patterns of survival. These patterns are robust to multiple reanalyses and remain after correcting for diverse external and mechanical predictors of mortality rate using survival forests. These findings challenge the perception of aging as an inevitable and cumulative physical phenomenon, complicate our longstanding comparison of organisms to machines, and highlight exciting new pathways to study the evolution of death in complex systems.</description>

      <title>Towards an Atomic Agency for Quantum-AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This essay analyzes emerging AI &amp; quantum technology (incl. quantum-AI hybrids) regulation, export controls, and standards in the US, EU, &amp; China, comparing legislative efforts anno 2025 to balance benefits/risks via their distinct innovation systems. While finding convergence on needing responsible governance despite differing philosophies, it posits risks from a US 'Washington effect' (premature regulation under uncertainty) and a Chinese 'Beijing effect' (exporting autocratic norms via standards/Digital Silk Road), exacerbated by export controls and decoupling. Faced with planetary challenges, it explores pathways toward a harmonized Quantum Acquis Planetaire, anchored in universal values ('what connects us') via foundational standards and agile legal guardrails. Smart regulation must incentivize responsible behavior (e.g., RQT by design) and ensure equitable benefit/risk distribution, requiring cooperative stewardship and strategic Sino-American recoupling. This could be coupled with collaborative research platforms for quantum and AI (which are increasingly interdependent) akin to CERN or ITER - emulating successful international resource pooling to foster coordinated responsible innovation. Realizing goals like fault tolerant quantum-centric supercomputing, algorithmic development and use case discovery requires such collective global expertise, challenging protectionist measures that stifle collaboration and supply chains. The Quantum Acquis Planetaire, envisioned as a global body of Quantum Law, could be codified via a UN Quantum Treaty inspired by precedents like the 2024 UN AI Resolution and 1968 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), designed to align quantum advancements with global imperatives such as the UN SDGs. To enforce it, manage arms race risks, and ensure non-proliferation, an 'Atomic Agency for Quantum-AI' (modeled on IAEA safeguards) warrants serious examination.</description>

      <title>Grid Topology Estimation using an Information Theoretic Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The topology of a power grid is estimated using an information theoretic approach. By modeling the grid as a graph and using voltage magnitude data of individual nodes in the grid, the mutual information between pairs of nodes is computed using different approximation methods. Using the well-known Chow-Liu algorithm, a maximum spanning tree based on mutual information is computed to estimate the power grid topology. Experiments and results are presented to optimize this approach with success shown for IEEE networks generated with MATPOWER and data generated using GridLAB-D. The algorithm is then cross-validated on IEEE networks generated by the European Union Joint Research Council.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Traffic Flow Optimization Through Intrinsic Motivation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traffic congestion has long been an ubiquitous problem that is exacerbating with the rapid growth of megacities. In this proof-of-concept work we study intrinsic motivation, implemented via the empowerment principle, to control autonomous car behavior to improve traffic flow. In standard models of traffic dynamics, self-organized traffic jams emerge spontaneously from the individual behavior of cars, affecting traffic over long distances. Our novel car behavior strategy improves traffic flow while still being decentralized and using only locally available information without explicit coordination. Decentralization is essential for various reasons, not least to be able to absorb robustly substantial levels of uncertainty. Our scenario is based on the well-established traffic dynamics model, the Nagel-Schreckenberg cellular automaton. In a fraction of the cars in this model, we substitute the default behavior by empowerment, our intrinsic motivation-based method. This proposed model significantly improves overall traffic flow, mitigates congestion, and reduces the average traffic jam time.</description>

      <title>Are Baby Boomers' Non-Work Trip-Making Behavior Different than Millennials? Lessons Learned from NHTS Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a comparison between Millennials' and Baby Boomers' non-work travel behaviors using data from the 2017 National Household Travel Survey. Bootstrapped segmented ordered logit models are employed to capture the variability in travel preferences and trip frequency across these generational groups, providing more robust insights into their non-work travel. Millennials, particularly those who work from home, are found to have a negative association with higher non-work trip frequency, whereas Baby Boomers have a positive association with higher non-work trip frequency. The model results show that female Millennials who are heads of households are more likely to make non-work trips but less likely when living in urban areas. Ride sharing among Baby Boomers shows a higher association with non-work travel compared to Millennials. These insights could have implications for travel demand management, as shifting travel patterns necessitate adjustments in infrastructure investments and management strategies to support effective long-term transportation planning.</description>

      <title>Breaking the Code: Multi-level Learning in the Eurovision Song Contest</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Organizations learn from the market, political, and societal responses to their actions. While in some cases both the actions and responses take place in an open manner, in many others, some aspects may be hidden from external observers. The Eurovision Song Contest offers an interesting example to study organizational level learning at two levels: organizers and participants. We find evidence for changes in the rules of the Contest in response to undesired outcomes such as runaway winners. We also find strong evidence of participant learning in the characteristics of competing songs over the 70-years of the Contest. English has been adopted as the lingua franca of the competing songs and pop has become the standard genre. Number of words of lyrics has also grown in response to this collective learning. Remarkably, we find evidence that four participating countries have chosen to ignore the "lesson" that English lyrics increase winning probability. This choice is consistent with utility functions that award greater value to featuring national language than to winning the Contest. Indeed, we find evidence that some countries -- but not Germany -- appear to be less susceptible to "peer" pressure. These observations appear to be valid beyond Eurovision.</description>

      <title>Analysis and Resilience of the U.S. Flight Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Air travel is one of the most widely used transportation services in the United States. This paper analyzes the U.S. Flight Network (USFN) using complex network theory by exploring how the network's topology contributes to its efficiency and vulnerability. This is done by examining the structural properties, degree distributions, and community structures in the network. USFN was observed to follow power-law distribution and falls under the anomalous regime, suggesting that the network is hub dominant. Compared to null networks, USFN has a higher clustering coefficient and modularity. Various percolation test revealed that USFN is vulnerable to targeted attacks and is susceptible to complete cascading failure if one of the major hubs fails. The overall results suggest that while the USFN is designed for efficiency, it is highly vulnerable to disruptions. Protecting key hub airports is important to make the network more robust and prevent large-scale failures.</description>

      <title>A Blue Start: A large-scale pairwise and higher-order social network dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale networks have been instrumental in shaping the way that we think about how individuals interact with one another, developing key insights in mathematical epidemiology, computational social science, and biology. However, many of the underlying social systems through which diseases spread, information disseminates, and individuals interact are inherently mediated through groups of arbitrary size, known as higher-order interactions. There is a gap between higher-order dynamics of group formation and fragmentation, contagion spread, and social influence and the data necessary to validate these higher-order mechanisms. Similarly, few datasets bridge the gap between these pairwise and higher-order network data. Because of its open API, the Bluesky social media platform provides a laboratory for observing social ties at scale. In addition to pairwise following relationships, unlike many other social networks, Bluesky features user-curated lists known as "starter packs" as a mechanism for social network growth. We introduce "A Blue Start", a large-scale network dataset comprising 26.7M users and their 1.6B pairwise following relationships and 301.3K groups representing starter packs. This dataset will be an essential resource for the study of higher-order network science.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-linear mixed effects models are widely used to estimate parameter estimates in the field of pharmacometrics across pharmaceutical industry, US regulatory agencies and academia. The preciseness of the parameter estimate is evaluated using relative standard error (RSE) with a threshold of &lt;50% considered as 'precisely estimated'. Here we investigate the use of this metric alone in Monolix to calibrate a recently published in-host mathematical model for hepatitis D virus (HDV) with our own longitudinal data obtained from patients treated with HDV-entry inhibitor bulevirtide (BLV) monotherapy for up to 96 weeks. We identified substantial discordance between Monolix calibration output, measured longitudinal data and the HDV model despite the fact that Monolix parameters had a RSE &lt;50%, suggesting that model parameters were estimated with precision. Surprisingly, while Monolix suggested precise parameter estimates based on RSE&lt;50%, the correlation matrix in Monolix indicated a strong inverse correlation between BLV efficacy and the loss rate of HDV-infected cells raising identifiability issues. Furthermore, the fits failed to reproduce HDV kinetics accurately in the majority of patients (i.e., poor goodness of fit). Lastly, the estimated pretreatment serum HDV level varied significantly from measured observations. In summary, we demonstrate that even when RSE was &lt;50%, other outputs such as the correlation matrix, confidence intervals and goodness of fit at both the individual and population level need to be checked for accuracy to accept or refine a proposed model.</description>

      <title>Bursty Switching Dynamics Promotes the Collapse of Network Topologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-varying connections are crucial in understanding the structures and dynamics of complex networks. In this paper, we propose a continuous-time switching topology model for temporal networks that is driven by bursty behavior and study the effects on network structure and dynamic processes. Each edge can switch between an active and a dormant state, leading to intermittent activation patterns that are characterized by a renewal process. We analyze the stationarity of the network activation scale and emerging degree distributions by means of the Markov chain theory. We show that switching dynamics can promote the collapse of network topologies by reducing heterogeneities and forming isolated components in the underlying network. Our results indicate that switching topologies can significantly influence random walks in different networks and promote cooperation in donation games. Our research thus provides a simple quantitative framework to study network dynamics with temporal and intermittent interactions across social and technological networks.</description>

      <title>Exploring the interplay between population profile and optimal routes in U.S. cities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cities have developed over time alongside advancements in civilization, focusing on efficient travel and reducing costs. Many studies have examined the distinctive features of urban road networks, such as their length, efficiency, connection to population density, and other properties. However, the relationship between car routes and population in city structures remains unclear. In this study, we used the center of mass for each city tract, defined by the US Census, as the origins and destinations for our itineraries. We calculated travel time, and both Euclidean and travel distances for sixty major cities. We discovered that the total sum of all routes adheres to an urban law. The distribution of these car journeys follows Weibull functions, suggesting that the urban center plays a crucial role in optimizing routes across multiple cities. We also developed a simple point pattern model for the population, which aligns with the well-known decreasing exponential density expression. Our findings show that the interplay between population and path optimization influences city structure through its center. This study offers a new perspective on the fundamental principles that shape urban design.</description>

      <title>Null-adjusted persistence function for high-resolution community detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modularity and persistence probability are two widely used quality functions for detecting communities in complex networks. In this paper, we introduce a new objective function called null-adjusted persistence, which incorporates features from both modularity and persistence probability, as it implies a comparison of persistence probability with the same null model of modularity. We prove key analytic properties of this new function. We show that the null-adjusted persistence overcomes the limitations of modularity, such as scaling behavior and resolution limits, and the limitation of the persistence probability, which is an increasing function with respect to the cluster size. We propose to find the partition that maximizes the null-adjusted persistence with a variation of the Louvain method and we tested its effectiveness on benchmark and real networks. We found out that maximizing null-adjusted persistence outperforms modularity maximization, as it detects higher resolution partitions in dense and large networks.</description>

Abstract: The Science of Science (SoS) explores the mechanisms underlying scientific discovery, and offers valuable insights for enhancing scientific efficiency and fostering innovation. Traditional approaches often rely on simplistic assumptions and basic statistical tools, such as linear regression and rule-based simulations, which struggle to capture the complexity and scale of modern research ecosystems. The advent of artificial intelligence (AI) presents a transformative opportunity for the next generation of SoS, enabling the automation of large-scale pattern discovery and uncovering insights previously unattainable. This paper offers a forward-looking perspective on the integration of Science of Science with AI for automated research pattern discovery and highlights key open challenges that could greatly benefit from AI. We outline the advantages of AI over traditional methods, discuss potential limitations, and propose pathways to overcome them. Additionally, we present a preliminary multi-agent system as an illustrative example to simulate research societies, showcasing AI's ability to replicate real-world research patterns and accelerate progress in Science of Science research.</description>

      <title>SIS Epidemic Modelling on Homogeneous Networked System: General Recovering Process and Mean-Field Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although we have made progress in understanding disease spread in complex systems with non-Poissonian activity patterns, current models still fail to capture the full range of recovery time distributions. In this paper, we propose an extension of the classic susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) model, called the general recovering process SIS (grp-SIS) model. This model incorporates arbitrary recovery time distributions for infected nodes within the system. We derive the mean-field equations assuming a homogeneous network, provide solutions for specific recovery time distributions, and investigate the probability density function (PDF) for infection times in the system's steady state. Our findings show that recovery time distributions significantly affect disease dynamics, and we suggest several future research directions, including extending the model to arbitrary infection processes and using the quasistationary method to address deviations in numerical results.</description>

      <title>How to optimise tournament draws: The case of the 2022 FIFA World Cup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The organisers of major sports competitions use different policies with respect to constraints in the group draw. Our paper aims to rationalise these choices by analysing the trade-off between attractiveness (the number of games played by teams from the same geographic zone) and fairness (the departure of the draw mechanism from a uniform distribution). A parametric optimisation model is formulated and applied to the 2022 FIFA World Cup draw. A flaw of the draw procedure is identified: the pre-assignment of the host to a group implies additional but unnecessary distortions. All Pareto efficient sets of draw constraints are determined via simulations. The proposed framework can be used to find the optimal draw rules of a tournament and justify the distortion of the draw procedure for the stakeholders.</description>

      <title>Strength and weakness of disease-induced herd immunity in networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.04700v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When a fraction of a population becomes immune to an infectious disease, the population-wide infection risk decreases nonlinearly due to collective protection, known as herd immunity. Some studies based on mean-field models suggest that natural infection in a heterogeneous population may induce herd immunity more efficiently than homogeneous immunization. However, we theoretically show that this is not necessarily the case when the population is modeled as a network instead of using the mean-field approach. We identify two competing mechanisms driving disease-induced herd immunity in networks: the biased distribution of immunity toward socially active individuals enhances herd immunity, while the topological localization of immune individuals weakens it. The effect of localization is stronger in networks embedded in a low-dimensional space, which can make disease-induced immunity less effective than random immunization. Our results highlight the role of networks in shaping herd immunity and call for a careful examination of model predictions that inform public health policies.</description>

      <title>When cardinals strategize: An agent-based model of influence and ideology for the papal conclave</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07014v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose and analyze two agent-based models to investigate the dynamics of papal conclaves, focusing on how social influence, strategic voting, and ideological alignment affect the time required to elect a pope. In the first model, cardinals interact through two mechanisms: with probability $p$, they imitate the choice of a randomly selected peer, and with probability $q$, they shift support to the most voted candidate from the previous round. Additionally, strategic behavior is introduced via ``useful voting'', where agents abandon their preferred candidate if he receives less than a threshold fraction of the votes, switching instead to the most viable alternative. A candidate must secure a qualified majority of two-thirds to be elected. We then extend the framework by incorporating ideological blocs, assigning each cardinal and candidate to one of two groups (e.g., progressives and conservatives). Cardinals initially vote for candidates from their own group but may cross ideological lines for strategic reasons. We initialize the electorate with $20\%$ conservative cardinals, reflecting the current composition shaped by papal appointments. Numerical simulations show that ideological polarization tends to delay the election by increasing the number of voting rounds required. However, higher values of strategic responsiveness $q$ can restore efficiency even under polarization. We further validate the model by calibrating parameters to historical data from conclaves held between 1939 and 2025. The model reproduces observed convergence times with good agreement, supporting its explanatory power across institutional contexts. The rapid outcome of the 2025 conclave, despite ideological divisions, suggests the importance of informal consensus-building, possibly prior to voting, as a key mechanism for accelerating convergence.</description>

      <title>Pedestrian mobility citizen science complements expert mapping for enhancing inclusive neighborhood placemaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11098v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cities are complex systems that demand integrated approaches, with increasing attention focused on the neighborhood level. This study examines the interplay between expert-based mapping and citizen science in the Primer de Maig neighborhood of Granollers, Catalonia, Spain--an area marked by poor-quality public spaces and long-standing socio-economic challenges. Seventy-two residents were organized into 19 groups to record their pedestrian mobility while engaging in protocolized playful social actions. Their GPS identified opportunity units for meaningful public space activation. Although 56% of observed actions occurred within expert-defined units, the remaining 44% took place elsewhere. Clustering analysis of geo-located action stops revealed seven distinct clusters, highlighting overlooked areas with significant social potential. These findings underscore the complementarity of top-down and bottom-up approaches, demonstrating how citizen science and community science approaches enriches urban diagnostics by integrating subjective, community-based perspectives in public space placemaking and informing inclusive, adaptive sustainable urban transformation strategies.</description>

      <title>DAOs of Collective Intelligence? Unraveling the Complexity of Blockchain Governance in Decentralized Autonomous Organizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01823v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) have transformed organizational structures by shifting from traditional hierarchical control to decentralized approaches, leveraging blockchain and cryptoeconomics. Despite managing significant funds and building global networks, DAOs face challenges like declining participation, increasing centralization, and inabilities to adapt to changing environments, which stifle innovation. This paper explores DAOs as complex systems and applies complexity science to explain their inefficiencies. In particular, we discuss DAO challenges, their complex nature, and introduce the self-organization mechanisms of collective intelligence, digital democracy, and adaptation. By applying these mechanisms to refine DAO design and construction, a conceptual framework for assessing a DAO's viability is created. This contribution lays the foundation for future research at the intersection of complexity science, digital democracy and DAOs.</description>
