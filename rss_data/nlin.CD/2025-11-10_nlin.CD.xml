      <title>Phase space volume preserving dynamics for non-Hamiltonian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Infinitesimal volumes stretch and contract as they coevolve with classical phase space trajectories according to a linearized dynamics. Unless these tangent space dynamics are modified, the underlying chaotic dynamics will cause the volume to vanish as tangent vectors collapse on the most expanding direction. Here, we propose an alternative linearized dynamics and rectify the generalized Liouville equation to preserve phase space volume, even for non-Hamiltonian systems. Within a classical density matrix theory, we define the time evolution operator from the anti-symmetric part of the stability matrix so that phase space volume is time-invariant. The operator generates orthogonal transformations without distorting volume elements, providing an invariant measure for dissipative dynamics and a evolution equation for the density matrix akin to the quantum mechanical Liouville-von Neumann equation. The compressibility of volume elements is determined by a non-orthogonal operator made from the symmetric part of the stability matrix. We analyze complete sets of basis vectors for the tangent space dynamics of chaotic systems, which may be dissipative, transient or driven, without re-orthogonalization of tangent vectors. The linear harmonic oscillator, the Lorenz-Fetter model, and the H\'enon-Heiles system demonstrate the computation of the instantaneous Lyapunov exponent spectrum and the local Gibbs entropy flow rate using these bases and show that it is numerically convenient.</description>

      <title>Exactly solvable Stuart-Landau models in arbitrary dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use Clifford's geometric algebra to extend the Stuart-Landau system to dimensions $D &gt;2$ and give an exact solution of the oscillator equations in the general case. At the supercritical Hopf bifurcation marked by a transition from stable fixed-point dynamics to oscillatory motion, the Jacobian matrix evaluated at the fixed point has $N=\lfloor{D/2}\rfloor$ pairs of complex conjugate eigenvalues which cross the imaginary axis simultaneously. For odd $D$ there is an additional purely real eigenvalue that does the same. Oscillatory dynamics is asymptotically confined to a hypersphere $\mathbb{S}^{D-1}$ and is characterised by extreme multistability, namely the coexistence of an infinite number of limiting orbits each of which has the geometry of a torus $\mathbb{T}^N$ on which the motion is either periodic or quasiperiodic. We also comment on similar Clifford extensions of other limit cycle oscillator systems and their generalisations.</description>

      <title>SVD-based Causal Emergence for Gaussian Iterative Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08261v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Causal emergence (CE) based on effective information (EI) demonstrates that macro-states can exhibit stronger causal effects than micro-states in dynamics. However, the identification of CE and the maximization of EI both rely on coarse-graining strategies, which is a key challenge. A recently proposed CE framework based on approximate dynamical reversibility, utilizing singular value decomposition (SVD), is independent of coarse-graining. Still, it is limited to transition probability matrices (TPM) in discrete states. To address this, this article proposes a novel CE quantification framework for Gaussian iterative systems (GIS), based on approximate dynamical reversibility derived from the SVD of inverse covariance matrices in forward and backward dynamics. The positive correlation between SVD-based and EI-based CE, along with the equivalence condition, is given analytically. After that, we provide precise coarse-graining strategies directly from singular value spectra and orthogonal matrices. This new framework can be applied to any dynamical system with continuous states and Gaussian noise, such as auto-regressive growth models, Markov-Gaussian systems, and even SIR modeling using neural networks (NN). Numerical simulations on typical cases validate our theory and offer a new approach to studying the CE phenomenon, emphasizing noise and covariance over dynamical functions in both known models and machine learning.</description>

      <title>Shearless barriers in the conservative Ikeda map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07322v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of the Ikeda map in the conservative limit, where it is represented as a two-dimensional area-preserving map governed by two control parameters, $\theta$ and $\phi$. We demonstrate that the map can be interpreted as a composition of a rotation and a translation of the state vector. In the integrable case ($\phi = 0$), the map reduces to a uniform rotation by angle $\theta$ about a fixed point, independent of initial conditions. For $\phi \ne 0$, the system becomes nonintegrable, and the rotation angle acquires a coordinate dependence. The resulting rotation number profile exhibits extrema as a function of position, indicating the formation of shearless barriers. We analyze the emergence, persistence, and breakup of these barriers as the control parameters vary.</description>

      <title>Vorticity Packing Effects on Long Time Turbulent Transport in Decaying Two-Dimensional Incompressible Navier-Stokes Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09487v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent high-resolution, high-Reynolds-number simulations have shown that the initial total circulation, quantified by the vorticity packing fraction (VPF), strongly influences the late-time Eulerian statistical equilibria of decaying incom- pressible two-dimensional Navier-Stokes turbulence (Biswas et al., 2022, Physics of Fluids 34, 065101), revealing a transition from point-vortex--dominated to finite-size (patch-vortex) equilibria with increasing vortex packing, and emphasizing the role of of the classical exclusion principle (i.e., incompressibility) and total circulation in determining the final statistical states. The present study examines how the associated Lagrangian tracer transport evolves with VPF across the early (linear-nonlinear turbulence onset), intermediate (turbulence development), and late (coherent dipole evolution) stages, and how it correlates with the corresponding Eulerian states. Turbulence, triggered by the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability and sustained by inverse energy cascades, forms large-scale coherent vortices that govern long-time transport. Tracer dynamics, analyzed via mean-square displacement and position-velocity probability distri- bution functions (PDFs), reveal that increasing VPF accelerates turbulence onset, drives a transition from sub- to super- diffusive transport with decreasing anisotropy in the intermediate stage, and determines late-time behavior dominated by either orbital coherent vortex trapping (sub-diffusive) or linear translational dipole motion (super-diffusive). These dis- tinct long-time transport characteristics, evolving from sub- to super-diffusive behavior with increasing vorticity pack- ing, demonstrate a strong correspondence between the transition from point-vortex- to finite-size-vortex-dominated Eulerian equilibria and the underlying Lagrangian transport in decaying incompressible 2D Navier-Stokes turbulence.</description>
