      <title>A Theory of Saving under Risk Preference Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Empirical evidence shows that wealthy households have substantially higher saving rates and markedly lower marginal propensity to consume (MPC) than other groups. Existing theory can account for this pattern only under restrictive assumptions on returns, discounting, and preferences. This paper develops a general theory of optimal savings with preference shocks, allowing risk aversion to vary across states and over time. We show that incorporating such heterogeneity in risk attitudes fundamentally alters the asymptotic dynamics of consumption and saving. In particular, we provide an analytical characterization of the asymptotic MPCs and show that zero asymptotic MPCs, corresponding to a 100\% asymptotic saving rate, arise under markedly weaker conditions than in existing theory. Strikingly, such outcomes occur whenever there is a positive probability that agents become less risk averse in the future. As a result, the vanishing MPC emerges as a generic feature rather than a knife-edge result of the optimal savings model, offering a more theoretically robust and empirically consistent account of the saving behavior of wealthy households.</description>

      <title>Balanced contributions, consistency, and value for games with externalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider fair and consistent extensions of the Shapley value for games with externalities. Based on the restriction identified by Casajus et al. (2024, Games Econ. Behavior 147, 88-146), we define balanced contributions, Sobolev's consistency, and Hart and Mas-Colell's consistency for games with externalities, and we show that these properties lead to characterizations of the generalization of the Shapley value introduced by Macho-Stadler et al. (2007, J. Econ. Theory 135, 339-356), that parallel important characterizations of the Shapley value.</description>

      <title>Explicit Consumption Functions with Borrowing Constraints: a Continuous Time Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is no known explicit global closed form solution for the standard income fluctuation problem with a borrowing constraint and where wealth accumulates with a constant interest rate $r$. Using a continuous time formulation, I derive an explicit global closed form solution for the case $r=0$ using the Lambert W function. For the case $r&gt;0$, I derive an explicit global closed form approximation that is valid for $r\sim 0$. I then use these to derive explicit expressions for the marginal propensity to consume out of assets and permanent income. I show that the cross-derivative between the two is strictly positive: the consumption consumption is supermodular.</description>

      <title>TEE-BFT: Pricing the Security of Data Center Execution Assurance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26091v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Blockchains face inherent limitations when communicating outside their own ecosystem, largely due to the Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) 3f+1 security model. Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) are a promising mitigation because they allow a single trusted broker to interface securely with external systems.
  This paper develops a cost-of-collusion principal-agent model for compromising a TEE in a Data Center Execution Assurance design. The model isolates the main drivers of attack profitability: a K-of-n coordination threshold, independent detection risk q, heterogeneous per-member sanctions F_i, and a short-window flow prize (omega) proportional to the value secured (beta times V).
  We derive closed-form deterrence thresholds and a conservative design bound (V_safe) that make collusion unprofitable under transparent parameter choices. Calibrations based on time-advantaged arbitrage indicate that plausible TEE parameters can protect on the order of one trillion dollars in value.</description>
