      <title>Quantum and Semi-Classical Signatures of Dissipative Chaos in the Steady State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the quantum-classical correspondence in open quantum many-body systems using the SU(3) Bose-Hubbard trimer as a minimal model. Combining exact diagonalization with semiclassical Langevin dynamics, we establish a direct connection between classical trajectories characterized by fixed-point attractors, limit cycles, or chaos and the spectral and structural properties of the quantum steady state. We show that classical dynamical behavior, as quantified by the sign of the Lyapunov exponent, governs the level statistics of the steady-state density matrix: non-positive exponents associated with regular dynamics yield Poissonian statistics, while positive exponents arising from chaotic dynamics lead to Wigner-Dyson statistics. Strong symmetries constrain the system to lower-dimensional manifolds, suppressing chaos and enforcing localization, while weak symmetries preserve the global structure of the phase space and allow chaotic behavior to persist. To characterize phase-space localization, we introduce the phase-space inverse participation ratio IPR, which defines an effective dimension D of the Husimi distribution's support. We find that the entropy scales as $S \propto \ln N^D$, consistently capturing the classical nature of the underlying dynamics. This semiclassical framework, based on stochastic mixtures of coherent states, successfully reproduces not only observable averages but also finer features such as spectral correlations and localization properties. Our results demonstrate that dissipative quantum chaos is imprinted in the steady-state density matrix, much like in closed systems, and that the interplay between dynamical regimes and symmetry constraints can be systematically probed using spectral and phase-space diagnostics. These tools offer a robust foundation for studying ergodicity, localization, and non-equilibrium phases of open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>High-Throughput Computation of Anharmonic Low-Frequency Protein Vibrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At room temperature, low frequency vibrations at far-infrared frequencies are thermally excited ($k_B T &gt; h \nu$) and not restricted to harmonic fluctuations around a single potential energy minimum. For folded proteins, these intrinsically anharmonic vibrations can contain information on slow conformational transitions. Recently, we have developed FREquency-SElective ANharmonic (FRESEAN) mode analysis, a method based on time correlation functions that isolates low-frequency vibrational motions from molecular dynamics simulation trajectories without relying on harmonic approximations. We recently showed that low-frequency vibrations obtained from FRESEAN mode analysis are effective collective variables in enhanced sampling simulations of conformational ensembles. However, FRESEAN mode analysis is based on velocity time correlations between all degrees of freedom, which creates computational challenges for large biomolecules. To facilitate future applications, we demonstrate here how coarse-graining of all-atom simulation trajectories can be combined with FRESEAN mode analysis to extract information on low-frequency vibrations at minimal computational cost.</description>

      <title>Generative thermodynamic computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a generative modeling framework for thermodynamic computing, in which structured data is synthesized from noise by the natural time evolution of a physical system governed by Langevin dynamics. While conventional diffusion models use neural networks to perform denoising, here the information needed to generate structure from noise is encoded by the dynamics of a thermodynamic system. Training proceeds by maximizing the probability with which the computer generates the reverse of a noising trajectory, which ensures that the computer generates data with minimal heat emission. We demonstrate this framework within a digital simulation of a thermodynamic computer. If realized in analog hardware, such a system would function as a generative model that produces structured samples without the need for artificially-injected noise or active control of denoising.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a set of computer codes designed to test methods for optimizing time-dependent control protocols in fluctuating nonequilibrium systems. Each problem consists of a stochastic model, an optimization objective, and C++ and Python implementations that can be run on Unix-like systems. These benchmark systems are simple enough to run on a laptop, but challenging enough to test the capabilities of modern optimization methods. This release includes five problems and a worked example. The problem set is called NESTbench25, for NonEquilibrium STatistical mechanics benchmarks (2025).</description>

      <title>Random walk with multiple memory channels: a new paradigm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new class of one-dimensional, discrete time random walk model with memory, termed "Random walk with $n$ memory channels" (RW$n$MC) is proposed. In this model the information of $n$ ($n\in \mathbb{Z}$) previous steps from the walker's entire history are needed to decide future step. Exact calculation of the mean and variance of position of the RW2MC ($n=2$) has been done which shows that it can lead to asymptotic diffusive and superdiffusive behavior in different parameter regimes. A connection between RW$n$MC and P\'olya type urn model evolving by $n$ drawings has also been reported. This connection for the RW2MC is discussed in detail which suggests the applicability of RW$2$MC in many population dynamics model with multiple competing species.</description>

      <title>Advanced Langevin thermostats: Properties, extensions to rheology, and a lean momentum-conserving approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Langevin equation accounts for unresolved bath degrees of freedom driving the system toward the bath temperature. Because of this, numerical solutions of the Langevin equation have a long history. Here, we recapitulate, combine, and extend existing Langevin-equation based thermostats, scrutinize their properties and demonstrate their superiority over global kinetic-energy controls. Our work includes compact, asymptotic-analysis based derivations of stochastic thermostats, including the highly accurate Gr{\o}nbech-Jensen scheme. Proposed extensions include a precise, colored and a lean, momentum-conserving thermostat.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent decades, it has been emphasized that the evolving structure of networks may be shaped by interaction principles that yield sparse graphs with a vertex degree distribution exhibiting an algebraic tail, and other structural traits that are not featured in traditional random graphs. In this respect, through a mean-field approach, this review tackles the statistical physics of graph models based on the interaction principle of duplication-divergence. Additional sophistications extending the duplication-divergence model are also reviewed as well as generalizations of other known models. Possible research gaps and related prior results are then discussed.</description>

      <title>Flips Reveal the Universal Impact of Memory on Random Explorations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantifying space exploration is a central question in random walk theory, with direct applications ranging from animal foraging, diffusion-limited reactions, and intracellular transport to stock markets. In particular, the explored domain by one or many simple memoryless (or Markovian) random walks has received considerable attention . However, the physical systems mentioned above typically involve significant memory effects, and so far, no general framework exists to analyze such systems. We introduce the concept of a \emph{flip}, defined most naturally in one dimension, where the visited territory is $[x_{\rm min}, x_{\rm max}]$: a flip occurs when, after discovering a new site at $x_{\rm max}$, the walker next discovers $x_{\rm min} - 1$ instead of $x_{\rm max} + 1$ (and vice-versa).
  While it reduces to the classical splitting probability in Markovian systems, we show that the flip probability serves as a key observable for quantifying the impact of memory effects on space exploration.
  Here, we demonstrate that the flip probability follows a strikingly simple and universal law: it decays inversely with the number of sites visited, as \(1/n\), independently of the underlying stochastic process. We confirm this behavior through simulations across paradigmatic non-Markovian models and observe it in real-world systems, without relying on model assumptions, including biological tracer motion, DNA sequences, and financial market dynamics. Finally, we reveal the physical mechanism behind this universality and show how it extends to higher-dimensional and fractal domains. Our determination of universal flip statistics lay the groundwork for understanding how memory effects govern random explorations.</description>

      <title>Fokker-Planck Score Learning: Efficient Free-Energy Estimation under Periodic Boundary Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate free-energy estimation is essential in molecular simulation, yet the periodic boundary conditions (PBC) commonly used in computer simulations have rarely been explicitly exploited. Equilibrium methods such as umbrella sampling, metadynamics, and adaptive biasing force require extensive sampling, while non-equilibrium pulling with Jarzynski's equality suffers from poor convergence due to exponential averaging. Here, we introduce a physics-informed, score-based diffusion framework: by mapping PBC simulations onto a Brownian particle in a periodic potential, we derive the Fokker-Planck steady-state score that directly encodes free-energy gradients. A neural network is trained on non-equilibrium trajectories to learn this score, providing a principled scheme to efficiently reconstruct the potential of mean force (PMF). On benchmark periodic potentials and small-molecule membrane permeation, our method is up to one order of magnitude more efficient than umbrella sampling.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional Parallel Tempering for Constrained Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sampling Boltzmann probability distributions plays a key role in machine learning and optimization, motivating the design of hardware accelerators such as Ising machines. While the Ising model can in principle encode arbitrary optimization problems, practical implementations are often hindered by soft constraints that either slow down mixing when too strong, or fail to enforce feasibility when too weak. We introduce a two-dimensional extension of the powerful parallel tempering algorithm (PT) that addresses this challenge by adding a second dimension of replicas interpolating the penalty strengths. This scheme ensures constraint satisfaction in the final replicas, analogous to low-energy states at low temperature. The resulting two-dimensional parallel tempering algorithm (2D-PT) improves mixing in heavily constrained replicas and eliminates the need to explicitly tune the penalty strength. In a representative example of graph sparsification with copy constraints, 2D-PT achieves near-ideal mixing, with Kullback-Leibler divergence decaying as O(1/t). When applied to sparsified Wishart instances, 2D-PT yields orders of magnitude speedup over conventional PT with the same number of replicas. The method applies broadly to constrained Ising problems and can be deployed on existing Ising machines.</description>

      <title>Free real scalar CFT on fuzzy sphere: spectrum, algebra and wavefunction ansatz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a simple model to realize the free real scalar CFT on the fuzzy sphere. The model is structurally similar to the original model that realizes the 3D Ising CFT on the fuzzy sphere. Owing to the shift symmetry of the free scalar, the free scalar CFT fixed point in our model can be accessed with only a single tuning parameter-the conformal coupling. We numerically demonstrate that our model correctly reproduces the operator spectrum, correlation functions, and, crucially, the harmonic oscillator algebra of the real scalar CFT. We also examine the fuzzy sphere algebra, a generalization of the Girvin-MacDonald-Platzman algebra, and discuss its potential implications for defining quantum field theories on non-commutative geometries. Finally, we propose wavefunction ansatz for the ground states of both the free scalar and Ising CFTs, which exhibit remarkable agreement with the CFT ground state wavefunctions of the fuzzy sphere model. For instance, the wavefunction overlap between our Ising ansatz and the Ising CFT ground state exceeds $0.99$ for $N=28$ fermions, suggesting a promising direction for tackling the 3D Ising CFT.</description>

      <title>Path Integral Monte Carlo in the Angular Momentum Basis for a Chain of Planar Rotors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a Path Integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) approach that uses the angular momentum representation for the description of interacting rotor systems. Such a choice of representation allows the calculation of momentum properties without having to break the paths. The discrete nature of the momentum basis also allows the use of rejection-free Gibbs sampling techniques. To illustrate the method, we study the collective behavior of $N$ confined planar rotors with dipole-dipole interactions, a system known to exhibit a quantum phase transition from a disordered to an ordered state at zero temperature. Ground state properties are obtained using the Path Integral Ground State (PIGS) method. We propose a Bond-Hamiltonian decomposition for the high temperature density matrix factorization of the imaginary time propagator. We show that \textit{cluster-loop} type moves are necessary to overcome ergodicity issues and to achieve efficient Markov Chain updates. Ground state energies and angular momentum properties are computed and compared with Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) benchmark results. In particular, the derivative of the kinetic energy with respect to the interaction strength estimator is presented as a successful order parameter for the detection of the quantum phase transition.</description>

      <title>Generalized Onsager reciprocal relations of charge and spin transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In spin-orbit-coupled systems the charge and spin transport are generally coupled to each other, namely a charge current will induce a spin current and vice versa. In the presence of time-reversal symmetry $\mathcal{T}$, the cross-coupling transport coefficients describing how one process affects the other are constrained by the famous Onsager reciprocal relations. In this paper, we generalize the Onsager reciprocal relations of charge and spin transport to systems that break the time-reversal symmetry but preserve a combined symmetry of $\mathcal{T}$ and some other symmetry operation $\mathcal{O}$. We show that the symmetry or antisymmetry of the cross-coupling transport coefficients remains in place provided that the operator $\mathcal{O}$ meets certain conditions. Among many candidate systems where our generalized Onsager relations apply, we focus on a conceptually simple and experimentally realized model in cold atomic systems for explicit demonstration and use these relations to predict highly non-trivial transport phenomena that can be readily verified experimentally.</description>

      <title>Unconventional Spin Dynamics and Supersolid Excitations in the Triangular-Lattice XXZ Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by recent experiments, we investigate the spin-1/2 XXZ model on the triangular lattice with strong Ising anisotropy, combining large-scale numerical simulations and analytical methods to uncover unconventional spin dynamics. First, we compute the dynamical spin structure factor using density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations and find excellent agreement with inelastic neutron scattering data on the layered compound $\text{K}_2\text{Co}(\text{SeO}_3)_2$. The low-energy spectrum reveals a roton-like minimum at the $M$ point, absent in linear spin-wave theory, accompanied by peak intensity and a broad continuum above it. Near the $\Gamma$ point, we observe an approximately linear dispersion with vanishing spectral weight. Second, we compare two analytical frameworks that reproduce the observed features. The first is a hard-core boson approach, which includes: (i) an effective staggered boson model (ESBM) at zero magnetic field, (ii) perturbation theory applied to the one-third magnetization plateau, and (iii) a self-consistent mean-field Schwinger boson theory (SBT). The second framework is based on a variational supersolid quantum dimer model (QDM) ansatz, combined with a single-mode approximation. The SBT captures the broad continuum, the $M$-point minimum, and linear dispersion at $\Gamma$, whereas the QDM reproduces the roton minimum and linear dispersion at finite momentum near $\Gamma$. Remarkably, both the QDM wavefunction and the DMRG ground state exhibit nearly identical structure factors with pronounced transverse photon-like excitations. Together, our comprehensive theoretical and numerical analysis elucidates the microscopic origin of supersolid excitations in the XXZ triangular lattice model and their proximity to a spin liquid phase observed experimentally.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate that the machine learning of density functionals allows one to determine simultaneously the equilibrium chemical potential across simulation datasets of inhomogeneous classical fluids. Minimization of an implicit loss function based on an Euler-Lagrange equation yields both the universal one-body direct correlation functional, which is represented locally by a neural network, as well as the system-specific unknown chemical potential values. The method can serve as an efficient alternative to conventional computational techniques of measuring the chemical potential. It also facilitates using canonical training data from Brownian dynamics, molecular dynamics, or Monte Carlo simulations as a basis for constructing neural density functionals, which are fit for accurate multiscale prediction of soft matter systems in equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Kinetic magnetism in the crossover between the square and triangular lattice Fermi-Hubbard models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We calculate the spin correlations that result from the motion of a single dopant in the hard-core Fermi-Hubbard model, as the geometry evolves from a square to a triangular lattice. In particular, we consider the square lattice with an additional hopping along one diagonal, whose strength is continuously varied. We use a high-temperature expansion which expresses the partition function as a sum over closed paths taken by the dopant. We sample thousands of diagrams in the space of closed paths using the quantum Monte Carlo approach of Raghavan and Elser [1,2], which is free of finite-size effects and allows us to simulate temperatures as low as $T \sim 0.3|t|$, even in cases where there is a sign problem. For the case of a hole dopant, we find a crossover from kinetic ferromagnetism to kinetic antiferromagnetism as the geometry is tuned from square to triangular, which can be observed in current quantum gas microscopes.</description>

      <title>Fermionic logarithmic negativity in the Krawtchouk chain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16531v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The entanglement of non-complementary regions is investigated in an inhomogeneous free-fermion chain through the lens of the fermionic logarithmic negativity. Focus is on the Krawtchouk chain, whose relation to the eponymous orthogonal polynomials allows for exact diagonalization and analytical calculations of certain correlation functions. For adjacent regions, the negativity scaling corresponds to that of a conformal field theory with central charge $c=1$, in agreement with previous studies on bipartite entanglement in the Krawtchouk chain. For disjoint regions, we focus on the skeletal regime where each region reduces to a single site. This regime is sufficient to extract the leading behaviour at large distances. In the bulk, the negativity decays as $d^{-4 \Delta_f}$ with $\Delta_f=1/2$, where $d$ is the separation between the regions. This is in agreement with the homogeneous result of free Dirac fermions in one dimension. Surprisingly, when one site is close to the boundary, this exponent changes and depends on the parity of the boundary site $m=0,1,2,\dots$, with $\Delta_f^{\textrm{even}}=3/8$ and $\Delta_f^{\textrm{odd}}=5/8$. The results are supported by numerics and analytical calculations.</description>

      <title>Dynamic neuron approach to deep neural networks: Decoupling neurons for renormalization group analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00396v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep neural network architectures often consist of repetitive structural elements. We introduce an approach that reveals these patterns and can be broadly applied to the study of deep learning. Similarly to how a power strip helps untangle and organize complex cable connections, this approach treats neurons as additional degrees of freedom in interactions, simplifying the structure and enhancing the intuitive understanding of interactions within deep neural networks. Furthermore, it reveals the translational symmetry of deep neural networks, which simplifies the application of the renormalization group transformation-a method that effectively analyzes the scaling behavior of the system. By utilizing translational symmetry and renormalization group transformations, we can analyze critical phenomena. This approach may open new avenues for studying deep neural networks using statistical physics.</description>

      <title>Bridging the Gap between Koopmanism and Response Theory: Using Natural Variability to Predict Forced Response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01622v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The fluctuation-dissipation theorem is a cornerstone result in statistical mechanics that can be used to translate the statistics of the free natural variability of a system into information on its forced response to perturbations. By combining this viewpoint on response theory with the key ingredients of Koopmanism, it is possible to deconstruct virtually any response operator into a sum of terms, each associated with a specific mode of natural variability of the system. This dramatically improves the interpretability of the resulting response formulas. We show here on three simple yet mathematically meaningful examples how to use the Extended Dynamical Mode Decomposition (EDMD) algorithm on an individual trajectory of the system to compute with high accuracy correlation functions as well as Green functions associated with acting forcings. This demonstrates the great potential of using Koopman analysis for the key problem of evaluating and testing the sensitivity of a complex system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03567v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mutual information between particle positions before and after mixing provides a universal assumption-free measure of mixing efficiency at low Reynolds number which accounts for the kinematic reversibility of the Stokes equation. For a generic planar shear flow with time-dependent shear rate, we derive a compact expression for the mutual information as a nonlinear functional of the shearing protocol and solve the associated extremisation problem exactly to determine the optimal control under both linear and non-linear constraints, specifically total shear and total dissipation per unit volume. Remarkably, optimal protocols turn out to be universal and time-reversal symmetric in both cases. Our results establish a minimum energetic cost of erasing information in a broad class of non-equilibrium drift-diffusive systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09980v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While Landauer's principle sets a fundamental energy limit for irreversible digital computation, we show that Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) implemented on analog physical substrates can operate under markedly different thermodynamic constraints. We distinguish between two classes of analog systems: dynamic and quasi-static. In dynamic systems, energy dissipation arises from neuron resets, with a lower bound governed by Landauer's principle. To analyse a quasi-static analog platform, we construct an explicit mapping of a generic feedforward DNN onto a physical system described by a model Hamiltonian. In this framework, inference can proceed reversibly, with no minimum free energy cost imposed by thermodynamics. We further analyze the training process in quasi-static analog networks and derive a fundamental lower bound on its energy cost, rooted in the interplay between thermal and statistical noise. Our results suggest that while analog implementations can outperform digital ones during inference, the thermodynamic cost of training scales similarly in both paradigms.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Shooting Point Monte Carlo Methods for Transition Path Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03054v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rare event sampling algorithms are essential for understanding processes that occur infrequently on the molecular scale, yet they are important for the long-time dynamics of complex molecular systems. One of these algorithms, transition path sampling (TPS), has become a standard technique to study such rare processes since no prior knowledge on the transition region is required. Most TPS methods generate new trajectories from old trajectories by selecting a point along the old trajectory, modifying its momentum in some way, and then ``shooting'' a new trajectory by integrating forward and backward in time. In some procedures, the shooting point is selected independently for each trial move, but in others, the shooting point evolves from one path to the next so that successive shooting points are related to each other. To account for this memory effect, we introduce a theoretical framework based on an extended ensemble that includes both paths and shooting indices. We derive appropriate acceptance rules for various path sampling algorithms in this extended formalism, ensuring the correct sampling of the transition path ensemble. Our framework reveals the need for amended acceptance criteria in the flexible-length aimless shooting and spring shooting methods.</description>

      <title>Quantum thermal machine regimes in the transverse-field Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23710v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We identify and interpret the possible quantum thermal machine regimes with a transverse-field Ising model as the working substance. In general, understanding the emergence of such regimes in a many-body quantum system is challenging due to the dependence on the many energy levels in the system. By considering infinitesimal work strokes, we can understand the operation from equilibrium properties of the system. We find that infinitesimal work strokes enable both heat engine and accelerator operation, with the output and boundaries of operation described by macroscopic properties of the system, in particular the net transverse magnetization. At low temperatures, the regimes of operation and performance can be understood from quasiparticles in the system, while at high temperatures an expansion of the free energy in powers of inverse temperature describes the operation. The understanding generalises to larger work strokes when the temperature difference between the hot and cold reservoirs is large. For hot and cold reservoirs close in temperature, a sufficiently large work stroke can enable refrigerator and heater regimes. Our results and method of analysis will prove useful in understanding the possible regimes of operation of quantum many-body thermal machines more generally.</description>

      <title>Strong Disorder Renormalization Group Method for Bond Disordered Antiferromagnetic Quantum Spin Chains with Long Range Interactions: Ground State Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07298v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce and implement a reformulation of the strong disorder renormalization group method in real space, well suited to study bond disordered antiferromagnetic power law coupled quantum spin chains. We derive the Master equations for the distribution function of pair distances $\tilde{r}$.
  First, we apply it to a short range coupled spin chain, keeping only interactions for adjacent spins. We confirm that it is solved by the infinite randomness fixed point distribution. Then, we solve the Master equation for the power law long range interaction between all spins for any anisotropy ranging from the XX-limit to the isotropic Heisenberg limit, corresponding to a tight binding chain of disordered long range interacting Fermions with long range hopping. We thereby show that the distribution function of couplings $J$ at renormalization scale $\Omega$ flows to the strong disorder fixed point distribution with small corrections at $\tilde{r} &gt; \rho,$ which depend on power exponent $\alpha$ and coupling anisotropy $\gamma.$ As a consequence, the low temperature magnetic susceptibility diverges with an anomalous power law. The distribution of singlet lengths $l$ is found to decay as $l^{-2}$. The entanglement entropy of a subsystem of length $n$ increases in the ground state logarithmically for all $\alpha$ and $\gamma$. After a global quantum quench the entanglement entropy increases with time logarithmically as $S(t) \sim \ln(t)/(2\alpha)$.</description>

Abstract: Cubic silicon carbide phonon thermal conductivity has been calculated using anharmonic phonon analysis. The atomic interaction model was built using displacement-force data obtained with the High Efficiency Configuration Space Sampling (HECSS) technique and density functional theory calculated forces. In the new version of HECSS we replaced the Markov chain scheme of Metropolis-Hastings Monte-Carlo with weighting of the final sampling according to the target distribution. This increased the efficiency of the method and allowed to use -- with appropriate weight -- all generated and ab-initio evaluated samples. The quality of the proposed method is confirmed by the accuracy with which the experimental results taken from the literature were reproduced.</description>

      <title>Fluctuations and Correlations of Local Topological Order Parameters in Disordered Two-dimensional Topological Insulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23188v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional topological insulators are characterized by an insulating bulk and conductive edge states protected by the nontrivial topology of the bulk electronic structure. They remain robust against moderate disorder until Anderson localization occurs and destroys the topological phase. Interestingly, disorder can also induce a topological phase - known as a topological Anderson insulator - starting from an otherwise pristine trivial phase. While topological invariants are generally regarded as global quantities, we argue that space-resolved topological markers can act as local order parameters, revealing the role of fluctuations and correlations in the local topology under Anderson disorder and vacancies. With this perspective, we perform numerical simulations of disorder-driven topological phase transitions in the Haldane and Kane-Mele models, using supercells with both open and periodic boundary conditions. We find that short-scale fluctuations of topological markers vanish upon coarse-graining, except at the topological phase transition, where their correlation length peaks and large-scale fluctuations remain. Notably, such a topological correlation function is characterized by critical exponents that appear universal across disorder types, yet they can resolve different topological phase transitions.</description>

Abstract: We present a local offline decoder for topological codes that operates according to a parallelized message-passing framework. The decoder works by passing messages between anyons, with the contents of received messages used to move nearby anyons towards one another. We prove the existence of a threshold, and show that in a system of linear size $L$, decoding terminates with an $O((\log L)^\eta)$ average-case runtime, where $\eta$ is a small constant. For i.i.d Pauli noise, our decoder has $\eta=1$ and a threshold at a noise strength of $p_c\approx 7.3\%$.</description>

      <title>Interpretable representation learning of quantum data enabled by probabilistic variational autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11982v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Interpretable machine learning is rapidly becoming a crucial tool for scientific discovery. Among existing approaches, variational autoencoders (VAEs) have shown promise in extracting the hidden physical features of some input data, with no supervision nor prior knowledge of the system at study. Yet, the ability of VAEs to create meaningful, interpretable representations relies on their accurate approximation of the underlying probability distribution of their input. When dealing with quantum data, VAEs must hence account for its intrinsic randomness and complex correlations. While VAEs have been previously applied to quantum data, they have often neglected its probabilistic nature, hindering the extraction of meaningful physical descriptors. Here, we demonstrate that two key modifications enable VAEs to learn physically meaningful latent representations: a decoder capable of faithfully reproduce quantum states and a probabilistic loss tailored to this task. Using benchmark quantum spin models, we identify regimes where standard methods fail while the representations learned by our approach remain meaningful and interpretable. Applied to experimental data from Rydberg atom arrays, the model autonomously uncovers the phase structure without access to prior labels, Hamiltonian details, or knowledge of relevant order parameters, highlighting its potential as an unsupervised and interpretable tool for the study of quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Structure-Dynamics Correlation and Its Link to Fragility and Dynamic Heterogeneity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12773v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the connection between structure, dynamics, and fragility (the rate at which relaxation time grow with decreasing temperature) is central to unraveling the glass transition. Fragility is often linked to dynamic heterogeneity, and thus it is commonly assumed that if structure influences dynamics, more fragile systems should exhibit stronger structure dynamics correlations. In this study, we test the generality of this assumption using three model systems: Lennard-Jones (LJ) and Weeks--Chandler--Andersen, where fragility is tuned via density, and a modified LJ (q, p) system, where potential softness is changed to vary fragility. We employ a structural order parameter derived from the mean field caging potential and analyze energy barriers at both macroscopic and microscopic levels. While the macroscopic slope of the energy barrier, suitably defined, correlates with fragility, no consistent correlation is found for the microscopic energy barriers. Instead, the latter shows a strong correlation with an independently computed structure dynamics measure obtained from isoconfigurational ensemble. Surprisingly, the two systems with the highest structure dynamics correlation, LJ at rho = 1.1 and the (8, 5) model, are respectively the least and most fragile within their classes. These systems exhibit broad mobility distributions, bimodal displacement profiles, and high non-Gaussian parameters, all indicative of dynamic heterogeneity. However, their dynamic susceptibilities remain low, suggesting a decoupling between spatial correlation and temporal heterogeneity. Both systems lie in the enthalpy-dominated regime and are near the spinodal, suggesting mechanical instability as a source of heterogeneity. These findings challenge the conventional linkage among fragility, heterogeneity, and structure-dynamics correlation.</description>
