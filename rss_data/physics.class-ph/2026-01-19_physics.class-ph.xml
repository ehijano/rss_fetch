      <title>Nonlinear Scalar Interactions in the EMDrive: Petiau's Elliptic-Function Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The EMDrive, a controversial electromagnetic propulsion concept, challenges momentum conservation in standard Maxwell electrodynamics. We propose a beyond-Maxwell framework by coupling the electromagnetic field to a light scalar field, inspired by axion-like particle models and effective field theory. Using Guy Petiau's 1958 elliptic-function solutions for nonlinear wave equations, we construct exact cavity modes and combine them via Jacobi addition theorems. These nonlinear modes produce an asymmetric momentum flux, suggesting a theoretical pathway for EMDrive thrust. We compute the stress-tensor asymmetry numerically and show that while standard axion-like particles yield negligible effects, light scalars beyond current constraints could produce measurable thrust. The framework provides testable predictions connecting EMDrive physics to dark matter searches.</description>

      <title>Conformal Symmetry and the Thermal Effects of Acceleration in Classical Physic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An accelerating Rindler frame in Minkowski spacetime acting for a finite time interval is used to carry a box of particles or waves between two relativistic inertial frames. The finite spatial extent of the box allows treatment of the equations of motion for particles or for waves, while the Rindler acceleration provides a substitute for scattering to test for thermal equilibrium. In the case of equilibrium for relativist particles, the Juttner distribution is derived. For relativistic waves, a full derivation of the Planck spectrum including zero-point radiation is obtained within classical theory. For relativistic waves, relativistic behavior and conformal symmetry are crucial. It is emphasized that the classical two-point correlation function for classical zero-point radiation depends upon the geodesic separation between the spacetime points and is independent of the coordinate system choice. The classical point of view here does not give any support for the idea that a system in uniform acceleration through classical zero-point radiation finds a thermal system.</description>

      <title>Chemically decisive benchmarks on the path to quantum utility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Progress towards quantum utility in chemistry requires not only algorithmic advances, but also the identification of chemically meaningful problems whose electronic structure fundamentally challenges classical methods. Here, we introduce a curated hierarchy of chemically decisive benchmark systems designed to probe distinct regimes of electronic correlation relevant to molecular, bioinorganic, and heavy-element chemistry. Moving beyond minimal toy models, our benchmark set spans multireference bond breaking (N$_2$), high-spin transition-metal chemistry (FeS), biologically relevant iron-sulfur clusters ([2Fe-2S]), and actinide-actinide bonding (U$_2$), which exhibits extreme sensitivity to active-space choice, relativistic treatment, and correlation hierarchy even within advanced multireference frameworks. As a concrete realization, we benchmark a recently developed automated and adaptive quantum algorithm based on generator-coordinate-inspired subspace expansion,ADAPT-GCIM, using a black-box workflow that integrates entropy-based active-space selection via the ActiveSpaceFinder tool. Across this chemically diverse problem set, ADAPT-GCIM achieves high accuracy in challenging correlation regimes. Equally importantly, these benchmarks expose general failure modes and design constraints-independent of any specific algorithm-highlighting the necessity of problem-aware and correlation-specific strategies for treating strongly correlated chemistry on quantum computers. To support systematic benchmarking and reproducible comparisons, the Hamiltonians for all systems studied are made openly available.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal spectra of a wormhole family: overtone features and a parameter-controlled redshift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09860v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Though investigated extensively in the past, we take a detailed relook at the study of quasinormal modes (QNM) in a known family of wormholes (ultrastatic ($g_{00}=-1$), as well as spacetimes with different, non-constant $g_{00}$), which includes the familiar Bronnikov-Ellis spacetime as a special case. Our focus here is to go beyond the fundamental mode and obtain some of the QNM overtones using a suitable numerical scheme. Scalar and axial gravitational QNMs including two or three overtones are obtained for the family of ultrastatic geometries and their parameter dependencies are shown explicitly. Further, we comment on how (a) the overtones may influence the time-domain profile in a perturbation and (b) in what sense, the use of overtones may help in distinguishing between different geometries within the family.
  Finally, we show how an effect somewhat similar to the so-called `environment induced redshift' of QNMs, introduced recently (Phys. Rev. D \textbf{111}, 064026 (2025)), may be obtained for spacetimes with non-constant $g_{00}$, via an appropriate tuning of available metric parameters which systematically modify the shapes of the effective potentials arising in the perturbation equations.</description>
