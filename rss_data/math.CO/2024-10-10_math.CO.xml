      <title>A note on Two-Point Concentration of the Independence Number of $G_{n,m}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the independence number of $ G_{n,m}$ is concentrated on two values for $ n^{5/4+ \epsilon} &lt; m \le \binom{n}{2}$. This result establishes a distinction between $G_{n,m}$ and $G_{n,p}$ with $p = m/ \binom{n}{2}$ in the regime $ n^{5/4 + \epsilon} &lt; m&lt; n^{4/3}$. In this regime the independence number of $ G_{n,m}$ is concentrated on two values while the independence number of $ G_{n,p}$ is not; indeed, for $p$ in this regime variations in $ \alpha( G_{n,p})$ are determined by variations in the number of edges in $ G_{n,p}$.</description>

      <title>Neighborhood Balanced 3-Coloring</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph is said to be neighborhood 3-balanced if there exists a vertex labeling with three colors so that each vertex has an equal number of neighbors of each color. We give order constraints on 3-balanced graphs, determine which generalized Petersen and Pappus graphs are 3-balanced, discuss when being 3-balanced is preserved under various graph constructions, give two general characterizations of cubic 3-balanced graphs, and classify cubic 3-balanced graphs of small order.</description>

      <title>Characterizing real-representable matroids with large average hyperplane-size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalizing a theorem of the first two authors and Geelen for planes, we show that, for a real-representable matroid $M$, either the average hyperplane-size in $M$ is at most a constant depending only on its rank, or each hyperplane of $M$ contains one of a set of at most $r(M)-2$ lines. Additionally, in the latter case, the ground set of $M$ has a partition $(E_{1}, E_{2})$, where $E_{1}$ can be covered by few flats of relatively low rank and $|E_{2}|$ is bounded. Finally, we formulate a high-dimensional generalization of a classic problem of Motzkin, Gr\"unbaum, Erd\H{o}s and Purdy on sets of red and blue points in the plane with no monochromatic blue line. We show that the solution to this problem gives a tight upper bound on $|E_{2}|$. We also discuss this high-dimensional problem in its own right, and prove some initial results.</description>

      <title>Mis\`ere Connect Four is Solved</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Connect Four is a two-player game where each player attempts to be the first to create a sequence of four of their pieces, arranged horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, by dropping pieces into the columns of a grid of width seven and height six, in alternating turns. Mis\`ere Connect Four is played by the same rules, but with the opposite objective: do not connect four. This paper announces that Mis\`ere Connect Four is solved: perfect play by both sides leads to a second-player win. More generally, this paper also announces that Mis\`ere Connect $k$ played on a $w \times h$ board is also solved, but the outcome depends on the game's parameters $k$, $w$, and $h$, and may be a first-player win, a second-player win, or a draw. These results are constructive, meaning that we provide explicit strategies, thus enabling readers to impress their friends and foes alike with provably optimal play in the mis\`ere form of a table-top game for children.</description>

      <title>Lyndon-like cyclic sieving and Gauss congruence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A family of instances of the cyclic sieving phenomenon is said to be 'Lyndon-like' if their fixed-point counts satisfy a particular recursive formula. By allowing these families to be indexed by sets generalising the positive integers, we observe that many known instances of cyclic sieving are in fact Lyndon-like. Using a combinatorial model of necklaces where beads vary by both colour and length, we prove a correspondence between families of integers satisfying the Gauss congruences and possible bead-sets for these necklaces. This result provides new insight into Gauss congruence, and allows us to describe many novel examples of Lyndon-like cyclic sieving involving necklaces, path walks, tubings and more.</description>

      <title>On cycles in monotone grid classes of permutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We undertake a detailed investigation into the structure of permutations in monotone grid classes whose row-column graphs do not contain components with more than one cycle. Central to this investigation is a new decomposition, called the $M$-sum, which generalises the well-known notions of direct sum and skew sum, and enables a deeper understanding of the structure of permutations in these grid classes. Permutations which are indecomposable with respect to the $M$-sum play a crucial role in the structure of a grid class and of its subclasses, and this leads us to identify coils, a certain kind of permutation which corresponds to repeatedly traversing a chosen cycle in a particular manner.
  Harnessing this analysis, we give a precise characterisation for when a subclass of such a grid class is labelled well quasi-ordered, and we extend this to characterise (unlabelled) well quasi-ordering in certain cases. We prove that a large general family of these grid classes are finitely based, but we also exhibit other examples that are not, thereby disproving a conjecture from 2006 due to Huczynska and Vatter.</description>

      <title>Odd-Ramsey numbers of complete bipartite graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In his study of graph codes, Alon introduced the concept of the odd-Ramsey number of a family of graphs $\mathcal{H}$ in $K_n$, defined as the minimum number of colours needed to colour the edges of $K_n$ so that every copy of a graph $H\in \mathcal{H}$ intersects some colour class in an odd number of edges. In this paper, we focus on complete bipartite graphs. First, we completely resolve the problem when $\mathcal{H}$ is the family of all spanning complete bipartite graphs on $n$ vertices. We then focus on its subfamilies, that is, $\{K_{t,n-t}\colon t\in T\}$ for a fixed set of integers $T\subseteq [\lfloor n/2 \rfloor]$. We prove that the odd-Ramsey problem is equivalent to determining the maximum dimension of a linear binary code avoiding codewords of given weights, and leverage known results from coding theory to deduce asymptotically tight bounds in our setting. We conclude with bounds for the odd-Ramsey numbers of fixed (that is, non-spanning) complete bipartite subgraphs.</description>

      <title>Smoothed analysis for graph isomorphism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06095v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is no known polynomial-time algorithm for graph isomorphism testing, but elementary combinatorial "refinement" algorithms seem to be very efficient in practice. Some philosophical justification is provided by a classical theorem of Babai, Erd\H{o}s and Selkow: an extremely simple polynomial-time combinatorial algorithm (variously known as "na\"ive refinement", "na\"ive vertex classification", "colour refinement" or the "1-dimensional Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm") yields a so-called canonical labelling scheme for "almost all graphs". More precisely, for a typical outcome of a random graph $G(n,1/2)$, this simple combinatorial algorithm assigns labels to vertices in a way that easily permits isomorphism-testing against any other graph.
  We improve the Babai-Erd\H{o}s-Selkow theorem in two directions. First, we consider randomly perturbed graphs, in accordance with the smoothed analysis philosophy of Spielman and Teng: for any graph $G$, na\"ive refinement becomes effective after a tiny random perturbation to $G$ (specifically, the addition and removal of $O(n\log n)$ random edges). Actually, with a twist on na\"ive refinement, we show that $O(n)$ random additions and removals suffice. These results significantly improve on previous work of Gaudio-R\'acz-Sridhar, and are in certain senses best-possible.
  Second, we complete a long line of research on canonical labelling of random graphs: for any $p$ (possibly depending on $n$), we prove that a random graph $G(n,p)$ can typically be canonically labelled in polynomial time. This is most interesting in the extremely sparse regime where $p$ has order of magnitude $c/n$; denser regimes were previously handled by Bollob\'as, Czajka-Pandurangan, and Linial-Mosheiff. Our proof also provides a description of the automorphism group of a typical outcome of $G(n,p_n)$ (slightly correcting a prediction of Linial-Mosheiff).</description>

      <title>Spread blow-up lemma with an application to perturbed random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Combining ideas of Pham, Sah, Sawhney, and Simkin on spread perfect matchings in super-regular bipartite graphs with an algorithmic blow-up lemma, we prove a spread version of the blow-up lemma. Intuitively, this means that there exists a probability measure over copies of a desired spanning graph $H$ in a given system of super-regular pairs which does not heavily pin down any subset of vertices. This allows one to complement the use of the blow-up lemma with the recently resolved Kahn-Kalai conjecture. As an application, we prove an approximate version of a conjecture of B\"ottcher, Parczyk, Sgueglia, and Skokan on the threshold for appearance of powers of Hamilton cycles in perturbed random graphs.</description>

      <title>Almost colour-balanced spanning forests in complete graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given $K_n$ whose edges are coloured red and blue, and a forest $F$ of order $n$, we seek embeddings of $F$ with small imbalance, that is, difference between the numbers of red and blue edges. We show that if the $2$-colouring of the edges of $K_n$ is balanced, meaning that the numbers of red and blue edges are equal, and $F$ has maximum degree $\Delta$, then one can find an embedding of $F$ into $K_n$ whose imbalance is at most $\Delta/2 + 18$, which is essentially best possible and resolves a conjecture of Mohr, Pardey, and Rautenbach. Furthermore, we give a tighter bound for the imbalance for small values of $\Delta$. In particular, we prove that the imbalance can be taken to be constant in the case where $\Delta&lt;n(1/4 - \eta)$ for any constant $\eta&gt;0$.</description>

      <title>Linear dependencies, polynomial factors in the Duke--Erd\H os forbidden sunflower problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We call a family of $s$ sets $\{F_1, \ldots, F_s\}$ a \textit{sunflower with $s$ petals} if, for any distinct $i, j \in [s]$, one has $F_i \cap F_j = \cap_{u = 1}^s F_u$. The set $C = \cap_{u = 1}^s F_u$ is called the {\it core} of the sunflower. It is a classical result of Erd\H os and Rado that there is a function $\phi(s,k)$ such that any family of $k$-element sets contains a sunflower with $s$ petals. In 1977, Duke and Erd\H os asked for the size of the largest family $\ff\subset{[n]\choose k}$ that contains no sunflower with $s$ petals and core of size $t-1$. In 1987, Frankl and F\" uredi asymptotically solved this problem for $k\ge 2t+1$ and $n&gt;n_0(s,k)$. This paper is one of the pinnacles of the so-called Delta-system method.
  In this paper, we extend the result of Frankl and F\"uredi to a much broader range of parameters: $n&gt;f_0(s,t) k$ with $f_0(s,t)$ polynomial in $s$ and $t$. We also extend this result to other domains, such as $[n]^k$ and ${n\choose k/w}^w$ and obtain even stronger and more general results for forbidden sunflowers with core at most $t-1$ (including results for families of permutations and subfamilies of the $k$-th layer in a simplicial complex).
  The methods of the paper, among other things, combine the spread approximation technique, introduced by Zakharov and the first author, with the Delta-system approach of Frankl and F\"uredi and the hypercontractivity approach for global functions, developed by Keller, Lifshitz and coauthors. Previous works in extremal set theory relied on at most one of these methods. Creating such a unified approach was one of the goals for the paper.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce totally nonnegative Grassmannians over finite fields where an element of a finite field is nonnegative if it is a square of an element of the finite field. Explicit point counts are given in some special cases where we find new interpretations of sequences in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS). We compare and contrast the theory of totally nonnegative Grassmannians over a finite field with the traditional case of the field of real numbers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The edge space $\mathcal{E}(G)$ of a graph $G$ is the vector space $\mathbb{F}_2^{E(G)}$ with members naturally identified with subgraphs of $G$, and the $H$-space is the subspace $\mathcal{C}_H(G)$ of $ \mathcal{E}(G)$ spanned by copies of the graph $H$. We are interested in when the random graph $G = G_{n,p}$ is likely to satisfy \[\mathcal{C}_H(G) = \mathcal{W}_H(G),\] where $\mathcal{W}_H(G)$ takes one of four natural values, depending on the value of $\mathcal{C}_H(K_n)$. We show that for strictly $2$-balanced $H$, w.h.p. the above equality holds whenever every edge of $G$ is in a copy of $H$.</description>

      <title>The number of edges in graphs with bounded clique number and circumference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06449v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\cal H$ be a family of graphs. The Tur\'an number ${\rm ex}(n,{\cal H})$ is the maximum possible number of edges in an $n$-vertex graph which does not contain any member of $\cal H$ as a subgraph. As a common generalization of Tur\'an's theorem and Erd\H{o}s-Gallai theorem on the Tur\'an number of matchings, Alon and Frankl determined ${\rm ex}(n,{\cal H})$ for ${\cal H}=\{K_r,M_k\}$, where $M_k$ is a matching of size $k$. Replacing $M_k$ by $P_k$, Katona and Xiao obtained the Tur\'an number of ${\cal H}=\{K_r,P_k\}$ for $r \leq \lfloor k/2 \rfloor$ and sufficiently large $n$. In addition, they proposed a conjecture for the case of $r \geq \lfloor k/2 \rfloor+1$ and sufficiently large $n$. Motivated by the fact that the result for ${\rm ex}(n,P_k)$ can be deduced from the one for ${\rm ex}(n,{\cal C}_{\geq k})$, we investigate the Tur\'an number of ${\cal H}=\{K_r, {\cal C}_{\geq k}\}$ in this paper. Namely, for such $\cal H$, we are able to show the value of ${\rm ex}(n,{\cal H})$ for $r \geq \lfloor (k-1)/2\rfloor+2$ and all $n$. As an application of this result, we confirm Katona and Xiao's conjecture in a stronger form. For $r \leq \lfloor (k-1)/2\rfloor+1$, we manage to show the value of ${\rm ex}(n,{\cal H})$ for sufficiently large $n$.</description>

      <title>Outer Independent Roman Domination Number of Cartesian Product of Paths and Cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a graph $G$ with vertex set $V$, an outer independent Roman dominating function (OIRDF) is a function $f$ from $V(G)$ to $\{0, 1, 2\}$ for which every vertex with label $0$ under $f$ is adjacent to at least a vertex with label $2$ but not adjacent to another vertex with label $0$. The weight of an OIRDF $f$ is the sum of vertex function values all over the graph, and the minimum of an OIRDF is the outer independent Roman domination number of $G$, denoted as $\gamma_{oiR}(G)$. In this paper, we focus on the outer independent Roman domination number of the Cartesian product of paths and cycles $P_{n}\Box C_{m}$. We determine the exact values of $\gamma_{oiR}(P_n\Box C_m)$ for $n=1,2,3$ and $\gamma_{oiR}(P_n\Box C_3)$ and present an upper bound of $\gamma_{oiR}(P_n\Box C_m)$ for $n\ge 4, m\ge 4$.</description>

      <title>When Joints Meet Extremal Graph Theory: Hypergraph Joints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Kruskal--Katona theorem determines the maximum number of $d$-cliques in an $n$-edge $(d-1)$-uniform hypergraph. A generalization of the theorem was proposed by Bollob\'as and Eccles, called the partial shadow problem. The problem asks to determine the maximum number of $r$-sets of vertices that contain at least $d$ edges in an $n$-edge $(d-1)$-uniform hypergraph. In our previous work, we obtained an asymptotically tight upper bound via its connection to the joints problem, a problem in incidence geometry. In a different direction, Friedgut and Kahn generalized the Kruskal--Katona theorem by determining the maximum number of copies of any fixed hypergraph in an $n$-edge hypergraph, up to a multiplicative factor.
  In this paper, using the connection to the joints problem again, we generalize our previous work to show an analogous partial shadow phenomenon for any hypergraph, generalizing Friedgut and Kahn's result. The key idea is to encode the graph-theoretic problem with new kinds of joints that we call hypergraph joints. Our main theorem is a generalization of the joints theorem that upper bounds the number of hypergraph joints, which the partial shadow phenomenon immediately follows from. In addition, with an appropriate notion of multiplicities, our theorem also generalizes a generalization of H\"older's inequality considered by Finner.</description>

      <title>On an acyclic relaxation of incomparable families of sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For two families $\mathcal{A}, \mathcal{B} \subseteq \mathcal{P}([k])$, we write $\mathcal{A}\vdash\mathcal{B}$ if $A\not\supseteq B$ for each two sets $A \in \mathcal{A}$ and $B \in \mathcal{B}$. $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{B}$ are called incomparable if $\mathcal{A}\vdash\mathcal{B}$ and $\mathcal{B}\vdash\mathcal{A}$. Seymour (1973) proved that the maximum size of two incomparable equal-sized families in $\mathcal{P}([k])$ is $\frac{1}{4}2^k$. A sequence of families $\mathcal{B}_1,\dots,\mathcal{B}_l \ \subseteq \mathcal{P}([k])$ is called $d$-exceeding if $\mathcal{B}_i\vdash\mathcal{B}_j$ for all $i,j\in [l]$ with $j-i\in [d]$. Cyclically reusing $d+1$ pairwise incomparable families yields arbitrarily long $d$-exceeding sequences of families. We prove inversely that upper bounds on the size of $d+1$ pairwise incomparable equal-sized families are also true for sufficiently long $d$-exceeding sequences, for fixed $d$. A sequence of sets $B_1,\dots,B_l \subseteq [k]$ is called $d$-exceeding if $\{B_1\},\dots,\{B_l\}$ is $d$-exceeding, that is, if $B_i \not\supseteq B_j$ for all $i,j\in [l]$ with $j-i\in [d]$. We locate the maximum $d$ such that there exist arbitrarily long $d$-exceeding sequences of subsets of $[k]$ between $(1-o(1)) \tfrac{1}{e} 2^k$ and $\tfrac{1}{2}2^k-2$.</description>

      <title>Some sufficient conditions for graphs to have component factors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ denote a graph and $k\geq2$ be an integer. A $\{K_{1,1},K_{1,2},\ldots,K_{1,k},\mathcal{T}(2k+1)\}$-factor of $G$ is a spanning subgraph, whose every connected component is isomorphic to an element of $\{K_{1,1},K_{1,2},\ldots,K_{1,k},\mathcal{T}(2k+1)\}$, where $\mathcal{T}(2k+1)$ is one special family of tree. In this paper, we put forward some sufficient conditions for the existence of $\{K_{1,1},K_{1,2},\ldots,K_{1,k},\mathcal{T}(2k+1)\}$-factors in graphs. Furthermore, we construct some extremal graphs to show that the main results in this paper are best possible.</description>

      <title>Dimension Bounds for Systems of Equations with Graph Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a broad class of equations that are described by a graph, which includes many well-studied systems. For these, we show that the number of solutions (or the dimension of the solution set) can be bounded by studying certain induced subgraphs. As corollaries, we obtain novel bounds in spectral graph theory on the multiplicities of graph eigenvalues, and in nonlinear dynamical system on the dimension of the equilibrium set of a network.</description>

      <title>Cut covers of acyclic digraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A cut in a digraph $D=(V,A)$ is a set of arcs $\{uv \in A: u\in U, v\notin U\}$, for some $U\subseteq V$. It is known that the arc set $A$ is covered by $k$ cuts if and only if it admits a $k$-coloring such that no two consecutive arcs $uv, vw$ receive the same color. Alon, Bollob\'as, Gy\'arf\'as, Lehel and Scott (2007) observed that every acyclic digraph of maximum indegree at most $\binom{k}{\lfloor k/2 \rfloor}-1$ is covered by $k$ cuts. We prove that this degree condition is best possible (if an enormous outdegree is allowed). Notably, for $k\geq 5$, powers of directed paths do not suffice as extremal examples. Instead, we locate the maximum $d$ such that the $d$-th power of an arbitrarily long directed path is covered by $k$ cuts between $(1-o(1)) \frac{1}{e} 2^k$ and $\frac{1}{2}2^k-2$. Let $k\geq 3$ and $D$ be an acyclic digraph that is not covered by $k$ cuts. We prove that the decision problem whether a digraph that admits a homomorphism to $D$ is covered by $k$ cuts is NP-complete. If $k=3$ and $D$ is the third power of the directed path on 12 vertices, then even the restriction to planar digraphs of maximum indegree and outdegree $3$ holds.</description>

      <title>A structural description of Zykov and Blanche Descartes graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1949, Zykov proposed the first explicit construction of triangle-free graphs with arbitrarily large chromatic number. We define a Zykov graph as any induced subgraph of a graph created using Zykov's construction. We give a structural characterization of Zykov graphs based on a specific type of stable set, that we call splitting stable set. It implies that recognizing this class is NP-complete, while being FPT in the treewidth of the input graph. We provide similar results for the Blanche Descartes construction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding invertibility in restricted mis\`ere play has been challenging; in particular, the possibility of non-conjugate inverses posed difficulties. Advances have been made in a few specific universes, but a general theorem was elusive. We prove that every universe has the conjugate property, and also give a characterisation of the invertible elements of each universe. We then explore when a universe can have non-trivial invertible elements, leaving a slew of open problems to be further investigated.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the \emph{ID-index} of a finite simple connected graph. For a graph $G=(V,\ E)$ with diameter $d$, we let $f:V\longrightarrow \mathbb{R}$ assign \emph{ranks} to the vertices, then under $f$, each vertex $v$ gets a \emph{string}, which is a $d$-vector with the $i$-th coordinate being the sum of the ranks of the vertices that are of distance $i$ from $v$. The \emph{ID-index} of $G$, denoted by $IDI(G)$, is defined to be the minimum number $k$ for which there is an $f$ with $|f(V)|=k$, such that each vertex gets a distinct string under $f$. We present some relations between ID-graphs, which were defined by Chartrand, Kono, and Zhang, and their ID-indices; give a lower bound on the ID-index of a graph; and determine the ID-indices of paths, grids, cycles, prisms, complete graphs, some complete multipartite graphs, and some caterpillars.</description>

      <title>The proof of a conjecture about cages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The girth of a graph is defined as the length of a shortest cycle in the graph. A $(k; g)$-cage is a graph of minimum order among all $k$-regular graphs with girth $g$. A cycle $C$ in a graph $G$ is termed nonseparating if the graph $G-V(C)$ remains connected. A conjecture, proposed in [T. Jiang, D. Mubayi. Connectivity and Separating Sets of Cages. J. Graph Theory 29(1)(1998) 35--44], posits that every cycle of length $g$ within a $(k; g)$-cage is nonseparating. While the conjecture has been proven for even $g$ in the aforementioned work, this paper presents a proof demonstrating that the conjecture holds true for odd $g$ as well. Thus, the previously mentioned conjecture was proven to be true.</description>

      <title>Unique-neighbor Expanders with Better Expansion for Polynomial-sized Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A $(d_1,d_2)$-biregular bipartite graph $G=(L\cup R,E)$ is called left-$(m,\delta)$ unique-neighbor expander iff each subset $S$ of the left vertices with $|S|\leq m$ has at least $\delta d_1|S|$ unique-neighbors, where unique-neighbors mean vertices with exactly one neighbor in $S$. We can also define right/two-sided expanders similarly. In this paper, we give the following three strongly explicit constructions of unique-neighbor expanders with better unique-neighbor expansion for polynomial-sized sets, while sufficient expansion for linear-sized sets is also preserved:
  (1) Two-sided $(n^{1/3-\epsilon},1-\epsilon)$ lossless expanders for arbitrary $\epsilon&gt;0$ and aspect ratio.
  (2) Left-$(\Omega(n),1-\epsilon)$ lossless expanders with right-$(n^{1/3-\epsilon},\delta)$ expansion for some $\delta&gt;0$.
  (3) Two-sided-$(\Omega(n),\delta)$ unique-neighbor expanders with two-sided-$(n^{\Omega(1)},1/2-\epsilon)$ expansion.
  The second construction exhibits the first explicit family of one-sided lossless expanders with unique-neighbor expansion for polynomial-sized sets from the other side and constant aspect ratio. The third construction gives two-sided unique-neighbor expanders with additional $(1/2-\epsilon)$ unique-neighbor expansion for two-sided polynomial-sized sets, which approaches the $1/2$ requirement in Lin and Hsieh (arXiv:2203.03581).
  Our techniques involve tripartite product recently introduced by Hsieh et al (STOC 2024), combined with a generalized existence argument of biregular graph with optimal two-sided unique-neighbor expansion for almost all degrees. We also use a new reduction from large girth/bicycle-freeness to vertex expansion, which might be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Clique density vs blowups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A well-known theorem of Nikiforov asserts that any graph with a positive $K_{r}$-density contains a logarithmic blowup of $K_r$. In this paper, we explore variants of Nikiforov's result in the following form. Given $r,t\in\mathbb{N}$, when a positive $K_{r}$-density implies the existence of a significantly larger (with almost linear size) blowup of $K_t$? Our results include:
  For an $n$-vertex ordered graph $G$ with no induced monotone path $P_{6}$, if its complement $\overline{G}$ has positive triangle density, then $\overline{G}$ contains a biclique of size $\Omega(\frac{n}{\log{n}})$. This strengthens a recent result of Pach and Tomon. For general $k$, let $g(k)$ be the minimum $r\in \mathbb{N}$ such that for any $n$-vertex ordered graph $G$ with no induced monotone $P_{2k}$, if $\overline{G}$ has positive $K_r$-density, then $\overline{G}$ contains a biclique of size $\Omega(\frac{n}{\log{n}})$. Using concentration of measure and the isodiametric inequality on high dimensional spheres, we provide constructions showing that, surprisingly, $g(k)$ grows quadratically. On the other hand, we relate the problem of upper bounding $g(k)$ to a certain Ramsey problem and determine $g(k)$ up to a factor of 2.
  Any incomparability graph with positive $K_{r}$-density contains a blowup of $K_r$ of size $\Omega(\frac{n}{\log{n}}).$ This confirms a conjecture of Tomon in a stronger form. In doing so, we obtain a strong regularity type lemma for incomparability graphs with no large blowups of a clique, which is of independent interest.
  We also prove that any $r$-comparability graph with positive $K_{(2h-2)^{r}+1}$-density contains a blowup of $K_h$ of size $\Omega(n)$, where the constant $(2h-2)^{r}+1$ is optimal. The $\frac{n}{\log n}$ size of the blowups in all our results are optimal up to a constant factor.</description>

      <title>On the local convergence of integer-valued Lipschitz functions on regular trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study random integer-valued Lipschitz functions on regular trees. It was shown by Peled, Samotij and Yehudayoff that such functions are localized, however, finer questions about the structure of Gibbs measures remain unanswered. Our main result is that the weak limit of a uniformly chosen 1-Lipschitz function with 0 boundary condition on a $d$-ary tree of height $n$ exists as $n \to \infty$ if $2 \le d \le 7$, but not if $d \ge 8$, thereby partially answering a question posed by Peled, Samotij and Yehudayoff. For large $d$, the value at the root alternates between being almost entirely concentrated on 0 for even $n$ and being roughly uniform on $\{-1,0,1\}$ for odd $n$, leading to different limits as $n$ approaches infinity along evens or odds. For $d \ge 8$, the essence of this phenomenon is preserved, which obstructs the convergence. For $d \le 7$, this phenomenon ceases to exist, and the law of the value at the root loses its connection with the parity of $n$. Along the way, we also obtain an alternative proof of localization. The key idea is a fixed point convergence result for a related operator on $\ell^\infty$, and a procedure to show that the iterations get into a `basin of attraction' of the fixed point. We also prove some accompanying analogous `even-odd phenomenon' type results about $M$-lipschitz functions on general non-amenable graphs with high enough expansion (this includes for example the large $d$ case for regular trees). We also prove a convergence result for 1-Lipschitz functions with $\{0,1\}$ boundary condition. This last result relies on an absolute value FKG for uniform 1-Lipschitz functions when shifted by $1/2$.</description>

      <title>Omega-categorical limits of betweenness relations and $D$-sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore two constructions of oligomorphic Jordan permutation groups preserving a `limit of betweenness relations' and a `limit of $D$-relations', from \cite{bhattmacph2006jordan} and \cite{almazaydeh2021jordan} respectively. Several issues left open in \cite{almazaydeh2021jordan} are resolved. In particular it is shown that the `limit of $D$-relations' is not homogeneous in the given language, but is `homogenizable', that is, there is a homogeneous structure over a finite relational language with the same universe and the same automorphism group. The structure is NIP, but not monadically NIP, its age is not well-quasi-ordered under embeddability, and the growth rate of the sequence enumerating orbits on $k$-sets grows faster than exponentially. The automorphism group is maximal-closed in the symmetric group. Similar results are shown for the construction in \cite{bhattmacph2006jordan}.</description>

Abstract: For each simple Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ of simply-laced type, Hernandez and Leclerc introduced a certain category $\mathcal{C}_{\mathbb{Z}}$ of finite-dimensional representations of the quantum affine algebra of $\mathfrak{g}$, as well as certain subcategories $\mathcal{C}_{\mathbb{Z}}^{\leq \xi}$ depending on a choice of height function adapted to an orientation of the Dynkin graph of $\mathfrak{g}$. In our previous work we constructed an algebra homomorphism $\widetilde{D}_{\xi}$ whose domain contains the image of the Grothendieck ring of $\mathcal{C}_{\mathbb{Z}}^{\leq \xi}$ under the truncated $q$-character morphism $\widetilde{\chi}_q$ corresponding to $\xi$. We exhibited a close relationship between the composition of $\widetilde{D}_{\xi}$ with $\widetilde{\chi}_q$ and the morphism $\overline{D}$ recently introduced by Baumann, Kamnitzer and Knutson in their study of the equivariant homology of Mirkovi\'c-Vilonen cycles. In this paper, we extend $\widetilde{D}_{\xi}$ in order to investigate its composition with Frenkel-Reshetikhin's original $q$-character morphism. Our main result consists in proving that the $q$-characters of all standard modules in $\mathcal{C}_{\mathbb{Z}}$ lie in the kernel of $\widetilde{D}_{\xi}$. This provides a large family of new non-trivial rational identities suggesting possible geometric interpretations.</description>

      <title>Flips in Odd Matchings</title>

Abstract: Let $\mathcal{P}$ be a set of $n=2m+1$ points in the plane in general position. We define the graph $GM_\mathcal{P}$ whose vertex set is the set of all plane matchings on $\mathcal{P}$ with exactly $m$ edges. Two vertices in $GM_\mathcal{P}$ are connected if the two corresponding matchings have $m-1$ edges in common. In this work we show that $GM_\mathcal{P}$ is connected and give an upper bound of $O(n^2)$ on its diameter. Moreover, we present a tight bound of $\Theta(n)$ for the diameter of the flip graph of points in convex position.</description>

      <title>Universality for roots of derivatives of entire functions via finite free probability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06403v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A universality conjecture of Farmer and Rhoades [Trans. Amer. Math. Soc., 357(9):3789--3811, 2005] and Farmer [Adv. Math., 411:Paper No. 108781, 14, 2022] asserts that, under some natural conditions, the roots of an entire function should become perfectly spaced in the limit of repeated differentiation. This conjecture is known as Cosine Universality. We establish this conjecture for a class of even entire functions with only real roots which are real on the real line. Along the way, we establish a number of additional universality results for Jensen polynomials of entire functions, including the Hermite Universality conjecture of Farmer [Adv. Math., 411:Paper No. 108781, 14, 2022]. Our proofs are based on finite free probability theory. We establish finite free probability analogs of the law of large numbers, central limit theorem, and Poisson limit theorem for sequences of deterministic polynomials under repeated differentiation, under optimal moment conditions, which are of independent interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use a double shifted power analog of free fermion fields to introduce current operators, Hamiltonians, and vertex operators which are deformed by two families of parameters and satisfy analogous formulas to the classical case. We show that the deformed half vertex operators correspond to the row transfer matrices of a solvable six vertex model recently given by Naprienko [arXiv:2301.12110], which under a specialization yields the factorial Schur functions (up to a reindexing of parameters). As a consequence, we show that under the boson-fermion correspondence using our deformed half vertex operators, the natural basis (under this specialization) maps to the factorial Schur functions. Furthermore, the image of the natural basis vectors are tau function solutions to the 2D Toda lattice.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Fourier coefficients $c_1(n)$ of the elliptic modular $j$-function are always even for $n \not\equiv 7 \pmod{8}$. In contrast, for $n \equiv 7 \pmod{8}$, it is conjectured that ``half" of the coefficients take odd values. In this article, we first observe in detail when $c_1(8n-1)$ is odd and show that the coefficients share the same parity as the coefficients $c_{\mu_2}(n)$ of the 2nd order mock theta function $\mu_2(q)$. Furthermore, we prove that this phenomenon also holds among several hauptmoduln and between hauptmoduln and even-order mock theta functions.</description>

      <title>On Interactions for Large Scale Interacting Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Statistical mechanics explains the properties of macroscopic phenomena based on the movements of microscopic particles such as atoms and molecules. Movements of microscopic particles can be represented by large-scale interacting systems. In this article, we study a combinatorial object which we call interactions, given as a symmetric directed graph representing the possible transition of states on adjacent sites of large-scale interacting systems. Such interactions underlie various standard processes such as the exclusion processes, generalized exclusion processes, multi-species exclusion processes, lattice-gas processes with energy, and the multi-lane particle processes. We introduce the notion of equivalences of interactions using their space of conserved quantities. This allows for the classification of interactions reflecting corresponding macroscopic properties. In particular, we prove that when the set of local states consists of two, three or four elements, then the number of equivalence classes of separable interactions are respectively one, two and five. We also define the wedge sums and box products of interactions, which give systematic methods for constructing new interactions from existing ones. Furthermore, we prove that the irreducibly quantified condition for interactions, which has implicitly played an important role in the theory of hydrodynamic limits, is preserved by wedge sums and box products. Our results provide a systematic method to construct and classify interactions, offering abundant examples suitable for considering hydrodynamic limits.</description>

      <title>A Random-Walk Concentration Principle for Occupancy Processes on Finite Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper concerns discrete-time occupancy processes on a finite graph. Our results can be formulated in two theorems, which are stated for vertex processes, but also applied to edge process (e.g., dynamic random graphs). The first theorem shows that concentration of local state averages is controlled by a random walk on the graph. The second theorem concerns concentration of polynomials of the vertex states. For dynamic random graphs, this allows to estimate deviations of edge density, triangle density, and more general subgraph densities. Our results only require Lipschitz continuity and hold for both dense and sparse graphs.</description>

Abstract: We characterise twisted right-angled Artin groups that are subgroup separable using only their defining mixed graphs; we deduce that the group is subgroup separable if and only if the underlying simplicial graph of the mixed graph does not contain paths or squares in 4 vertices. Our work generalises the results of Metaftsis - Raptis on classical right-angled Artin groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We unify problems about the equivariant geometry of symmetric quiver representation varieties, in the finite type setting, with the corresponding problems for symmetric varieties $GL(n)/K$ where $K$ is an orthogonal or symplectic group. In particular, we translate results about singularities of orbit closures; combinatorics of orbit closure containment; and torus equivariant cohomology and K-theory between these classes of varieties. We obtain these results by constructing explicit embeddings with nice properties of homogeneous fiber bundles over type $A$ symmetric quiver representation varieties into symmetric varieties.</description>

      <title>On the action of the symmetric group on the free LAnKe II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A LAnKe (also known as a Lie algebra of the $n$th kind, or a Filippov algebra) is a vector space equipped with a skew-symmetric $n$-linear form that satisfies the generalized Jacobi identity. The symmetric group $\mathfrak{S}_m$ acts on the multilinear part of the free LAnKe on $m=(n-1)k+1$ generators, where $k$ is the number of brackets. The corresponding representation was studied by Friedmann, Hanlon, Stanley and Wachs, who asked whether for $n \ge k$, its irreducible decomposition contains no summand whose Young diagram has at most $k-1$ columns. It is known that the answer is affirmative if $k \le 3$. In this paper, we show that the answer is affirmative for all $k$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The normal covering number $\gamma(G)$ of a finite group $G$ is the minimum number of proper subgroups whose conjugates cover the group. We give various estimates for $\gamma(S_n)$ and $\gamma(A_n)$ depending on the arithmetic structure of $n$. In particular we determine the limsups over $\gamma(S_n) / n$ and $\gamma(A_n) / n$ over the sequences of even and odd integers, as well as the liminf of $\gamma(S_n) / n$ over even integers. In general we explain how the values of $\gamma(S_n) / n$ and $\gamma(A_n) / n$ are related to problems in additive combinatorics. These results answer most of the questions posed by Bubboloni, Praeger, and Spiga as Problem 20.17 of the Kourovka Notebook.</description>

      <title>Gaussian to log-normal transition for independent sets in a percolated hypercube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Independent sets in graphs, i.e., subsets of vertices where no two are adjacent, have long been studied, for instance as a model of hard-core gas. The $d$-dimensional hypercube, $\{0,1\}^d$, with the nearest neighbor structure, has been a particularly appealing choice for the base graph, owing in part to its many symmetries. Results go back to the work of Korshunov and Sapozhenko who proved sharp results on the count of such sets as well as structure theorems for random samples drawn uniformly. Of much interest is the behavior of such Gibbs measures in the presence of disorder. In this direction, Kronenberg and Spinka [KS] initiated the study of independent sets in a random subgraph of the hypercube obtained by considering an instance of bond percolation with probability $p$. Relying on tools from statistical mechanics they obtained a detailed understanding of the moments of the partition function, say $\mathcal{Z}$, of the hard-core model on such random graphs and consequently deduced certain fluctuation information, as well as posed a series of interesting questions. In particular, they showed in the uniform case that there is a natural phase transition at $p=2/3$ where $\mathcal{Z}$ transitions from being concentrated for $p&gt;2/3$ to not concentrated at $p=2/3$.
  In this article, developing a probabilistic framework, as well as relying on certain cluster expansion inputs from [KS], we present a detailed picture of both the fluctuations of $\mathcal{Z}$ as well as the geometry of a randomly sampled independent set. In particular, we establish that $\mathcal{Z}$, properly centered and scaled, converges to a standard Gaussian for $p&gt;2/3$, and to a sum of two i.i.d. log-normals at $p=2/3$. A particular step in the proof which could be of independent interest involves a non-uniform birthday problem for which collisions emerge at $p=2/3$.</description>

Abstract: Given a length function on the edge set of a finite graph, we define a vertex-weight and an edge-weight in terms of it and consider the corresponding graph Laplacian. In this paper, we consider the problem of maximizing the first nonzero eigenvalue of this Laplacian over all edge-length functions subject to a certain normalization. For an extremal solution of this problem, we prove that there exists a map from the vertex set to a Euclidean space consisting of first eigenfunctions of the corresponding Laplacian so that the length function can be explicitly expressed in terms of the map and the Euclidean distance. This is a graph-analogue of Nadirashvili's result related to first-eigenvalue maximization problem on a smooth surface. We discuss simple examples and also prove a similar result for a maximizing solution of the G\"oring-Helmberg-Wappler problem.</description>

Abstract: Quasisymmetric functions have recently been used in time series analysis as polynomial features that are invariant under, so-called, dynamic time warping. We extend this notion to data indexed by two parameters and thus provide warping invariants for images. We show that two-parameter quasisymmetric functions are complete in a certain sense, and provide a two-parameter quasi-shuffle identity. A compatible coproduct is based on diagonal concatenation of the input data, leading to a (weak) form of Chen's identity.</description>

Abstract: Let $A\subseteq \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}$ be a finite set with minimum element $0$, maximum element $m$, and $\ell$ elements strictly in between. Write $(hA)^{(t)}$ for the set of integers that can be written in at least $t$ ways as a sum of $h$ elements of $A$. We prove that $(hA)^{(t)}$ is "structured" for
  \[ h \geq (1+o(1)) \frac{1}{e} m\ell t^{1/\ell} \]
  (as $\ell \to \infty$, $t^{1/\ell} \to \infty$), and prove a similar theorem on the size and structure of $A\subseteq \mathbb{Z}^d$ for $h$ sufficiently large. Moreover, we construct a family of sets $A = A(m,\ell,t)\subseteq \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}$ for which $(hA)^{(t)}$ is not structured for $h\ll m\ell t^{1/\ell}$.</description>

In the process we find, for each $i \in \{2,3,4\}$, the excluded minors for the class of $\mathbb{H}_i$-representable matroids having at most 10 elements, and the excluded minors for the class of $\mathbb{H}_5$-representable matroids having at most 13 elements.</description>

Abstract: A graph $G$ contains a strong parity factor $F$ if for every subset $X\subseteq V(G)$ with $|X|$ even, $G$ has a spanning subgraph $F$ satisfying $\delta(F)\geq1$, $d_F(u)\equiv1$ (mod 2) for any $u\in X$, and $d_F(v)\equiv0$ (mod 2) for any $v\in V(G)\setminus X$. In this paper, we give a spectral radius condition to guarantee that a connected graph contains a strong parity factor.</description>

      <title>Threshold numbers of some graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12063v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A graph $G=(V,E)$ is called a \emph{$k$-threshold graph} with \emph{thresholds} $\theta_1&lt;\theta_2&lt;...&lt;\theta_k$ if we can assign a real number $r(v)$ to each vertex $v\in V$, such that for any $u,v\in V$, we have $uv\in E$ if and only if $r(u)+r(v)\ge \theta_i$ holds true for an odd number of elements in $\{\theta_1,\theta_2,...,\theta_k\}$. The smallest integer $k$ such that $G$ is a $k$-threshold graph is called the \emph{threshold number} of $G$. For the complete multipartite graphs and the cluster graphs, Kittipassorn and Sumalroj determined the exact threshold numbers of $K_{n\times 3}$ and $nK_3$. In this paper, first we determine the threshold numbers of some path-related graphs, including linear forests, ladders, and tents. Then, on the basis of Kittipassorn and Sumalroj's results, we determine the exact threshold numbers of $K_{n_1\times 1, n_2\times 2, n_3\times 3}$ and $n_1 K_1\cup n_2 K_2\cup n_3 K_3$, which solve a problem proposed by Sumalroj.</description>

      <title>Connected components and non-bipartiteness of generalized Paley graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00281v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we consider the class of Cayley graphs known as generalized Paley graphs (GP-graphs for short) given by $\Gamma(k,q) = Cay(\mathbb{F}_q, \{x^k : x\in \mathbb{F}_q^* \})$, where $\mathbb{F}_q$ is a finite field with $q$ elements, both in the directed and undirected case. Hence $q=p^m$ with $p$ prime, $m\in \mathbb{N}$ and one can assume that $k\mid q-1$. We first give the connected components of an arbitrary GP-graph. We show that these components are smaller GP-graphs all isomorphic to each other (generalizing a Lim and Praeger's result from 2009 to the directed case). We then characterize those GP-graphs which are disjoint unions of odd cycles. Finally, we show that $\Gamma(k,q)$ is non-bipartite except for the graphs $\Gamma(2^m-1,2^m)$, $m \in \mathbb{N}$, which are isomorphic to $K_2 \sqcup \cdots \sqcup K_2$, the disjoint union of $2^{m-1}$ copies of $K_2$.</description>

      <title>Minimal resolutions of lattice ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.09557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.09557v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A canonical minimal free resolution of an arbitrary co-artinian lattice ideal over the polynomial ring is constructed over any field whose characteristic is 0 or any but finitely many positive primes. The differential has a closed-form combinatorial description as a sum over lattice paths in $\mathbb{Z}^n$ of weights that come from sequences of faces in simplicial complexes indexed by lattice points. Over a field of any characteristic, a non-canonical but simpler resolution is constructed by selecting choices of higher-dimensional analogues of spanning trees along lattice paths. These constructions generalize sylvan resolutions for monomial ideals by lifting them equivariantly to lattice modules.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.01127v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a closed, computable formula for the cellular homology coefficients of real flag manifolds associated with split real forms of type A. We demonstrate the process using movements within the code diagram for permutations. Additionally, we compute the third and fourth homology groups and provide generators for the free part up to the sixth homology group.</description>

      <title>Bidiagonal matrix factorisations associated with symmetric multiple orthogonal polynomials and lattice paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.03561v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The central object of study in this paper are infinite banded Hessenberg matrices admitting factorisations as products of bidiagonal matrices. In the two main results of this paper, we show that these Hessenberg matrices are associated with the decomposition of $(r+1)$-fold symmetric $r$-orthogonal polynomials and are the production matrices of the generating polynomials of $r$-Dyck paths.
  Then, we use these factorisations and the recently found connection of multiple orthogonal polynomials with lattice paths and branched continued fractions to study $(r+1)$-fold symmetric $r$-orthogonal polynomials on a star-like set of the complex plane and their decomposition via multiple orthogonal polynomials on the positive real line. As an example, we give explicit formulas as terminating hypergeometric series for the Appell sequences of $(r+1)$-fold symmetric $r$-orthogonal polynomials on a star-like set and show that the densities of their orthogonality measures can be expressed via Meijer G-functions on the positive real line.</description>

      <title>Griesmer type bounds for additive codes over finite fields, integral and fractional MDS codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08916v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article we prove Griesmer type bounds for additive codes over finite fields. These new bounds give upper bounds on the length of maximum distance separable (MDS) codes, codes which attain the Singleton bound. We will also consider codes to be MDS if they attain the fractional Singleton bound, due to Huffman. We prove that this bound in the fractional case can be obtained by codes whose length surpasses the length of the longest known codes in the integral case. For small parameters, we provide exhaustive computational results for additive MDS codes, by classifying the corresponding (fractional) subspace-arcs. This includes a complete classification of fractional additive MDS codes of size 243 over the field of order 9.</description>

      <title>Error-Correcting Graph Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13867v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct Error-Correcting Graph Codes. An error-correcting graph code of distance $\delta$ is a family $C$ of graphs on a common vertex set of size $n$, such that if we start with any graph in $C$, we would have to modify the neighborhoods of at least $\delta n$ vertices in order to obtain some other graph in $C$. This is a natural graph generalization of the standard Hamming distance error-correcting codes for binary strings. Yohananov and Yaakobi were the first to construct codes in this metric, constructing good codes for $\delta &lt; 1/2$, and optimal codes for a large-alphabet analogue. We extend their work by showing
  1. Combinatorial results determining the optimal rate vs. distance trade-off nonconstructively.
  2. Graph code analogues of Reed-Solomon codes and code concatenation, leading to positive distance codes for all rates and positive rate codes for all distances.
  3. Graph code analogues of dual-BCH codes, yielding large codes with distance $\delta = 1-o(1)$. This gives an explicit ''graph code of Ramsey graphs''.
  Several recent works, starting with the paper of Alon, Gujgiczer, K\"orner, Milojevi\'c, and Simonyi, have studied more general graph codes; where the symmetric difference between any two graphs in the code is required to have some desired property. Error-correcting graph codes are a particularly interesting instantiation of this concept.</description>

      <title>Online Matching and Contention Resolution for Edge Arrivals with Vanishing Probabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14506v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the performance of sequential contention resolution and matching algorithms on random graphs with vanishing edge probabilities. When the edges of the graph are processed in an adversarially-chosen order, we derive a new OCRS that is $0.382$-selectable, attaining the "independence benchmark" from the literature under the vanishing edge probabilities assumption. Complementary to this positive result, we show that no OCRS can be more than $0.390$-selectable, significantly improving upon the upper bound of $0.428$ from the literature. We also derive negative results that are specialized to bipartite graphs or subfamilies of OCRS's. Meanwhile, when the edges of the graph are processed in a uniformly random order, we show that the simple greedy contention resolution scheme which accepts all active and feasible edges is $1/2$-selectable. This result is tight due to a known upper bound. Finally, when the algorithm can choose the processing order, we show that a slight tweak to the random order -- give each vertex a random priority and process edges in lexicographic order -- results in a strictly better contention resolution scheme that is $1-\ln(2-1/e)\approx0.510$-selectable. Our positive results also apply to online matching on $1$-uniform random graphs with vanishing (non-identical) edge probabilities, extending and unifying some results from the random graphs literature.</description>

      <title>A Deceptively Simple Quadratic Recurrence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03510v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Standard techniques for treating linear recurrences no longer apply for quadratic recurrences. It is not hard to determine asymptotics for a specific parametrized model over a wide domain of values (all $p \neq 1/2$ here). The gap between theory and experimentation seems insurmountable, however, at a single outlier ($p = 1/2$).</description>
