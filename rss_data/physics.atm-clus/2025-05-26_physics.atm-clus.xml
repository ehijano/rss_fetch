      <title>Triple differential cross-section for Laser-assisted (e,2e) process on $H_2O$ molecule by Plane and Twisted electrons Impact</title>

Abstract: Twisted electron-impact single ionization ((e,2e) process) of water molecule is theoretically studied in the presence of an external laser field. Calculations have been performed in the framework of the first Born approximation in coplanar asymmetric geometry. The wave functions for the fast (incident/scattered) electron and the ejected electron are described by the Volkov and Coulomb Volkov wave functions respectively which take into account the interaction of the laser field with incident/scattered and ejected electrons respectively. We calculate the triple differential cross section (TDCS) corresponding to the laser-assisted (e,2e) process for different orientations of the linearly polarised laser field. We describe the molecular state of $H_{2}O$ by the linear combination of atomic orbitals (self-consistent field LCAO method). The angular profile of the TDCS for plane wave electrons is strongly modified by the laser field compared to that of without laser field. However, for the twisted electrons with laser field the angular distribution is slightly changed from those of without laser field. We study the angular distribution of TDCS for laser field polarization parallel to the incident momentum ($\varepsilon_0$ $\parallel$ $k_i$), parallel to momentum transfer ($\varepsilon_0$ $\parallel$ $\Delta$) and perpendicular to the momentum transfer ($\varepsilon_0$ $\perp$ $\Delta$) and we observe that the $\varepsilon_0$ $\parallel$ $\Delta$ has the highest magnitude of TDCS. For the orientations $\varepsilon_0$ $\parallel$ $k_i$ and $\varepsilon_0$ $\perp$ $\Delta$, the laser-assisted plane wave studies shows oscillatory nature of TDCS but for the orientation $\varepsilon_0$ $\parallel$ $\Delta$ we observe only recoil peak for $p-like$ character orbitals and dual peak, a recoil and binary peaks for the $s-like$ character orbital.</description>

      <title>Double Microwave Shielding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08095v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop double microwave shielding, which has recently enabled evaporative cooling to the first Bose-Einstein condensate of polar molecules [Bigagli et al., Nature 631, 289 (2024)]. Two microwave fields of different frequency and polarization are employed to effectively shield polar molecules from inelastic collisions and three-body recombination. Here, we describe in detail the theory of double microwave shielding. We demonstrate that double microwave shielding effectively suppresses two- and three-body losses. Simultaneously, dipolar interactions and the scattering length can be flexibly tuned, enabling comprehensive control over interactions in ultracold gases of polar molecules. We show that this approach works universally for a wide range of molecules. This opens the door to studying many-body physics with strongly interacting dipolar quantum matter.</description>
