      <title>Why Are Verdazyl Radicals Non-Emissive? An Experimental and Computational Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Verdazyl radicals are a versatile class of air-stable organic radicals used in various applications, especially for their magnetic properties. Despite the development of a wide range of verdazyl derivatives, however, they are all non-emissive. To investigate the reasons behind this and to understand the excited-state dynamics of verdazyls, we combine steady-state and femtosecond pump-probe spectroscopy with quantum chemical calculations. In the carbazole-substituted 2,4,6-triphenylverdazyl (TPV-Cz) , we observe ultrafast internal conversion of the first excited state on a timescale of 0.5 $\pm$ 0.1 ps, followed by vibrational relaxation with a lifetime of 3.7 $\pm$ 0.4 ps. Spin-flip time-dependent density functional theory calculations reveal that the sub-picosecond non-radiative decay comes from a low-energy conical intersection between the D1 and D0 states, driven by an out-of-plane distortion of the verdazyl ring. This distortion is observed and remains energetically accessible in the isolated verdazyl ring in 2,4,6-triphenylverdazyl and in TPV-Cz. This shows that the conical intersection geometry is a recurring feature across different types of verdazyl derivatives and explains why all verdazyls are non-emissive despite different functionalization. Our results provide a mechanistic understanding of the photophysical properties of verdazyl radicals and offers a pathway for the future design of emissive verdazyl derivatives.</description>

      <title>Implementation of Girsanov Reweighting in CP2K</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamical reweighting of path measures is a powerful approach for accurately evaluating slow molecular processes using modified potential energy surfaces used in enhanced sampling methods. Integrating this reweighting framework into the CP2K electronic-structure and molecular-dynamics (MD) software package delivers a robust and widely applicable tool for metadynamics, uncertainty quantification, and force-field optimisation based on both \textit{ab initio} and classical MD simulations. Based on the Girsanov theorem for stochastic dynamical systems, the method is adapted to the Bussi-Donadio-Parrinello velocity-rescaling scheme. This scheme is accessible through the CSVR thermostat and can be interpreted as a Langevin OVRVO/OBABO update scheme requiring two random numbers per integration step. Comprehensive implementation details are provided, including a complete overview of the modified CP2K modules involved in the MD cycle and the computation of reweighting factors. The framework supports multiple sources of bias potentials, enabling reweighting via the PLUMED interface or CP2K-native external potentials and restraints. The feasibility of the implementation is demonstrated through rerun benchmarks, dynamical reweighting of Markov state models (MSMs) and computation of transport properties based on CP2K trajectories, showing excellent agreement with reference simulations.</description>

      <title>Stray Field NMR: a powerful method to measure dynamics at the millisecond scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transport properties in fluids and confined systems play a central role across a wide range of natural and technological contexts, from geology and environmental sciences to biology, energy storage, and membrane-based separation processes. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) provides a unique, non-destructive means to probe these properties through species-selective measurements of self-diffusion coefficients. While pulsed field gradient NMR (PFG-NMR) is routinely used, its access to diffusion times is typically limited to values no shorter than about 10 ms, restricting its applicability to systems with fast dynamics and long relaxation times. Diffusion NMR in a permanent magnetic field gradient (STRAFI) offers a complementary, multiscale approach, enabling diffusion measurements over an extended temporal window, from a few hundred microseconds to several tens of seconds. Despite its strong potential, this technique remains rarely implemented due to experimental and methodological challenges. In this work, we present a robust and versatile STRAFI-based methodology, including a specifically designed experimental setup, optimized pulse sequences, and rigorous data analysis, allowing accurate extraction of self-diffusion coefficients for a broad range of nuclei. The capabilities of the approach are illustrated through diverse applications, including the study of concentrated electrolytes using "NMR-exotic" nuclei ($^{35}$Cl, $^{79}$Br/$^{81}$Br, $^{127}$I, $^{17}$O) and the characterization of micrometre-scale porosity in membranes.</description>

      <title>Characterization of Strongly Hyperfine-split Protons by DNP</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.05824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic nuclear polarization experiments use microwave irradiation to transfer the larger electron polarization to nuclear spins of interest, and thus enhance the NMR transitions above thermal equilibrium. How the polarization transfer from the electron spin to the nuclear spins in such experiments proceeds and which nuclear spins close to an unpaired electron get polarized and contribute through spin diffusion to the observable bulk nuclear magnetization is not fully understood. We address these questions by combining reverse DNP and band-selective inversion pulses on nuclear spins. We report the electron-detected NMR spectrum of proton spins involved in the direct DNP process in Ox063 trityl samples with protonated and deuterated solvents and variable radical concentrations. We also determine the spin-diffusion barrier surrounding trityl and find that proton spin diffusion is quenched for hyperfine coulings exceding ~250 kHz. This corresponds to a radius of the spin diffusion barrier in the range from 5.4 to 6.8 {\AA}. Burning a hole into the NMR spectrum of proton spins involved in the direct DNP step reveals an electron-electron spin diffusion process imprinted on the proton spectrum. We explain this diffusion process using a three-spin system consisting of two electron spins and one proton and quantify the electron spin diffusion rate constant.</description>

      <title>A Non Linear Spectral Graph Neural Network Simulator for More Stable and Accurate Rollouts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are a central tool in science and engineering enabling the study of dynamical behavior and the link between microscopic structure and macroscopic function. Their high computational cost, however, has motivated extensive efforts to develop accelerated alternatives. A promising approach is the use of machine-learning-based simulators that allow for substantially larger time steps than conventional MD. Among these, graph neural network (GNN)-based methods have been found to be especially attractive given that they naturally encode the inductive bias of interacting particle systems, however current architectures remain limited in accuracy and stability. In particular, standard message-passing schemes struggle to efficiently propagate long-range information. Here, we investigate whether spectral-GNN simulators can overcome these limitations by explicitly representing a simulated system in a global eigenmode basis, and therefore better capture long-range and collective behavior. Focusing on disordered elastic networks, model systems for complex materials and biological structures such as proteins, we compare spatial, linear spectral, and nonlinear spectral GNN architectures. We find that while spectral representations alone are not sufficient, nonlinear spectral models substantially outperform alternatives. By learning both the time-dependent dynamics and the mixing of eigenmodes, these models more accurately capture the system's slow, global modes, which dominate macroscopic behavior. This leads to a marked reduction in systematic particle-position error and significantly improved prediction of global physical properties.</description>

      <title>Rotational Coherence Dominates Early-Time Dynamics and Produces Long-Time Revivals in the S2 State of Azulene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ultrafast dynamics of azulene have been debated for decades, with reported picosecond decay constants variously attributed to intramolecular vibrational redistribution (IVR), internal conversion, or rotational dephasing. Using polarization and femtosecond time-resolved Resonance Enhanced Multi-photon Ionization Spectroscopy with a nanosecond delay window, we disentangle this long-standing inconsistency and show that the early 2-5 ps decay component arises entirely from rotational dephasing of an excited-state wavepacket. Identical time constants extracted from the decay of the parallel signal and rise of the perpendicular signal across multiple vibronic origins provide an unambiguous rotational anisotropy signature, eliminating the need for IVR-based interpretations. Extending the measurement window to 1.3 ns reveals well-structured J-type and C-type rotational coherence revivals in S2 azulene on top of the well-documented fluorescence decay, demonstrating that both the short- and long-time dynamics contain information about the coherent rotational dynamics. These results show that azulene, and by extension polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), can sustain structured rotational coherence deep into the nanosecond regime, positioning PAHs as model systems for quantum-coherent wavepacket dynamics and providing a framework for probing coherence, decoherence, and rotational control in electronically rich molecular systems.</description>

      <title>Knowledge Distillation of a Protein Language Model Yields a Foundational Implicit Solvent Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Implicit solvent models (ISMs) promise to deliver the accuracy of explicit solvent simulations at a fraction of the computational cost. However, despite decades of development, their accuracy has remained insufficient for many critical applications, particularly for simulating protein folding and the behavior of intrinsically disordered proteins. Developing a transferable, data-driven ISM that overcomes the limitations of traditional analytical formulas remains a central challenge in computational chemistry. Here we address this challenge by introducing a novel strategy that distills the evolutionary information learned by a protein language model, ESM3, into a computationally efficient graph neural network (GNN). We show that this GNN potential, trained on effective energies from ESM3, is robust enough to drive stable, long-timescale molecular dynamics simulations. When combined with a standard electrostatics term, our hybrid model accurately reproduces protein folding free-energy landscapes and predicts the structural ensembles of intrinsically disordered proteins. This approach yields a single, unified model that is transferable across both folded and disordered protein states, resolving a long-standing limitation of conventional ISMs. By successfully distilling evolutionary knowledge into a physical potential, our work delivers a foundational implicit solvent model poised to accelerate the development of predictive, large-scale simulation tools.</description>

      <title>Molecular signatures of pressure-induced phase transitions in a lipid bilayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how lipid bilayers respond to pressure is essential for interpreting the coupling between membrane proteins and their native environments. Here, we use all-atom molecular dynamics to examine the pressure-temperature behavior of model membranes composed of DMPC or $\Delta$9-cis-PC. Within the studied range (288-308 K, 1-2000 bar), DMPC undergoes a liquid--gel transition, while $\Delta$9-cis-PC remains fluid due to unsaturation. The CHARMM36 force field reproduces experimental boundaries with high fidelity: simulated DMPC transitions deviate by only 5-10 K and 100-300 bar, and $\Delta$9-cis-PC exhibits no transition. Hysteresis is modest but most pronounced when starting from low-temperature gels. We identify area per lipid, bilayer thickness, and acyl-chain gauche fraction as sensitive phase markers; among these, the gauche fraction provides the most robust signature. Simulations indicate an interdigitated gel is the equilibrium structure under finite-size conditions. However, at low temperature and high pressure, interdigitation decreases, consistent with the experimental lamellar gel phase. This long-lived interdigitation critically impacts standard order parameters, specifically area per lipid and membrane thickness. These results underscore the accuracy of modern force fields and highlight how simulations mechanistically complement experimental studies of pressure-regulated membranes.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneous ice nucleation on model substrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ice nucleation is greatly important in areas as diverse as climate change, cryobiology, geology or food industry. Predicting the ability of a substrate to induce the nucleation of ice from supercooled water is a difficult problem. Here, we use molecular simulations to analyse how the ice nucleating ability is affected by the substrate lattice structure and orientation. We focus on different model lattices: simple cubic, body centred cubic and face centred cubic, and assess their ability to induce ice nucleation by calculating nucleation rates. Several orientations are studied for the case of the face centred cubic lattice. Curiously, a hexagonal symmetry does not guarantee a better ice nucleating ability. By comparing the body centred cubic and the cubic lattices we determined that there is a significant role of the underlying crystal plane(s) on ice nucleation. The structure of the liquid layer adjacent to the substrate reveals that more efficient nucleants induce a more structured liquid. The most efficient substrates present a strong sensitivity of their ice nucleating ability to the lattice parameters. Introducing a novel methodological approach, we use Classical Nucleation Theory to estimate the contact angle of the ice nucleus on the studied substrates from the calculated nucleation rates. The method also provides the nucleation free energy barrier height, the kinetic pre-factor and the critical cluster size. The latter is in agreement with the nucleus size obtained through a microscopic analysis of the nucleation trajectories, which supports the validity of Classical Nucleation Theory down to small critical clusters.</description>

      <title>Topological origin of peak splitting in the structure factor of liquid water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The splitting of the principal peak in the structure factor of liquid water is commonly interpreted as evidence of a competition between two distinct local environments. Here, we show that this peak splitting arises from medium-range topological features of the hydrogen-bond network. Using atomistic simulations, we systematically decompose the structure factor into contributions from hydrogen-bonded rings of different sizes. We find that 5-8-membered rings, which dominate the network topology of liquid water at low temperatures, can directly explain the experimentally observed bimodal scattering signal. Among these, 5-membered rings are particularly persistent, maintaining distinct structural signatures even above room temperature. Our findings establish a direct link between the network topology of liquid water and experimentally accessible diffraction features, clarifying the microscopic basis of water's behaviour and suggesting a broader conceptual framework for interpreting the anomalies in tetrahedral network liquids and glasses.</description>

      <title>Computing solvation free energies of small molecules with experimental accuracy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18171v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Free energies play a central role in characterising the behaviour of chemical systems and are among the most important quantities that can be calculated by molecular dynamics simulations. Solvation free energies in various organic solvents, in particular, are well-studied physicochemical properties of drug-like molecules and are commonly used to assess and optimise the accuracy of nonbonded parameters in empirical forcefields, and also as a fast-to-compute surrogate of performance for protein-ligand binding free energy estimation. Machine learned potentials (MLPs) show great promise as more accurate alternatives to empirical forcefields, but are not readily decomposed into physically motivated functional forms, which has thus far rendered them incompatible with standard alchemical free energy methods that manipulate individual pairwise interaction terms. However, since the accuracy of free energy calculations is highly sensitive to the forcefield, this is a key area in which MLPs have the potential to address the shortcomings of empirical forcefields. In this work, we introduce an efficient alchemical free energy protocol that enables calculations of rigorous free energy differences in condensed phase systems modelled entirely by MLPs. Using a pretrained, transferrable, alchemically equipped MLP model, we demonstrate sub-chemical accuracy for the solvation free energies of a wide range of organic molecules.</description>

      <title>Isomer- and state-dependent ion-molecule reactions between Coulomb-crystallised Ca$^+$ ions and 1,2-dichloroethene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08791v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report a systematic investigation of isomer- and state-dependent reactions between Coulomb-crystallised laser-cooled Ca$^+$ ions and \emph{cis/trans}-1,2-dichloroethene (DCE) isomers. By manipulating the electronic state populations of Ca$^+$ through tuning of laser cooling parameters, we observed distinct reactivities in its ground and excited states, as well as with the geometric isomers of DCE. Our experiments revealed two primary reaction channels, formation of CaCl$^+$ and C$_2$HCaCl$^+$, followed by secondary reaction pathways. While excited-state reactions proceed at rate coefficients consistent with capture theory predictions, ground-state reactions show a systematically lower reactivity. \emph{Ab initio} calculations of reaction pathways suggest that this suppression stems from the formation of long-lived reaction complexes. The \textit{cis} isomer was found to exhibit a higher reactivity with all electronic states of Ca$^+$ than its \textit{trans} counterpart. The present study provides insights into the combined effects of molecular structure and quantum states influencing ion-molecule reaction dynamics.</description>

      <title>Diverse polymorphism in Ruddlesden-Popper chalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11300v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) chalcogenides are stable, non-toxic candidates for optoelectronic or thermoelectric applications. The structural diversity of RP oxides is already exploited to tune properties or achieve more advanced functionalities like multiferroicity, however, little is known about the structural evolution of RP chalcogenides. In this work, we develop a high-accuracy machine-learned interatomic potential to run large-scale molecular dynamics simulations on $Ba_{n+1}Zr_nS_{3n+1}$ for $n=1$ to $n=6$. We predict new polymorphs for each $n$-value, calculate their corresponding phase transition temperatures, and validate our approach through comparison to published experimental results. We find that the $n=1$ phase exhibits negative thermal expansion, that $n=1$ and $n=3$ undergo unusual ascending symmetry breaking, and that phases with $n\geq4$ form layer-dependent tilt patterns previously unreported for inorganic RP materials. This unique behaviour results from competition between octahedral rotations and rumpling at the rocksalt interface, and suggests new strategies for accessing advanced functionalities.</description>
