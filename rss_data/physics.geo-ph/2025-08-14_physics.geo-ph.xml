      <title>Risk-based framework to determine climate-informed design storms for road drainage infrastructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Climate change is amplifying extreme precipitation events in many regions and imposes substantial challenges for the resilience of road drainage infrastructure. Conventional design storm methodologies, which rely on historical trends of rainfall data under a stationarity assumption, may not adequately account for future climate variability. This study introduces a risk-based framework for determining climate-informed design storms tailored to road drainage systems. The proposed framework integrates climate model projections with risk assessment to quantify the potential impacts of future extreme rainfall on drainage performance and adjust the future design storm, with a focus on the province of Ontario, Canada. Projected precipitation changes for mid- and late-century time horizons are quantified using statistically downscaled CMIP6 General Circulation Models. The risk level is defined as a function of hazard and vulnerability, where hazard combines both physiographic and meteorological factors. Vulnerability is comprised of socioeconomic, transportation, and environmental considerations. To systematically integrate these components, a weighting scheme is developed based on a sensitivity analysis of the criteria, which provides flexibility in assigning relative importance to each factor. The estimated risk level is then applied to adjust the projected design storm accordingly. The proposed workflow is demonstrated through both province-wide and site-specific applications across Ontario's road network to better highlight its scalability and adaptability. The findings signify the necessity of shifting from static, stationarity-based design methodologies to dynamic, risk-informed approaches that enhance the long-term resilience of transportation networks.</description>

      <title>A comparative study of data- and image- domain LSRTM under velocity-impedance parametrization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Least-squares reverse time migration (LSRTM) is one of the classic seismic imaging methods to reconstruct model perturbations within a known reference medium. It can be computed in either data or image domain using different methods by solving a linear inverse problem, whereas a careful comparison analysis of them is lacking in the literature. In this article, we present a comparative study for multiparameter LSRTM in data- and image- domain in the framework of SMIwiz open software. Different from conventional LSRTM for recovering only velocity perturbation with variable density, we focus on simultaneous reconstruction of velocity and impedance perturbations after logorithmic scaling, using the first-order velocity-pressure formulation of acoustic wave equation. The first 3D data-domain LSRTM example has been performed to validate our implementation, involving expensive repetition of Born modelling and migration over a number of iterations. As a more cost-effective alternative, the image-domain LSRTM is implemented using point spread function (PSF) and nonstationary deblurring filter. Dramatic disctinctions between data and image domain methods are discovered with 2D Marmousi test: (1) The data-domain multiparameter inversion provides much better reconstruction of reflectivity images than image-domain approaches, thanks to the complete use of Hessian in Krylov space; (2) The poor multiparameter image-domain inversion highlights the limitation of incomplete Hessian sampling and strong parameter crosstalks, making it difficult to work in practice; (3) In contrast, monoparameter image-domain inversion for seismic impedance is found to work well.</description>

      <title>Ice-free geomorphometry of Queen Maud Land, East Antarctica: 1. S\^oya Coast</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Geomorphometric modeling and mapping of ice-free Antarctic areas is promising for obtaining new quantitative knowledge about the topography of these unique landscapes and for the further use of morphometric information in Antarctic research. Within the framework of a project of creating a physical geographical thematic scientific reference geomorphometric atlas of ice-free terrains of Antarctica, we performed geomorphometric modeling and mapping of key ice-free areas of the S\^oya Coast (the east coast of the L\"utzow-Holm Bay, Queen Maud Land, East Antarctica). These include the Flatvaer Islands, Langhovde Hills, Breidv\r{a}gnipa, Skarvsnes Foreland, Skallen Hills, and Skallevikhalsen Hills. As input data for geomorphometric modeling and mapping, we used five fragments of the Reference Elevation Model of Antarctica. For the six ice-free areas and adjacent glaciers, we derived models and maps of eleven most scientifically important morphometric variables (i.e., slope, aspect, horizontal curvature, vertical curvature, minimal curvature, maximal curvature, catchment area, topographic wetness index, stream power index, total insolation, and wind exposition index). The obtained models and maps describe the ice-free topography of the S\^oya Coast in a rigorous, quantitative, and reproducible manner. New morphometric data can be useful for further geological, geomorphological, glaciological, ecological, and hydrological studies of this region.</description>

      <title>OpenSWI: A Massive-Scale Benchmark Dataset for Surface Wave Dispersion Curve Inversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surface wave dispersion curve inversion plays a critical role in both shallow resource exploration and deep geological studies, yet it remains hindered by sensitivity to initial models and low computational efficiency. Recently, data-driven deep learning methods, inspired by advances in computer vision, have shown promising potential to address these challenges. However, the lack of large-scale, diverse benchmark datasets remains a major obstacle to their development and evaluation. To bridge this gap, we present OpenSWI, a comprehensive benchmark dataset generated through the Surface Wave Inversion Dataset Preparation (SWIDP) pipeline. OpenSWI includes two synthetic datasets tailored to different research scales and scenarios, OpenSWI-shallow and OpenSWI-deep, and an AI-ready real-world dataset for generalization evaluation, OpenSWI-real. OpenSWI-shallow, derived from the 2-D OpenFWI geological model dataset, contains over 22 million 1-D velocity profiles paired with fundamental-mode phase and group velocity dispersion curves, spanning a wide range of shallow geological structures (e.g., flat layers, faults, folds, realistic stratigraphy). OpenSWI-deep, built from 14 global and regional 3-D geological models, comprises 1.26 million high-fidelity 1-D velocity-dispersion pairs for deep-Earth studies. OpenSWI-real, compiled from open-source projects, contains two sets of observed dispersion curves with corresponding reference models, serving as a benchmark for evaluating model generalization. To demonstrate utility, we trained models on OpenSWI-shallow and -deep and evaluated them on OpenSWI-real, demonstrating strong agreement between predictions and references, which confirms the diversity and representativeness of the dataset. To advance intelligent surface wave inversion, we release the SWIDP toolbox, OpenSWI datasets, and trained models for the research community.</description>

      <title>Ocean-E2E: Hybrid Physics-Based and Data-Driven Global Forecasting of Extreme Marine Heatwaves with End-to-End Neural Assimilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22071v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work focuses on the end-to-end forecast of global extreme marine heatwaves (MHWs), which are unusually warm sea surface temperature events with profound impacts on marine ecosystems. Accurate prediction of extreme MHWs has significant scientific and financial worth. However, existing methods still have certain limitations in forecasting general patterns and extreme events. In this study, to address these issues, based on the physical nature of MHWs, we created a novel hybrid data-driven and numerical MHWs forecast framework Ocean-E2E, which is capable of 40-day accurate MHW forecasting with end-to-end data assimilation. Our framework significantly improves the forecast ability of MHWs by explicitly modeling the effect of oceanic mesoscale advection and air-sea interaction based on a dynamic kernel. Furthermore, Ocean-E2E is capable of end-to-end MHWs forecast and regional high-resolution prediction, allowing our framework to operate completely independently of numerical models while outperforming the current state-of-the-art ocean numerical/AI forecasting-assimilation models. Experimental results show that the proposed framework performs excellently on global-to-regional scales and short-to-long-term forecasts, especially in those most extreme MHWs. Overall, our model provides a framework for forecasting and understanding MHWs and other climate extremes. Our codes are available at https://github.com/ChiyodaMomo01/Ocean-E2E.</description>

      <title>On the Efficacy of Ocean Formation with a Primordial Hydrogen Atmosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10417v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has been suggested that Earth's present water budget formed from oxidation reactions between its initial hydrogen-rich primordial atmosphere and its magma ocean. Here we examine this hypothesis by building a comprehensive atmosphere-magma ocean model. We find that water formation is unlikely for two reasons. First, any water formed from oxidation reactions in the magma ocean would quickly outgass because of the water-poor atmosphere above. Second, the top boundary layer of the magma ocean becomes stable against convection because the oxidation reactions produce metallic iron, which sinks to the core of a growing Earth. This iron loss makes the top boundary layer significantly more buoyant than the rest of the magma, thus becoming stable against mixing. Our results suggest that hydrogen dissolution is unlikely to play a major role in the formation of Earth's oceans.</description>
