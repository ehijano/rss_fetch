      <title>Global existence and uniqueness of weak solutions for the MHD equations with large $L^3$-initial values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the weak solution theory for the MHD system with large $L^3$-initial data. Due to the fact that the natural boundary condition on the magnetic field $H$ is the slip boundary condition, the Leray-Schauder fixed-point theorem, which have used to investigate the weak solution theory of the Navier-Stokes system, becomes invalid. To address such difficulty, we will invoke the Leray's approximation technique and the perturbation theory to seek a global weak solution to the Cauchy problem for MHD equations with large $L^3$-initial data. Our strategy provides a simple alternative (self-contained) proof of weak $L^3$-solution theory of incompressible Navier-Stokes system. Moreover, this weak solution is unique under some restrictions.</description>

      <title>Semiclassical localization of Schr\"odinger's eigenfunctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article addresses the microlocalization of eigenfunctions for the semiclassical Schr\"odinger operator $-h^2\Delta+V$ on closed Riemann surfaces with real bounded potentials. Our primary aim is to establish quantitative bounds on the spatial concentration of these eigenfunctions, extending classical results, typically restricted to smooth potentials, to the more general case where the potential is merely bounded. Our main result provides an explicit exponential bound for the $L^2$-norm of eigenfunctions on the entire surface in terms of their $L^2$-norm on an arbitrary open subset with an exponential weight of $Ch^{-1}\log(h)^2$. This bound improves upon previous estimates for non-smooth potentials that was an exponential weight of $Ch^{-4/3}$. Our proof is based on a recent approach of the Landis conjecture develop by Logunov, Malinnikova, Nadirashvili and Nazarov (2025).</description>

      <title>Pointwise Hadamard variational formula for the fractional Laplacian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish pointwise formulas for the shape derivative of solutions to the Dirichlet problem associated with the fractional Laplacian. Specifically, we consider the equation $(-\Delta)^s u = h$ in $\Omega$ and $u=0$ in $\Omega^c$, where the right-hand side $h$ is either a Dirac delta distribution or a Lipschitz function. In both cases, we prove that the corresponding solution is shape differentiable in every direction and we derive a formula for the pointwise value of its shape derivative. These formulas involve integral on the domain's boundary and fractional Neumann's traces. This extends to the case of the fractional Laplacian the well-known Hadamard variational formula for the standard Laplacian. Our argument is in the spirit of \cite{Ushikoshi, Kozono-Ushikoshi} and is based on PDEs techniques.</description>

      <title>A Brezis and Peletier type result for the fractional Robin function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the Laplacian operator of fractional order $s\in (0,1)$ in several dimensions. We consider the equation $(-\Delta)^su=f(x,u)$ in $\Omega$, $u=0$ in $\Omega^c$ and establish a representation formula for partial derivatives of solutions in terms of the normal derivative $u/\delta^s$. As a consequence, we prove that solutions to the overdetermined problem $(-\Delta)^su=f(x,u)$ in $\Omega$, $u=0$ in $\Omega^c$, and $u/\delta^s=0$ on $\partial\Omega$ are globally Lipschitz continuous provided that $2s&gt;1$. We also prove a Pohozaev-type identity for the Green function and, in particular, obtain a formula for the gradient of the Robin function, which extends to the fractional setting some results obtained by Br\'ezis and Peletier in \cite{Bresiz} in the classical case of the Laplacian. Finally, an application to the nondegeneracy of critical points of the fractional Robin function in symmetric domains is discussed.</description>

      <title>Non-homogeneous boundary value problems for second-order degenerate hyperbolic equations and their application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study second-order hyperbolic equations with degenerate elliptic operators and non-homogeneous Dirichlet boundary inputs. We establish existence and regularity of weak solutions in weighted Sobolev spaces under mild assumptions on the degenerate weight. A Dirichlet map is constructed for the degenerate elliptic operator, leading to a solution theory that extends classical approaches to the degenerate setting. In particular, we derive energy estimates and well-posedness for boundary inputs of low regularity (in appropriate trace spaces), even though the classical Dirichlet-to-Neumann framework is not directly applicable in the degenerate setting. As an application, we prove an approximate controllability criterion, which generalizes the Hilbert Uniqueness Method to degenerate wave equations. Our framework accommodates higher-dimensional degenerate waves, non-homogeneous boundary conditions, and weighted functional analysis. We also illustrate how our criterion connects to higher-dimensional Grushin equations and waves with single-point degeneracy, and we highlight the remaining unique continuation/observability issue as an open problem.</description>

      <title>On two-dimensional steady compactly supported Euler flows with constant vorticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we mainly construct local solution curves for the two-dimensional steady compactly supported incompressible Euler equations with free boundaries and constant vorticity. Our work is distinguished from most existing studies on two-dimensional steady water waves by its focus on perturbations near annular flows, rather than laminar flows. More precisely, we consider three classes of steady Euler flows with compact support, corresponding to partially overdetermined, two-phase overdetermined, and overdetermined elliptic problems. The primary contribution of our work is threefold. For each class, we first establish the flexibility result (i.e., the existence of nontrivial admissible domains) via shape derivatives and local bifurcation theory. Second, we give and discuss the corresponding rigidity result respectively. Third, we apply the implicit function theorem to demonstrate the stability of standard annular flows under perturbations of the Neumann boundary condition. Our results also offer novel insights into the theory of elliptic overdetermined problems.</description>

      <title>A priori estimates for general elliptic and parabolic boundary value problems over irregular domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the realization of a myriad of general local and nonlocal inhomogeneous elliptic and parabolic boundary value problems over classes of irregular regions. We present a unified approach in which either local or nonlocal Neumann, Robin, and Wentzell boundary value problems are treated simultaneously. We establish solvability and global regularity results for both the stationary and time-dependent heat equations governed by general differential operators with unbounded measurable coefficients and various boundary conditions at once, first on a general framework, and then by presenting concrete important examples of irregular domains, Wentzell-type boundary conditions, and nonlocal maps. As a consequence, we develop a priori estimates for multiple differential equations under various situations, which are tied to a large number of applications performed over real world regions, such heat transfer, electrical conductivity, stable-like processes (probability theory), diffusion of medical sprays in the bronchial trees, and oceanography (among many others).</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the generalized solution of Fractional Singular Burgers equation driving by $\vert D\vert^{\frac{1}{2}}\xi$. We establish a framework to describe the equations satisfied by generalized solutions, termed the Generalized Fractional Singular Burgers equation(GFSB), and prove its local well-posedness. Finally, we prove that the solution of GFSB can be the generalized solution of Fractional Singular Burgers equation for $\gamma&gt;\frac{3}{2}$.</description>

      <title>Normalized Standing Waves for the Focusing Inhomogeneous Schr\"odinger Equation with Spatially Growing Nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the focusing inhomogeneous nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation $$ i\partial_t u + \Delta u = -|x|^b |u|^{p-1}u ,\quad (t,x)\in (0,\infty)\times\mathbb{R}^N, $$ with $b&gt;0$ and $p&gt;1$. Due to the spatial growth of the nonlinearity, standard compactness arguments do not apply and new difficulties arise.
  We first characterize ground state standing waves via a variational approach on the Nehari manifold and we establish some sharp stability and instability properties. In the $L^2$-subcritical regime, we prove the existence of normalized ground states by solving a constrained energy minimization problem in the radial energy space, and we show that the resulting set of minimizers is orbitally stable under the flow. In contrast, in the $L^2$-critical and supercritical regimes, ground state standing waves are shown to be strongly unstable by finite-time blow-up.
  Our results extend classical stability and instability theory for nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations to the case of spatially growing inhomogeneous nonlinearities.</description>

      <title>The Dirichlet problem as the boundary of the Poisson problem: A sharp approximation result</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On a bounded domain $\Omega\subset\mathbb R^{n+1}$, $n\geq2$, satisfying the corkscrew condition and with Ahlfors regular boundary, we characterize the dual space to the space ${\bf N}_{2,p}$ of functions $u$ whose Kenig-Pipher modified non-tangential maximal operator $\mathcal N_2(u)$ lies in $L^p(\partial\Omega)$, $p\in(1,\infty)$. We find that \[ ({\bf N}_{2,p})^*={\bf C}_{2,p'}\oplus L^{p'}(\partial\Omega),\qquad\text{and that}\qquad L^{p'}(\partial\Omega)=\partial^{\operatorname{weak}-*}{\bf C}_{2,p'}\,/\,{\bf C}_{2,p'}, \] where ${\bf C}_{2,p'}$ is a certain $L^{p'}$-Carleson space and $p'$ is the H\"older conjugate of $p$. This answers a question considered by Hyt\"onen and Ros\'en.
  Inspired by this result and the recently understood characterizations of the $L^p$-solvability of the Dirichlet problem in terms of the Poisson problem by Mourgoglou, Poggi, and Tolsa, we show a novel approximation result: for an arbitrary elliptic operator $L=-\operatorname{div} A\nabla$ with a not necessarily symmetric matrix $A$ of real bounded measurable coefficients, the solution space to the Dirichlet problem with data in $L^p(\partial\Omega)$ \[
  \left\{\begin{aligned}-\operatorname{div} A\nabla u&amp;=0,\quad&amp;\text{in }&amp;\Omega,\\u&amp;=g,\quad&amp;\text{on }&amp;\partial\Omega,\end{aligned}\right. \]
  lies on the weak-$*$ boundary in ${\bf N}_{2,p}$ of the solution space to the Poisson problem \[ \left\{\begin{aligned}-\operatorname{div} A\nabla w&amp;=-\operatorname{div} F,\qquad&amp;\text{in }&amp;\Omega,\\ w&amp;=0,\qquad&amp;\text{on }&amp;\partial\Omega,\end{aligned}\right. \] with $F\in{\bf C}_{2,p}$, provided that the Dirichlet problem for $L$ with data in $L^p(\partial\Omega)$ is solvable in $\Omega$. This approximation result is sharp and new even for the Laplacian and on the unit ball.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.07582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the Hierarchical null controllability of a coupled degenerate semilinear parabolic equation in domains which are moving in time. We show the local null controllability of the semilinear system using Liusternik's inverse function theorem. Nevertheless, the main difficulty is to adapt a Carleman estimate for the controllability of the linearized otimality system, using a Carleman inequality for degenerate non-autonomous equation obtanied by the authors previously.</description>

      <title>Integral Harnack estimates and the rate of extinction of singular fractional diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove several integral Harnack-type inequalities for local weak solutions of parabolic equations with measurable and bounded coefficients, describing singular s-fractional p-Laplacian diffusion. Then we apply the aforementioned estimates to evaluate the decay rate of the local mass and supremum of the solutions as they approach a possible extinction time. Yet we show consistency of our general decay estimates by studying the extinction phenomenon for weak solutions of the Cauchy-Dirichlet problem, by means of an approximation procedure that carefully avoids the use of an integrable time derivative.</description>

      <title>Finding the convex envelope of a boundary datum using random geometric graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.07696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we approximate the convex envelope of a boundary datum inside a bounded domain in the Euclidean space. We work with a random graph that is obtained as random points with uniform distribution that are connected by proximity ($x\sim y$ when $|x-y|&lt;r$). On the graph we solve an equation (that approximate the first eigenvalue of the Hessian of a smooth function) with an exterior datum. Under appropriate assumptions on $r$ we show that the unique solution to the equation in the graph converges to the convex envelope of the boundary datum as the number of points goes to infinity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.07807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the linear stability of a class of monotone shear flows. When the associated Rayleigh operator possesses a neutral embedded eigenvalue, we show that solutions of the linearized system may exhibit arbitrarily large growth in both the $L^\infty$ and $L^2$ norms. Moreover, when the embedded eigenvalue is multiple, we prove that the instability becomes stronger and explicitly construct solutions that grow linearly in time. This instability originates from the non-normality of the Rayleigh operator.</description>

Abstract: This paper shows that, in the formal level, the convergence of solutions of Boltzmann equation to solutions of the compressible Navier-Stokes system with small Mach number over the three-dimensional periodic domain $\mathbb{T}^3$,
  using the relative entropy method originated from Bardos, Golse, Levermore [{\em Comm. Pure Appl. Math.} {\bf 46} (1993) 667--753] and Yau [{\em Lett. Math. Phys.} {\bf 22} (1991) 63--80]. We discuss the evolution of the entropy which is relative to the local Maxwellian governed by the solution of slightly compressible Navier-Stokes system. This characterizes the convergence rate from Boltzmann equation to the incompressible Navier-Stokes system.</description>

We first prove $L^p$-stability estimates for advection-diffusion PDEs when $\mathrm{div}(b)\in L^r_t(L^q_x)$ with $r\in[2,\infty]$ and $q\in[n/2,\infty)$ satisfying the compatibility condition $n/(2q)+1/r\leq 1$. We then prove a stability result in $L^\infty$ for solutions of viscous transport equations when $\mathrm{div}(b(t))$ fails to be integrable in time. We apply these properties to obtain new continuous dependence estimates for viscous Hamilton-Jacobi equations via integral methods. One of the main novelties in this latter setting is that the constants of the estimates are all explicit with respect to the data of the problem. These imply new uniqueness properties for diffusive Hamilton-Jacobi equations without relying on the theory of viscosity solutions.</description>

      <title>Observability properties of the singular Grushin equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the observability properties of the Grushin equation with an inverse square potential, whose singularity occurs at the boundary of two-dimensional rectangular domains or in the interior of the domain in higher dimensions. In some specific configurations of the observation set, we obtain the exact minimal time of observability. The analysis we present relies on recent Carleman estimates obtained by K. Beauchard, J. Dard\'e, and S. Ervedoza. As a byproduct of these results, we observe, for the heat equation associated to the Laplace-Beltrami operator on almost-Riemannian manifolds, a dependence of the minimal time of observability on the dimension of the singularity.</description>

      <title>Enhanced lifespan bounds for 1D quasilinear Klein-Gordon flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we consider one-dimensional scalar quasilinear Klein--Gordon equations with general nonlinearities, on both $\mathbb{R}$ and $\mathbb{T}$. By employing a refined modified-energy framework of Ifrim and Tataru, we investigate long time lifespan bounds for small data solutions. Our main result asserts that solutions with small initial data of size $\epsilon$ persist on the improved cubic timescale $|t| \lesssim \epsilon^{-2}$ and satisfy sharp cubic energy estimates throughout this interval. We also establish difference bounds on the same time scale. In the case of $\mathbb{R}$, we are further able to use dispersion in order to extend the lifespan to $\epsilon^{-4}$. This generalizes earlier results obtained by Delort in the semilinear case.</description>

Abstract: The work is devoted to establishing the global well-posedness in $W^{(1,2),2}(R\times R^{+})$ of the integro-differential problem involving the two nonlocal terms describing the diffusion and the production in the biological system in the presence of the transport term. Such model is relevant to the cell population dynamics in the Mathematical Biology. The proof is based on a fixed point technique.</description>

      <title>A bifurcation theory approach to the nonlocal Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the nonlocal Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation on the one-dimensional torus,
  \[
  u_t+u u_x=\Lambda^{r}u-\varepsilon \Lambda^{s}u,\qquad x\in\mathbb T,
  \] where $\varepsilon&gt;0$, $s&gt;1$, $r\in[-1,s)$. We first prove local and global well-posedness for initial data in $H^{3}(\mathbb T)$. We then investigate the steady-state problem and show that the trivial branch undergoes bifurcation at the critical values $\varepsilon_k=k^{\,r-s}$, $k\in\mathbb N$. Using the Crandall-Rabinowitz theorem we obtain smooth local curves of nontrivial equilibria emanating from each $(\varepsilon_k,0)$ and compute the bifurcation direction. To address the global continuation of these branches we derive global a priori bounds and apply a global alternative based on the Fitzpatrick-Pejsachowicz-Rabier degree for Fredholm maps of index zero. In particular, for the component bifurcating from the first critical point we prove that its $\varepsilon$-projection contains the interval $(2^{r-s},1)$, yielding the existence of nontrivial steady states for that parameter range. We complement the theory with numerical continuation results illustrating the bifurcation diagram and solution profiles.</description>

      <title>Stability of $L^p$ Dirichlet solvability under small bi-Lipschitz transformations of domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that small bi-Lipschitz deformations of a Lipschitz domain (with possibly large Lipschitz constant) preserve the solvability of the Dirichlet problem for the Laplacian with boundary data in $L^p$, for the same value of $p&gt;1$. As a consequence, for all $p\in(1,\infty)$, we obtain the solvability of the $L^p$ Dirichlet problem for small Lipschitz perturbations of convex domains, thereby unifying two fundamentally different settings in which such results were previously known: convex and $C^1$ domains. The key ingredient and novelty of our approach is a construction of a change of variables based on a non-constant basis derived from the Green function, which encodes the geometry of the base domain.</description>

      <title>Remainder terms and sharp quantitative stability for a nonlocal Sobolev inequality on the Heisenberg group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the following nonlocal Sobolev inequality on the Heisenberg group \begin{equation}\label{eq:HLS}
  S_{HL}(Q,\mu) \left(\int_{\mathbb{H}^{n}}\int_{\mathbb{H}^{n}}\frac{|u(\xi)|^{Q^{\ast}_{\mu}}|u(\eta)|^{Q^{\ast}_{\mu}}}{|\eta^{-1}\xi|^{\mu}}{d}\xi{d}\eta\right)^{\frac{1}{Q^{\ast}_{\mu}}}\leq \int_{\mathbb{H}^{n}}|\nabla_{\mathbb{H}}u|^{2}d\xi,\quad \forall \, u\in S^{1,2}(\mathbb{H}^{n}), \end{equation} where $Q=2n+2$ is the homogeneous dimension of the Heisenberg group $\mathbb{H}^{n}$, $n\geq1$, $\mu\in(0,Q)$, $Q^{\ast}_{\mu}=\frac{2Q-\mu}{Q-2}$ is the upper critical exponent in the sense of the Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev inequality and the Folland-Stein-Sobolev inequality on the Heisenberg group, $S_{HL}(Q,\mu)$ is the sharp constant of \eqref{eq:HLS}, and $S^{1,2}(\mathbb{H}^{n})$ is the Folland-Stein-Sobolev space. %of the nonlocal-Sobolev inequality. It is well-known that, up to a translation and suitable scaling, \begin{equation}\label{eq:abs}
  -\Delta_{\mathbb{H}} u=\left(\int_{\mathbb{H}^{n}}\frac{|u(\eta)| ^{Q^{\ast}_{\mu}}}{|\eta^{-1}\xi|^{\mu}}{d}\eta\right)|u|^{Q_\mu^*-2}u,~~u\in S^{1,2}(\mathbb{H}^{n}) \end{equation} is the Euler-Lagrange equation corresponding to the associated minimization problem.
  On the one hand, we show the existence of a gradient-type remainder term for inequality \eqref{eq:HLS} when $Q\geq4$, $\mu\in (0,4]$, and as a corollary, derive the existence of a remainder term in the weak $L^{\frac{Q}{Q-2}}$-norm on bounded domains. On the other hand, we establish the quantitative stability of critical points for equation \eqref{eq:abs} in the multi-bubble case when $Q=4$ and $\mu\in (2,4)$.</description>

      <title>$C^{1,\alpha}$-regularity for Mixed Local and Nonlocal Degenerate Elliptic Equations in the Heisenberg Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The regularity theory for equations combining both local and nonlocal operators in sub-Riemannian geometries is a huge challenge. In this paper, we investigate the $C^{1,\alpha}$-regularity of weak solutions to mixed local and nonlocal degenerate elliptic equations on the Heisenberg group. We first derive a sophisticated iteration scheme of Morrey-type by leveraging horizontal difference quotient combined with the Nirenberg difference quotient and fractional Sobolev-type inequality on the Heisenberg group. Then, the H\"{o}lder continuity of the weak solutions is established by applying the local boundedness, the iteration scheme of Morrey-type, an iterative method and the Morrey inequality. Finally, we use the H\"{o}lder continuity in conjunction with Theorem 1.2 from Mukherjee and Zhong[18] to prove the $C^{1,\alpha}$-regularity of weak solutions.</description>

      <title>Wave propagation in the frequency regime in one-dimensional quasiperiodic media -Limiting absorption principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the one-dimensional Helmholtz equation with (possibly perturbed) quasiperiodic coefficients. Quasiperiodic functions are the restriction of higher dimensional periodic functions along a certain (irrational) direction. In classical settings, for real-valued frequencies, this equation is generally not well-posed: existence of solutions in L 2 is not guaranteed and uniqueness in L $\infty$ may fail. This is a well-known difficulty of Helmholtz equations, but it has never been addressed in the quasiperiodic case. We tackle this issue by using the limiting absorption principle, which consists in adding some imaginary part (also called absorption) to the frequency in order to make the equation well-posed in L 2 , and then defining the physically relevant solution by making the absorption tend to zero. In previous work, we introduced a definition of the solution of the equation with absorption based on Dirichlet-to-Neumann (DtN) boundary conditions. This approach offers two key advantages: it facilitates the limiting process and has a direct numerical counterpart. In this work, we first explain why the DtN boundary conditions have to be replaced by Robin-to-Robin boundary conditions to make the absorption go to zero. We then prove, under technical assumptions on the frequency, that the limiting absorption principle holds and we propose a numerical method to compute the physical solution.</description>

      <title>Construction of two-bubble solutions for the energy-critical Hartree equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a pure two-bubble solution for the focusing, energy-critical Hartree equation in space dimension $N \geq 7$. The constructed solution is spherically symmetric, global in (at least) the negative time direction and asymptotically behaves as a superposition of two ground states (or bubbles) both centered at the origin, with the ratio of their length scales converging to $0$ and the phases of the two bubbles form the right angle. The main arguments are the modulation analysis, the bootstrap argument and the topological argument. The main novelty with respect to existing constructions of pure two-bubble solutions is the nonlocal interaction, which is more complex to analyze.</description>

      <title>Influence of the Reynolds number on non-Newtonian flow in thin porous media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the effect of the Reynolds number on the flow of a generalized Newtonian fluid through a thin porous medium in $\mathbb{R}^3$. This medium is a domain of thickness $\varepsilon \ll 1$, perforated by periodically distributed solid cylinders of size $\varepsilon$. We consider the nonlinear stationary Navier-Stokes system with viscosity following the Carreau law. Using tools from homogenization theory and assuming that the Reynolds number scales as $\varepsilon^{-\gamma}$, where $\gamma$ is a real constant, we prove the existence of a critical Reynolds number of order $1/\varepsilon$, in the sense that the inertial term in the Navier-Stokes system has no influence in the limit if the Reynolds number is of order smaller than or equal to $1/\varepsilon$ (i.e. $\gamma = 1$). In this case, we derive linear or nonlinear Darcy laws connecting velocity to pressure gradient. Conversely, we expect a contribution from the inertial term in the homogenized problem if the Reynolds number is greater than $1/\varepsilon$. Finally, we propose a numerical method to solve nonlinear Darcy laws describing effective flow in the critical case and demonstrate its practical applicability on several examples.</description>

Abstract: We consider the inverse problem of determining a compact Riemannian manifold with boundary from fixed time observations of the solution, restricted to a small subset in space, for the Navier-Stokes system with a local source on the manifold. Our approach is based on a reduction to an inverse problem for an auxiliary hyperbolic Stokes system, via linearization and spectral techniques. We solve the resulting inverse problem by a new generalization of the Boundary Control method.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we study the initial value problem associated with an abstract integrodifferential equation in interpolation scales. We prove local-in-time existence, uniqueness, continuation, and a blow-up alternative for regular mild solutions to the problem. Additionally, we apply this theory to the Navier-Stokes equations with hereditary viscosity, taking initial data in the scale of fractional power spaces associated with the Stokes operator. We also explore reaction-diffusion problems with memory, considering the effects of super-linear and gradient-type nonlinearities, and initial data in Lebesgue and Besov spaces, respectively.</description>

      <title>Derivation and analysis of a Stokes-transport system in evolving vessels modeling thermoregulation in human skin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a Stokes flow coupled with advective-diffusive transport in an evolving domain with boundary conditions allowing for inflow and outflow. The evolution of the domain is induced by the transport process, leading to a fully coupled problem. Our aim is to model the thermal control of blood flow in human skin. To this end, the model takes into account the temperature-dependent production of biochemical substances, the subsequent dilation and constriction of blood vessels, and the resulting changes in convective heat transfer. We prove existence and uniqueness of weak solutions using a fixed point method that allows us to treat the nonlinear coupling.</description>

      <title>Rigidity of homogeneous Lam\'e systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this short paper, we show that any Lam\'e system whose Dirichlet-to-Neumann map for the elastic wave equation agrees with the one arising from the homogeneous Lam\'e system must actually be homogeneous. We do not need to impose any assumptions for the Lam\'e coefficients that we aim to recover. We use the fact that the homogeneous system gives rise to a geometry that is both simple and admits a strictly convex foliation.</description>

      <title>Global well-posedness for one-dimensional compressible Navier--Stokes system in dynamic combustion with small $BV\cap L^1$ initial data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the global well-posedness theory of small BV weak solutions to a one-dimensional compressible Navier--Stokes model for reacting gas mixtures in dynamic combustion. The unknowns of the PDE system consist of the specific volume, velocity, temperature, and mass fraction of the reactant. For initial data that are small perturbations around the constant equilibrium state $(1, 0, 1, 0)$ in the $L^1(\mathbb{R}) \cap {\rm BV}(\mathbb{R})$-norm, we establish the local-in-time existence of weak solutions via an iterative scheme, show the stability and uniqueness of local weak solutions, and prove the global-in-time existence of solutions for initial data with small BV-norm via an analysis of the Green's function of the linearised system. The large-time behaviour of the global BV weak solutions is also characterised. This work is motivated by and extends the recent global well-posedness theory for BV weak solutions to the one-dimensional isentropic Navier--Stokes and Navier--Stokes--Fourier systems developed in [T.-P. Liu, S.-H. Yu, Commun. Pure Appl. Math. 75 (2022), 223--348] and [H. Wang, S.-H. Yu, X. Zhang, Arch. Ration. Mech. Anal. 245 (2022), 375--477].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.08932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show the existence of non-trivial self-expanding harmonic map flows starting from non-energy-minimizing 0-homogeneous maps to a regular ball or a closed hemisphere. In particular, given a non-minimizing but stationary 0-homogeneous harmonic map $u_0$ to a closed hemisphere, we construct infinitely many different weak solutions to harmonic map flow starting from $u_0$, all of which satisfy the parabolic monotonicity formula. This answers a question of Struwe.</description>

Abstract: We prove local $W^{1,q}$-regularity for weak solutions to fractional $p$-Laplacian type equations with right-hand side $f\in L^r_{\mathrm{loc}}(\Omega)$. Assuming $p&gt;1$, $s\in(0,1)$, and $sp'&gt;1$, solutions belong to $W^{1,q}_{\mathrm{loc}}(\Omega)$ for the optimal exponent $q=q(n,p,s,r)$. We obtain quantitative local gradient estimates involving nonlocal tail terms. The optimality of $q$ is confirmed by a counterexample.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.07224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we review and analyze both the theoretical and numerical aspects of strongly and weakly coupled thermoelastic systems. By employing spectral analysis techniques and establishing uniform resolvent estimates, we derive uniform polynomial decay rates for the associated semigroups under a suitable class of boundary conditions. Particular attention is paid to the role of modal approximations in energy analysis. The theoretical results are complemented by numerical experiments that illustrate how the regularity of initial data, smooth versus nonsmooth, affects the observed decay rates, providing deeper insight into the interplay between spectral structure and energy dissipation.</description>

      <title>Real Bers embedding on the line: Fisher-Rao linearization, Schwarzian curvature, and scattering coordinates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a real-analytic counterpart of the Bers embedding for the Fr\'echet Lie group $\Diff^{-\infty}(\R)$ of decay-controlled diffeomorphisms of the line, and establish its connection to $L^p$ Fisher-Rao geometry on densities. For $p\in[1,\infty)$, the $p$-root map $\varphi\mapsto p(\varphi'^{1/p}-1)$ isometrically linearizes the homogeneous $\dot W^{1,p}$ Finsler metric on $\Diff^{-\infty}(\R)$, yielding explicit geodesics and a canonical flat connection whose Eulerian geodesic equation is the generalized Hunter-Saxton equation; for $p=\infty$, logarithmic coordinates $\varphi\mapsto\log\varphi'$ provide a global isometry and the Schwarzian derivative emerges as the projective curvature. We construct a real Bers map $\beta^{-\infty}\colon\Diff^{-\infty}(\R)/\Aff(\R)\to W^{\infty,1}(\R)$ via this Schwarzian, prove it is a Fr\'echet-smooth injective immersion whose linearization admits a tame right inverse given by an explicit Volterra operator, and characterize its image through Sturm-Liouville spectral theory. We introduce an $L^p$-Schwarzian family $S_p$ that interpolates between affine and projective cocycles, establish full asymptotic expansions as $p\to\infty$ in Fr\'echet and Orlicz-Sobolev scales, and extend the Bers embedding to Orlicz diffeomorphism groups. Through the Jacobian correspondence, these structures transfer to a manifold of densities asymptotic to Lebesgue measure, where the nonlinear Eulerian transport reduces to a pointwise Riccati law and the Schwarzian becomes the score curvature governing Fisher information. The compact-manifold $L^p$ Fisher-Rao linearization of Bauer, Bruveris, Harms, and Michor is recalled as a guiding framework.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we establish a lower bound, in terms of the isoperimetric deficit, for the first eigenvalue of the Robin Laplacian with negative boundary parameter on horospherically convex bounded domains in hyperbolic space, which implies that the geodesic ball maximizes this eigenvalue among all such domains. Furthermore, we derive upper bounds for the first eigenvalue of the Robin Laplacian with positive boundary parameter on horospherically convex bounded domains in hyperbolic space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.07843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $(M,g)$ be a compact connected two-dimensional Riemannian manifold without boundary. In this note, we answer a question posed by Steinerberger: can one remove the $\sqrt{\log n}$ factor in the two-dimensional Green--Wasserstein inequality while keeping the unrenormalized off-diagonal Green term? We show that this is impossible on any compact connected surface: there is no inequality of the same form that holds uniformly over point sets with an $O(n^{-1/2})$ remainder for all $n$. We argue by contradiction and combine a second-moment estimate for the random Green energy of i.i.d. samples with the semi-discrete random matching asymptotics of Ambrosio--Glaudo.</description>

Abstract: Wang, Weng and Xia[Math.

In the present paper, we study a fractional mean curvature flow for $C^{1,1}$-regular hypersurfaces with a capillary-type boundary condition and obtain the short time existence by the fixed point argument.</description>

      <title>On the Existence of Steady States for Blended Gas Flow with Non-Constant Compressibility Factor on Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.08481v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study hydrogen-natural gas mixtures transported through pipeline networks. The flow is modeled by the isothermal Euler equations with a pressure law involving a non-constant, composition-dependent compressibility factor. For a broad class of such compressibility models, we prove the existence of steady-state solutions on networks containing compressor stations. The analysis is based on an implicit representation of the pressure profiles and a continuity argument that overcomes the discontinuous dependence of the gas composition on the flow direction. Numerical examples illustrate the influence of different compressibility models on the resulting states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.08606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by applications in conditional sampling, given a probability measure $\mu$ and a diffeomorphism $\phi$, we consider the problem of simultaneously approximating $\phi$ and the pushforward $\phi_{\#}\mu$ by means of the flow of a continuity equation whose velocity field is a perceptron neural network with piecewise constant weights. We provide an explicit construction based on a polar-like decomposition of the Lagrange interpolant of $\phi$. The latter involves a compressible component, given by the gradient of a particular convex function, which can be realized exactly, and an incompressible component, which -- after approximating via permutations -- can be implemented through shear flows intrinsic to the continuity equation. For more regular maps $\phi$ -- such as the Kn\"othe-Rosenblatt rearrangement -- we provide an alternative, probabilistic construction inspired by the Maurey empirical method, in which the number of discontinuities in the weights doesn't scale inversely with the ambient dimension.</description>

Abstract: We study a slow-fast system of coupled two- and three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations in which the fast component is perturbed by an additive fractional Brownian noise with Hurst parameter $H&gt;\frac{1}{3}$. The system is analyzed using rough path theory, and the limiting behaviour strongly depends on the value of $H$. We prove convergence in law of the slow component to a Navier-Stokes system with an additional It\^o-Stokes drift when $H&lt;\frac{1}{2}$. In contrast, for $H\in (\frac{1}{2},1)$, the limit equation features only a transport noise driven by a rough path.</description>

Abstract: We investigate in the present paper the maximization problem for the L1 norm of the unique positive solution of an heterogeneous Fisher-KPP equation with respect to the growth rate. It is already known that the BV norms of maximizers of this functional blow up when the diffusivity tends to zero. Here, we first show that the maximizers are always BV. Next, we completely characterize the limit of the maximas of this functional as the diffusivity tends to zero, and we show that one can construct a quasi-maximizer which is periodic, in a sense, and with a BV norm behaving like the inverse of the square root of the diffusivity. Lastly, we prove that along a subsequence of diffusivities, any maximizer is periodic, in a sense.</description>

      <title>The Sommerfeld-Rellich Framework for Scattering on Hyperbolic Space: Far-Field Patterns and Inverse Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.16416v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper establishes a complete time-harmonic scattering theory for hyperbolic space, formulating it within the classical Sommerfeld-Rellich paradigm centered on far-field patterns--a foundational framework that has been absent despite the well-developed spectral and time-dependent theories for this geometry. We explicitly construct the ingoing and outgoing fundamental solutions for the Helmholtz operator and perform a precise asymptotic analysis at the conformal boundary to derive a {hyperbolic Sommerfeld radiation condition}. This condition, which is a local criterion at infinity, uniquely selects physically admissible outgoing solutions. We prove a f{hyperbolic Rellich theorem} guaranteeing the uniqueness of the scattered field and its far-field pattern from asymptotic data. Within this rigorous framework, we solve the direct scattering problem for compact sources, penetrable media, and impenetrable obstacles, providing explicit representations for the corresponding {far-field patterns}. As a principal application and demonstration of the framework's utility, we initiate the study of inverse scattering on hyperbolic space, formulating both the inverse obstacle and inverse medium problems where the objective is to reconstruct the scatterer from measurements of its far-field pattern. Our work provides the essential theoretical underpinning for a far-field-based approach to scattering and inversion in hyperbolic geometry and lays the groundwork for extensions to asymptotically hyperbolic manifolds.</description>

Abstract: We use the well-posedness of transmission problems on classes of two-sided Sobolev extension domains to give variational definitions for (boundary) layer potential operators and Neumann-Poincar{\'e} operators. These classes of domains contain Lipschitz domains, and also domains with fractal boundaries. Although our variational formulation does not involve any measures on the boundary, we recover the classical results in smooth domains by considering the surface measure on the boundary. We discuss properties of these operators and generalize basic results in imaging beyond the Lipschitz case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07240v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study critical semilinear nonlocal elliptic equations involving the logarithmic Schr\"odinger operator and its fractional pseudo-relativistic counterpart, both arising in quantum models with nonlocal and relativistic effects. We first establish the existence, uniqueness, and regularity of weak solutions to equations involving the logarithmic operator \((I - \Delta)^{\ln}\) with subcritical logarithmic nonlinearities. We then investigate a Brezis--Nirenberg-type problem involving the fractional pseudo-relativistic Schr\"odinger operator \((I - \Delta)^s\), and prove the existence of least-energy solutions under both subcritical and critical nonlinearities. In particular, we show that these least-energy solutions converge, up to a subsequence, to a nontrivial least-energy solution of the limiting problem as \(s \to 0^+\). Our approach relies on variational methods, including the geometry of the Nehari manifold, uniform positive lower bounds, mountain-pass structure, the Palais--Smale condition, and delicate asymptotic analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08473v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the longstanding inverse problem of simultaneously recovering both causal sources and medium parameters in evolutionary PDEs from a single passive boundary observation. We develop a mathematical framework focusing on second-order hyperbolic systems, where the measurement consists of the Cauchy pair of the wave field restricted to an open subset of the boundary over all positive time. Under a structural invariance condition on the source-to-speed ratio, we prove that the initial source \(f\) and wave speed \(c\) of the wave equation are uniquely determined by such boundary data. The proof combines intricate integral identities, Fourier and harmonic analysis, and subtle high-frequency asymptotics, avoiding artificial decoupling assumptions and accommodating physically realistic scenarios.
  As key extensions, we demonstrate the recovery of multiple unknowns in more general hyperbolic systems and establish analogous unique determination results for parabolic and Schr\"odinger-type equations, showcasing the versatility of the methodology. These results resolve a major open problem in coupled-physics imaging and provide a rigorous mathematical foundation for similar inverse problems arising in more sophisticated evolutionary settings.</description>

      <title>Existence of self-similar solutions for the surface diffusion flow with nonlinear boundary conditions in the half space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19391v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Mullins' problem that was proposed by Mullins in 1957 and is one of the models of the thermal grooving by surface diffusion. Mathematically, this is the problem of evolving curves in the half space that is governed by the surface diffusion flow with the contact angle condition and the no-flux condition on the boundary. The no-flux condition is represented as the equation that the first order derivative of the curvature with respect to the arc-length parameter is equal to zero, so that it is the nonlinear boundary condition. For this original Mullins' problem, we show the existence and the uniqueness of the self-similar solution. The self-similar solution is obtained as the mild solution under the smallness assumption on the contact angle.</description>

Abstract: We deal with weighted Hardy-Sobolev type inequalities for functions on $\mathbb{R}^d$, $d\geq 2$. The weights involved are anisotropic, given by products of powers of the distance to the origin and to a nontrivial subspace. We establish necessary and sufficient conditions for validity of these inequalities, and investigate the existence/nonexistence of extremal functions.</description>

      <title>Boundary behaviour of potential-type integrals for the multi-term time-fractional diffusion equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15356v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the boundary behaviour of potential-type integrals for the multi-term time-fractional diffusion equation (MTFDE) across the moving boundary. First, we establish the jump relation for the integral operator associated with the fundamental solution of the inhomogeneous MTFDE. Second, we prove the continuity of the integral operator generated by the kernel corresponding to the homogeneous MTFDE. Krasnoschok obtained similar results for the time-fractional diffusion equation. However, in the multi-term case, the fundamental solution has more complex structure and does not admit standard scaling properties, which requires a different approach. Our results are essential for the analysis of boundary integral equations related to the MTFDE in time-dependent domains.</description>

Abstract: We study the local behavior of the elements of a specific energy class of functions, called the nonlocal parabolic ($p$-homogenous) De Giorgi class. First we carry on an analysis of their local boundedness under optimal tail conditions, and then prove several weak Harnack inequalities, measure theoretical propagation lemmas, and a parabolic Harnack inequality. We show a full proof of the local H\"{o}lder continuity, eventually establishing a Liouville-type rigidity property. Finally, as an application of our method, we prove a state-of-the-art nonlocal Harnack inequality for nonnegative solutions of the nonlocal Trudinger equation.</description>

      <title>On the spectral stability of periodic capillary-gravity waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17534v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the spectral stability of periodic traveling waves in the two dimensional gravity-capillary water wave problem. We derive a stability criterion based on an index function, whose sign determines the spectral stability of the waves. This result aligns with earlier formal analyses by Djordjevi\'c \&amp; Redekopp [15] and Ablowitz \&amp; Segur [1], which employed the nonlinear Schr\"odinger approximation in the modulational regime. In particular, we show that instability is excluded near spectral crossings away from the origin when the surface tension is positive and the inverse square of the Froude number $\alpha\in(0,1),$ which results from the fact that the corresponding Krein signatures are identical. It is also shown that there exists $\alpha_1 = (23 - 3\sqrt{41})/8$ and a curve $\beta: (\alpha_1, 1]\rightarrow \mathbb{R}_{+},$ such that for any $\alpha \in (\alpha_1, 1]$, small amplitude periodic waves are spectrally stable when $\beta &gt; \beta(\alpha)$. These findings highlight the stabilizing effect of surface tension on periodic capillary-gravity waves.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study a nonlocal extension of the Aw-Rascle-Zhang traffic model, where the pressure-like term is modeled as a convolution between vehicle density and a kernel function. This formulation captures nonlocal driver interactions and aligns structurally with the Euler-alignment system studied in [23]. Using a sticky particle approximation, we construct entropy solutions to the equation for the cumulative density and prove convergence of approximate solutions to weak solutions of the nonlocal system. The analysis includes well-posedness, stability estimates, and an entropic selection principle.</description>

      <title>Mixed local-nonlocal equations with critical nonlinearity on $\mathbb{R}^N$: Non-existence, Existence, and Multiplicity of positive solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15507v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the following quasilinear critical problem involving the mixed local-nonlocal operator: \begin{equation}\label{main_prob_abstract_1}\tag{$\mathcal{P}_p$}
  -\Delta_p u+(-\Delta_p)^s u=|u|^{p^*-2}u+f(x)\text{ in }\mathbb{R}^N, \end{equation} where $s \in (0,1), p \in (1, \infty), N&gt;p$, $p^*=\frac{Np}{N-p}$, and $f$ is a nonnegative functional in the dual space of the ambient solution space. If $f \equiv0$, then we show that \eqref{main_prob_abstract_1} does not admit any nontrivial weak solution in $L^p(\mathbb{R}^N)$. This phenomenon stands in contrast to the purely local and purely nonlocal cases. On the other hand, if $f$ is a nontrivial nonnegative functional, we establish the existence of a positive weak solution to \eqref{main_prob_abstract_1} provided $\|f\|$ is small. For this purpose we prove the concentration compactness principle for the mixed operator $-\Delta_p +(-\Delta_p)^s$ in $\mathbb{R}^N$. We also discuss the multiplicity of positive weak solutions to \eqref{main_prob_abstract_1}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19733v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the microlocal properties of the evolutions of Schr\"odinger equations using metaplectic Wigner distributions. So far, only restricted classes of metaplectic Wigner distributions, satisfying particular structural properties, have allowed the analysis of microlocal properties. We first extend the microlocal results to all metaplectic Wigner distributions, including the well-known Kohn-Nirenberg quantization, and examine these findings in the framework of Fourier integral operators with quadratic phase. Finally, we analyze the phase space concentration of the (cross) Wigner distribution arising from the interaction of two states, with particular attention to interactions generated by certain Schr\"odinger evolutions. These contributions enable a more refined study of the so-called ghost frequencies.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the well-posedness of Fractional Rough Burgers equation driven by space-time noise in $H^s(\m T)$ space. For the higher dissipation $\gamma\in(\frac{4}{3},2]$, we establish local well-posedness. Global well-posedness is further obtained when $\gamma$ is restricted to the interval $(\frac{3}{2}, 2]$. For the lower dissipation $\gamma\in(\frac{5}{4},\frac{4}{3}]$, we use the regularity analysis derivation the para-controlled solution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.12612v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate linear parabolic equations in divergence form with singular coefficients and non-smooth boundary data. When the diffusion, drift, or potential terms, as well as the initial or boundary conditions, are distributions rather than functions, classical and weak solution concepts become inadequate due to the ill-posedness of products involving distributions. To overcome this, we introduce a framework of very weak solutions based on regularization techniques and the theory of moderate nets. Existence of very weak solutions is established under minimal regularity assumptions. We further prove consistency with classical solutions when the data are smooth and demonstrate uniqueness via negligibility arguments. Finally, we present numerical computations that illustrate the robustness of the very weak solution framework in handling highly singular inputs, including delta-type potentials and distributional boundary traces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07771v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work investigates the initial value problem (IVP) for the two-parameter family of dispersive wave equations known as the Majda-McLaughlin-Tabak (MMT) model, which arises in the weak turbulence theory of random waves. The MMT model can be viewed as a derivative nonlinear Schr\"odinger (dNLS) equation where both the nonlinearity and dispersion involve nonlocal fractional derivatives. The purpose of this study is twofold: first, to establish a sharp well-posedness theory for the MMT model; and second, to identify the critical threshold for the derivative in the nonlinearity relative to the dispersive order required to ensure well-posedness. As a by-product, we establish sharp well-posedness for non-local fractional dNLS equations; notably, our results resolve the regularity endpoint left open in https://www.aimsciences.org/article/doi/10.3934/dcdsb.2022039 .</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.14779v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The integrated theory of the probe and singular sources methods (IPS) is developed for an inverse obstacle problem governed by the stationary Schr\"odinger equation in a bounded domain. The unknown obstacles are penetrable, and their surface is modeled by a part of the support of the potential in the governing equation. The main results concern an analytical detection method for these obstacles from the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map. They consist of three parts: a singular sources method via the probe method using a solution with higher-order singularity for the governing equation of the background medium; the discovery of an IPS function whose two ways of decomposition give us the indicator functions for both the probe and singular sources methods; a completely integrated version of both methods, which means their indicator functions coincide. Furthermore, a result on Side B of IPS is also given, concerning the blowing-up property of a sequence calculated from the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map.</description>

Abstract: We study the small dispersion limit of the intermediate long wave (ILW) equation, specifically on a class of well-behaved initial conditions $u_0$ where the number of solitons in the solution increases without bound. First, we conduct a formal WKB-style analysis on the ILW direct scattering problem, generating approximate eigenvalues and norming constants. We then use this to define a modified set of scattering data and rigorously analyze the associated inverse scattering problem. The main results include demonstrating $L^2$-convergence of the solution at $t = 0$ to the original initial condition $u_0$ and for $0 &lt; t &lt; t_\mathrm{c}$ to the associated solution of invicid Burgers' equation, where $t_\mathrm{c}$ is the time of gradient catastrophe.</description>

      <title>On Poincar\'e-Sobolev level involving fractional GJMS operators on hyperbolic space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03299v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to a qualitative analysis of the Poincar\'e--Sobolev level associated with the fractional GJMS operators \(\mathcal{P}_s\) \(\bigl(s\in(0,\tfrac n2)\setminus\mathbb N\bigr)\) on the hyperbolic space \(\mathbb H^n\). In contrast to the integer-order case, when \(s\notin\mathbb N\) the operator \(\mathcal{P}_s\) does not enjoy the conformal covariance that allows one, in the upper half-space or ball model, to relate it to the Euclidean fractional Laplacian \((-\Delta)^s\); this link is crucial for importing Euclidean theory. We therefore introduce \(\widetilde{\mathcal{P}}_s\) (\(s&gt;0\)), which is conformally related to \((-\Delta)^s\). Our purpose in the paper is to analyze the monotonicity, attainability, and strict-gap regions of the Poincar\'e--Sobolev levels associated with \(\mathcal{P}_s\) and \(\widetilde{\mathcal{P}}_s\). First, we reinterpret the Brezis--Nirenberg problem through the lens of Poincar\'e--Sobolev levels, connecting earlier results for the Euclidean Laplacian and for operators \(\mathcal{P}_k\) on \(\mathbb H^n\) with integer \(k\in(0,\tfrac n2)\). We then establish new, explicit lower bounds for the Hardy term in fractional Hardy--Sobolev--Maz'ya inequalities involving both \(\mathcal{P}_s\) and \(\widetilde{\mathcal{P}}_s\). By applying the concentration--compactness principle together with a detailed analysis of the strict-gap regions for the Poincar\'e--Sobolev levels, we prove the existence of solutions to the Brezis--Nirenberg problem on \(\mathbb H^n\) for both operators. Finally, combining the Hardy lower bounds with criteria for attainability, we obtain a complete characterization of the Poincar\'e--Sobolev levels \(H_{n,s}\) and \(\widetilde H_{n,s}\).</description>

      <title>Fine properties of nonlinear potentials and a unified perspective on monotonicity formulas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06462v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We rigorously show that a large family of monotone quantities along the weak inverse mean curvature flow is the limit case of the corresponding ones along the level sets of $p$-capacitary potentials. Such monotone quantities include Willmore and Minkowski-type functionals on Riemannian manifolds with nonnegative Ricci curvature. In $3$-dimensional manifolds with nonnegative scalar curvature, we also recover the monotonicity of the Hawking mass and its nonlinear potential theoretic counterparts. This unified view is built on a refined analysis of $p$-capacitary potentials. We prove that they strongly converge in $W^{1,q}_{\mathrm{loc}}$ as $p\to 1^+$ to the inverse mean curvature flow and their level sets are curvature varifolds. Finally, we also deduce a Gauss-Bonnet-type theorem for level sets of $p$-capacitary potentials.</description>

Abstract: We present direct and elementary commutator techniques for the Dirac equation with long-range electric and mass perturbations. The main results are absence of generalized eigenfunctions and locally uniform resolvent estimates, both in terms of the optimal Besov-type spaces. With an additional massless assumption, we also obtain an algebraic radiation condition of projection type. For their proofs, following the scheme of Ito-Skibsted, we adopt, along with various weight functions, the generator of radial translations as conjugate operator, and avoid any of advanced functional analysis, pseudodifferential calculus, or even reduction to the Schr\"odinger equation. The results of the paper would serve as a foundation for the stationary scattering theory of the Dirac operator.</description>

      <title>Rademacher's Theorem for Calderon-Zygmund-type Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09159v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rademacher's Theorem can be interpreted as an almost-everywhere \emph{little-$o$ improvement principle}: if a function admits a uniform pointwise first-order Lipschitz control at every point, then this control improves to a vanishing one at almost every point. In the language of Calder\'on--Zygmund pointwise spaces, this means that \[ f \in T^\infty_1(x) \quad \forall x \in \mathbb{R}^d \qquad \Longrightarrow \qquad f \in t^\infty_1(x) \quad \text{for a.e. } x \in \mathbb{R}^d. \]
  The purpose of this paper is to establish an analogous almost-everywhere improvement principle in a refined $L^p$ setting. We consider pointwise Calder\'on-Zygmund spaces $T^p_{\phi}(x)$ defined via polynomial approximation in $L^p$ with a function parameter $\phi$, allowing for fractional regularity indices and logarithmic corrections through Boyd functions. We prove that, under natural assumptions on $\phi$, the uniform membership \[ f \in T^p_{\phi}(x) \quad \forall x \in E \] on a measurable set $E \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ implies an almost-everywhere improvement to a vanishing approximation rate, namely \[ f \in t^p_{\phi,n+1}(x) \quad \text{for a.e. } x \in E, \] where $n &lt; \underline{b}(\phi) \leq \overline{b}(\phi) &lt; n+1$.
  The proof combines measurability arguments, a generalized Whitney extension theorem, and fine properties of Sobolev spaces. We also show that this result is essentially sharp: in general, one cannot expect almost-everywhere membership in $t^p_{\phi,n}(x)$ for fractional indices, and explicit counterexamples are provided.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Formation of Black Holes due to Boundary Effect in Vacuum Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09508v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that a marginally outer trapped surface (MOTS) can form as a result of Einsteinian evolution in pure vacuum spacetime starting from regular initial data free of MOTSs due to pure boundary effects. We adapt a Cauchy-double-null framework and use the boundary generalized mean curvature condition for the existence of an interior MOTS imposed by the author S-T Yau in \cite{yau}. In particular, we prove that the condition of \cite{yau} can be met dynamically starting from a configuration that does not verify the same through a focusing mechanism. In fact, a very mild incoming radiation can cause a large enough generalized boundary mean curvature of an isotropically large domain so that a MOTS exists in the interior. This is fundamentally different from black hole formation by standard ``gravitational collapse" and can be interpreted as the dynamical realization of a long-suspected idea in GR: MOTS can form because of ``global geometry", not just quasi-local concentration of gravity/matter.</description>

      <title>Rotationally symmetric translating solitons of fully nonlinear extrinsic geometric flows: Classification and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23623v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study rotationally symmetric translators for fully nonlinear extrinsic geometric flows driven by a curvature function, and we establish the fine asymptotics of bowl-type evolutions and, when admissible, the construction and classification of catenoidal-type solutions, together with their asymptotic behavior. Under natural structural and convexity assumptions, we also prove rigidity and uniqueness results within appropriate classes of graphical translators of such curvature flows.</description>

      <title>Variable Elliptic Structures on the Plane: Transport Dynamics, Rigidity, and Function Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19274v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study variable elliptic structures on planar domains defined by a smoothly varying quadratic relation between a local generator and real coefficient functions. This induces a rank two real algebra bundle whose multiplication varies with position and gives rise to a generalized first order Cauchy Riemann type operator. Differentiating the structure relation shows that the derivatives of the generator are uniquely determined by the structure coefficients, leading to an intrinsic obstruction field that governs all deviations from the constant coefficient theory. Eliminating the derivatives of the generator yields a universal first order transport system constraining the admissible variability of the structure coefficients. In the elliptic regime this system reduces to a forced complex inviscid Burgers equation for a scalar spectral parameter encoding the structure data. Transport along characteristic curves is therefore intrinsic to variable elliptic structures. Within this framework, general smooth first order elliptic systems on the plane admit a natural reformulation as variable structure Vekua equations. The intrinsic obstruction identifies the geometric source of inhomogeneity, while a rigidity condition selects a conservative transport regime. A rigidity-flatness theorem further characterizes when rigid structures reduce locally to constant coefficients, yielding a geometric classification of smooth first order elliptic equations on the plane. Classical tools of complex analysis reemerge in the rigid regime with explicit structure.</description>

      <title>Dynamical stability of various convex graphical translators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22368v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the first part of the paper, we prove the existence of longtime solution to mean curvature flow starting from a graph of a continuous function defined over a slab. Then, we establish dynamical stability results for various types of graphical translators to mean curvature flow, namely the grim reaper, two dimensional graphical translators, and asymptotically cylindrical translators.</description>
