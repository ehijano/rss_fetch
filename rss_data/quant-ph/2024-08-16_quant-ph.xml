      <title>Quantum Rational Transformation Using Linear Combinations of Hamiltonian Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rational functions are exceptionally powerful tools in scientific computing, yet their abilities to advance quantum algorithms remain largely untapped. In this paper, we introduce effective implementations of rational transformations of a target operator on quantum hardware. By leveraging suitable integral representations of the operator resolvent, we show that rational transformations can be performed efficiently with Hamiltonian simulations using a linear-combination-of-unitaries (LCU). We formulate two complementary LCU approaches, discrete-time and continuous-time LCU, each providing unique strategies to decomposing the exact integral representations of a resolvent. We consider quantum rational transformation for the ubiquitous task of approximating functions of a Hermitian operator, with particular emphasis on the elementary signum function. For illustration, we discuss its application to the ground and excited state problems. Combining rational transformations with observable dynamic mode decomposition (ODMD), our recently developed noise-resilient quantum eigensolver, we design a fully real-time approach for resolving many-body spectra. Our numerical demonstration on spin systems indicates that our real-time framework is compact and achieves accurate estimation of the low-lying energies.</description>

      <title>Hybrid entanglement and error correction in a scalable quantum network node</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent breakthroughs have ushered the quantum network into a new era, where quantum information can be stored, transferred, and processed across multiple nodes on a metropolitan scale. A key challenge in this new era is enhancing the capabilities of individual nodes, providing precise and robust control over multiple qubits and advanced functionality for scalable quantum networks. Here, we report on precise and complex control in a hybrid quantum node based on a diamond color center. We demonstrate hybrid coherent control by entangling three types of qubits: an electron spin as an interface qubit, a nuclear spin with long memory time, and a flying photonic qubit, with their qubit frequencies spanning three distinct regimes from the optical domain to the rf domain. By incorporating two additional memory qubits, we encode three memory qubits into a logical state using the three-qubit repetition code and entangle this logical qubit with a photonic qubit. Leveraging hybrid qubits and precise control, we repeatedly read out the error syndromes of memory qubits through the electron spin, serving as an auxiliary qubit, then apply a real-time feedback operation to correct bit-flip errors. We execute and verify active error correction for up to twelve rounds and demonstrate the improvement over the uncorrected counterpart. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of several key functionalities for next-generation quantum repeaters, paving the way towards full-fledged metropolitan-scale quantum networks for a wide range of practical applications.</description>

      <title>Constant-Overhead Magic State Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magic state distillation is a crucial yet resource-intensive process in fault-tolerant quantum computation. The protocol's overhead, defined as the number of input magic states required per output magic state with an error rate below $\epsilon$, typically grows as $\mathcal{O}(\log^\gamma(1/\epsilon))$. Achieving smaller overheads, i.e., smaller exponents $\gamma$, is highly desirable; however, all existing protocols require polylogarithmically growing overheads with some $\gamma &gt; 0$, and identifying the smallest achievable exponent $\gamma$ for distilling magic states of qubits has remained challenging. To address this issue, we develop magic state distillation protocols for qubits with efficient, polynomial-time decoding that achieve an $\mathcal{O}(1)$ overhead, meaning the optimal exponent $\gamma = 0$; this improves over the previous best of $\gamma \approx 0.678$ due to Hastings and Haah. In our construction, we employ algebraic geometry codes to explicitly present asymptotically good quantum codes for $2^{10}$-dimensional qudits that support transversally implementable logical gates in the third level of the Clifford hierarchy. The use of asymptotically good codes with non-vanishing rate and relative distance leads to the constant overhead. These codes can be realised by representing each $2^{10}$-dimensional qudit as a set of $10$ qubits, using stabiliser operations on qubits. The $10$-qubit magic states distilled with these codes can be converted to and from conventional magic states for the controlled-controlled-$Z$ ($CCZ$) and $T$ gates on qubits with only a constant overhead loss, making it possible to achieve constant-overhead distillation of such standard magic states for qubits. These results resolve the fundamental open problem in quantum information theory concerning the construction of magic state distillation protocols with the optimal exponent.</description>

      <title>Using linear and nonlinear entanglement witnesses to generate and detect bound entangled states on an IBM quantum processor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate bound entanglement in three-qubit mixed states which are diagonal in the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) basis. Entanglement in these states is detected using entanglement witnesses and the analysis focuses on states exhibiting positive partial transpose (PPT). We then compare the detection capabilities of optimal linear and nonlinear entanglement witnesses. In theory, both linear and nonlinear witnesses produce non-negative values for separable states and negative values for some entangled GHZ diagonal states with PPT, indicating the presence of entanglement. Our experimental results reveal that in cases where linear entanglement witnesses fail to detect entanglement, nonlinear witnesses are consistently able to identify its presence. Optimal linear and nonlinear witnesses were generated on an IBM quantum computer and their performance was evaluated using two bound entangled states (Kay and Kye states) from the literature, and randomly generated entangled states in the GHZ diagonal form. Additionally, we propose a general quantum circuit for generating a three-qubit GHZ diagonal mixed state using a six-qubit pure state on the IBM quantum processor. We experimentally implemented the circuit to obtain expectation values for three-qubit mixed states and compute the corresponding entanglement witnesses.</description>

      <title>Sum-of-Squares inspired Quantum Metaheuristic for Polynomial Optimization with the Hadamard Test and Approximate Amplitude Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computation shows promise for addressing numerous classically intractable problems, such as optimization tasks. Many optimization problems are NP-hard, meaning that they scale exponentially with problem size and thus cannot be addressed at scale by traditional computing paradigms. The recently proposed quantum algorithm arXiv:2206.14999 addresses this challenge for some NP-hard problems, and is based on classical semidefinite programming (SDP). In this manuscript, we generalize the SDP-inspired quantum algorithm to sum-of-squares programming, which targets a broader problem set. Our proposed algorithm addresses degree-$k$ polynomial optimization problems with $N \leq 2^n$ variables (which are representative of many NP-hard problems) using $O(nk)$ qubits, $O(k)$ quantum measurements, and $O(\textrm{poly}(n))$ classical calculations. We apply the proposed algorithm to the prototypical Max-$k$SAT problem and compare its performance against classical sum-of-squares, state-of-the-art heuristic solvers, and random guessing. Simulations show that the performance of our algorithm surpasses that of classical sum-of-squares after rounding. Our results further demonstrate that our algorithm is suitable for large problems and approximates the best known classical heuristics, while also providing a more generalizable approach compared to problem-specific heuristics.</description>

      <title>A Multilevel Approach For Solving Large-Scale QUBO Problems With Noisy Hybrid Quantum Approximate Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum approximate optimization is one of the promising candidates for useful quantum computation, particularly in the context of finding approximate solutions to Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems. However, the existing quantum processing units (QPUs) are relatively small, and canonical mappings of QUBO via the Ising model require one qubit per variable, rendering direct large-scale optimization infeasible. In classical optimization, a general strategy for addressing many large-scale problems is via multilevel/multigrid methods, where the large target problem is iteratively coarsened, and the global solution is constructed from multiple small-scale optimization runs. In this work, we experimentally test how existing QPUs perform as a sub-solver within such a multilevel strategy. We combine and extend (via additional classical processing) the recent Noise-Directed Adaptive Remapping (NDAR) and Quantum Relax $\&amp;$ Round (QRR) algorithms. We first demonstrate the effectiveness of our heuristic extensions on Rigetti's transmon device Ankaa-2. We find approximate solutions to $10$ instances of fully connected $82$-qubit Sherrington-Kirkpatrick graphs with random integer-valued coefficients obtaining normalized approximation ratios (ARs) in the range $\sim 0.98-1.0$, and the same class with real-valued coefficients (ARs $\sim 0.94-1.0$). Then, we implement the extended NDAR and QRR algorithms as subsolvers in the multilevel algorithm for $6$ large-scale graphs with at most $\sim 27,000$ variables. The QPU (with classical post-processing steps) is used to find approximate solutions to dozens of problems, at most $82$-qubit, which are iteratively used to construct the global solution. We observe that quantum optimization results are competitive regarding the quality of solutions compared to classical heuristics used as subsolvers within the multilevel approach.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Optimal-speed unitary time evolution of pure and quasi-pure quantum states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a characterization of the Hamiltonians that generate optimal-speed unitary time evolution and the associated dynamical trajectory, where the initial states are either pure states or quasi-pure quantum states. We construct the manifold of pure states as an orbit under the conjugation action of the Lie group $\SU(n)$ on the manifold of one-dimensional orthogonal projectors, obtaining an isometry with the flag manifold $\SU(n)/\textnormal{S}(\textnormal{U}(1)\times \textnormal{U}(n-1 ))$. From this construction, we show that Hamiltonians generating optimal-speed time evolution are fully characterized by equigeodesic vectors of $\SU(n)/\textnormal{S}(\textnormal{U}(1)\times \textnormal{U}(n-1))$. We later extend that result to quasi-pure quantum states.</description>

Abstract: We discuss the coupling of photon spin with rotation in connection with a recent proposal of Fedderke et al. [arXiv:2406.16178 [physics.optics]] regarding a precision gyroscope based on the intrinsic spin of light. To this end, we analyze the propagation of electromagnetic radiation in a physical system that uniformly rotates about the direction of wave propagation in the presence of an ambient medium. Finally, we consider the possibility of using this type of spin-of-light gyroscope to measure gravitomagnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Feedforward Quantum Singular Value Transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a major advancement in Quantum Singular Value Transformation (QSVT) through the development of Feedforward QSVT (FQSVT), a framework that significantly enhances the efficiency and robustness of quantum algorithm design. By leveraging intermediate measurements and feedforward operations, FQSVTs reclaim quantum information typically discarded in conventional QSVT, enabling more efficient transformations. Our results show that FQSVTs can exponentially accelerate the projection of quantum states onto energy subspaces, outperforming probabilistic projection and adiabatic algorithms with superior efficiency and a drastic reduction in query complexity. In the context of superconducting qubits, FQSVTs offer a powerful tool for managing energy subspaces, improving efficiency for state preparation and leakage detection.</description>

      <title>Quantum Cross Nonlinearity for Photon-Number-Resolving Nondestructive Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an unconventional mechanism for quantum nonlinearity in a system comprising of a V-type quantum emitter (QE) and two Fabry-Perot cavities. The two transitions of the V-type QE are effectively coupled with two independent cavity modes. The system exhibits a strong quantum nonlinear control in the transmission even at the single-photon level, which we refer to as quantum cross nonlinearity. The underlying physics can be understood as quantum competition between the two transitions of the QE sharing a common ground state. By leveraging this quantum cross nonlinearity, we further show photon-number-resolving quantum nondestructive detection. Owing to the widespread nature of this V-type configuration, our approach can be readily extended to diverse cavity quantum electrodynamic systems beyond the realm of optics, encompassing, e.g., microwave photons and acoustic wave phonons. This versatility may facilitate numerous unique applications for quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Quantum enhanced Markov chains require fine-tuned quenches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum-enhanced Markov chain Monte Carlo, an algorithm in which configurations are proposed through a measured quantum quench and accepted or rejected by a classical algorithm, has been proposed as a possible method for robust quantum speedup on imperfect quantum devices. While this procedure is resilient to noise and control imperfections, the potential for quantum advantage is unclear. By upper-bounding the gap of the Markov chain, we identify competing factors that limit the algorithm's performance. One needs the quantum dynamics to efficiently delocalize the system over a range of classical states, however, it is also detrimental to introduce too much entropy through the quench. Specifically, we show that in the long-time limit, the gap of the Markov chain is bounded by the inverse participation ratio of the classical states in the eigenstate basis, showing there is no advantage when quenching to an ergodic system. For the paradigmatic Sherrington-Kirkpatrick and 3-spin model, we identify the regime of optimal spectral gap scaling and link it to the system's eigenstate properties.</description>

      <title>Bayesian retrodiction of quantum supermaps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Petz map has been established as a quantum version of the Bayes' rule. It unifies the conceptual belief update rule of a quantum state observed after a forward quantum process, and the operational reverse process that brings the final state to a recovered state equal to the updated belief, counteracting the forward process. Here, we study a higher-order generalization of the quantum Bayes' rule by considering a quantum process undergoing a quantum supermap. For a few families of initial beliefs, we show that a similar unification is possible -- the rules to update the belief of quantum channels can be implemented via a "reverse" quantum supermap, which we call the retrodiction supermap, allowing for applications such as error correction in quantum cloud computing. Analytical solutions are provided for those families, while a recipe for arbitrary initial beliefs is yet to be found.</description>

      <title>Minimum Synthesis Cost of CNOT Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimizing the size and depth of CNOT circuits is an active area of research in quantum computing and is particularly relevant for circuits synthesized from the Clifford + T universal gate set. Although many techniques exist for finding short syntheses, it is difficult to assess how close to optimal these syntheses are without an exponential brute-force search. We use a novel method of categorizing CNOT gates in a synthesis to obtain a strict lower bound computable in $O(n^{\omega})$ time on the minimum number of gates needed to synthesize a given CNOT circuit, where $\omega$ denotes the matrix multiplication constant and $n$ is the number of qubits involved. Applying our framework, we prove that $3(n-1)$ gate syntheses of the $n$-cycle circuit are optimal and provide insight into their structure. We also generalize this result to permutation circuits. For linear reversible circuits with $ n = 3, 4, 5$ qubits, our lower bound is optimal for 100%, 67.7%, and 23.1% of circuits and is accurate to within one CNOT gate in 100%, 99.5%, and 83.0% of circuits respectively. We also introduce an algorithm that efficiently determines whether certain circuits can be synthesized with fewer than $n$ CNOT gates.</description>

      <title>A quantum-classical hybrid algorithm with Ising model for the learning with errors problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Learning-With-Errors (LWE) problem is a crucial computational challenge with significant implications for post-quantum cryptography and computational learning theory. Here we propose a quantum-classical hybrid algorithm with Ising model (HAWI) to address the LWE problem. Our approach involves transforming the LWE problem into the Shortest Vector Problem (SVP), using variable qubits to encode lattice vectors into an Ising Hamiltonian. We then identify the low-energy levels of the Hamiltonian to extract the solution, making it suitable for implementation on current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. We prove that the number of qubits required is less than $m(3m-1)/2$, where $m$ is the number of samples in the algorithm. Our algorithm is heuristic, and its time complexity depends on the specific quantum algorithm employed to find the Hamiltonian's low-energy levels. If the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is used to solve the Ising Hamiltonian problem, and the number of iterations satisfies $y &lt; O\left(m\log m\cdot 2^{0.2972k}/pk^2\right)$, our algorithm will outperform the classical Block Korkine-Zolotarev (BKZ) algorithm, where $k$ is the block size related to problem parameters, and $p$ is the number of layers in QAOA. We demonstrate the algorithm by solving a $2$-dimensional LWE problem on a real quantum device with $5$ qubits, showing its potential for solving meaningful instances of the LWE problem in the NISQ era.</description>

      <title>Characterization of Intensity Correlation via Single-photon Detection in Quantum Key Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the most significant vulnerabilities in the source unit of quantum key distribution (QKD) is the correlation between quantum states after modulation, which shall be characterized and evaluated for its practical security performance. In this work, we propose a methodology to characterize the intensity correlation according to the single-photon detection results in the measurement unit without modifying the configuration of the QKD system. In contrast to the previous research that employs extra classical optical detector to measure the correlation, our method can directly analyse the detection data generated during the raw key exchange, enabling to characterize the feature of correlation in real-time system operation. The basic method is applied to a BB84 QKD system and the characterized correlation decreases the secure key rate shown by the security proof. Furthermore, the method is extended and applied to characterize the correlation from the result of Bell-state measurement, which demonstrates its applicability to a running full-scheme MDI QKD system. This study provides an approach for standard certification of a QKD system.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finding a Hadamard matrix of a specific order using a quantum computer can lead to a demonstration of practical quantum advantage. Earlier efforts using a quantum annealer were impeded by the limitations of the present quantum resource and its capability to implement high order interaction terms, which for an $M$-order matrix will grow by O(M^2). In this paper, we propose a novel qubit-efficient method by implementing the Hadamard matrix searching algorithm on a universal quantum computer. We achieve this by employing the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA). Since high order interaction terms that are implemented on a gate-based quantum computer do not need ancillary qubits, the proposed method reduces the required number of qubits into O(M). We present the formulation of the method, construction of corresponding quantum circuits, and experiment results in both a quantum simulator and a real gate-based quantum computer. The experiments successfully found the Baumert-Hall type Hadamard matrices up to 132. These results motivate further efforts to discover previously unknown Hadamard matrices and a prospect to ultimately demonstrate practical quantum advantages</description>

      <title>Efficient simulation of inhomogeneously correlated systems using block interaction product states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The strength of DMRG lies in its treatment of identical sites that are energetically degenerate and spatially similar. However, this becomes a drawback when applied to quantum chemistry calculations for large systems, as entangled orbitals often span broad ranges in energy and space, with notably inhomogeneous interactions. In this study, we propose addressing strong intra-fragment and weak inter-fragment correlations separately using a multi-configurational block interaction product state (BIPS) framework. The strong correlation is captured in electronic states on fragments, considering entanglement between fragments and their environments. This method has been tested in various chemical systems and shows high accuracy and efficiency in addressing inhomogeneous effects in quantum chemistry.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Quantum Energy Teleportation using a 3-Qubit System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Energy Teleportation (QET) is a novel method that leverages quantum entanglement to transfer energy between two distant locations without any physical movement of the energy. The first realization of QET on superconducting hardware, utilizing a 2-qubit system, demonstrated an average energy retrieval efficiency of 11.4% by the receiver, Bob. In this paper, we present a new approach using a 3-qubit system to enhance the energy efficiency of QET. We have incorporated a novel 3-qubit ground state hamiltonian H to achieve this, that conforms the constraints of Zero mean energy. Our experimental results show a significant improvement in energy retrieval, achieving an average efficiency of 46.4%, which is significantly higher than that of the 2-qubit system. This advancement not only marks a step forward in practical quantum energy applications but also provides a new framework for future research in quantum energy teleportation and related quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Intensity correlations in measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The intensity correlations due to imperfect modulation during the quantum-state preparation in a measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution (MDI QKD) system compromise its security performance. Therefore, it is crucial to assess the impact of intensity correlations on the practical security of MDI QKD systems. In this work, we propose a theoretical model that quantitatively analyzes the secure key rate of MDI QKD systems under intensity correlations. Furthermore, we apply the theoretical model to a practical MDI QKD system with measured intensity correlations, which shows that the system struggles to generate keys efficiently under this model. We also explore the boundary conditions of intensity correlations to generate secret keys. This study extends the security analysis of intensity correlations to MDI QKD protocols, providing a methodology to evaluate the practical security of MDI QKD systems.</description>

      <title>Design of a Specialized Low Noise Amplifier for Enhancing Non-Classicality in Quantum Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we present the design and analysis of a Low Noise Amplifier tailored specifically for quantum applications. We selected the HEMT for its unique noise reduction properties, crucial for quantum engineering. The main goal is to minimize the noise figure within the C-band frequency range (4-8 GHz) to induce nonclassicality in quantum signals. While achieving a noise figure of less than 0.065 dB within this band, we recognized the trade-off with gain, mitigated by incorporating additional stages to maintain noise figure at optimal levels. Quantum analysis of the circuit, employing a simplified model of HEMT due to its complexity, revealed insights into its nonlinear properties and interactions between circuit components and environmental factors. Leveraging Qutip toolbox in Python, we conducted time-evolution analysis of the system, revealing the circuit's behavior as an open quantum system under cryogenic conditions. Our investigation extends to quantifying quantum correlation (quantum discord) and its relationship with noise figure, posing important questions regarding the direct impact of its minimization on circuit nonclassicality at cryogenic temperatures. This comprehensive study sheds light on the intricate interplay between circuit design, and its influence on the relationship between the noise figure and quantum correlation.</description>

      <title>Identifying Entanglement Phases with Bipartite Projected Ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce bipartite projected ensembles (BPEs) for quantum many-body wave functions, which consist of pure states supported on two local subsystems, with each state associated with the outcome of a projective measurement of the complementary subsystem in a fixed local basis. We demonstrate that the corresponding ensemble-averaged entanglements (EAEs) between two subsystems can effectively identify entanglement phases. In volume-law entangled states, EAE converges to a nonzero value with increasing distance between subsystems. For critical systems, EAE exhibits power-law decay, and it decays exponentially for area-law systems. Thus, entanglement phase transitions can be viewed as a disorder-order phase transition. We also apply BPE and EAE to measured random Clifford circuits to probe measurement-induced phase transitions. We show that EAE serves not only as a witness to phase transitions, but also unveils additional critical phenomena properties, including dynamical scaling and surface critical exponents. Our findings provide an alternative approach to diagnosing entanglement laws, thus enhancing the understanding of entanglement phase transitions. Moreover, given the scalability of measuring EAE in quantum simulators, our results hold promise for impacting quantum simulations.</description>

Abstract: Photonics has been a promising platform for implementing quantum technologies owing to its scalability and robustness. In this Letter, we demonstrate the encoding of information in 32 time bins or dimensions of a single photon. A practical scheme for manipulating the single photon in high dimensions is experimentally realized to implement a compiled version of Shor's algorithm on a single photon.

      <title>Critical assessment of information back-flow in measurement-free teleportation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We assess a scheme for measurement-free quantum teleportation from the perspective of the resources underpinning its performance. In particular, we focus on recently made claims about the crucial role played by the degree of non-Markovianity of the dynamics of the information carrier whose state we aim to teleport. We prove that any link between efficiency of teleportation and back-flow of information depends fundamentally on the way the various operations entailed by the measurement-free teleportation protocol are implemented, while - in general - no claim of causal link can be made. Our result reinforces the need for the explicit assessment of the underlying physical platform when assessing the performance and resources for a given quantum protocol and the need for a rigorous quantum resource theory of non-Markovianity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper describes the means to reveal and characterize slow periodic modulation of qubit frequency. Such modulation can come from different sources and can impact qubit stability. We show that the modulation leads to very sharp peaks in the power spectrum of outcomes of periodically repeated Ramsey measurements. The positions and shapes of the peaks allow finding both the frequency and the amplitude of the modulation. We also explore how additional slow fluctuations of the qubit frequency and fluctuations of the modulation frequency affect the spectrum. The analytical results are in excellent agreement with extensive simulations.</description>

      <title>From Entanglement Purification Scheduling to Fidelity-constrained Entanglement Routing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently emerged as a disruptive networking paradigm, quantum networks rely on the mysterious quantum entanglement to teleport qubits without physically transferring quantum particles. However, the state of quantum systems is extremely fragile due to environment noise. A promising technique to combat against quantum decoherence is entanglement purification. To fully exploit its benefit, two fundamental research questions need to be answered: (1) given an entanglement path, what is the optimal entanglement purification schedule? (2) how to compute min-cost end-to-end entanglement paths subject to fidelity constraint? In this paper, we give algorithmic solutions to both questions. For the first question, we develop an optimal entanglement purification scheduling algorithm for the single-hop case and analyze the \textsc{purify-and-swap} strategy in the multi-hop case by establishing the closed-form condition for its optimality. For the second question, we design a polynomial-time algorithm constructing an $\epsilon$-optimal fidelity-constrained path. The effectiveness of our algorithms are also numerically demonstrated by extensive simulations.</description>

      <title>Searching Weighted Barbell Graphs with Laplacian and Adjacency Quantum Walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A quantum particle evolving by Schr\"odinger's equation in discrete space constitutes a continuous-time quantum walk on a graph of vertices and edges. When a vertex is marked by an oracle, the quantum walk effects a quantum search algorithm. Previous investigations of this quantum search algorithm on graphs with cliques have shown that the edges between the cliques can be weighted to enhance the movement of probability between the cliques to reach the marked vertex. In this paper, we explore the most restrictive form of this by analyzing search on a weighted barbell graph that consists of two cliques of the same size joined by a single weighted edge/bridge. This graph is generally irregular, so quantum walks governed by the graph Laplacian or by the adjacency matrix can differ. We show that the Laplacian quantum walk's behavior does not change, no matter the weight of the bridge, and so the single bridge is too restrictive to affect the walk. Similarly, the adjacency quantum walk's behavior is unchanged for most weights, but when the weight equals the size of a clique, the probability does collect at the clique containing the marked vertex, and utilizing a two-stage algorithm with different weights for each stage, the success probability is boosted from 0.5 to 0.996, independent of the size of the barbell graph.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We decompose arbitrary weight $Z\otimes \ldots \otimes Z$ exponentials into circuits of constant depth using $\mathcal{O}(n)$ ancillae and two-body XX and ZZ interactions. Consequenty, a similar method works for arbitrary Pauli exponentials. Our decomposition is compatible with linear nearest neighbour architectures. We prove its correctness after introducing novel circuit rewrite rules for circuits which benefit from qubit recycling. As a novelty, the decomposition is immediately applicable for implementing fault-tolerant lattice surgery computations, expressing arbitrary stabilizer circuits using only two-body interactions, as well as reducing the depth of NISQ computations, such as VQE.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the half system entanglement Hamiltonians of the ground state of free fermion critical transverse field Ising model with periodic boundary conditions in the presence of defects. In general, we see that these defects introduce non-local terms into the entanglement Hamiltonian with the largest being couplings across the defect that decay with distance. It is also shown that the entanglement Hamiltonian does know of the defect even if the defect is outside of the subsystem. We also discuss what happens when defects are on the boundaries of the subsystem, and in particular, we investigate the behavior as the bond leading into the subsystem is cut. Finally, we examine the non-local behavior of the antiperiodic defect and duality defect, both of which introduce zero modes.</description>

      <title>Memory-optimised Cubic Splines for High-fidelity Quantum Operations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio-frequency pulses are widespread for the control of quantum bits and the execution of operations in quantum computers. The ability to tune key pulse parameters such as time-dependent amplitude, phase, and frequency is essential to achieve maximal gate fidelity and mitigate errors. As systems scale, a larger fraction of the control electronic processing will move closer to the qubits, to enhance integration and minimise latency in operations requiring fast feedback. This will constrain the space available in the memory of the control electronics to load time-resolved pulse parameters at high sampling rates. Cubic spline interpolation is a powerful and widespread technique that divides the pulse into segments of cubic polynomials. We show an optimised implementation of this strategy, using a two-stage curve fitting process and additional symmetry operations to load a high-sampling pulse output on an FPGA. This results in a favourable accuracy versus memory footprint trade-off. By simulating single-qubit population transfer and atom transport on a neutral atom device, we show that we can achieve high fidelities with low memory requirements. This is instrumental for scaling up the number of qubits and gate operations in environments where memory is a limited resource.</description>

      <title>A universal neutral-atom quantum computer with individual optical addressing and non-destructive readout</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computers must achieve large-scale, fault-tolerant operation to deliver on their promise of transformational processing power [1-4]. This will require thousands or millions of high-fidelity quantum gates and similar numbers of qubits [5]. Demonstrations using neutral-atom qubits trapped and manipulated by lasers have shown that this modality can provide high two-qubit gate (CZ) fidelities and scalable operation [6-10]. However, the gates in these demonstrations are driven by lasers that do not resolve individual qubits, with universal computation enabled by physical mid-circuit shuttling of the qubits. This relatively slow operation will greatly extend runtimes for useful, large-scale computation. Here we demonstrate a universal neutral-atom quantum computer with gate rates limited by optical switching times, rather than shuttling, by individually addressing tightly focused laser beams at an array of single atoms. We achieve CZ fidelity of 99.35(4)% and local single qubit RZ gate fidelity of 99.902(8)%. Moreover, we demonstrate non-destructive readout of alkali-atom qubits with sub-percent loss, which boosts operational speed. This technique also enables us to measure 99.73(3)% CZ fidelity with atom-loss events excluded, which is a record among long lived neutral-atom qubits and highlights the path to higher fidelity and error correction. Our results represent a critical step towards large-scale, fault-tolerant neutral-atom quantum computers that can execute computations on practical timescales.</description>

      <title>Optimization by Decoded Quantum Interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Decoded Quantum Interferometry (DQI), a quantum algorithm for reducing classical optimization problems to classical decoding problems by exploiting structure in the Fourier spectrum of the objective function. DQI reduces sparse max-XORSAT to decoding LDPC codes, which can be achieved using powerful classical algorithms such as Belief Propagation (BP). As an initial benchmark, we compare DQI using belief propagation decoding against classical optimization via simulated annealing. In this setting we present evidence that, for a certain family of max-XORSAT instances, DQI with BP decoding achieves a better approximation ratio on average than simulated annealing, although not better than specialized classical algorithms tailored to those instances. We also analyze a combinatorial optimization problem corresponding to finding polynomials that intersect the maximum number of points. There, DQI efficiently achieves a better approximation ratio than any polynomial-time classical algorithm known to us, thus realizing an apparent exponential quantum speedup. Finally, we show that the problem defined by Yamakawa and Zhandry in order to prove an exponential separation between quantum and classical query complexity is a special case of the optimization problem efficiently solved by DQI.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multiple optically levitated particles in vacuum can exhibit electrostatic interactions, optical binding, or non-reciprocal light-induced dipole-dipole interactions, making them promising platforms for exploring mesoscopic entanglement and complex interactions. However, in optical trap arrays, individually controlling the position and polarization of each trap is challenging, limiting the precise tuning of interactions between adjacent particles. This constraint hinders the study of complex interaction systems. In this work, we introduce a third nanoparticle as a coupler to two initially non-interacting nanoparticles, achieving tunable dipole-dipole coupling mediated by the third one. We investigated the effect of the particles' phases and positions on the interaction strength and demonstrated its broad tunability. Our method allows for precise control of interactions between any pair of adjacent particles in multi-particle systems, facilitating the further use of levitated nanoparticle arrays in entanglement research and sensing.</description>

Abstract: Single-photon detectors (SPDs) are widely used in applications requiring extremely weak light detection. In the near-infrared region, SPDs based on InGaAs/InP single-photon avalanche diodes (SPADs) are the primary candidates for practical applications because of their small size, low cost and ease of operation. Driven by the escalating demands for quantum communication and lidar, the performance of InGaAs/InP SPDs has been continuously enhanced. This paper provides a comprehensive review of advances in InGaAs/InP SPDs over the past 10 years, including the investigation into SPAD structures and mechanisms, as well as emerging readout techniques for both gated and free-running mode SPDs. In addition, future prospects are also summarised.</description>

      <title>Quantum Mpemba effects in many-body localization systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nonequilibrium dynamics of quantum many-body systems have attracted growing attention due to various intriguing phenomena absent in equilibrium physics. One famous example is the quantum Mpemba effect, where the subsystem symmetry is restored faster under a symmetric quench from a more asymmetric initial state. The quantum Mpemba effect has been extensively studied in integrable and chaotic systems. In this Letter, we investigate symmetry restoration and quantum Mpemba effect in many-body localized systems with various initial states. We reveal that the symmetry can still be fully restored in many-body localization phases without approaching thermal equilibrium. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the presence of the quantum Mpemba effect is universal for any initial tilted product state, contrasting to the cases in the chaotic systems where the presence of the quantum Mpemba effect relies on the choice of initial states. We also provide a theoretical analysis of symmetry restoration and quantum Mpemba effects with the help of the effective model for many-body localization. This Letter not only sheds light on extending the quantum Mpemba effect to more non-equilibrium settings but also contributes to a deeper understanding of the many-body localization.</description>

      <title>Dots and Boxes Algorithm for Peierls Substitution: Application to Multidomain Topological Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic fields can be introduced into discrete models of quantum systems by the Peierls substitution. For tight-binding Hamiltonians, the substitution results in a set of (Peierls) phases that are usually calculated from the magnetic vector potential. As the potential is not unique, a convenient gauge can be chosen to fit the geometry and simplify calculations. However, if the magnetic field is non-uniform, finding a convenient gauge is challenging. In this work we propose to bypass the vector potential determination by calculating the Peierls phases exclusively from the gauge-invariant magnetic flux. The phases can be assigned following a graphic algorithm reminiscent of the paper and pencil game "dots and boxes". We showcase the method implementation by calculating the interference phenomenon in a modified Aharonov-Bohm ring and propose a phase assignation alternative to the Landau gauge to reproduce the Half Integer Quantum Hall Effect in graphene. A non-uniform magnetic field case is addressed by considering a multi-domain Chern insulator to study the effects of domain walls in resistance and current quantization. It is found that adding decoherence and a finite temperature into the model results in quantized resistances that are in good agreement with experiments made with multi-domain intrinsic topological insulators.</description>

      <title>Tripartite measurement uncertainty in Schwarzschild space-time</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The effect of Hawking radiation on tripartite measurement uncertainty in a Schwarzschild black hole background is analyzed in this study. Two scenarios are examined: in the first, quantum memory particles approach a Schwarzschild black hole and are positioned near the event horizon, while the particle being measured remains in the asymptotically flat region. In the second scenario, the measured particle moves toward the black hole, and the quantum memories stay in the asymptotically flat region. The study considers two initial quantum states: GHZ and W states. The findings reveal that in both cases, measurement uncertainty increases steadily with rising Hawking temperature. When comparing the GHZ and W states, the GHZ state initially exhibits lower measurement uncertainty at low Hawking temperatures than the W state, indicating greater resilience to Hawking radiation. Additionally, when the quantum memories remain in the asymptotically flat region while the measured particle falls toward the black hole, the uncertainties for GHZ and W states do not align at high temperatures. The GHZ state consistently demonstrates lower measurement uncertainty, showcasing its superior robustness against Hawking radiation.</description>

Abstract: We introduce Josephson junction and inductor models in Keysight ADS that feature an auxiliary flux port, and facilitate the expression of flux quantization conditions in simulation of superconducting microwave circuits. We present several examples that illustrate our methodology for constructing flux-quantizing circuits, including dc- and rf-SQUIDs, tunable couplers, and parametric amplifiers using SNAIL and rf-SQUID arrays. We perform DC, S-parameter, and harmonic balance simulations to validate our models and methods against theory and published experimental results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the steady-state transport characteristics of a quantum dot system consisting of a single energy level embedded between two reservoirs under the influence of both the temperature gradient and bias voltage. Within tailored parameter regimes, the system can exhibit three counterintuitive transport phenomena of anomalous thermodiffusion, absolute negative mobility and reverse heat transport respectively. These counterintuitive phenomena do not violate the second law of thermodynamics. Moreover, absolute negative mobility and reverse heat transport can be identified by a reversible energy level. These anomalous transports are different from thermoelectric transports and provide different perspectives for a more comprehensive understanding of the transport characteristics of quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Imaging coupled vibrational, rotational, and electronic wave packet dynamics in a triatomic molecule</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular dynamics triggered by interaction with light often involve the excitation of several electronic, vibrational, and rotational states. Characterizing the resulting coupled electronic and nuclear wave packet motion represents a severe challenge, even for small polyatomic systems. In this Letter, we demonstrate how the interplay between vibrational, rotational, and electronic degrees of freedom governs the evolution of molecular wave packets in the low-lying states of strong-field-ionized sulfur dioxide. Using time-resolved Coulomb explosion imaging (CEI) in combination with quantum mechanical wave packet simulations, we directly map bending vibrations of the molecule, show how the vibrational wave packet is influenced by molecular alignment, and elucidate the role of the coupling between the two lowest electronic states of the cation. A conical intersection between these states couples the bending and asymmetric stretching coordinates, which is clearly reflected in the correlated fragment momenta. Our results suggest that multi-coincident CEI represents an efficient experimental tool for characterizing coupled electronic and nuclear motion in polyatomic molecules.</description>

      <title>Evidence for simple "arrow of time functions" in closed chaotic quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08007v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Through an explicit construction, we assign to any infinite temperature autocorrelation function $C(t)$ a set of functions $\alpha^n(t)$. The construction of $\alpha^n(t)$ from $C(t)$ requires the first $2n$ temporal derivatives of $C(t)$ at times $0$ and $t$. Our focus is on $\alpha^n(t)$ that (almost) monotonously decrease, we call these ``arrows of time functions" (AOTFs). For autocorrelation functions of few body observables we numerically observe the following: An AOTF featuring a low $n$ may always be found unless the the system is in or close to a nonchaotic regime with respect to a variation of some system parameter. All $\alpha^n(t)$ put upper bounds to the respective autocorrelation functions, i.e. $\alpha^n(t) \geq C^2(t)$. Thus the implication of the existence of an AOTF is comparable to that of the H-Theorem, as it indicates a directed approach to equilibrium. We furthermore argue that our numerical finding may to some extent be traced back to the operator growth hypothesis. This argument is laid out in the framework of the so-called recursion method.</description>

Abstract: Recent experiments have revealed that single proteins can display high conductivity, which stays finite for low temperatures, decays slowly with distance, and exhibits a rich spatial structure featuring highly conducting and strongly insulating domains. Here, we intruduce a new formula by combining the density matrix of the Liouville-Master Equation simulating quantum transport in nanoscale devices, and the phenomenological model of electronic conductance through molecules, that can account for the observed distance- and temperature dependence of conductance in proteins. We demonstrate its efficacy on experimentally highly conductive extracellular cytochrome nanowires, which are good candidates to illustrate our new approach by calculating and visualizing their electronic wiring, given the interest in the arrangement of their conducting and insulating parts. As proteins and protein nanowires exhibit significant potential for diverse applications, including energy production and sensing, our computational technique can accelerate the design of nano-bioelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Spectral Projections for Density Matrices in Quantum Field Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the spectral projection of density matrices in quantum field theory. With appropriate regularization, the spectral projectors of density matrices are expected to be well-defined. These projectors can be obtained using the Riesz projection formula, which allows us to compute both the density of eigenvalues and the expectation values of local operators in the projected states. We find that there are universal divergent terms in the expectation value of the stress energy tensor, where the coefficients depend universally on the density of eigenvalues and a function that describes the dependence of eigenvalues on boundary location. Using projection states, we can construct a series of new states in quantum field theories and discuss their general properties, focusing on the holographic aspects. We observe that quantum fluctuations are suppressed in the semiclassical limit. We also demonstrate that the fixed area state, previously constructed using gravitational path integrals, can be constructed by suitably superposition of appromiate amount of projection states. Additionally, we apply spectral projection to non-Hermitian operators, such as transition matrices, to obtain their eigenvalues and densities. Finally, we highlight potential applications of spectral projections, including the construction of new density and transition matrices and the understanding of superpositions of geometric states.</description>

Abstract: On plain physical grounds localization of relativistic quantum particles is extended to the acronal regions of Minkowski spacetime. Acronal localization fulfills automatically the requirements of causality. It constitutes the frame which complies most completely with the principle of causality for quantum mechanical systems. Acronal localization is equivalent to the localization in the regions of the causal logic. Representations of the causal logic are constructed for the systems with mass spectrum of positive Lebesgue measure and every definite spin. Apparently no representation of the causal logic for a real mass system has been achieved in the past.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scientific applications are starting to explore the viability of quantum computing. This exploration typically begins with quantum simulations that can run on existing classical platforms, albeit without the performance advantages of real quantum resources. In the context of high-performance computing (HPC), the incorporation of simulation software can often take advantage of the powerful resources to help scale-up the simulation size. The configuration, installation and operation of these quantum simulation packages on HPC resources can often be rather daunting and increases friction for experimentation by scientific application developers. We describe a framework to help streamline access to quantum simulation software running on HPC resources. This includes an interface for circuit-based quantum computing tasks, as well as the necessary resource management infrastructure to make effective use of the underlying HPC resources. The primary contributions of this work include a classification of different usage models for quantum simulation in an HPC context, a review of the software architecture for our approach and a detailed description of the prototype implementation to experiment with these ideas using two different simulators (TNQVM \&amp; NWQ-Sim). We include initial experimental results running on the Frontier supercomputer at the Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility (OLCF) using a synthetic workload generated via the SupermarQ quantum benchmarking framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interactions between particles normally induce the decay of the particles Bloch oscillations (BOs) in a periodic lattice. In the large on-site interactions region, spin-$1/2$ fermions may form into doublon bound state and undergoes doublon BOs in the present of tilted potential. Here we investigate the impact of nearest-neighbor interaction $V$ on the multi-doublon BOs in a mass-imbalanced extended Fermi-Hubbard model. We derive a doublons effective Hamiltonian, and show that a minor change of $V$ can alter the dynamic behaviors of doublons qualitatively. Notably, at a resonance point, the doublons act like free hard-core bosons. Under a tilted potential, the system may exhibit different types of multi-doublon BOs at or deviation from the resonance point with different initial states. Numerical results are presented to demonstrate our conclusions in the one- and two-dimensional systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08213v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent developments in integrated optics have made it possible to fabricate high-bandwidth electro-optic modulators (EOMs). Here we show cascaded operation of two of such modulators driven by custom-built electronics delivering on-demand picosecond pulses and application to a quantum dot cavity-QED single photon source. We implement an EOM-based correlation technique and demonstrate light pulses as short as 24$\pm$2 ps with a single EOM. The EOMs can be synchronized and operated in series, we then produce optical pulses down to 17 ps. To optimize the pulse contrast, we analyze for two different EOM devices the transmission as a function of EOM bias, wavelength and temperature, and we show that by temperature tuning and stabilization, a pulse contrast above 25 dB can be obtained at the targeted wavelength. With this high contrast we demonstrate resonant excitation of an InGaAs quantum dot - microcavity based single photon source, demonstrating a crucial technology for scalability and synchronization of large scale photonic quantum applications.</description>

      <title>Discovery and Application of the Two-Electron Quantum Theory of Glass States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The glass state problem stems from the failure described in terms of one-electron theory or atoms (molecules) as independent particles. In 2005, de Gennes proposed that the way to explain the glass transition in simple terms was to construct the cluster model of molecules in contact with all existing glass models and to refine the picture of the mean-field hard-sphere molecules (HSMs) in contact with each other. In the process of refining this picture, we discovered the two-electron quantum theory derived from the second solution of de Gennes n = 0, where the clustered contact of the two HSMs along the z-axis is the sequential emergence of the 16 z-direction interface excited quantum states of their coupled electron pair, the two HSMs suddenly overlap by 0.27% to form a magic-interface two-dimensional vector. The two coupled electron orbitals synchronously escaped the two HSMs 16 times, tangent to the magic interface 16 times, and 16 parallel repulsive electron pairs with an interval of 5.9987{\deg}, which is a clustered boson interaction between the two HSMs. This is the common origin of boson peaks in the glass state and electron pairing in the high-temperature superconductivity. Therefore, the collective behavior of electrons in the two-electron theory can unify the glass transition and the high-temperature superconducting transition. This paper is not only a complete theoretical statement on glass transition, but also a new interpretation of the theory of high-temperature superconductivity, which provides a new theoretical perspective in the search for room-temperature superconducting materials.</description>

      <title>Integrable RG Flows on Topological Defect Lines in 2D Conformal Field Theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological defect lines (TDLs) in two-dimensional conformal field theories (CFTs) are standard examples of generalized symmetries in quantum field theory. Integrable lattice incarnations of these TDLs, such as those provided by spin/anyonic chains, provide a crucial playground to investigate their properties, both analytically and numerically. Here, a family of parameter-dependent integrable lattice models is presented, which realize different TDLs in a given CFT as the parameter is varied. These models are based on the general quantum-inverse scattering construction, and involve inhomogeneities of the spectral parameter. Both defect hamiltonians and (defect) line operators are obtained in closed form. By varying the inhomogeneities, renormalization group flows between different TDLs (such as the Verlinde lines associated with the Virasoro primaries $(1,s)$ and $(s,1)$ in diagonal minimal CFTs) are then studied using different aspects of the Bethe-ansatz as well as ab-initio numerical techniques. Relationships with the anisotropic Kondo model as well as its non-Hermitian version are briefly discussed</description>

Abstract: Using artificial dissipation to tame entanglement growth, we chart the emergence of diffusion in a generic interacting lattice model for varying U(1) charge densities. We follow the crossover from ballistic to diffusive transport above a scale set by the scattering length, finding the intuitive result that the diffusion constant scales as $D \propto 1/\rho$ at low densities $\rho$. Our numerical approach generalizes the Dissipation-Assisted Operator Evolution (DAOE) algorithm: in the spirit of the BBGKY hierarchy, we effectively approximate non-local operators by their ensemble averages, rather than discarding them entirely. This greatly reduces the operator entanglement entropy, while still giving accurate predictions for diffusion constants across all density scales. We further construct a minimal model for the transport crossover, yielding charge correlation functions which agree well with our numerical data. Our results clarify the dominant contributions to hydrodynamic correlation functions of conserved densities, and serve as a guide for generalizations to low temperature transport.</description>

Abstract: Encoding logical qubits in bosonic modes provides a potentially hardware-efficient implementation of fault-tolerant quantum information processing. Here, we demonstrate high-fidelity and deterministic preparation of highly non-classical bosonic states in the mechanical motion of a trapped ion. Our approach implements error-suppressing pulses through optimized dynamical modulation of laser-driven spin-motion interactions to generate the target state in a single step. We demonstrate logical fidelities for the Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) state as high as $\bar{\mathcal{F}}=0.940(8)$, a distance-3 binomial state with an average fidelity of $\mathcal{F}=0.807(7)$, and a 12.91(5) dB squeezed vacuum state.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate non-classical correlations between phonons and photons created using opto-mechanical spontaneous parametric down-conversion in a system based on a soft-clamped ultracoherent membrane oscillator inside of a Fabry-P\'erot optical resonator. Non-Gaussian quantum features are demonstrated for the center-of-mass motion of a sub-millimeter nanogram-scale mechanical oscillator. We show that phonons stored in the mechanical oscillator, when subsequently read out, display strong signs of quantum coherence, which we demonstrate by single-photon counting enabled by our state-of-the-art optical filtering system. We observe a violation of the classical two-time Cauchy-Schwarz inequality between a heralding write photon and a stored phonon with a confidence of $&gt;92\%$.</description>

Abstract: The need for fast and robust quantum state transfer is an essential element in scalable quantum information processing, leading to widespread interest in shortcuts to adiabaticity for speeding up adiabatic quantum protocols. However, shortcuts to adiabaticity for systems with more than a few levels is occasionally challenging to compute in theory and frequently difficult to implement in experiments. In this work, we develop a protocol for constructing shortcuts to adiabaticity through the multi-state Landau-Zener approach and a stricter adiabatic condition. Importantly, our protocol only requires a few pieces of information about the energy spectrum and just adjusts the evolutionary rate of the system. It means that our protocol has broad applicability to theoretical models and does not require increasing the difficulty of the experiment. As examples, we apply our protocol to state transfer in the two-level Landau-Zener model, the non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model and the topological Thouless pump model and find that it can speed up the manipulation speed while remaining robust to Hamiltonian errors. Furthermore, based on the experimental friendliness of our findings, it can potentially be extended to many-body systems, dissipation cases, or Floquet processes. Overall, the proposed shortcut protocol offers a promising avenue for enhancing the efficiency and reliability of quantum state transfer protocols.</description>

Abstract: Pebble games are used to study space/time trade-offs. Recently, spooky pebble games were introduced to study classical space / quantum space / time trade-offs for simulation of classical circuits on quantum computers. In this paper, the spooky pebble game framework is applied for the first time to general circuits. Using this framework we prove an upper bound for quantum space in the spooky pebble game. We also prove that solving the spooky pebble game is PSPACE-complete. Moreover, we present a solver for the spooky pebble game based on satisfiability solvers combined with heuristic optimizers. This spooky pebble game solver was empirically evaluated by calculating optimal classical space / quantum space / time trade-offs. Within limited runtime, the solver could find a strategy reducing quantum space when classical space is taken into account, showing that the spooky pebble model is useful to reduce quantum space.</description>

Abstract: P-algebras are a non-commutative, non-associative generalization of Boolean algebras that are for quantum logic what Boolean algebras are for classical logic. P-algebras have type &lt;X, 0, ', .&gt; where 0 is a constant, ' is unary and . is binary. Elements of X are called features. A partial order is defined on the set X of features by x &lt;= y iff x.y = x. Features commute, i.e., x.y = y.x iff x.y &lt;= x. Features x and y are said to be orthogonal iff x.y = 0 and orthogonality is a symmetric relation.The operation + is defined as the dual of . and it is commutative on orthogonal features. The closed subspaces of a separable Hilbert space form a P-algebra under orthogonal complementation and projection of a subspace onto another one.P-algebras are complemented orthomodular posets but they are not lattices. Existence of least upper bounds for ascending sequences is equivalent to the existence of least upper bounds for countable sets of pairwise orthogonal elements. Atomic algebras are defined and their main properties are studied. The logic of P-algebras is then completely characterized. The language contains a unary connective corresponding to the operation ' and a binary connective corresponding to the operation ".". It is a substructural logic of sequents where the Exchange rule is extremely limited. It is proved to be sound and complete for P-algebras.</description>

      <title>HQNET: Harnessing Quantum Noise for Effective Training of Quantum Neural Networks in NISQ Era</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08475v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper delves into the intricate dynamics of quantum noise and its influence on the onset and mitigation of barren plateaus (BPs) - a phenomenon that critically impedes the scalability of QNNs. We find that BPs appear earlier in noisy quantum environments compared to ideal, noise-free conditions.However, strategic selection of qubit measurement observables can effectively tackle this issue. To this end, we examine a variety of observables, such as PauliZ,PauliX, PauliY, and a specially designed arbitrary Hermitian observable, tailored to the requirements of the cost function and the desired outputs of quantum circuits. Our analysis encompasses both global and local cost function definitions, with the former involving measurements across all qubits and the latter focusing on single-qubit measurements within the QNN framework. Our findings indicate that in a global cost function scenario, PauliX and PauliY observables lead to flatter optimization landscapes, signaling BPs with increasing qubits, especially in noisy conditions. Conversely, the PauliZ observable maintains trainability up to 8 qubits but encounters BPs at 10 qubits. Notably, the arbitrary Hermitian observable, when used with a global cost function, shows a unique advantage as it benefits from noise, facilitating effective training up to 10 qubits. Furthermore, with a local cost function, out of the three conventional observables (PauliX, PauliY and PauliZ), PauliZ is more effective, sustaining training efficiency under noisy conditions for up to 10 qubits, while PauliX and PauliY do not show similar benefits and remain susceptible to BPs. Our results highlight the importance of noise consideration in QNN training and propose a strategic approach to observable selection to improve QNN performance in noisy quantum computing environments thus contributing to the advancement of quantum machine learning research.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16727v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the performance of a quantum error correction code subject to physically-motivated noise modeled by a Lindblad master equation. Working within the code-capacity framework, we consider dissipative and coherent single-qubit terms and two-qubit crosstalk, studying how different approximations of the noise capture the performance of the five-qubit code. A composite-channel approximation where every noise term is considered separately, captures the behavior in many physical cases up to considerably-long timescales, and we analyze its eventual failure due to the effect of noncommuting terms. In contrast, we find that single-qubit approximations do not properly capture the error correction dynamics with two-qubit noise, even for short times. A Pauli approximation going beyond a single-qubit channel, is sensitive to the details of the noise, state, and decoder, and succeeds in many cases at short timescales relative to the noise strength, beyond which it fails. We calculate the code pseudo-threshold emerging within this model, and demonstrate how knowledge of the qubit parameters and connectivity can be used to design better decoders. These results shed light on the performance of error correction codes in the presence of realistic noise and can advance the ongoing efforts toward useful quantum error correction.</description>

Abstract: In the field of quantum computing, variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) represent a pivotal category of quantum solutions across a broad spectrum of applications. These algorithms demonstrate significant potential for realising quantum computational advantage. A fundamental aspect of VQAs involves formulating expressive and efficient quantum circuits (namely ansatz), and automating the search of such ansatz is known as quantum architecture search (QAS). Recently, reinforcement learning (RL) techniques is utilized to automate the search for ansatzes, known as RL-QAS. This study investigates RL-QAS for crafting ansatz tailored to the variational quantum state diagonalisation problem. Our investigation includes a comprehensive analysis of various dimensions, such as the entanglement thresholds of the resultant states, the impact of initial conditions on the performance of RL-agent, the phase transition behaviour of correlation in concurrence bounds, and the discrete contributions of qubits in deducing eigenvalues through conditional entropy metrics. We leverage these insights to devise an entanglement-guided admissible ansatz in QAS to diagonalise random quantum states using optimal resources. Furthermore, the methodologies presented herein offer a generalised framework for constructing reward functions within RL-QAS applicable to variational quantum algorithms.</description>

Abstract: We report measurements of counting statistics, average and variance, of microwave photons of ill-defined frequency : bichromatic photons, i.e. photons involving two well separated frequencies, and "white" broadband photons. Our setup allows for the analysis of single photonic modes of arbitrary waveform over the 1-10 GHz frequency range. The photon statistics is obtained by on-the-fly numerical calculation from the sampled time-dependent voltage. Using an ac+dc biased tunnel junction as a source of quantum microwave, we report an ultra-wide squeezing spectrum representing a competitive source for entanglement generation (up to 0.9 billion measured entangled bits per second) easily achievable experimentally. We also report the observation of quantum steering by the tunnel junction, and show how the presence of squeezing of a broadband mode implies the existence of entanglement between two modes it encompasses.</description>

Abstract: In quantum mechanics, randomness is postulated as a separate axiom. De Broglie's theory allows one to reproduce quantum phenomena from completely deterministic formalism. But the question of the quantum randomness emergency in the de Broglie-Bohm theory needs special attention. In the work [G. Tastevin, F. Lalo\"e, Comptes Rendus. Physique, 2021, 22, 1, pp. 99-116], it was shown that it arises as a result of the device microscopic state influence on the measurement result. In our work, we investigate the genesis of the quantum randomness in the de Broglie's theory in more details. Namely, we investigate the target system and the device behaviour in the decoherence process and model the measurement of canonical-conjugate observables. We propose a thought experiment which tests the opportunity of the information transition using beable-parameters violating the uncertainty relation. We show that in the measurement process, the strong stochastic fluctuations of beable parameters arise randomising the system in accordance with the uncertainty relation. Nevertheless, we find anomalous models of measurement in which these fluctuations can be neglected. These special models require further investigation.</description>

Abstract: Characterizing the temporal-spectral profile of single photons is essential for quantum information protocol utilizing temporal mode for encoding. Based on the phase retrieval algorithm, we present a method to reconstruct the phase spectrum difference between two wave packets from their Hong-Ou-Mandel dip, and intensity spectra. Our confirmatory experiment with weak coherent wave packets demonstrated the accuracy of the reconstructed phase spectrum difference to within plus or minus 0.1 rad. This method is generalizable to the measurement of unknown single-photon wave packets with the aid of a reference wave packet, requiring only the collection of one-dimensional data, which simplifies and expedites the process.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10198v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An important goal in quantum key distribution (QKD) is the task of providing a finite-size security proof without the assumption of collective attacks. For prepare-and-measure QKD, one approach for obtaining such proofs is the generalized entropy accumulation theorem (GEAT), but thus far it has only been applied to study a small selection of protocols. In this work, we present techniques for applying the GEAT in finite-size analysis of generic prepare-and-measure protocols, with a focus on decoy-state protocols. In particular, we present an improved approach for computing entropy bounds for decoy-state protocols, which has the dual benefits of providing tighter bounds than previous approaches (even asymptotically) and being compatible with methods for computing min-tradeoff functions in the GEAT. Furthermore, we develop methods to incorporate some improvements to the finite-size terms in the GEAT, and implement techniques to automatically optimize the min-tradeoff function. Our approach also addresses some numerical stability challenges specific to prepare-and-measure protocols, which were not addressed in previous works.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19468v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work introduces a geometrical object that generalizes the quantum geometric tensor; we call it $N$-bein. Analogous to the vielbein (orthonormal frame) used in the Cartan formalism, the $N$-bein behaves like a ``square root'' of the quantum geometric tensor. Using it, we present a quantum geometric tensor of two states that measures the possibility of moving from one state to another after two consecutive parameter variations. This new tensor determines the commutativity of such variations through its anti-symmetric part. In addition, we define a connection different from the Berry connection, and combining it with the $N$-bein allows us to introduce a notion of torsion and curvature \`{a} la Cartan that satisfies the Bianchi identities. Moreover, the torsion coincides with the anti-symmetric part of the two-state quantum geometric tensor previously mentioned, and thus, it is related to the commutativity of the parameter variations. We also describe our formalism using differential forms and discuss the possible physical interpretations of the new geometrical objects. Furthermore, we define different gauge invariants constructed from the geometrical quantities introduced in this work, resulting in new physical observables. Finally, we present two examples to illustrate these concepts: a harmonic oscillator and a generalized oscillator, both immersed in an electric field. We found that the new tensors quantify correlations between quantum states that were unavailable by other methods.</description>

Abstract: Measuring a qubit state is a fundamental yet error-prone operation in quantum computing. These errors can arise from various sources, such as crosstalk, spontaneous state transitions, and excitations caused by the readout pulse. Here, we utilize an integrated approach to deploy neural networks onto field-programmable gate arrays (FPGA). We demonstrate that implementing a fully connected neural network accelerator for multi-qubit readout is advantageous, balancing computational complexity with low latency requirements without significant loss in accuracy. The neural network is implemented by quantizing weights, activation functions, and inputs. The hardware accelerator performs frequency-multiplexed readout of five superconducting qubits in less than 50 ns on a radio frequency system on chip (RFSoC) ZCU111 FPGA, marking the advent of RFSoC-based low-latency multi-qubit readout using neural networks. These modules can be implemented and integrated into existing quantum control and readout platforms, making the RFSoC ZCU111 ready for experimental deployment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17342v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a scheme for speeding up quantum measurement. The scheme builds on previous protocols that entangle the system to be measured with ancillary systems. In the idealised situation of perfect entangling operations and no decoherence, it gives an exact space-time trade-off meaning the readout speed increases linearly with the number of ancilla. We verify this scheme is robust against experimental imperfections through numerical modelling of gate noise and readout errors, and under certain circumstances our scheme can even lead to better than linear improvement in the speed of measurement with the number of systems measured. This hardware-agnostic approach is broadly applicable to a range of quantum technology platforms and offers a route to accelerate mid-circuit measurement as required for effective quantum error correction.</description>

Abstract: We study closed universes in simple models of two dimensional gravity, such as Jackiw-Teiteilboim (JT) gravity coupled to matter, and a toy topological model that captures the key features of the former. We find there is a stark contrast, as well as some connections, between the perturbative and non-perturbative aspects of the theory. We find rich semi-classical physics. However, when non-perturbative effects are included there is a unique closed universe state in each theory. We discuss possible meanings and interpretations of this observation.</description>

      <title>Kinematic analysis of multiple Compton scattering in quantum-entangled two-photon systems</title>

Abstract: The Stokes-Mueller method is used to analyze the scattering of entangled photon pairs in a two-photon system. This study examines the scenario where one of the photons, part of a pair of maximally entangled annihilation photons, undergoes intermediate Compton scattering before both photons are detected using Compton polarimeters. The method also accounts for potential quantum-decoherence effects resulting from Compton scattering. The analysis investigates the scattering behavior in both parallel and perpendicular planes, identifying variations in the modulation factor that affect azimuthal correlations. These variations include increases, decreases, sign changes, or disappearances at certain intermediate scattering angles. This work aims to provide theoretical results that support the testing and verification of predictions made by quantum field theory.</description>

      <title>Relational bulk reconstruction from modular flow</title>

Abstract: The entanglement wedge reconstruction paradigm in AdS/CFT states that for a bulk qudit within the entanglement wedge of a boundary subregion $\bar{A}$, operators acting on the bulk qudit can be reconstructed as CFT operators on $\bar{A}$. This naturally fits within the framework of quantum error correction, with the CFT states containing the bulk qudit forming a code protected against the erasure of the boundary subregion $A$. In this paper, we set up and study a framework for relational bulk reconstruction in holography: given two code subspaces both protected against erasure of the boundary region $A$, the goal is to relate the operator reconstructions between the two spaces. To accomplish this, we assume that the two code subspaces are smoothly connected by a one-parameter family of codes all protected against the erasure of $A$, and that the maximally-entangled states on these codes are all full-rank. We argue that such code subspaces can naturally be constructed in holography in a "measurement-based" setting. In this setting, we derive a flow equation for the operator reconstruction of a fixed code subspace operator using modular theory which can, in principle, be integrated to relate the reconstructed operators all along the flow. We observe a striking resemblance between our formulas for relational bulk reconstruction and the infinite-time limit of Connes cocycle flow, and take some steps towards making this connection more rigorous. We also provide alternative derivations of our reconstruction formulas in terms of a canonical reconstruction map we call the modular reflection operator.</description>

      <title>Quantum Noise Spectroscopy of Criticality in an Atomically Thin Magnet</title>

Abstract: Dynamic critical fluctuations in magnetic materials encode important information about magnetic ordering in the associated critical exponents. Using nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond, we implement $T_2$ (spin-decoherence) noise magnetometry to study critical dynamics in a 2D Van der Waals magnet CrSBr. By analyzing NV decoherence on time scales approaching the characteristic correlation time $\tau_c$ of critical fluctuations, we extract the critical exponent $\nu$ for the correlation length. Our result deviates from the Ising prediction and highlights the role of long-range dipolar interactions in 2D CrSBr. Furthermore, analyzing the divergence of the correlation length suggests the possibility of 2D-XY criticality in CrSBr in a temperature window near $T_C$ where static magnetic domains are absent. Our work provides a first demonstration of $T_2$ noise magnetometry to quantitatively analyze critical scaling behavior in 2D materials.</description>

      <title>Josephson oscillations of two weakly coupled Bose-Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06208v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A numerical experiment based on a particle number-conserving quantum field theory is performed for two initially independent Bose-Einstein condensates that are coherently coupled at two temperatures. The present model illustrates ab initio that the initial phase of each of the two condensates doesn't remain random at the Boltzmann equilibrium, but is distributed around integer multiple values of $2\pi$ from the interference and thermalization of forward and backward propagating matter waves. The thermalization inside the atomic vapors can be understood as an intrinsic measurement process that defines a temperature for the two condensates and projects the quantum states to an average wave field with zero (relative) phases. Following this approach, focus is put on the original thought experiment of Anderson on whether a Josephson current between two initially separated Bose-Einstein condensates occurs in a deterministic way or not, depending on the initial phase distribution.</description>
