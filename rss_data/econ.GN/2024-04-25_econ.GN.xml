      <title>Adaptive Mechanism Design using Multi-Agent Revealed Preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper constructs an algorithmic framework for adaptively achieving the mechanism design objective, finding a mechanism inducing socially optimal Nash equilibria, without knowledge of the utility functions of the agents. We consider a probing scheme where the designer can iteratively enact mechanisms and observe Nash equilibria responses. We first derive necessary and sufficient conditions, taking the form of linear program feasibility, for the existence of utility functions under which the empirical Nash equilibria responses are socially optimal. Then, we utilize this to construct a loss function with respect to the mechanism, and show that its global minimization occurs at mechanisms under which Nash equilibria system responses are also socially optimal. We develop a simulated annealing-based gradient algorithm, and prove that it converges in probability to this set of global minima, thus achieving adaptive mechanism design.</description>

      <title>Firm-level supply chains to minimize unemployment and economic losses in rapid decarbonization scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.08987v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Urgently needed carbon emissions reductions might lead to strict command-and-control decarbonization strategies with potentially negative economic consequences. Analysing the entire firm-level production network of a European economy, we have explored how the worst outcomes of such approaches can be avoided. We compared the systemic relevance of every firm in Hungary with its annual CO2 emissions to identify optimal emission-reducing strategies with a minimum of additional unemployment and economic losses. Setting specific reduction targets, we studied various decarbonization scenarios and quantified their economic consequences. We determined that for an emissions reduction of 20%, the most effective strategy leads to losses of about 2% of jobs and 2% of economic output. In contrast, a naive scenario targeting the largest emitters first results in 28% job losses and 33% output reduction for the same target. This demonstrates that it is possible to use firm-level production networks to design highly effective decarbonization strategies that practically preserve employment and economic output.</description>

      <title>Strategic Responses to Technological Change: Evidence from ChatGPT and Upwork</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15262v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: AI technologies have the potential to affect labor market outcomes by both increasing worker productivity and reducing the demand for certain skills or tasks. Such changes may have important implications for the ways in which workers seek jobs and position themselves. In this project, we examine how freelancers change their strategic behavior on an online work platform following the launch of ChatGPT in December 2022. We present evidence suggesting that, in response to technological change, freelancers increase the concentration of job applications across specializations and differentiate themselves from both their past behavior and their peers. We show that such changes are shaped by the extent to which a freelancer experiences growth in demand or supply in the domains they specialize in. We document heterogeneity in this effect across freelancer characteristics and document how strategic repositioning can help mitigate the negative effects of technological change on freelancer performance on the platform.</description>

      <title>An Economic Solution to Copyright Challenges of Generative AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13964v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (AI) systems are trained on large data corpora to generate new pieces of text, images, videos, and other media. There is growing concern that such systems may infringe on the copyright interests of training data contributors. To address the copyright challenges of generative AI, we propose a framework that compensates copyright owners proportionally to their contributions to the creation of AI-generated content. The metric for contributions is quantitatively determined by leveraging the probabilistic nature of modern generative AI models and using techniques from cooperative game theory in economics. This framework enables a platform where AI developers benefit from access to high-quality training data, thus improving model performance. Meanwhile, copyright owners receive fair compensation, driving the continued provision of relevant data for generative model training. Experiments demonstrate that our framework successfully identifies the most relevant data sources used in artwork generation, ensuring a fair and interpretable distribution of revenues among copyright owners.</description>
