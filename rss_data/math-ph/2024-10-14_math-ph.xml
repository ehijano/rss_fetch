      <title>On the perturbed periodic Schr\"odinger operators with separate resonant embedded eigenvalues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider Schr\"odinger operators on $L^2(0,\infty)$ given by
  \begin{align}
  Hu=(H_0+V)u=-u^{\prime\prime}+V_0u+Vu=Eu,\nonumber
  \end{align}
  where $V_0$ is real, $1$-periodic and $V$ is the perturbation. It is well known that under perturbations $V(x)=o(1)$ as $x\to\infty$, the essential spectrum of $H$ coincides with the essential spectrum of $H_0$. We introduce a new way to construct $C^\infty$ oscillatory decaying perturbations. In particular, we can construct $C^\infty$ perturbations with resonant embedded eigenvalues from the same spectral band and large separate spectral bands.</description>

      <title>On the prolongation of a local hydrodynamic-type Hamiltonian operator to a nonlocal one</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlocal Hamiltonian operators of Ferapontov type are well-known objects that naturally arise local from Hamiltonian operators of Dubrovin-Novikov type with the help of three constructions, Dirac reduction, recursion scheme and reciprocal transformation. We provide an additional construction, namely the prolongation of a local hydrodynamic-type Hamiltonian operator of a subsystem to its nonlocal counterpart for the entire system. We exemplify this construction by a system governing an isothermal no-slip drift flux.</description>

      <title>Fused Specht Polynomials and $c=1$ Degenerate Conformal Blocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a class of polynomials that we call fused Specht polynomials and use them to characterize irreducible representations of the fused Hecke algebra with parameter $q=-1$ in the space of polynomials. We apply the fused Specht polynomials to construct a basis for a space of holomorphic (chiral) conformal blocks with central charge $c=1$ which are degenerate at each point. In conformal field theory, this corresponds to all primary fields having conformal weight in the Kac table. The associated correlation functions are expected to give rise to conformally invariant boundary conditions for the Gaussian free field, which has also been verified in special cases.</description>

      <title>Planar UST Branches and $c=-2$ Degenerate Boundary Correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a conformal field theory (CFT) description of the probabilistic model of boundary effects in the wired uniform spanning tree (UST) and its algebraic content, concerning the entire first row of the Kac table with central charge $c=-2$. Namely, we prove that all boundary-to-boundary connection probabilities for (potentially fused) branches in the wired UST converge in the scaling limit to explicit CFT quantities, expressed in terms of determinants, which can also be viewed as conformal blocks of degenerate primary fields in a boundary CFT with central charge $c=-2$.
  Moreover, we verify that the Belavin-Polyakov-Zamolodchikov (BPZ) PDEs (i.e., Virasoro degeneracies) of arbitrary orders hold, and we also reveal an underlying valenced Temperley-Lieb algebra action on the space of boundary correlation functions of primary fields in this model. To prove these results, we combine probabilistic techniques with representation theory.</description>

      <title>Weak topological phases in the presence of interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the stability of weak symmetry-protected topological phases (SPTs) in the presence of short-range interactions, focusing on the tenfold way classification. Using Atiyah's Real $\mathit{KR}$-theory and Anderson-dualized bordism, we classify free and interacting weak phases across all Altland-Zirnbauer symmetry classes in low dimensions. Extending the free-to-interacting map of Freed-Hopkins, we mathematically compute how the behavior of free weak SPTs changes when interactions are introduced as well as predict intrinsically-interacting weak phases in certain classes. Our mathematical techniques involve T-duality and the James splitting of the torus. Our results provide a mathematical framework for understanding the persistence of weak SPTs under interactions, with potential implications for experimental and theoretical studies of these phases.</description>

      <title>DLR equations for the superstable Bose gas at any temperature and activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a thermodynamic limit for the grand canonical Bose gas (in its Feynman-Kac representation) with superstable interaction. Although we do not prove the presence of infinite cycles, our infinite volume model is naturally a distribution over configurations of finite loops and interlacements. We prove the limiting process to be solution of DLR equations. We will work within the framework of Dirichlet and periodic boundary conditions, for any inverse temperature $\beta$ &gt; 0, chemical potential $\mu$ $\in$ R and dimension d$\ge$1.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a general approach for deriving transparent boundary conditions for the stationary Schroedinger equation with arbitrary potential. It is proven that the transparent boundary conditions can be written in terms of the Weyl-Titchmarsh coefficients. As examples for the application of the proposed approach, two special cases for the stationary Schroedinger equation with the harmonic potential and the Poeschl-Teller potential are considered.</description>

      <title>Response theory for locally gapped systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a notion of a \emph{local gap} for interacting many-body quantum lattice systems and prove the validity of response theory and Kubo's formula for localized perturbations in such settings.
  On a high level, our result shows that the usual spectral gap condition, concerning the system as a whole, is not a necessary condition for understanding local properties of the system.
  More precisely, we say that an equilibrium state $\rho_0$ of a Hamiltonian $H_0$ is locally gapped in $\Lambda^{\mathrm{gap}} \subset \Lambda$, whenever the Liouvillian $- \mathrm{i} \, [H_0, \, \cdot \, ]$ is almost invertible on local observables supported in $\Lambda^{\mathrm{gap}}$ when tested in $\rho_0$.
  To put this into context, we provide other alternative notions of a local gap and discuss their relations.
  The validity of response theory is based on the construction of \emph{non-equilibrium almost stationary states} (NEASSs).
  By controlling locality properties of the NEASS construction, we show that response theory holds to any order, whenever the perturbation \(\epsilon V\) acts in a region which is further than $|\log \epsilon|$ away from the non-gapped region $\Lambda \setminus \Lambda^{\mathrm{gap}}$.</description>

      <title>A Comparative Study on the Convergence Rate of Two Online Quantum State Reconstruction Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, the convergence rates of two algorithms for the online quantum states reconstruction with Gaussian measurement noise in continuous weak measurement are studied, one is the online proximal gradient-based alternating direction method of multipliers (OPG-ADMM) algorithm, and another is Kalman fitering-based quantum state estimation (KF-QSE) algorithm. For the OPG-ADMM algorithm, by defining the loss function of the optimization function and the constraint condition in the times T tracking process, the convergence rate theorem of the two loss functions is obtained and proved. Then, the convergence order of the normalized distance of the density matrix under the OPG-ADMM algorithm is derived from the conclusion of the theorem. For the KF-QSE algorithm, after defining the loss function of the optimization function, the theorem of the convergence order of the loss function is investigated. Then, the convergence order of the normalized distance of the KF-QSE algorithm is deduced from the conclusion of the theorem. Finally, in the numerical simulation experiments, we use the normalized distance of density matrix as the indicator and use two algorithms for online reconstruction of the 4-bit quantum system. The derived performance of algorithm convergence rates are verified by the comparison and analysis of the results.</description>

      <title>Extended Divergence-Measure Fields, the Gauss-Green Formula, and Cauchy Fluxes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09214v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish the Gauss-Green formula for extended divergence-measure fields (i.e., vector-valued measures whose distributional divergences are Radon measures) over open sets. We prove that, for almost every open set, the normal trace is a measure supported on the boundary of the set. Moreover, for any open set, we provide a representation of the normal trace of the field over the boundary of the open set as the limit of measure-valued normal traces over the boundaries of approximating sets. Furthermore, using this theory, we extend the balance law from classical continuum physics to a general framework in which the production on any open set is measured with a Radon measure and the associated Cauchy flux is bounded by a Radon measure concentrated on the boundary of the set. We prove that there exists an extended divergence-measure field such that the Cauchy flux can be recovered through the field, locally on almost every open set and globally on every open set. Our results generalize the classical Cauchy's Theorem (that is only valid for continuous vector fields) and extend the previous formulations of the Cauchy flux (that generate vector fields within $L^{p}$). Thereby, we establish the equivalence between entropy solutions of the multidimensional nonlinear partial differential equations of divergence form and of the mathematical formulation of physical balance laws via the Cauchy flux through the constitutive relations in the axiomatic foundation of Continuum Physics.</description>

      <title>Greedy Trial Subspace Selection in Meshfree Time-Stepping Scheme with Applications in Coupled Bulk-Surface Pattern</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Combining kernel-based collocation methods with time-stepping methods to solve parabolic partial differential equations can potentially introduce challenges in balancing temporal and spatial discretization errors. Typically, using kernels with high orders of smoothness on some sufficiently dense set of trial centers provides high spatial approximation accuracy that can exceed the accuracy of finite difference methods in time. The paper proposes a greedy approach for selecting trial subspaces in the kernel-based collocation method applied to time-stepping to balance errors in both well-conditioned and ill-conditioned scenarios. The approach involves selecting trial centers using a fast block-greedy algorithm with new stopping criteria that aim to balance temporal and spatial errors. Numerical simulations of coupled bulk-surface pattern formations, a system involving two functions in the domain and two on the boundary, illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in reducing trial space dimensions while maintaining accuracy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work establishes a linear response formula for sequential intermittent dynamical systems, consisting of Liverani-Saussol-Vaienti maps with varying parameters. As a consequence, we establish quenched (trajectory-wise) linear response for random compositions of these maps, complementing recent annealed (averaged) results in this setting. As an intermediate step, we show existence, uniqueness and statistical stability of the sequential equivariant densities for such non-uniformly expanding systems. Our arguments rely on the cone technique introduced by Baladi and Todd and further developed by Lepp{\"a}nen.</description>

      <title>Exact WKB in all sectors I: Potentials with degenerate saddles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09511v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the exact-WKB (EWKB) method through the analysis of Airy and Weber types, with an emphasis on the exact quantization of locally harmonic potentials in multiple sectors. The core innovation of our work lies in introducing a novel complexification approach to the energy parameter $u$, distinct from the common complexification of the (semi-classical) expansion parameter used in Borel summability. This new technique allows for continuous analytical continuation across different sectors of a potential while maintaining the exact quantization condition, even before median summation. By redefining the $A$-cycle above the potential barrier top, we ensure the quantization condition remains real and, by use of the Stokes automorphism and the median resummation, show that the resurgence structure is preserved across transitions between sectors. Furthermore, we extend the Weber-type exact-WKB method, offering exact estimates for quantum actions around all types of saddle points, generalizing previous results. Through the analysis of these quantum actions, we reveal the presence of $S$-duality, facilitating the exchange between perturbative and non-perturbative behaviors, and we conjecture the mapping of the P-NP relations between dual theories. Our study encompasses periodic and symmetric double-well potentials, demonstrating that the exact-WKB method captures intricate structures in quantum systems in all sectors, including multi-instanton contributions and the resurgence of quantum actions.</description>

Abstract: We prove that an imitation game has a perfect quantum approximate strategy if and only if there exists a bi-tracial state on the minimal tensor product of two universal C${^*}$-algebras, which induces the perfect correlation. Moreover, we are trying to relate imitation games to the minimal tensor product of two universal C${^*}$-algebras and demonstrate that an imitation game has a perfect quantum approximate strategy if and only if there exist a von Neumann algebra and an amenable tracial state on it, such that the perfect correlation can be induced by the tracial state. However, We encountered some difficulties regarding continuity in the proof process. In section 2 we get some results for special cases, and in section 3 we list our problems.</description>

Abstract: We establish a precise correspondence between points of momentum amplituhedra and origami crease patterns. As an application, we prove that the BCFW cells triangulate the momentum amplituhedron when all Mandelstam variables are nonnegative. As another application, we show that every weighted planar bipartite graph $\Gamma$ admits a t-embedding, i.e., an embedding of the planar dual of $\Gamma$ such that the sum of angles of white (equivalently, black) faces around each vertex is equal to $\pi$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a universal and straightforward algebraic procedure for flat bands construction, polynomial indicator method. Using only Bloch Hamiltonian eigendeterminant functional to identify conditions that guarantee existence of nondispersive eigenvalues, the polynomial indicator method is applicable to all lattice types, enabling predictions of (topological) flat bands in electronic band structure (across the materials), as well as all possible designs of novel artificial flat band lattices. The method is in detail illustrated on several examples - kagome and dice lattice included.</description>

      <title>Mass, Conformal Capacity, and the Volumetric Penrose Inequality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\Omega$ be a smooth, bounded subset of $\mathbb{R}^3$ diffeomorphic to a ball. Consider $M = \mathbb{R}^3 \setminus \Omega$ equipped with an asymptotically flat metric $g = f^4 g_{\text{euc}}$, where $f\to 1$ at infinity. Assume that $g$ has non-negative scalar curvature and that $\Sigma = \partial M$ is a minimal 2-sphere in the $g$ metric. We prove a sharp inequality relating the ADM mass of $M$ with the conformal capacity of $\Omega$. As a corollary, we deduce a sharp lower bound for the ADM mass of $M$ in terms of the Euclidean volume of $\Omega$. We also prove a stability type result for this ``volumetric Penrose inequality.'' The proofs are based on a monotonicity formula holding along the level sets of a 3-harmonic function.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we present a new learning method called sl-PINN to tackle the one-dimensional viscous Burgers problem at a small viscosity, which results in a singular interior layer. To address this issue, we first determine the corrector that characterizes the unique behavior of the viscous flow within the interior layers by means of asymptotic analysis. We then use these correctors to construct sl-PINN predictions for both stationary and moving interior layer cases of the viscous Burgers problem. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that sl-PINNs accurately predict the solution for low viscosity, notably reducing errors near the interior layer compared to traditional PINN methods. Our proposed method offers a comprehensive understanding of the behavior of the solution near the interior layer, aiding in capturing the robust part of the training solution.</description>

Abstract: We remind the definition and main properties of the Krichever quasiclassical tau-function, and turn to the application of these formulas for recent studies of two-dimensional quantum gravity. We show, that in the case of minimal gravity it turns to be directly related with the Verlinde formula for minimal models, giving in particular case its one more direct proof. Generalizations for continuous "complex Liouville" theory are also briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Quantum Linear Time-Translation-Invariant Systems: Conjugate Symplectic Structure, Uncertainty Bounds, and Tomography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Linear time-translation-invariant (LTI) models offer simple, yet powerful, abstractions of complex classical dynamical systems. Quantum versions of such models have so far relied on assumptions of Markovanity or an internal state-space description. We develop a general quantization scheme for multimode classical LTI systems that reveals their fundamental quantum noise, is applicable to non-Markovian scenarios, and does not require knowledge of an internal description.The resulting model is that of an open quantum LTI system whose dilation to a closed system is characterized by elements of the conjugate symplectic group. Using Lie group techniques, we show that such systems can be synthesized using frequency-dependent interferometers and squeezers. We derive tighter Heisenberg uncertainty bounds which constrain the ultimate performance of any LTI system, and obtain an invariant representation of their output noise covariance matrix that reveals the ubiquity of "complex squeezing" in lossy systems. This frequency-dependent quantum resource can be hidden to homodyne and heterodyne detection and can only be revealed with more general "symplectodyne" detection. These results establish a complete and systematic framework for the analysis, synthesis, and measurement of arbitrary quantum LTI systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates stability estimates for inverse source problems in the stochastic polyharmonic wave equation, where the source is represented by white noise. The study examines the well-posedness of the direct problem and derives stability estimates for identifying the strength of the random source. Assuming a priori information of the regularity and support of the source strength, the H\"{o}lder stability is established in the absence of a potential. In the more challenging case where a potential is present, the logarithmic stability estimate is obtained by constructing specialized solutions to the polyharmonic wave equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider smooth Gowdy-symmetric generalised Taub-NUT solutions, a class of inhomogeneous cosmological models with spatial three-sphere topology. They are characterised by existence of a smooth past Cauchy horizon and, with the exception of certain singular cases, they also develop a regular future Cauchy horizon. Several examples of exact solutions were previously constructed, where the initial data (in form of the initial Ernst potentials) are polynomials of low degree. Here, we generalise to polynomial initial data of arbitrary degree. Utilising methods from soliton theory, we obtain a simple algorithm that allows us to construct the resulting Ernst potential with purely algebraic calculations. We also derive an explicit formula in terms of determinants, and we illustrate the method with two examples.</description>

Abstract: We discuss global tensor invariants of a rigid body motion in the cases of Euler, Lagrange and Kovalevskaya. These invariants are obtained by substituting tensor fields with cubic on variable components into the invariance equation and solving the resulting algebraic equations using computer algebra systems. According to the Poincar\'{e}-Cartan theory of invariants, the existence of invariant geometric structures raises the question of using them to study the dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The existence of pseudorandom unitaries (PRUs) -- efficient quantum circuits that are computationally indistinguishable from Haar-random unitaries -- has been a central open question, with significant implications for cryptography, complexity theory, and fundamental physics. In this work, we close this question by proving that PRUs exist, assuming that any quantum-secure one-way function exists. We establish this result for both (1) the standard notion of PRUs, which are secure against any efficient adversary that makes queries to the unitary $U$, and (2) a stronger notion of PRUs, which are secure even against adversaries that can query both the unitary $U$ and its inverse $U^\dagger$. In the process, we prove that any algorithm that makes queries to a Haar-random unitary can be efficiently simulated on a quantum computer, up to inverse-exponential trace distance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a theory of random non-Hermitian action that, after quantization, describes the stochastic nonlinear dynamics of quantum states in Hilbert space. Focusing on fermionic fields, we propose both canonical quantization and path integral quantization, demonstrating that these two approaches are equivalent. Using this formalism, we investigate the evolution of a single-particle Gaussian wave packet under the influence of non-Hermiticity and randomness. Our results show that specific types of non-Hermiticity lead to wave packet localization, while randomness affects the central position of the wave packet, causing the variance of its distribution to increase with the strength of the randomness.</description>

Abstract: The Bianchi type $\mathrm{VI}_{-1/9}$, $\mathrm{VIII}$ and $\mathrm{IX}$ vacuum models all have 4-dimensional Hubble-normalized state spaces and are expected to have a generic initial oscillatory singularity, but the invariant boundary sets responsible for the oscillations are much more complicated for type $\mathrm{VI}_{-1/9}$ than those of type $\mathrm{VIII}$ and $\mathrm{IX}$. For the first time, we explicitly solve the equations on these type $\mathrm{VI}_{-1/9}$ boundary sets and also introduce a new graphic representation of the associated network of heteroclinic chains (i.e. sequences of solutions describing the oscillations). In particular, we give examples of networks of entangled cyclic heteroclinic chains and show that only some of these cyclic heteroclinic chains are asymptotically relevant.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we study a new generalization of the kinetic equation emerging in run-and-tumble models. We show that this generalization leads to a wide class of generalized fractional kinetic (GFK) and telegraph-type equations depending by two (or three) parameters. We provide an explicit expression of the solution in the Laplace domain and show that, for a particular choice of the parameters, the fundamental solution of the GFK equation can be interpreted as the probability density function of a stochastic process obtained by a suitable transformation of the inverse of a subordinator. Then, we discuss some particular interesting cases, such as generalized telegraph models, diffusion fractional equations involving higher order time derivatives and fractional integral equations.</description>

      <title>A Probabilistic Mean Field Limit for the Vlasov-Poisson System for Ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Vlasov-Poisson system for ions is a kinetic equation for dilute, unmagnetised plasma. It describes the evolution of the ions in a plasma under the assumption that the electrons are thermalized. Consequently, the Poisson coupling for the electrostatic potential contains an additional exponential nonlinearity not present in the electron Vlasov-Poisson system.
  The system can be formally derived through a mean field limit from a microscopic system of ions interacting with a thermalized electron distribution. However, it is an open problem to justify this limit rigorously for ions modelled as point charges. Existing results on the derivation of the three-dimensional ionic Vlasov-Poisson system require a truncation of the singularity in the Coulomb interaction at spatial scales of order $N^{- \beta}$ with $\beta &lt; 1/15$, which is more restrictive than the available results for the electron Vlasov-Poisson system.
  In this article, we prove that the Vlasov-Poisson system for ions can be derived from a microscopic system of ions and thermalized electrons with interaction truncated at scale $N^{- \beta}$ with $\beta &lt; 1/3$. We develop a generalisation of the probabilistic approach to mean field limits that is applicable to interaction forces defined through a nonlinear coupling with the particle density. The proof is based on a quantitative uniform law of large numbers for convolutions between empirical measures of independent, identically distributed random variables and locally Lipschitz functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quite some years ago, Oleg Chalykh has built a nice theory from the observation that the Macdonald polynomial reduces at $t=q^{-m}$ to a sum over permutations of simpler polynomials called Baker-Akhiezer functions, which can be unambiguously constructed from a system of linear difference equations. Moreover, he also proposed a generalization of these polynomials to the twisted Baker-Akhiezer functions. Recently, in a private communication Oleg suggested that these twisted Baker-Akhiezer functions could provide eigenfunctions of the commuting Hamiltonians associated with the $(-1,a)$ rays of the Ding-Iohara-Miki algebra. In the paper, we discuss this suggestion and some evidence in its support.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10718v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the sensitivity of the eigenvectors of random matrices, showing that even small perturbations make the eigenvectors almost orthogonal. More precisely, we consider two deformed Wigner matrices $W+D_1$, $W+D_2$ and show that their bulk eigenvectors become asymptotically orthogonal as soon as $\mathrm{Tr}(D_1-D_2)^2\gg 1$, or their respective energies are separated on a scale much bigger than the local eigenvalue spacing. Furthermore, we show that quadratic forms of eigenvectors of $W+D_1$, $W+D_2$ with any deterministic matrix $A\in\mathbf{C}^{N\times N}$ in a specific subspace of codimension one are of size $N^{-1/2}$. This proves a generalization of the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis to eigenvectors belonging to two different spectral families.</description>

      <title>Production of the Fisher information for the Landau-Coulomb equation with L1 initial data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the Landau-Coulomb equation for initial data with bounded mass, finite numbers of moments, and entropy. We show the existence of a global weak solution that has bounded Fisher information for positive times. This solution is therefore a global strong solution away from the initial time. We propose an alternative approach, based on already existing estimates, to the study of the appearance of Fisher information recently performed by Ji in [12].</description>

      <title>Singular Twist Waves in Chromonic Liquid Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chromonic liquid crystals are lyotropic nematic phases whose applications span from food to drug industries. It has recently been suggested that the elastic energy density governing the equilibrium distortions of these materials may be quartic in the measure of twist. Here we show that the non-linear twist-wave equation associated with such an energy has smooth solutions that break down in a finite time, giving rise to the formation of a shock wave, under rather generic assumptions on the initial profile. The critical time at which smooth solutions become singular is estimated analytically with an accuracy that numerical calculations for a number of exemplary cases prove to be satisfactory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.03495v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the nonlinear Gross-Pitaevskii equation at positive density, that is, for a bounded solution not tending to 0 at infinity. We focus on infinite ground states, which are by definition minimizers of the energy under local perturbations. When the Fourier transform of the interaction potential takes negative values we prove the existence of a phase transition at high density, where the constant solution ceases to be a ground state. The analysis requires mixing techniques from elliptic PDE theory and statistical mechanics, in order to deal with a large class of interaction potentials.</description>

Abstract: We consider the lattice analog of a recently proposed continuum model for the propagation of one- and two-photon states in a random medium. We find that there is localization of single photons in an energy band centered at the resonant energy of the atoms. Moreover, there is also localization of photons at arbitrarily large energies. For the case of two photons, there is localization in an energy band centered at twice the resonant frequency.</description>

      <title>Markov limits of steady states of the KPZ equation on an interval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.04462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.04462v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper builds upon the research of Corwin and Knizel who proved the existence of stationary measures for the KPZ equation on an interval and characterized them through a Laplace transform formula. Bryc, Kuznetsov, Wang and Wesolowski found a probabilistic description of the stationary measures in terms of a Doob transform of some Markov kernels; essentially at the same time, another description connecting the stationary measures to the exponential functionals of the Brownian motion appeared in work of Barraquand and Le Doussal.
  Our first main result clarifies and proves the equivalence of the two probabilistic description of these stationary measures. We then use the Markovian description to give rigorous proofs of some of the results claimed in Barraquand and Le Doussal. We analyze how the stationary measures of the KPZ equation on finite interval behave at large scale. We investigate which of the limits of the steady states of the KPZ equation obtained recently by G. Barraquand and P. Le Doussal can be represented by Markov processes in spatial variable under an additional restriction on the range of parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2110.10587v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The formalism of quantum theory over discrete systems is extended in two significant ways. First, quantum evolutions are generalized to act over entire network configurations, so that nodes may find themselves in a quantum superposition of being connected or not, and be allowed to merge, split and reconnect coherently in a superposition. Second, tensors and traceouts are generalized, so that systems can be partitioned according to almost arbitrary logical predicates in a robust manner. The hereby presented mathematical framework is anchored on solid grounds through numerous lemmas. Indeed, one might have feared that the familiar interrelations between the notions of unitarity, complete positivity, trace-preservation, non-signalling causality, locality and localizability that are standard in quantum theory be jeopardized as the neighbourhood and partitioning between systems become both quantum, dynamical, and logical. Such interrelations in fact carry through, albeit two new notions become instrumental: consistency and comprehension.</description>

      <title>Dirac Landau levels for surfaces with constant negative curvature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.09221v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Studies of the formation of Landau levels based on the Schr\"odinger equation for electrons constrained to curved surfaces have a long history. These include as prime examples surfaces with constant positive and negative curvature, the sphere [Phys. Rev. Lett. 51, 605 (1983)] and the pseudosphere [Annals of Physics 173, 185 (1987)]. Now, topological insulators, hosting Dirac-type surface states, provide a unique platform to experimentally examine such quantum Hall physics in curved space. Hence, extending previous work we consider solutions of the Dirac equation for the pseudosphere for both, the case of an overall perpendicular magnetic field and a homogeneous coaxial, thereby locally varying, magnetic field. For both magnetic-field configurations, we provide analytical solutions for spectra and eigenstates. For the experimentally relevant case of a coaxial magnetic field we find that the Landau levels split and show a peculiar scaling $\propto B^{1/4}$, thereby characteristically differing from the usual linear $B$ and $B^{1/2}$ dependence of the planar Schr\"odinger and Dirac case, respectively. We compare our analytical findings to numerical results that we also extend to the case of the Minding surface.</description>

Abstract: We show that one-parameter deformation $\mathcal A_{q,t}$ of the skein algebra $Sk_q(\Sigma_2)$ of a genus two surface suggested in [AS19] is flat. We solve the word problem in the algebra and describe monomial basis. In addition, we calculate the classical limit $\mathcal A_{q=1,t}$ of the algebra and prove that it is a one-parameter flat Poisson deformation of the coordinate ring $\mathcal A_{q=t=1}$ of an $SL(2,\mathbb C)$-charater variety of a genus two surface. As a byproduct, we obtain a remarkably simple presentation in terms of generators and relations for the coordinate ring $\mathcal A_{q=t=1}$ of a genus two character variety.</description>

      <title>A Chern-Simons approach to self-dual gravity in (2+1)-dimensions and quantisation of Poisson structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10220v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The (2+1)-dimensional analog self-dual gravity which is obtained via spacetime dimension reduction of the (3+1)-dimensional Holst action without reducing the internal gauge group is studied. A Chern-Simons formulation for this theory is constructed based on the gauge group $SL(2,\CC)_\RR\rcross \Rsix$ and maps the 3d complex self-dual dynamical variable and connection to 6d real variables which combines into a 12d Cartan connection. The Chern-Simons approach leads to a real analogue for the self-dual action based on a larger symmetry group. The quantization process follows the combinatorial quantization method outlined for Chern-Simons theory. In the combinatorial quantization of the phase space the Poisson structure governing the moduli space of flat connections which emerges is obtained using the classical $r$-matrix for the quantum double $D(SL(2,\CC)_\RR)$ viewed as the double of a double $ D(SL(2,\RR)\dcross AN(2))$. This quantum double gives the structure for quantum symmetries within the quantum theory for the model.</description>

      <title>Braids and Higher-order Exceptional Points from the Interplay Between Lossy Defects and Topological Boundary States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03054v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the perturbation of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chain by a localized lossy defect leads to higher-order exceptional points (HOEP). Depending on the location of the defect, third- and fourth- order exceptional points (EP3 \&amp; EP4) appear in the space of Hamiltonian parameters. On the one hand, they arise due to the non-Abelian braiding properties of exceptional lines (EL) in parameter space. Namely, the HOEPs lie at intersections of mutually non-commuting ELs. On the other hand, we show that such special intersections happen due to the fact that the delocalization of edge states, induced by the non-Hermitian defect, hybridizes them with defect states. These can then coalesce together into an EP3. When the defect lies at the midpoint of the chain, a special symmetry of the full spectrum can lead to an EP4. In this way, our model illustrates the emergence of interesting non-Abelian topological properties in the multiband structure of non-Hermitian perturbations of topological phases.</description>

      <title>Pinning, diffusive fluctuations, and Gaussian limits for half-space directed polymer models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.11439v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Half-space directed polymers in random environments are models of interface growth in the presence of an attractive hard wall. They arise naturally in the study of wetting and entropic repulsion phenomena. In 1985, Kardar predicted a "depinning" phase transition as the attractive force of the wall is weakened. This phase transition has been rigorously established for integrable models of half-space last passage percolation, i.e. half-space directed polymers at zero temperature, in a line of study tracing back to work of Baik--Rains. On the other hand, for integrable positive temperature models, the first rigorous proof of this phase transition has only been obtained very recently through a series of works of Barraquand--Wang, Imamura--Mucciconi--Sasamoto [IMS], Barraquand--Corwin--Das, and Das--Zhu [DZ] on the half-space log-Gamma polymer. In this paper we study a broad class of half-space directed polymer models with minimal assumptions on the random environment. We prove that an attractive force on the wall strong enough to macroscopically increase the free energy induces phenomena characteristic of the subcritical "bound phase," namely the pinning of the polymer to the wall and the diffusive fluctuations and limiting Gaussianity of the free energy. Our arguments are geometric in nature and allow us to analyze the positive temperature and zero temperature models simultaneously. Moreover, given the macroscopic free energy increase proven in [IMS] for the half-space log-Gamma polymer, our arguments can be used to reprove the results of [IMS, DZ] on polymer geometry and free energy fluctuations in the bound phase.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11350v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Relaxing the postulates of an axiomatic theory is a natural way to find more general theories, and historically, the discovery of non-Euclidean geometry is a famous example of this procedure. Here, we use this way to extend quantum mechanics by ignoring the heart of Heisenberg's quantum mechanics -- We do not assume the existence of a position operator that satisfies the Heisenberg commutation relation, $[\hat x,\hat p]=i\hbar$. The remaining axioms of quantum theory, besides Galilean symmetry, lead to a more general quantum theory with a free parameter $l_0$ of length dimension, such that as $l_0 \to 0$ the theory reduces to standard quantum theory. Perhaps surprisingly, this non-Heisenberg quantum theory, without a priori assumption of the non-commutation relation, leads to a modified Heisenberg uncertainty relation, $\Delta x \Delta p\geq \sqrt{\hbar^2/4+l_0^2(\Delta p)^2}$, which ensures the existence of a minimal position uncertainty, $l_0$, as expected from various quantum gravity studies. By comparing the results of this framework with some observed data, which includes the first longitudinal normal modes of the bar gravitational wave detector AURIGA and the $1S-2S$ transition in the hydrogen atom, we obtain upper bounds on the $l_0$.</description>

      <title>Schr\"odinger symmetry: a historical review</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.20316v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper reviews the history of the conformal extension of Galilean symmetry, now called Schr\"odinger symmetry. In the physics literature, its discovery is commonly attributed to Jackiw, Niederer and Hagen (1972). However, Schr\"odinger symmetry has a much older ancestry: the associated conserved quantities were known to Jacobi in 1842/43 and its euclidean counterpart was discovered by Sophus Lie in 1881 in his studies of the heat equation. A convenient way to study Schr\"odinger symmetry is provided by a non-relativistic Kaluza-Klein-type "Bargmann" framework, first proposed by Eisenhart (1929), but then forgotten and re-discovered by Duval {\it et al.} only in 1984. Representations of Schr\"odinger symmetry differ by the value $z=2$ of the dynamical exponent from the value $z=1$ found in representations of relativistic conformal invariance. For generic values of $z$, whole families of new algebras exist, which for $z=2/\ell$ include the $\ell$-conformal galilean algebras. We also review the non-relativistic limit of conformal algebras and that this limit leads to the $1$-conformal galilean algebra and not to the Schr\"odinger algebra. The latter can be recovered in the Bargmann framework through reduction. A distinctive feature of Galilean and Schr\"odinger symmetries are the Bargmann super-selection rules, algebraically related to a central extension. An empirical consequence of this was known as "mass conservation" already to Lavoisier. As an illustration of these concepts, some applications to physical ageing in simple model systems are reviewed.</description>

      <title>Scaling laws for Rayleigh-B\'enard convection between Navier-slip boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14936v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the two-dimensional Rayeigh-B\'enard convection problem between Navier-slip fixed-temperature boundary conditions and present a new upper bound for the Nusselt number. The result, based on a localization principle for the Nusselt number and an interpolation bound, exploits the regularity of the flow. On one hand our method yields a shorter proof of the celebrated result in Whitehead &amp; Doering (2011) in the case of free-slip boundary conditions. On the other hand, its combination with a new, refined estimate for the pressure gives a substantial improvement of the interpolation bounds in Drivas et al. (2022) for slippery boundaries. A rich description of the scaling behaviour arises from our result: depending on the magnitude of the Prandtl number and slip-length, our upper bounds indicate five possible scaling laws: $\textit{Nu} \sim (L_s^{-1}\textit{Ra})^{\frac{1}{3}}$, $\textit{Nu} \sim (L_s^{-\frac{2}{5}}\textit{Ra})^{\frac{5}{13}}$, $\textit{Nu} \sim \textit{Ra}^{\frac{5}{12}}$, $\textit{Nu} \sim \textit{Pr}^{-\frac{1}{6}} (L_s^{-\frac{4}{3}}\textit{Ra})^{\frac{1}{2}}$ and $\textit{Nu} \sim \textit{Pr}^{-\frac{1}{6}} (L_s^{-\frac{1}{3}}\textit{Ra})^{\frac{1}{2}}$</description>

      <title>Integrable Semi-Discretization for a Modified Camassa-Holm Equation with Cubic Nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18372v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the present paper, an integrable semi-discretization of the modified Camassa-Holm (mCH) equation with cubic nonlinearity is presented. The key points of the construction are based on the discrete Kadomtsev-Petviashvili (KP) equation and appropriate definition of discrete reciprocal transformations. First, we demonstrate that these bilinear equations and their determinant solutions can be derived from the discrete KP equation through Miwa transformation and some reductions. Then, by scrutinizing the reduction process, we obtain a set of semi-discrete bilinear equations and their general soliton solutions in the Gram-type determinant form. Finally, we obtain an integrable semi-discrete analog of the mCH equation by introducing dependent variables and discrete reciprocal transformation. It is also shown that the semi-discrete mCH equation converges to the continuous one in the continuum limit.</description>

      <title>Spectrum-preserving deformations of integrable spin chains with open boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17171v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discover a family of local deformations that leave part of the spectrum intact for strongly interacting and exactly solvable quantum many-body systems. Since the deformation preserves the Bethe Ansatz equations (BAE), it is dubbed the iso-BAE flow. Although all theories on the flow share the same BAE, the spectra are different. Part of the spectrum remains intact along the whole flow. Such states are protected by an emergent symmetry. The remaining parts of the spectrum change continuously along the flow and are doubly degenerate for even length spin chains. For odd length chains, the deformed spectrum also comprises doubly degenerate pairs apart from the sector with magnon number $(L+1)/2$, where $L$ is the length of the spin chain. We discuss the iso-BAE flow for the ${\rm XXX}_{1/2}$ model in detail and show that the iso-BAE flows exist for more general models including $q$-deformed XXZ as well as higher spin ${\rm XXX}_{s}$ spin chains.</description>

      <title>Discrete trace formulas and holomorphic functional calculus for the adjacency matrix of regular graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17505v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the holomorphic functional calculus for the adjacency matrices on possibly infinite regular graphs. More precisely, we show an expansion of $h(A)$ in terms of non-backtracking matrices, where $A$ is the adjacency matrix and $h$ is a holomorphic function on the interior of a particular ellipse containing the spectrum of $A$. Furthermore, we prove related trace formulas for regular graphs. Our results provide a simple and direct approach to the study of resolvent, heat and Schr\"odinger equations, Ihara zeta functions, and combinatorial enumeration problems on regular graphs.</description>

      <title>Some properties of a non-hydrostatic stochastic oceanic primitive equations model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02289v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study how relaxing the classical hydrostatic balance hypothesis affects theoretical aspects of the LU primitive equations well-posedness. We focus on models that sit between incompressible 3D LU Navier-Stokes equations and standard LU primitive equations, aiming for numerical manageability while capturing non-hydrostatic phenomena. Our main result concerns the well-posedness of a specific stochastic interpretation of the LU primitive equations. This holds with rigid-lid type boundary conditions, and when the horizontal component of noise is independent of z. In fact these conditions can be related to the dynamical regime in which the primitive equations remain valid. Moreover, under these conditions, we show that the LU primitive equations solution tends toward the one of the deterministic primitive equations for a vanishing noise, thus providing a physical coherence to the LU stochastic model.</description>

      <title>A polynomial-time classical algorithm for noisy quantum circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12768v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a polynomial-time classical algorithm for noisy quantum circuits. The algorithm computes the expectation value of any observable for any circuit, with a small average error over input states drawn from an ensemble (e.g. the computational basis). Our approach is based upon the intuition that noise exponentially damps non-local correlations relative to local correlations. This enables one to classically simulate a noisy quantum circuit by only keeping track of the dynamics of local quantum information. Our algorithm also enables sampling from the output distribution of a circuit in quasi-polynomial time, so long as the distribution anti-concentrates. A number of practical implications are discussed, including a fundamental limit on the efficacy of noise mitigation strategies: for constant noise rates, any quantum circuit for which error mitigation is efficient on most input states, is also classically simulable on most input states.</description>

      <title>Using Symmetries to Investigate the Complete Integrability, Solitary Wave Solutions and Solitons of the Gardner Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07973v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using a scaling symmetry, it is shown how to compute polynomial conservation laws, generalized symmetries, recursion operators, Lax pairs, and bilinear forms of polynomial nonlinear partial differential equations thereby establishing their complete integrability. The Gardner equation is chosen as the key example for it comprises both the Korteweg-de Vries and modified Korteweg-de Vries (mKdV) equations. The Gardner and Miura transformations which connect these equations are also computed using the concept of scaling homogeneity. Exact solitary wave solutions and solitons of the Gardner equation are derived using Hirota's method and other direct methods. The nature of these solutions depends on the sign of the cubic term in the Gardner equation and the underlying mKdV equation. It is shown that flat (table-top) waves of large amplitude only occur when the sign of the cubic nonlinearity is negative (defocusing case) whereas the focusing Gardner equation has the standard elastically colliding solitons. The paper's aim is to provide a review of integrability properties and solutions of the Gardner equation and illustrate the applicability of the scaling symmetry approach. The methods and algorithms used in this paper have been implemented in Mathematica but can be adapted for major computer algebra systems.</description>

Abstract: This short paper illustrates the general framework introduced in the paper "Not too little discs" (arXiv:2407.18192), joint with Victor Carmona, on yet another one dimensional example.

      <title>On estimates of trace-norm distance between quantum Gaussian states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11400v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the paper of F.A. Mele, A.A. Mele, L. Bittel, J. Eisert, V. Giovannetti, L. Lami, L. Leone, S.F.E. Oliviero, ArXiv:2405.01431, estimates for the trace-norm distance between two quantum Gaussian states in terms of the mean vectors and covariance matrices were derived and used to evaluate the number of elements in the $\varepsilon -$net in the set of energy-constrained Gaussian states. In the present paper we obtain different estimates; our proof is based on a fidelity-like quantity which we call states overlap, and is more straightforward leading to estimates which are sometimes even more stringent, especially in the cases of pure or gauge-invariant states. They do not depend on number of modes and hence can be extended to the case of bosonic field with infinite number of modes. These derivations are not aimed to replace the useful inequalities from ArXiv:2405.01431; they just show an alternative approach to the problem leading to different results. In the Appendix we briefly recall our results concerning estimates of the overlap for general fermionic Gaussian states of CAR. The problem studied in this paper can be considered as a noncommutative analog of estimation of the total variance distance between Gaussian probability distributions in the classical probability theory.</description>

      <title>Domain Decomposition-based coupling of Operator Inference reduced order models via the Schwarz alternating method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01433v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents and evaluates an approach for coupling together subdomain-local reduced order models (ROMs) constructed via non-intrusive operator inference (OpInf) with each other and with subdomain-local full order models (FOMs), following a domain decomposition of the spatial geometry on which a given partial differential equation (PDE) is posed. Joining subdomain-local models is accomplished using the overlapping Schwarz alternating method, a minimally-intrusive multiscale coupling technique that works by transforming a monolithic problem into a sequence of subdomain-local problems, which communicate through transmission boundary conditions imposed on the subdomain interfaces. After formulating the overlapping Schwarz alternating method for OpInf ROMs, termed OpInf-Schwarz, we evaluate the method's accuracy and efficiency on several test cases involving the heat equation in two spatial dimensions. We demonstrate that the method is capable of coupling together arbitrary combinations of OpInf ROMs and FOMs, and that speed-ups over a monolithic FOM are possible when performing OpInf ROM coupling.</description>

      <title>Algebraic classification of the gravitational field in general metric-affine geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07153v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the algebraic classification of the gravitational field in four-dimensional general metric-affine geometries, thus extending the current results of the literature in the particular framework of Weyl-Cartan geometry by the presence of the traceless nonmetricity tensor. This quantity switches on four of the eleven fundamental parts of the irreducible representation of the curvature tensor under the pseudo-orthogonal group, in such a way that three of them present similar algebraic types as the ones obtained in Weyl-Cartan geometry, whereas the remaining one includes thirty independent components and gives rise to a new algebraic classification. The latter is derived by means of its principal null directions and their levels of alignment, obtaining a total number of sixteen main algebraic types, which can be split into many subtypes. As an immediate application, we determine the algebraic types of the broadest family of static and spherically symmetric black hole solutions with spin, dilation and shear charges in Metric-Affine Gravity.</description>

      <title>The exact quantum chromatic number of Hadamard graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00042v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the exact value of the quantum chromatic numbers of Hadamard graphs of order $n=2^N$ for $N$ a multiple of $4$ using the upper bound derived by Avis, Hasegawa, Kikuchi, and Sasaki, as well as an application of the Hoffman-like lower bound of Elphick and Wocjan that was generalized by Ganesan for quantum graphs. As opposed to prior computations for the lower bound, our approach uses Ito's results on conjugacy class graphs allowing us to also find bounds on the quantum chromatic numbers of products of Hadamard graphs. In particular, we also compute the exact quantum chromatic number of the categorical product of Hadamard graphs.</description>
