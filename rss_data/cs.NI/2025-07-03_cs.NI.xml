      <title>A Full-Stack Platform Architecture for Self-Organised Social Coordination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To mitigate the restrictive centralising and monopolistic tendencies of platformisation, we aim to empower local communities by democratising platforms for self-organised social coordination. Our approach is to develop an open-source, full-stack architecture for platform development that supports ease of distribution and cloning, generativity, and a variety of hosting options. The architecture consists of a meta-platform that is used to instantiate a base platform with supporting libraries for generic functions, and plugins (intended to be supplied by third parties) for customisation of application-specification functionality for self-organised social coordination. Associated developer- and user-oriented toolchains support the instantiation and customisation of a platform in a two-stage process. This is demonstrated through the proof-of-concept implementation of two case studies: a platform for regular sporting association, and a platform for collective group study. We conclude by arguing that self-organisation at the application layer can be achieved by the specific supporting functionality of a full-stack architecture with complimentary developer and user toolchains.</description>

      <title>Fluid Aerial Networks: UAV Rotation for Inter-Cell Interference Mitigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid development of aerial infrastructure, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) that function as aerial base stations (ABSs) extend terrestrial network services into the sky, enabling on-demand connectivity and enhancing emergency communication capabilities in cellular networks by leveraging the flexibility and mobility of UAVs. In such a UAV-assisted network, this paper investigates position-based beamforming between ABSs and ground users (GUs). To mitigate inter-cell interference, we propose a novel fluid aerial network that leverages ABS rotation to increase multi-cell capacity and overall network efficiency. Specifically, considering the line-of-sight channel model, the spatial beamforming weights are determined by the orientation angles of the GUs. In this direction, we examine the beamforming gain of a two-dimensional multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) array at various ground positions, revealing that ABS rotation significantly affects multi-user channel correlation and inter-cell interference. Based on these findings, we propose an alternative low-complexity algorithm to design the optimal rotation angle for ABSs, aiming to reduce inter-cell interference and thus maximize the sum rate of multi-cell systems. In simulations, exhaustive search serves as a benchmark to validate the optimization performance of the proposed sequential ABS rotation scheme. Moreover, simulation results demonstrate that, in interference-limited regions, the proposed ABS rotation paradigm can significantly reduce inter-cell interference in terrestrial networks and improve the multi-cell sum rate by approximately 10\% compared to fixed-direction ABSs without rotation.</description>

      <title>Multi-User Generative Semantic Communication with Intent-Aware Semantic-Splitting Multiple Access</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the booming development of generative artificial intelligence (GAI), semantic communication (SemCom) has emerged as a new paradigm for reliable and efficient communication. This paper considers a multi-user downlink SemCom system, using vehicular networks as the representative scenario for multi-user content dissemination. To address diverse yet overlapping user demands, we propose a multi-user Generative SemCom-enhanced intent-aware semantic-splitting multiple access (SS-MGSC) framework. In the framework, we construct an intent-aware shared knowledge base (SKB) that incorporates prior knowledge of semantic information (SI) and user-specific preferences. Then, we designate the common SI as a one-hot semantic map that is broadcast to all users, while the private SI is delivered as personalized text for each user. On the receiver side, a diffusion model enhanced with ControlNet is adopted to generate high-quality personalized images. To capture both semantic relevance and perceptual similarity, we design a novel semantic efficiency score (SES) metric as the optimization objective. Building on this, we formulate a joint optimization problem for multi-user semantic extraction and beamforming, solved using a reinforcement learning-based algorithm due to its robustness in high-dimensional settings. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.</description>

      <title>MmBack: Clock-free Multi-Sensor Backscatter with Synchronous Acquisition and Multiplexing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Backscatter tags provide a low-power solution for sensor applications, yet many real-world scenarios require multiple sensors-often of different types-for complex sensing tasks. However, existing designs support only a single sensor per tag, increasing spatial overhead. State-of-the-art approaches to multiplexing multiple sensor streams on a single tag rely on onboard clocks or multiple modulation chains, which add cost, enlarge form factor, and remain prone to timing drift-disrupting synchronization across sensors.
  We present mmBack, a low-power, clock-free backscatter tag that enables synchronous multi-sensor data acquisition and multiplexing over a single modulation chain. mmBack synchronizes sensor inputs in parallel using a shared reference signal extracted from ambient RF excitation, eliminating the need for an onboard timing source. To efficiently multiplex sensor data, mmBack designs a voltage-division scheme to multiplex multiple sensor inputs as backscatter frequency shifts through a single oscillator and RF switch. At the receiver, mmBack develops a frequency tracking algorithm and a finite-state machine for accurate demultiplexing. mmBack's ASIC design consumes 25.56uW, while its prototype supports 5 concurrent sensor streams with bandwidths of up to 5kHz and 3 concurrent sensor streams with bandwidth of up to 18kHz. Evaluation shows that mmBack achieves an average SNR surpassing 15dB in signal reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Frontiers of Generative AI for Network Optimization: Theories, Limits, and Visions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While interest in the application of generative AI (GenAI) in network optimization has surged in recent years, its rapid progress has often overshadowed critical limitations intrinsic to generative models that remain insufficiently examined in existing literature. This survey provides a comprehensive review and critical analysis of GenAI in network optimization. We focus on the two dominant paradigms of GenAI including generative diffusion models (GDMs) and large pre-trained models (LPTMs), and organize our discussion around a categorization we introduce, dividing network optimization problems into two primary formulations: one-shot optimization and Markov decision process (MDP). We first trace key works, including foundational contributions from the AI community, and categorize current efforts in network optimization. We also review frontier applications of GDMs and LPTMs in other networking tasks, providing additional context. Furthermore, we present theoretical generalization bounds for GDMs in both one-shot and MDP settings, offering insights into the fundamental factors affecting model performance. Most importantly, we reflect on the overestimated perception of GenAI's general capabilities and caution against the all-in-one illusion it may convey. We highlight critical limitations, including difficulties in constraint satisfying, limited concept understanding, and the inherent probabilistic nature of outputs. We also propose key future directions, such as bridging the gap between generation and optimization. Although they are increasingly integrated in implementations, they differ fundamentally in both objectives and underlying mechanisms, necessitating a deeper understanding of their theoretical connections. Ultimately, this survey aims to provide a structured overview and a deeper insight into the strengths, limitations, and potential of GenAI in network optimization.</description>

      <title>On the Effect of Ruleset Tuning and Data Imbalance on Explainable Network Security Alert Classifications: a Case-Study on DeepCASE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automation in Security Operations Centers (SOCs) plays a prominent role in alert classification and incident escalation. However, automated methods must be robust in the presence of imbalanced input data, which can negatively affect performance. Additionally, automated methods should make explainable decisions. In this work, we evaluate the effect of label imbalance on the classification of network intrusion alerts. As our use-case we employ DeepCASE, the state-of-the-art method for automated alert classification. We show that label imbalance impacts both classification performance and correctness of the classification explanations offered by DeepCASE. We conclude tuning the detection rules used in SOCs can significantly reduce imbalance and may benefit the performance and explainability offered by alert post-processing methods such as DeepCASE. Therefore, our findings suggest that traditional methods to improve the quality of input data can benefit automation.</description>

      <title>Resilient-By-Design: A Resiliency Framework for Future Wireless Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23203v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Our future society will be increasingly digitalized, hyper-connected and globally data driven. The sixth generation (6G) and beyond 6G wireless networks are expected to bridge the digital and physical worlds by providing wireless connectivity as a service to different vertical sectors, making the society increasingly dependent on wireless networks. Thus, any disruption to these networks would have a significant impact with far-reaching consequences. Disruptions can occur for a variety of reasons, including planned outages, natural disasters, and deliberate cybersecurity attacks. Resilience against such disruptions is expected to be one of the most important defining features of future wireless networks. This paper first discusses a generic framework for designing future resilient wireless networks. A novel resilient-by-design framework consisting of four building blocks, namely predict, preempt, protect and progress, is then proposed as a specific example.</description>

      <title>Wireless Network Topology Inference: A Markov Chains Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17532v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address the problem of inferring the topology of a wireless network using limited observational data. Specifically, we assume that we can detect when a node is transmitting, but no further information regarding the transmission is available. We propose a novel network estimation procedure grounded in the following abstract problem: estimating the parameters of a finite discrete-time Markov chain by observing, at each time step, which states are visited by multiple ``anonymous'' copies of the chain. We develop a consistent estimator that approximates the transition matrix of the chain in the operator norm, with the number of required samples scaling roughly linearly with the size of the state space. Applying this estimation procedure to wireless networks, our numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed method accurately infers network topology across a wide range of parameters, consistently outperforming transfer entropy, particularly under conditions of high network congestion.</description>

      <title>DRST: a Non-Intrusive Framework for Performance Analysis in Softwarized Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17658v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The last decade has witnessed the proliferation of network function virtualization (NFV) in the telco industry, thanks to its unparalleled flexibility, scalability, and cost-effectiveness. However, as the NFV infrastructure is shared by virtual network functions (VNFs), sporadic resource contentions are inevitable. Such contention makes it extremely challenging to guarantee the performance of the provisioned network services, especially in high-speed regimes (e.g., Gigabit Ethernet). Existing solutions typically rely on direct traffic analysis (e.g., packet- or flow-level measurements) to detect performance degradation and identify bottlenecks, which is not always applicable due to significant integration overhead and system-level constraints. This paper complements existing solutions with a lightweight, non-intrusive framework for online performance inference that easily adapts to drift (i.e., a change over time of the actual state of our system). Instead of direct data-plane collection, we reuse hardware features in the underlying NFV infrastructure, introducing negligible interference in the data-plane. Our Drift-Resilient and Self-Tuning (DRST) framework can be integrated into existing NFV systems with minimal engineering effort and operate without the need for predefined traffic models or VNF-specific customization. DRST is deployed via a lightweight MLOps pipeline that automates the adaptation under runtime drift. We show how DRST can deliver accurate performance inference or diagnose run-time bottlenecks, as demonstrated through a comprehensive evaluation across diverse NFV scenarios.</description>

      <title>QUIC Delay Control: an implementation of congestion and delay control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00896v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new congestion and delay control algorithm named QUIC Delay Control (QUIC-DC) is proposed for controlling not only congestion but also the queueing delay encountered along the forward communication path. The core idea is to estimate the one-way queueing delay of a connection to trigger an early reaction to congestion. This idea, along with a the TCP Westwood+ congestion control algorithm, has been implemented in QUIC-DC and compared with QUIC Cubic, BBRv2, NewReno, Westwood+. The results obtained in the emulated and real network environments show that QUIC-DC can significantly reduce packet losses along with end-to-end communication delays, while preserving network utilization, features that are both very useful for real-time applications.</description>

      <title>Efficient Split Federated Learning for Large Language Models over Communication Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14667v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fine-tuning pre-trained large language models (LLMs) in a distributed manner poses significant challenges on resource-constrained edge networks. To address this challenge, we propose SflLLM, a novel framework that integrates split federated learning with parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques. By leveraging model splitting and low-rank adaptation (LoRA), SflLLM reduces the computational burden on edge devices. Furthermore, the introduction of a federated server facilitates parallel training and enhances data privacy. To accommodate heterogeneous communication conditions and diverse computational capabilities of edge devices, as well as the impact of LoRA rank selection on model convergence and training cost, we formulate a joint optimization problem of both communication and computation resource. The formulated problem jointly optimizes subchannel allocation, power control, model splitting point selection, and LoRA rank configuration, aimed at minimizing total training delay. An iterative optimization algorithm is proposed to solve this problem efficiently. Specifically, a greedy heuristic is employed for subchannel allocation, the power control subproblem is reformulated as a convex optimization problem using auxiliary variables, and an exhaustive search is adopted for optimal split position and rank selection. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed SflLLM framework achieves comparable model accuracy while significantly reducing client-side computational requirements. Furthermore, the proposed resource allocation scheme and adaptive LoRA rank selection strategy notably reduce the training latency compared to conventional approaches.</description>
