      <title>Optimizing and reducing stochastic resonance by noise color in globally coupled bistable systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19696v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the collective signal response of two typical nonlinear dynamical models, the mean-field coupled overdamped bistable oscillators and the underdamped Duffing oscillators, with respect to both the additive Ornstein-Uhlenbeck noise and the weak periodical stimulus. Based on the linear response theory, we theoretically derive the dependences of the ensemble signal response on the noise intensity and driving frequency of both systems. Furthermore, we theoretically demonstrate that the noise color monotonically weakens the strength of stochastic resonance in the overdamped situation, but nonmonotonically strengthens it in the underdamped counterpart. Such a result goes against the conventional wisdom that the color of the additive noise impairs the magnitude of stochastic resonance. Finally, we perform the numerical integration to verify our theoretical results and discuss potential connections with the functional significance of 1/f noise.</description>

      <title>Controller for rejection of the first harmonic in periodic signal with uncertain delay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11731v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The plant (system to be controlled) is disturbed by an external periodic signal containing a broad spectrum of Fourier harmonics. The first Fourier harmonic (sine-type signal) is assumed to be undesirable and should be removed by a control force, while other harmonics should be preserved without distortion. Because the measured plant data has an unknown amount of time delay (dead time) and the sensitivity of the plant to external force is unknown, thus the amplitude and the phase of an anti-sine control force are also unknown. Based on an internal model principle, we developed a feedback controller described as a linear time-invariant system that can remove the first harmonic from the plant's output by constantly adjusting its parameters of control force. That type of controller was requested to extend further the capabilities of a newly developed high-speed large-area rotational scanning atomic force microscopy technique where the sample is rotated, and a tilt angle between the normal of the sample surface and the axis of rotation produces the parasitic first Fourier harmonic which significantly limits the scanning area.</description>

      <title>Reachability in Restricted Chemical Reaction Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.12603v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The popularity of molecular computation has given rise to several models of abstraction, one of the more recent ones being Chemical Reaction Networks (CRNs). These are equivalent to other popular computational models, such as Vector Addition Systems and Petri-Nets, and restricted versions are equivalent to Population Protocols. This paper continues the work on core \emph{reachability} questions related to Chemical Reaction Networks; given two configurations, can one reach the other according to the system's rules? With no restrictions, reachability was recently shown to be Ackermann-complete, which resolved a decades-old problem.
  In this work, we fully characterize monotone reachability problems based on various restrictions such as the allowed rule size, the number of rules that may create a species ($k$-source), the number of rules that may consume a species ($k$-consuming), the volume, and whether the rules have an acyclic production order (\emph{feed-forward}). We show PSPACE-completeness of reachability with only bimolecular reactions in two-source and two-consuming rules. This proves hardness of reachability in a restricted form of Population Protocols. This is accomplished using new techniques within the motion planning framework.
  We give several important results for feed-forward CRNs, where rules are single-source or single-consuming. We show that reachability is solvable in polynomial time as long as the system does not contain special \emph{void} or \emph{autogenesis} rules. We then fully characterize all systems of this type and show that with void/autogenesis rules, or more than one source and one consuming, the problems become NP-complete. Finally, we show several interesting special cases of CRNs based on these restrictions or slight relaxations and note future significant open questions related to this taxonomy.</description>
