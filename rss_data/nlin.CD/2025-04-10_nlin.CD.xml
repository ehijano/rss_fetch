      <title>PT -symmetry breaking and universal spectral statistics in quantum kicked rotors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20071v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the spontaneous parity-time (PT )-symmetry breaking and spectral properties of a PT symmetric quantum kicked rotor under resonance conditions. At resonance, the QKR reduces to a finite-dimensional system. In the localized regime, we find that increasing the non-Hermitian parameter always induces a transition from a phase where the states exhibit PT symmetry to one where PT symmetry is spontaneously broken. In contrast, in the delocalized regime, the existence of such a transition depends on whether the reduced system is PT symmetric. If the reduced system is not PT symmetric, PT symmetry remains in the broken phase regardless of the non-Hermitian parameter. We further analyze the spectral statistics of the system in the delocalized regime. For real energy spectra, the level-spacing distribution transitions from Wigner-Dyson statistics, associated with the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble, to Poisson statistics as the non-Hermitian parameter increases, with the intermediate regime well described by the Brody distribution. For complex spectra, the level-spacing ratios and distributions are governed by time-reversal symmetry. The spectral statistics align with predictions for non-Hermitian random matrix ensembles in classes AI{\dag} and A, depending on the presence or absence of time-reversal symmetry. Our results provide insights into the spectral characteristics of non-Hermitian quantum chaotic systems and their connection to PT symmetry.</description>

      <title>Deviations from Random Matrix Theory in quantum chaotic systems: A Perspective from Observable Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16885v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study deviations from random matrix theory (RMT) in quantum chaotic systems from a perspective of observable properties. Specifically, we focus on the envelope function of the off-diagonal elements of few-body observables written in the eigenbasis of a quantum chaotic manybody system, as introduced in the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis ansatz. Our objective is to understand the origin of the nontrivial structure of the envelope function in real systems and its connection to the distance of the system from a fully random system described by RMT. To this end, we introduce a method to systematically induce randomness into a real model, which eventually transitions into a random matrix model. Our numerical simulations of a defect Ising model show that the nontrivial structure of the envelope function of local spins becomes less pronounced as the randomness of the system increase, eventually disappearing when the system becomes fully random. Our results imply that the structure of the envelope function of few-body observables is closely related to the randomness of the system, which can be used to characterize the deviation from random matrix theory.</description>
