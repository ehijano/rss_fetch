      <title>Existence and uniqueness of $L^1$-solutions to time-fractional nonlinear diffusion equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the global existence and uniqueness of $L^1$-solutions to the Cauchy problem for time-fractional porous medium type nonlinear diffusion equations. Furthermore, we give the mass conservation law for $L^1$-solutions to time-fractional fast diffusion equations, and prove that the finite-time extinction does not occur for any nonnegative $L^1$-solutions.</description>

      <title>Linear stability of the first bifurcation in a tumor growth free boundary problem via local bifurcation structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a 3-dimensional free boundary problem modeling tumor growth with the Robin boundary condition. The system involves a positive parameter $\mu$ which reflects the intensity of tumor aggressiveness. Huang, Zhang and Hu [Nonlinear Anal. Real World Appl. 2017(35), 483-502] have shown that for each $\mu_n$ ($n$ even) in a strictly increasing sequence $\{ \mu_n \}(n\geq 2)$, there exists a stationary bifurcation solution $(\sigma_n(\varepsilon),p_n(\varepsilon),r_n(\varepsilon))$ with $\mu = \mu_n(\varepsilon)$ bifurcating from $\mu_n$. We first derive that the bifurcation curve $(r_2(\varepsilon),\mu_2(\varepsilon))$ exhibits a transcritical bifurcation with $\mu_2'(0)&lt;0$. Moreover, we show that the stationary bifurcation solution $(\sigma_2(\varepsilon),p_2(\varepsilon),r_2(\varepsilon))$ is linearly unstable for small $|\varepsilon|$ under non-radially symmetric perturbations. In contrast to the linear stability of the radially symmetric stationary solution, the lack of explicit expressions for bifurcation solutions adds great difficulty in analyzing their linear stability. The novelty of this paper lies in the use of the bifurcation curve's structure to overcome the above difficulties. Moreover, this linear stability result is not established using the standard method, due to an eight-dimensional generalized kernel at eigenvalue 0 for the linearized operator.</description>

      <title>Local smoothing estimates for bilinear Fourier integral operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formulate a local smoothing conjecture for bilinear Fourier integral operators in every dimension $d \ge 2,$ derived from the celebrated linear case due to Sogge, which we refer to as the \emph{bilinear smoothing conjecture}. We show that the linear local smoothing conjecture implies this bilinear version. As a consequence of our approach and due to the recent progress on the subject, we establish local smoothing estimates for Fourier integral operators in dimension $d=2,$ that is, on $\mathbb{R}^2_x \times \mathbb{R}_t$. Also, a partial progress is presented for the high-dimensional case $d\geq 3.$ In particular, our method allows us to deduce that the bilinear local smoothing conjecture holds for all odd dimensions $d$.</description>

      <title>Global regularity for the Navier-Stokes equations with application to global solvability for the Euler equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that any Leray-Hopf weak solution to the $d$-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations $(d\geq 3)$ with initial values $u_0\in H^{s}(\mathbb R^d)$, $s\geq -1+\frac{d}{2}$, belongs to $L^\infty(0,\infty; H^{s}(\mathbb R^d))$ and thus it is globally regular. For the proof, first, we construct a supercritical space which has very sparse inverse logarithmic weight in the frequency domain, compared to the critical homogeneous Sobolev $\dot{H}^{-1+d/2}$-norm. Then we obtain the energy estimates of high frequency parts of the solution which involve the supercritical norm as a factor of the upper bounds. Finally, we superpose the energy norm of high frequency parts of the solution to get estimates of the critical and subcritical norms independent of the viscosity coefficient for the weak solution via the re-scaling argument.</description>

      <title>Riemann-Hilbert approach for the nonlocal modified Korteweg-de Vries equation with a step-like oscillating background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work focuses on the Cauchy problem for the nonlocal modified Korteweg-de Vries equation $$ u_t(x,t)+6u(x,t)u(-x,-t)u_x(x,t)+u_{xxx}(x,t)=0, $$ with the oscillating step-like boundary conditions: $u(x,t)\to 0$ as $x\to-\infty$ and $u(x,t)\backsimeq A\cos(2Bx+8B^3t)$ as $x\to\infty$, where $A,B&gt;0$ are arbitrary constants. The main goal is to develop the Riemann-Hilbert formalism for this problem, paying a particular attention to the case of the ``pure oscillating step'' initial data, that is $u(x,0)=0$ for $x&lt;0$ and $u(x,0)=A\cos(2Bx)$ for $x\geq0$. Also, we derive three new families of two-soliton solutions, which correspond to the values of $A$ and $B$ satisfying $B&lt;\frac{A}{4}$, $B&gt;\frac{A}{4}$, and $B=\frac{A}{4}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.15847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The first author established in [8] a quantitative Borg-Levinson theorem for the Schr\"odinger operator with unbounded potential. In the present work, we extend the results in [8] to the magnetic Schr\"odinger operator. We discuss both the isotropic and anisotropic cases. We establish H\"older stability inequalities of determining the electrical potential or magnetic field from the corresponding boundary spectral data.</description>

      <title>Recovery of nonlinear material parameters in a quasilinear Lam\'e system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the inverse problem of determining nonlinear elastic material parameters from boundary stress measurements corresponding to prescribed boundary displacements. The material law is described by a nonlinear, space-independent elastic tensor depending on both the displacement and the strain, and gives rise to a general class of quasilinear Lam\'e systems. We prove the unique and stable recovery of a wide class of space-independent nonlinear elastic tensors, including the identification of two nonlinear isotropic Lam\'e moduli as well as certain anisotropic tensors. The boundary measurements are assumed to be available at a finite number of boundary points and, in the isotropic case, at a single point. Moreover, the measurements are generated by boundary displacements belonging to an explicit class of affine functions. The analysis is based on structural properties of nonlinear Lam\'e systems, including asymptotic expansions of the boundary stress and tensorial calculus.</description>

      <title>Convergence to shock profiles for Burgers equation with singular fast-diffusion and boundary effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the asymptotic stability of viscous shock profile for the Burgers equation $u_t +f(u)_x = (\frac{u_{x}}{u^{1-m}})_x$ on the half-space $(0,+\infty)$, subject to the boundary conditions $u|_{x=0}=u_-&gt;0$ and $u|_{x=+\infty}=0$. Here, the parameter $\frac{1}{2}&lt;m&lt;1$ measures the strength of fast diffusion. A key challenge arises from the pronounced singularity in the diffusivity $\left(\frac{u_x}{u^{1-m}} \right)_x$ at $u=0$ and the boundary layer. We demonstrate that the long-time behavior of $u$ converges to a shifted shock profile $U(x-st-d(t))$, where $d(t)$ is governed by the boundary layer dynamics at $x=0$ and driven by the initial data $u(x,0)$. To overcome the singularity from fast diffusion compounded by the bad effect of boundary layer for wave stability, some new techniques for weighted energy estimates are introduced artfully.</description>

      <title>A new proof of unboundedness of Riesz operator in $L^\infty$ and applications to mild ill-posedness in $W^{1,\infty}$ of the Euler type equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we first present a new and simple proof of unboundedness of Riesz operator in $L^\infty$ and then establish the mild ill-posedness in $W^{1,\infty}$ of 3D rotating Euler equations and 2D Euler equations with partial damping. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first one addressing the ill-posedness issue on the rotating Euler equations in $W^{1,\infty}$ without the vorticity formulation. As a further application, we prove the instability of perturbations for the 2D surface quasi-geostrophic equation and porous medium system in $W^{1,\infty}$.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Inviscid Fluid Dynamics and Aero-acoustics on a Sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-time fluid and aeroacoustic simulation on complex surfaces can have interactive applications - from globe-based weather visualizations to immersive computer games with physically accurate wind and sound. However, conventional grid-based solvers struggle with numerical instability near surface singularities, and mesh-based approaches lack a straightforward path to solving partial differential equations (PDEs) with stable, high-order accuracy.
  Our model presents a unified framework for real-time inviscid fluid simulation and aeroacoustics on spherical surfaces with embedded obstacles, combining the Closest Point Method (CPM), projection-based Navier-Stokes solvers, and the Ffowcs Williams-Hawkings (FWH) analogy. CPM enables surface PDEs to be solved in a Cartesian embedding without parametrization by restricting computation to a narrow band around the sphere. Each band point is mapped to its nearest surface location, where band operators project results onto the local tangent space. Surface obstacles are modelled with signed distance functions (SDFs), enforcing no-slip velocity constraints and Bernoulli-based pressure adjustments for consistent real-world boundary interactions. Aeroacoustic sources are computed directly from surface pressure force derivatives and mapped to real-time audio via frequency and amplitude modulation with artifact-suppressing hysteresis smoothing.
  Our findings from this model simulate the behaviour of inviscid fluid on spherical surfaces while generating sound using the pressure of the fluid flowing on the surface. This approach gives results that offer stability, geometric consistency, and support applications in scientific visualization, virtual reality, and educational tools.</description>

      <title>A sharp criterion and complete classification of global-in-time solutions and finite time blow-up of solutions to a chemotaxis system in supercritical dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the chemotaxis system with indirect signal production in the whole space, \begin{equation}\label{abst:p}\tag{$\star$} \begin{cases} u_t = \Delta u - \nabla \cdot (u\nabla v),\\ 0 = \Delta v + w,\\ w_t = \Delta w + u \end{cases} \end{equation} with emphasis on supercritical dimensions. In contrast to the classical parabolic-elliptic Keller--Segel system, where the analysis can be reduced to a single equation, the above system is essentially parabolic-parabolic and does not admit such a reduction. In this paper, we establish a sharp threshold phenomenon separating global-in-time existence from finite time blow-up in terms of scaling-critical Morrey norms of the initial data. In particular, we prove the existence of singular stationary solutions and show that their Morrey norm values serve as the critical thresholds determining the long-time behavior of solutions. Consequently, we identify new critical exponents at which the long-time behavior of solutions changes. This yields a complete classification of the long-time behavior of solutions, providing the first such results for the essentially parabolic-parabolic chemotaxis system \eqref{abst:p} in supercritical dimensions.</description>

      <title>The Recovery of Semilinear Potentials Satisfying Null Conditions From Scattering Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct oscillatory solutions of fully semilinear wave equations in Minkowski space satisfying a null condition of the form $$\square u:=(-\partial_{x_0}^2 +\sum_{j=1}^n \partial_{x_j}^2 )u= q(x,u)((\partial_{x_0}u)^2-|\nabla_{x'}u|^2),$$ $$x=(x_0,x'), \;\ x'=(x_1,\ldots, x_n) \text{ and } x_0=t \text{ is the time variable,}$$ on an interval $x_0\in [-T,T]$, $T&lt;\infty$ arbitrary, which consist of the superposition of a non-oscillatory background solution and a single phase train of highly oscillatory waves of wave length $h\ll1$ and amplitudes given by powers of $h$; the waves interact with the nonlinearity and we measure the response $u(x_0,x')|_{x_0=T'}$ at a fixed time $x_0=T'&lt;T$.
  We show that the coefficient of amplitude $h$ of the oscillatory part of the nonlinear geometric optics expansion of the solution determines the light-ray transform of a vector field associated with $q(x,u)$, which determines $q(x,u)$ uniquely in the maximal region determined by the data. Our methods also work for systems of semilinear wave equations satisfying null conditions, but in this paper we focus on the scalar case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.16053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the well-posedness of a non-linear heat equation with power nonlinearity with positive initial data on quantum Euclidean spaces. We prove a noncommutative analogue of the classical Fujita theorem by identifying the critical exponent separating finite-time blow-up from global existence for small initial data. Moreover, we establish a fundamental inequality in general semifinite von Neumann algebras that is of independent interest and plays a crucial role in the study of global existence and local well-posedness of solutions of nonlinear equations in noncommutative setting.</description>

      <title>Continuum limit of hypergraph $p$-Laplacian equations on point clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies a class of $p$-Laplacian equations on point clouds that arise from hypergraph learning in a semi-supervised setting. Under the assumption that the point clouds consist of independent random samples drawn from a bounded domain $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^d$, we investigate the asymptotic behavior of the solutions as the number of data points tends to infinity, with the number of labeled points remains fixed. We show, for any $p&gt;d$ in the viscosity solution framework, that the continuum limit is a weighted $p$-Laplacian equation subject to mixed Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions. The result provides a new discretization of the $p$-Laplacian on point clouds.</description>

      <title>Stability and Decay for the 2D Anisotropic Navier-Stokes Equations with Fractional Horizontal Dissipation on $\mathbb{R}^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stability problem for the 2D Navier-Stokes equations with dissipation in only one direction on $\mathbb R^2$ is not fully understood. This dissipation is in the intermediate regime between the fully dissipative Navier-Stokes and the inviscid Euler. Navier-Stokes solutions in $\mathbb R^2$ decay algebraically in time while Euler solutions can grow rather rapidly in time. This paper solves the fundamental stability and large-time behavior problem on the anisotropic Navier-Stokes with fractional dissipation $\Lambda_1^{2s}$ for all $0\leq s&lt;1$. The case $s=1$ corresponds to the standard one directional dissipation $\partial_1^2$. Different techniques are developed to treat different ranges of fractional exponents: $0\leq s\leq \frac34$, $\frac34&lt;s&lt;\frac{11}{12}$, and $\frac{11}{12} \leq s &lt;1$. The final range is the most difficult case, for which we introduce the spatial polynomial $A_2$ weights and exploit the boundedness of Riesz transforms on weighted $L^2$-spaces.</description>

      <title>On the Ginzburg-Landau approximation for quasilinear pattern forming reaction-diffusion-advection systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the Ginzburg-Landau equation correctly predicts the dynamics of quasilinear pattern-forming reaction-diffusion-advection systems, close to the first instability. We present a simple theorem which is easily applicable for such systems and relies on key maximal regularity results. The theorem is applied to the Gray-Scott-Klausmeier vegetation-water interaction model and its application to general reaction-diffusion-advection systems is discussed.</description>

      <title>On the dimension drop for harmonic measure on uniformly non-flat Ahlfors-David regular boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend earlier results of Azzam on the dimension drop of the harmonic measure for a domain $\Omega\subset \R^{n}$ with $n\geq 3$, with dimensional Ahlfors regular boundary $\partial\Omega$ of dimension $s$ with $n-1-\delta_0 \leq s\leq n-1$, that is uniformly non flat. Here $\delta_0$ is a small positive constant dependent on the parameters of the problem. Our novel construction relies on elementary geometric and potential theoretic considerations. We avoid the use of Riesz transforms and compactness arguments, and also give quantitative bounds on the $\delta_0$ parameter.</description>

      <title>Metric-uniform spectral inequality for the Laplacian on manifolds with bounded sectional curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a Riemannian manifold $M$ endowed with a smooth metric $g$ satisfying upper and lower sectional curvature bounds, we show an equivalence property between the $\mathrm{L}^2$ norm on $M$ and the $\mathrm{L}^2$ norm on subsets $\omega$ satisfying a thickness condition, for functions in the range of a spectral projector. The thickness condition is known to be optimal in this setting. The constant appearing in the equivalence of norms property depends only on the dimension of the manifold, curvature bounds, and frequency threshold of the spectral cutoff, but, crucially, not on the injectivity radius.</description>

      <title>The Pohozaev identity for the Spectral Fractional Laplacian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove a Pohozaev identity for the Spectral Fractional Laplacian (SFL). This identity allows us to establish non-existence results for the semilinear Dirichlet problem $(-\Delta|_{\Omega})^su = f(u)$ in star-shaped domains. The first such identity for non-local operators was established by Ros-Oton and Serra in 2014 for the Restricted Fractional Laplacian (RFL). However, the SFL differs fundamentally from the RFL, and the integration by parts strategy of Ros-Oton and Serra cannot be applied. Instead, we develop a novel spectral approach that exploits the underlying quadratic structure. Our main result expresses the identity as a Schur product of the classical Pohozaev quadratic form and a transition matrix that depends on the eigenvalues of the Laplacian and the fractional exponent.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.15768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a mathematical model of a compressible viscous fluid driven by stochastic forces under slip boundary conditions of friction type. We introduce a notion of a weak solution that is analytically and probabilistically consistent with this model. Our main result establishes the existence of such weak solutions under slip boundary conditions on bounded domains with $C^{2+\nu}$-boundary ($\nu&gt;0$). The proof of this result combines an extended version of the four-layer approximation scheme on the torus by Breit/Feireisl/Hofmanov\'{a} (2018) with the convex approximation method for absolute value functions studied by Ne\v{c}asov\'{a}/Ogorzaly/Scherz (2023).</description>

      <title>Sharp quantitative stability for the fractional Sobolev trace inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.01766v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the stability of fractional Sobolev trace inequality within both the functional and critical point settings.
  In the functional setting, we establish the following sharp estimate:
  $$C_{\mathrm{BE}}(n,m,\alpha)\inf_{v\in\mathcal{M}_{n,m,\alpha}}\left\Vert f-v\right\Vert_{D_\alpha(\mathbb{R}^n)}^2 \leq \left\Vert f\right\Vert_{D_\alpha(\mathbb{R}^n)}^2 - S(n,m,\alpha) \left\Vert\tau_mf\right\Vert_{L^{q}(\mathbb{R}^{n-m})}^2,$$
  where $0\leq m&lt; n$, $\frac{m}{2}&lt;\alpha&lt;\frac{n}{2}, q=\frac{2(n-m)}{n-2\alpha}$ and $\mathcal{M}_{n,m,\alpha}$ denotes the manifold of extremal functions. Additionally, We find an explicit bound for the stability constant $C_{\mathrm{BE}}$ and establish a compactness result ensuring the existence of minimizers.
  In the critical point setting, we investigate the validity of a sharp quantitative profile decomposition related to the Escobar trace inequality and establish a qualitative profile decomposition for the critical elliptic equation
  \begin{equation*}
  \Delta u= 0 \quad\text{in }\mathbb{R}_+^n,\quad\frac{\partial u}{\partial t}=-|u|^{\frac{2}{n-2}}u \quad\text{on }\partial\mathbb{R}_+^n.
  \end{equation*}
  We then derive the sharp stability estimate:
  $$
  C_{\mathrm{CP}}(n,\nu)d(u,\mathcal{M}_{\mathrm{E}}^{\nu})\leq \left\Vert \Delta u +|u|^{\frac{2}{n-2}}u\right\Vert_{H^{-1}(\mathbb{R}_+^n)},
  $$
  where $\nu=1,n\geq 3$ or $\nu\geq2,n=3$ and $\mathcal{M}_{\mathrm{E}}^\nu$ represents the manifold consisting of $\nu$ weak-interacting Escobar bubbles. Through some refined estimates, we also give a strict upper bound for $C_{\mathrm{CP}}(n,1)$, which is $\frac{2}{n+2}$.</description>

      <title>Classification of positive solutions to the H\'enon-Sobolev critical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.01784v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate positive solutions to the following H\'enon-Sobolev critical system: $$
  -\mathrm{div}(|x|^{-2a}\nabla u)=|x|^{-bp}|u|^{p-2}u+\nu\alpha|x|^{-bp}|u|^{\alpha-2}|v|^{\beta}u\quad\text{in }\mathbb{R}^n,$$
  $$ -\mathrm{div}(|x|^{-2a}\nabla v)=|x|^{-bp}|v|^{p-2}v+\nu\beta|x|^{-bp}|u|^{\alpha}|v|^{\beta-2}v\quad\text{in }\mathbb{R}^n,$$
  $$u,v\in D_a^{1,2}(\mathbb{R}^n),$$
  where $n\geq 3,-\infty&lt; a&lt;\frac{n-2}{2},a\leq b&lt;a+1,p=\frac{2n}{n-2+2(b-a)},\nu&gt;0$ and $\alpha&gt;1,\beta&gt;1$ satisfying $\alpha+\beta=p$. Our findings are divided into two parts, according to the sign of the parameter $a$.
  For $a\geq 0$, we demonstrate that any positive solution $(u,v)$ is synchronized, indicating that $u$ and $v$ are constant multiples of positive solutions to the decoupled H\'enon equation:
  \begin{equation*}
  -\mathrm{div}(|x|^{-2a}\nabla w)=|x|^{-bp}|w|^{p-2}w.
  \end{equation*}
  For $a&lt;0$ and $b&gt;a$, we characterize all nonnegative ground states. Additionally, we study the nondegeneracy of nonnegative synchronized solutions.
  This work also delves into some general $k$-coupled H\'enon-Sobolev critical systems.</description>

      <title>The stability on the Caffarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg and Hardy-type inequalities and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15735v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish several improved Caffarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg and Hardy-type inequalities. Our main results are divided into two parts.
  In the first part, we consider the following Caffarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg inequality: \begin{equation*}
  \left(\int_{\mathbb{R}^n}|x|^{-pa}|\nabla u|^pdx\right)^{\frac{1}{p}}\geq S(p,a,b)\left(\int_{\mathbb{R}^n}|x|^{-qb}|u|^qdx\right)^{\frac{1}{q}},\quad\forall\; u\in D_a^p(\mathbb{R}^n), \end{equation*} We establish gradient stability of this inequality in both functional and critical settings, and we derive some functional properties of the stability constant. Building on the gradient stability, we also obtain several refined Sobolev-type embeddings involving weak Lebesgue norms for functions supported in general domains.
  In the second part, we focus on various classical Hardy-type inequalities, including the standard Hardy inequality, the $L^p$-logarithmic Sobolev inequality with weights, the logarithmic Hardy inequality, the Hardy-Morrey inequality, the Hardy-Sobolev interpolation inequality, and the interpolated Caffarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg inequality. We investigate their weighted versions and derive corresponding extremal functions, refinements, new remaining terms and stability constants.</description>

      <title>Fujita-Kato Solutions and Optimal Time Decay for the Vlasov-Navier-Stokes System in the Whole Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09937v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We are concerned with the construction of global-in-time strong solutions for the incompressible Vlasov-Navier-Stokes system in the whole three-dimensional space. One of our goals is to establish that small initial velocities with critical Sobolev regularity and sufficiently well localized initial kinetic distribution functions give rise to global and unique solutions. This constitutes an extension of the celebrated result for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations (NS) that has been established in 1964 by Fujita and Kato. If in addition the initial velocity is integrable, we establish that the total energy of the system decays to 0 with the optimal rate t^{-3/2}, like for the weak solutions of (NS). Our results partly rely on the use of a higher order energy functional that controls the regularity $H^1$ of the velocity and seems to have been first introduced by Li, Shou and Zhang in the context of nonhomogeneous Vlasov-Navier-Stokes system. In the small data case, we show that this energy functional decays with the rate t^{-5/2}.</description>

      <title>Degenerate stability of critical points of the Caffarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg inequality along the Felli-Schneider curve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10849v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the validity of a quantitative version of stability for the critical Hardy-H\'enon equation \begin{equation*}
  H(u):=\div(|x|^{-2a}\nabla u)+|x|^{-pb}|u|^{p-2}u=0,\quad u\in D_a^{1,2}(\R^n), \end{equation*} \begin{equation*}
  n\geq 2,\quad a&lt;b&lt;a+1,\quad a&lt;\frac{n-2}{2},\quad p=\frac{2n}{n-2+2(b-a)}, \end{equation*} which is well known as the Euler-Lagrange equation of the classical Caffarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg inequality. Establishing quantitative stability for this equation amounts to finding a nonnegative function $F$ such that the estimate \begin{equation*}
  \inf_{\substack{U_i\in\mathcal{M}
  1\leq i\leq\nu}}\norm*{u-\sum_{i=1}^\nu U_i}_{D_a^{1,2}(\R^n)}\leq C(a,b,n)F(\norm*{H(u)}_{D_a^{-1,2}(\R^n)}) \end{equation*} holds for any nonnegative function $u$ satisfying \begin{equation*}
  \left(\nu-\frac{1}{2}\right)S(a,b,n)^{\frac{p}{p-2}}\leq\int_{\R^n}|x|^{-2a}|\nabla u|^2\mathrm{d}x\leq \left(\nu+\frac{1}{2}\right)S(a,b,n)^{\frac{p}{p-2}}. \end{equation*} Here $\nu\in\N_+$ and $\mathcal{M}$ denotes the set of positive solutions to this equation. When $(a,b)$ falls above the Felli-Schneider curve, Wei and Wu \cite{Wei} found an optimal $F$. Their proof relies heavily on the fact that $\mathcal{M}$ is non-degenerate. When $(a,b)$ falls on the Felli-Schneider curve, due to the absence of the non-degeneracy condition, it becomes complicated and technical to find a suitable $F$. In this paper, we focus on this case. When $\nu=1$, we obtain an optimal $F$. When $\nu\geq2$ and $u$ is not too degenerate, we also derive an optimal $F$. To our knowledge, the results in this paper provide the first instance of degenerate stability in the critical point setting. We believe that our methods will be useful in other works on degenerate stability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15095v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove $L^{\infty}_{t}W^{1,p}_{x}$ Sobolev estimates in the Keller-Segel system with linear diffusion in any dimensionby proving a functional inequality, inspired by the Brezis-Gallou\"et-Wainger inequality. These estimates are also valid at the discrete level in the Jordan-Kinderlehrer-Otto (JKO) scheme. By coupling this result with the diffusion properties of a functional according to Bakry-Emery theory, we deduce the $L^2_t H^{2}_{x}$ convergence of the scheme, thereby extending the recent result of Santambrogio and Toshpulatov in the context of the Fokker-Planck equation to the Keller-Segel system.</description>

      <title>The Calder\'on problem for third order nonlocal wave equations with time-dependent nonlinearities and potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08657v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we study the Calder\'on problem for nonlocal generalizations of the semilinear Moore--Gibson--Thompson (MGT) equation and the Jordan--Moore--Gibson--Thompson (JMGT) equation of Westervelt-type. These partial differential equations are third order wave equations that appear in nonlinear acoustics, describe the propagation of high-intensity sound waves and exhibit finite speed of propagation. For semilinear MGT equations with nonlinearity $g$ and potential $q$, we show the following uniqueness properties of the Dirichlet to Neumann (DN) map $\Lambda_{q,g}$:
  (i) If $g$ is a polynomial-type nonlinearity whose $m$-th order derivative is bounded, then $\Lambda_{q,g}$ uniquely determines $q$ and $(\partial^{\ell}_\tau g(x,t,0))_{2\leq \ell \leq m}$.
  (ii) If $g$ is a polyhomogeneous nonlinearity of finite order $L$, then $\Lambda_{q,g}$ uniquely determines $q$ and $g$.
  The uniqueness proof for polynomial-type nonlinearities is based on a higher order linearization scheme, while the proof for polyhomogeneous nonlinearities only uses a first order linearization. Finally, we demonstrate that a first linearization suffices to uniquely determine Westervelt-type nonlinearities from the related DN maps. We also remark that all the unknowns, which we wish to recover from the DN data, are allowed to depend on time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08039v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study two kinds of nonlinear degenerate elliptic equations containing the Grushin operator. First, we prove radial symmetry and a decay rate at infinity of solutions to such a Grushin equation by using the moving plane method in combination with suitable integral inequalities. Applying similar methods, we obtain nonexistence results for solutions to a second type of Grushin equation in Euclidean half space. Finally, we derive a priori estimates and the existence for positive solutions to more general types of Grushin equations by employing blow up analysis and topological degree methods, respectively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08622v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study long time behavior of shear-thinning fluid flows in $d \geq 3$ dimensions, driven by additive stochastic forcing of trace class, with power-law indices ranging from $1$ to $ \frac{2d}{d+2}$. We particularly focus on Leray-Hopf solutions, i.e. on analytically weak solutions satisfying energy inequality. Introducing a new kind of energy related functional into the technique of convex integration enables the construction of infinitely many such solutions that are probabilistically strong for a certain initial value. Furthermore, we provide global i time estimates which lead to the existence of infinitely many stationary and even ergodic Leray--Hopf solutions. These results represent the first construction of Leray-Hopf solutions in the framework of stochastic shear-thinning fluids within this range of power-law indices.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Velocity Profiles for Homoenergetic Rayleigh-Boltzmann Flows under Dominant Shear</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15449v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a particular class of solutions to the Rayleigh--Boltzmann equation, known in the nonlinear setting as \emph{homoenergetic solutions}. These solutions take the form $ g(x, v, t) = f(v - L(t)x, t),$ where the matrix $L(t)$ represents a shear flow deformation. We began our analysis in \cite{MNV}, where we rigorously proved the existence of a stationary non-equilibrium solution and established different behaviours of the solutions depending on the size of the shear parameter, for cut-off collision kernels with homogeneity parameter $0 \leq \gamma &lt; 1$, thus including Maxwell molecules and hard potentials. In the present work, we focus on the regime in which the deformation term dominates the collision term for large times (hyperbolic-dominated regime). This scenario occurs for collision kernels with $\gamma &lt; 0$; in particular, we focus on the range $\gamma \in (-1, 0)$. In this regime, it is challenging to obtain a clear and direct description of the long-time asymptotic behaviour of the solutions. Here we present a formal analysis of the velocity distribution's long-time asymptotics and derive for the first time the explicit form of the corresponding asymptotic profile. We also discuss the different asymptotic behaviour expected in the case of homogeneity $\gamma &lt; -1$. In addition, we provide a probabilistic interpretation involving a stochastic process combining collisions with shear flow. The tagged particle velocity $\{v(t)\}_{t\geq 0}$ is a Markov process that arises from the combination of free flights in a shear flow along with random jumps caused by collisions.</description>

      <title>Direct reconstruction of general elastic inclusions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04831v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The inverse problem of linear elasticity is to determine the Lam\'e parameters, which characterize the mechanical properties of a domain, from pairs of pressure activations and the resulting displacements on its boundary. This work considers the specific problem of reconstructing inclusions that manifest themselves as deviations from the background Lam\'e parameters.
  The monotonicity method is a direct reconstruction method that has previously been considered for domains only containing positive (or negative) inclusions with finite contrast. That is, all inclusions have previously been assumed to correspond to a finite increase (or decrease) in both Lam\'e parameters compared to their background values. We prove the general outer approach of the monotonicity method that simultaneously allows positive and negative inclusions, of both finite and extreme contrast; the latter refers to either infinitely stiff or perfectly elastic materials.</description>

      <title>Large-Amplitude Steady Electrohydrodynamic Solitary Waves with Constant Vorticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01336v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates solitary water waves propagating on the surface of a two-dimensional dielectric fluid subject to an electric field. The system is formulated as a nonlinear free boundary problem, with interfacial dynamics governed by the strong coupling between the Euler equations with constant vorticity and the electric potential equations. We aim to explore the effects of the electric field and constant vorticity on the nonlinear wave interactions in such a system, specifically examining whether large-amplitude solitary waves analogous to those in reference \cite{SVHMHW2023} exist. Although the inclusion of the electric field considerably complicates the analysis, we establish the existence of a continuous branch of large-amplitude solitary wave solutions. Moreover, along the global bifurcation curve, one of the following must occur: (i) the formation of an equilibrium stagnation point, (ii) the degeneration of the conformal mapping, (iii) the onset of flow stagnation, or (iv) an unbounded increase in the dimensionless wave speed.</description>

      <title>On the effects of protection zone and directed population flux in prey-predator dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05054v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a spatial predator-prey model in which prey can enter a protection zone (refuge) inaccessible to predators, while predators exhibit directed movement toward prey-rich regions. The directed movement is modeled by a far-sighted population flux motivated by classical movement rules, in contrast to the more commonly analyzed near-sighted chemotaxis-type mechanisms. We first establish local-in-time well-posedness for the corresponding nonstationary problem under Neumann boundary conditions, despite the discontinuity induced by the refuge interface. We then investigate the stationary problem, focusing on how the coexistence states emerge and organize globally in parameter space. In particular, we identify the bifurcation threshold for positive steady states from semitrivial predator-only equilibria, and describe the global continuation of the resulting branches. Our analysis reveals that strong directed movement can induce turning-point structures and multiplicity of coexistence steady states, highlighting a nontrivial interplay between spatial protection and predator movement behavior.</description>

      <title>Homogenization of L\'evy-type operators: operator estimates with correctors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06832v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The goal of the paper is to study in $L_2(\R^d)$ a self-adjoint operator ${\mathbb A}_\eps$, $\eps &gt;0$, of the form $$ ({\mathbb A}_\eps u) (\x) = \int_{\R^d} \mu(\x/\eps, \y/\eps) \frac{\left( u(\x) - u(\y) \right)}{|\x - \y|^{d+\alpha}}\,d\y $$ with $1&lt; \alpha &lt; 2$;
  here the function
  $\mu(\x,\y)$ is $\Z^d$-periodic in the both variables, satisfies the symmetry relation $\mu(\x,\y) = \mu(\y,\x)$ and
  the estimates $0&lt; \mu_- \leqslant \mu(\x,\y) \leqslant \mu_+&lt; \infty$. The rigorous definition of the operator ${\mathbb A}_\eps$ is given in terms of the corresponding quadratic form. In the previous work of the authors it was shown that the resolvent $({\mathbb A}_\eps + I)^{-1}$ converges, as $\eps\to0$, in the operator norm in $L_2(\mathbb R^d)$ to the resolvent of the effective operator $A^0$, and the estimate $\|({\mathbb A}_\eps + I)^{-1} - (\A^0 + I)^{-1} \| = O(\eps^{2-\alpha})$ holds. In the present work we achieve a more accurate approximation of the resolvent of ${\mathbb A}_\eps$ which takes into account the correctors. Namely, for $N\in\mathbb N$ such that $2-1/N &lt; \alpha \le 2-1/(N+1)$, we obtain $$ \bigl\|({\mathbb A}_\eps + I)^{-1} - (\A^0 + I)^{-1} - \sum_{m=1}^N \eps^{m(2-\alpha)} \mathbb{K}_m \bigr\| = O(\eps). $$</description>

      <title>Beyond the Hodge Theorem: curl and asymmetric pseudodifferential projections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.02015v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a new approach to the study of spectral asymmetry. Working with the operator $\operatorname{curl}:=*\mathrm{d}$ on a connected oriented closed Riemannian 3-manifold, we construct, by means of microlocal analysis, the asymmetry operator -- a scalar pseudodifferential operator of order $-3$. The latter is completely determined by the Riemannian manifold and its orientation, and encodes information about spectral asymmetry. The asymmetry operator generalises and contains the classical eta invariant traditionally associated with the asymmetry of the spectrum, which can be recovered by computing its regularised operator trace. Remarkably, the whole construction is direct and explicit.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness of gauge covariant renormalisation of stochastic 3D Yang-Mills-Higgs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03060v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Local solutions to the 3D stochastic quantisation equations of Yang-Mills-Higgs were constructed in (arXiv:2201.03487), and it was shown that, in the limit of smooth mollifications, there exists a mass renormalisation of the Yang-Mills field such that the solution is gauge covariant. In this paper we prove uniqueness of the mass renormalisation that leads to gauge covariant solutions. This strengthens the main result of (arXiv:2201.03487), and is potentially important for the identification of the limit of other approximations, such as lattice dynamics. Our proof relies on systematic short-time expansions of singular stochastic PDEs and of regularised Wilson loops. We also strengthen the recently introduced state spaces to allow finer control on line integrals appearing in expansions of Wilson loops.</description>

Abstract: We establish the existence of smooth solutions for the LYZ equation at the critical phase $\theta =(n-2)\frac{\pi}{2}$, thereby solving the critical case of a problem posed by Collins-Jacob-Yau and Li concerning the solvability for phase $\theta \leq (n-2)\frac{\pi}{2}$. As applications, we solve the 3D Hessian equation $\sigma_2 = 1$ and the 4D Hessian quotient equation $\sigma_3 = \sigma_1$ under weaker assumptions than previously required.</description>

      <title>Boundary Delocalization and Spectral Packets for Dirichlet Eigenfunctions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.11605v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish a boundary delocalization principle for high-frequency Dirichlet eigenfunctions on smooth strictly convex domains. The main result excludes persistent boundary concentration at the level of individual eigenmodes when compared to short spectral packets of sublinear length. Quantitatively, we compare boundary energies of single eigenfunctions to packet sums over frequency windows of size N_k = o(k), without asserting any asymptotic gain in magnitude. The main mode-to-packet estimate relies only on the Rellich identity. For the multi-mode bias exclusion we additionally use the boundary local Weyl law to obtain a packet zero-mean cancellation estimate. This mode-to-packet comparison is independent of eigenvalue monotonicity and is stable under eigenvalue crossings.</description>
