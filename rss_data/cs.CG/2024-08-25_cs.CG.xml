      <title>Ten Problems in Geobotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robots sense, move and act in the physical world. It is therefore natural that algorithmic problems in robotics and automation have a geometric component, often central to the problem. Below we review ten challenging problems at the intersection of robotics and computational geometry -- let's call this intersection Geobotics. What is common to most of these problems is that the prevalent algorithmic techniques used in robotics do not seem suitable for solving them, or at least do not suggest quality guarantees for the solution. Solving some of them, even partially, can shed light on less well-understood aspects of computation in robotics.</description>

      <title>Critical Point Extraction from Multivariate Functional Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advances in high-performance computing require new ways to represent large-scale scientific data to support data storage, data transfers, and data analysis within scientific workflows. Multivariate functional approximation (MFA) has recently emerged as a new continuous meshless representation that approximates raw discrete data with a set of piecewise smooth functions. An MFA model of data thus offers a compact representation and supports high-order evaluation of values and derivatives anywhere in the domain. In this paper, we present CPE-MFA, the first critical point extraction framework designed for MFA models of large-scale, high-dimensional data. CPE-MFA extracts critical points directly from an MFA model without the need for discretization or resampling. This is the first step toward enabling continuous implicit models such as MFA to support topological data analysis at scale.</description>

      <title>Homological approximations in persistence theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.07632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.07632v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define a class of invariants, which we call homological invariants, for persistence modules over a finite poset. Informally, a homological invariant is one that respects some homological data and takes values in the free abelian group generated by a finite set of indecomposable modules. We focus in particular on groups generated by "spread modules", which are sometimes called "interval modules" in the persistence theory literature. We show that both the dimension vector and rank invariant are equivalent to homological invariants taking values in groups generated by spread modules. We also show that the free abelian group generated by the "single-source" spread modules gives rise to a new invariant which is finer than the rank invariant. They are also thankful to an anonymous referee for their thorough reading of this paper and suggestions for improvement.</description>
