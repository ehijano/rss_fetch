      <title>Effect of Rotation on Wave Mixing in Intermediate Mass Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Internal gravity waves (IGWs) are likely to cause mixing in stellar interiors. Studies show that the mixing by these waves changes drastically across age and mass (Varghese et al. 2023, arXiv:2211.06432). Here, we study the effect of rotation on this wave mixing by considering a 7 M$_{\odot}$ model at ZAMS and midMS. We compare the mixing profiles at a range of rotation rates ($1\times 10^{-5}$, $2\times 10^{-5}$, $3\times 10^{-5}$, $4\times 10^{-5}$ and $1\times 10^{-4}$ rad.s$^{-1}$) and observe that the mixing decreases with decreasing Rossby number. This can be attributed to the effect of rotation on convection which influences the amplitude with which the waves are excited near the convective-radiative interface.</description>

      <title>Modeling Time-Variable Elemental Abundances in Coronal Loop Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerous recent X-ray observations of coronal loops in both active regions (ARs) and solar flares have shown clearly that elemental abundances vary with time. Over the course of a flare, they have been found to move from coronal values towards photospheric values near the flare peak, before slowly returning to coronal values during the gradual phase. Coronal loop models typically assume that the elemental abundances are fixed, however. In this work, we introduce a time-variable abundance factor into the 0D ebtel++ code that models the changes due to chromospheric evaporation in order to understand how this affects coronal loop cooling. We find that for strong heating events ($\gtrsim$ 1 erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-3}$), the abundances quickly tend towards photospheric values. For smaller heating rates, the abundances fall somewhere between coronal and photospheric values, causing the loop to cool more quickly than the time-fixed photospheric cases (typical flare simulations) and more slowly than time-fixed coronal cases (typical AR simulations). This suggests heating rates in quiescent AR loops no larger than $\approx 0.1$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-3}$ to be consistent with recent measurements of abundance factors $f \gtrsim 2$.</description>

      <title>The Onset of Magnetic Reconnection in Dynamically Evolving Current Sheets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first results of three-dimensional (3D) numerical magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of the onset of magnetic reconnection via the tearing instability in dynamically thinning current sheets in the solar corona. In all our simulations, the onset of the non-linear tearing instability, which leads to the break-up of the thinning current sheet, does not occur until after the instability growth time becomes faster than the dynamic thinning time. Furthermore, as in previous 3D MHD simulations of static current sheets in the corona, for some parameters, the amount of magnetic shear is a fundamental switch-on parameter, which has consequences for coronal heating models. These results open up the possibility of using observable quantities of coronal current sheets to predict when they will break-up and release magnetic energy to power various energetic phenomena and/or heat the atmosphere.</description>

      <title>Effect of time-varying X-ray emission from stellar flares on the ionization of protoplanetary disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-rays have significant impacts on cold, weakly ionized protoplanetary disks by increasing the ionization rate and driving chemical reactions. Stellar flares are explosions that emit intense X-rays and are the unique source of hard X-rays with an energy of $\gtrsim10$ keV in the protoplanetary disk systems. Hard X-rays should be carefully taken into account in models as they can reach the disk midplane as a result of scattering in the disk atmospheres. However, previous models are insufficient to predict the hard X-ray spectra because of the simplification in flare models. We develop a model of X-ray spectra of stellar flares based on observations and flare theories. The flare temperature and nonthermal electron emissions are modeled as functions of flare energy, which allows us to better predict the hard X-ray photon flux than before. Using our X-ray model, we conduct radiative transfer calculations to investigate the impact of flare hard X-rays on disk ionization, with a particular focus on the protoplanetary disk around a T Tauri star. We demonstrate that for a flare with an energy of $\geq 10^{33}$ erg, X-ray photons with $\gtrsim 10$ keV penetrate down to the midplane to increase the ionization rates more than galactic cosmic rays. We also find that the 10-year-averaged X-rays from multiple flares could certainly contribute to the ionization at the disk midplane. These results emphasize the importance of stellar flares on the disk evolution.</description>

      <title>M17 MIR: A Massive Star is Forming via Episodic Mass Accretion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyzed the ALMA band 6 data for the outbursting massive protostar M17~MIR. The ALMA CO $J=2-1$ data reveals a collimated and bipolar north-south outflow from M17~MIR. The blue-shifted outflow exhibits four CO knots (N1 to N4) along the outflow axis, while the red-shifted outflow appears as a single knot (S1). The extremely high velocity (EHV) emissions of N1 and S1 are jet-like and contain sub-knots along the outflow axis. Assuming the nearest EHV sub-knots trace the ejecta from the accretion outbursts in the past decades, a tangential ejection velocity of $\sim421\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$ is derived for M17~MIR. Assuming the same velocity, the dynamical times of the multiple ejecta, traced by the four blue-shifted CO knots, range from 20 to 364 years. The four blue-shifted CO knots imply four clustered accretion outbursts with a duration of tens of years in the past few hundred years. The intervals between the four clustered accretion outbursts are also about tens of years. These properties of the four clustered accretion outbursts are in line with the disk gravitational instability and fragmentation model. The episodic accretion history of M17~MIR traced by episodic outflow suggests that a massive star can form from a lower-mass protostar via frequent episodic accretion events triggered by disk gravitational instability and fragmentation. The first detection of the knotty outflow from an outbursting massive protostar suggests that mass ejections accompanied with accretion events could serve as an effective diagnostic tool for the episodic accretion histories of massive protostars.</description>

      <title>IRIS observational approach to the oscillatory and damping nature of network and internetwork chromosphere small-scale brightening (SSBs) and their unusual dynamical and morphological differences in different regions on the solar disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the most exciting benefits of solar small-scale brightening is their oscillations, this study investigated the properties of small-scale brightening (SSBs) in different regions of the Sun and found that there are differences and similarities in the properties of oscillated and non-oscillated SSBs in different regions of the Sun, including quiet Sun (QS), the adjacent to active regions (AAR), and coronal hole (CH). The damping per period (Q-factor) and maximum Doppler velocity of SSBs varied depending on the region, with the less bright internetwork SSBs in QS having lower damping time (120 seconds) and higher maximum Doppler velocities (47 km/s) compared to the brighter network SSBs (with 216 seconds &amp; 37 km/s, respectively), while in AAR, internetwork SSBs tend to have higher damping time (about of 220 seconds) and wider maximum Doppler velocity (10 to 140 km/s) ranges compared to network SSBs (130 seconds &amp; 10 to 85 km/s). In CH, both types of SSBs show similar damping time (120 seconds), but internetwork SSBs tend to have higher maximum Doppler velocities (100 km/s) compared to network SSBs (85 km/s). Also, it was pointed out that the majority of network SSBs in AARs are in the overdamping mode, while in QS, internetwork SSBs demonstrate overdamping behavior and oscillated network SSBs exhibit critical damping behavior. It is important to bear in mind, however, that the physical mechanisms underlying the damping of SSBs may vary depending on the local plasma conditions and magnetic environment.</description>

      <title>Tidal Disruption Events from Stripped Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Observations of tidal disruption events (TDEs) show signs of Nitrogen enrichment reminiscent of other astrophysical sources such as active galactic nuclei (AGN) and star-forming galaxies. Given that TDEs probe the gas from a single star, it is possible to test if the observed enrichment is consistent with expectations from the CNO cycle by looking at the observed Nitrogen/Carbon (N/C) abundance ratios. Given that $\approx 20\%$ of solar mass stars (and an even larger fraction of more massive stars) live in close binaries, it is worthwhile to also consider what TDEs from stars influenced by binary evolution would look like. We show here that TDEs from stars stripped of their Hydrogen-rich (and Nitrogen-poor) envelopes through previous binary-induced mass loss can produce much higher observable N/C enhancements than even TDEs from massive stars. Additionally, we predict that the time-dependence of the N/C abundance ratio in the mass fallback rate of stripped stars will follow the inverse behavior of main-sequence stars, enabling a more accurate characterization of the disrupted star.</description>

      <title>Cold water emission cannot be used to infer depletion of bulk elemental oxygen [O/H] in disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We re-examine the constraints provided by Herschel Space Observatory data regarding cold water emission from protoplanetary disks. Previous disk models that were used to interpret observed water emission concluded that oxygen (O/H) is depleted by at least 2 orders of magnitude if a standard, interstellar gas/dust mass ratio is assumed in the disk. In this work, we use model results from a recent disk parameter survey and show that most of the \textit{Herschel} constraints obtained for cold water (i.e. for transitions with an upper energy level $E_\mathrm{up}&lt;200$ K, where the bulk of the disk water lies) can be explained with disk models adopting ISM-like oxygen elemental abundance (i.e. O/H=$3.2\times10^{-4}$) and the canonical gas/dust mass ratio of 100. We show that cold water vapor is mainly formed by photodesorption of water ice at the interface between the molecular layer and the midplane, and that its emission is relatively independent of the main disk properties like the disk gas mass and gas/dust mass ratio. We find that the abundance of water vapor in the outer disk is set by photoprocesses and depends on the (constant) vertical column density of water ice needed to attenuate the FUV photon flux, resulting in roughly constant emission for the parameters (gas mass, dust mass, disk radius) varied in our survey. Importantly, water line emission is found to be optically thick and hence sensitive to temperature more than abundance, possibly driving previous inferences of large scale oxygen depletion.</description>

      <title>Revisiting astrophysical bounds on continuous spontaneous localization models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04463v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Among the open problems in fundamental physics, few are as conceptually significant as the measurement problem in Quantum Mechanics. One of the proposed solutions to this problem is the Continuous Spontaneous Localization (CSL) model, which introduces a non-linear and stochastic modification of the Schr\"odinger equation. This model incorporates two parameters that can be subjected to experimental constraints. One of the most notable consequences of this theory is the spontaneous heating of massive objects; this anomalous heating is dependent on the CSL parameters. In this work, we will revisit some astrophysical bounds previously found, and introduce new methods for testing the spontaneous heating in a variety of compact objects. Finally, we will compare our different bounds and discuss the benefits and shortcomings of each one.</description>

      <title>The $\beta$ Pictoris b Hill sphere transit campaign. Paper II: Searching for the signatures of the $\beta$ Pictoris exoplanets through time delay analysis of the $\delta$ Scuti pulsations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04870v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $\beta$ Pictoris system is the closest known stellar system with directly detected gas giant planets, an edge-on circumstellar disc, and evidence of falling sublimating bodies and transiting exocomets. The inner planet, $\beta$ Pictoris c, has also been indirectly detected with radial velocity (RV) measurements. The star is a known $\delta$ Scuti pulsator, and the long-term stability of these pulsations opens up the possibility of indirectly detecting the gas giant planets through time delays of the pulsations due to a varying light travel time. We search for phase shifts in the $\delta$ Scuti pulsations consistent with the known planets $\beta$ Pictoris b and c and carry out an analysis of the stellar pulsations of $\beta$ Pictoris over a multi-year timescale. We used photometric data collected by the BRITE-Constellation, bRing, ASTEP, and TESS to derive a list of the strongest and most significant $\delta$ Scuti pulsations. We carried out an analysis with the open-source python package maelstrom to study the stability of the pulsation modes of $\beta$ Pictoris in order to determine the long-term trends in the observed pulsations. We did not detect the expected signal for $\beta$ Pictoris b or $\beta$ Pictoris c. The expected time delay is 6 seconds for $\beta$ Pictoris c and 24 seconds for $\beta$ Pictoris b. With simulations, we determined that the photometric noise in all the combined data sets cannot reach the sensitivity needed to detect the expected timing drifts. An analysis of the pulsational modes of $\beta$ Pictoris using maelstrom showed that the modes themselves drift on the timescale of a year, fundamentally limiting our ability to detect exoplanets around $\beta$ Pictoris via pulsation timing.</description>

      <title>Application of hydrostatic local thermodynamic equilibrium atmosphere models to interpretations of supersoft X-ray source spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13557v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Supersoft X-ray sources (SSSs) are accreting white dwarfs (WDs) with stable or recurrent thermonuclear burning on their surfaces. High-resolution X-ray spectra of such objects are rather complex, often consist of several components, and are difficult to interpret accurately. The main emission source is the hot surface of the WD and the emergent radiation can potentially be described by hot WD model atmospheres. We present a new set of such model atmosphere spectra computed in the effective temperature range from $100\rm\,kK$ to $1000\rm\,kK$, for eight values of surface gravity and three different chemical compositions. These compositions correspond to the solar one as well as to the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds, with decreased heavy element abundances, at one-half and one-tenth of the solar value. The presented model grid covers a broad range of physical parameters and, thus, it can be applied to a wide range of objects. It is also publicly available in XSPEC~format. As an illustration, we applied it here for the interpretation of \textit{Chandra} and XMM grating spectra of two classical SSSs, namely, CAL 83 (RX J0543.5$-$6823) and RX J0513.9$-$6951. The obtained effective temperatures and surface gravities of $T_{\rm eff} \approx 560$ kK, $\log g \approx 8.6-8.7$, and $T_{\rm eff} \approx 630\,{\rm kK}, \log g \approx 8.5-8.6$, respectively, are in a good agreement with previous estimations for both sources. The derived WD~mass estimations are within $1.1-1.4\,M_\odot$ for CAL 83 and $1.15-1.4\,M_\odot$ for RX J0513.9$-$6951. The mass of the WD in CAL $83$ is consistent with the mass predicted from the respective model of recurrent thermonuclear burning.</description>

      <title>Understanding the effects of spacecraft trajectories through solar coronal mass ejection flux ropes using 3DCOREweb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03271v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the impact of spacecraft positioning and trajectory on in situ signatures of coronal mass ejections (CMEs). Employing the 3DCORE model, a 3D flux rope model that can generate in situ profiles for any given point in space and time, we conduct forward modeling to analyze such signatures for various latitudinal and longitudinal positions, with respect to the flux rope apex, at 0.8~au. Using this approach, we explore the appearance of the resulting in situ profiles for different flux rope types, with different handedness and inclination angles, for both high and low twist CMEs. Our findings reveal that CMEs exhibit distinct differences in signatures between apex hits and flank encounters, with the latter displaying elongated profiles with reduced rotation. However, constant, non-rotating in situ signatures are only observed for flank encounters of low twist CMEs, suggesting the existence of untwisted magnetic field lines within CME legs. Additionally, our study confirms the unambiguous appearance of different flux rope types in in situ signatures, contributing to the broader understanding and interpretation of observational data. Given the model assumptions, this may refute trajectory effects to be the cause for mismatching flux rope types as identified in solar signatures. While acknowledging limitations inherent in our model, such as the assumption of constant twist and non-deformable torus-like shape, we still draw relevant conclusions within the context of global magnetic field structures of CMEs and the potential for distinguishing flux rope types based on in situ observations.</description>

      <title>Hourglass Magnetic Field of a Protostellar System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11069v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An hourglass-shaped magnetic field pattern arises naturally from the gravitational collapse of a star-forming gas cloud. Most studies have focused on the prestellar collapse phase, when the structure has a smooth and monotonic radial profile. However, most observations target dense clouds that already contain a central protostar, and possibly a circumstellar disk. We utilize an analytic treatment of the magnetic field along with insights gained from simulations to develop a more realistic magnetic field model for the protostellar phase. Key elements of the model are a strong radial magnetic field in the region of rapid collapse, an off-center peak in the magnetic field strength (a consequence of magnetic field dissipation in the circumstellar disk), and a strong toroidal field that is generated in the region of rapid collapse and outflow generation. A model with a highly pinched and twisted magnetic field pattern in the inner collapse zone facilitates the interpretation of magnetic field patterns observed in protostellar clouds.</description>

Abstract: In high-energy astrophysical processes involving compact objects, such as core-collapse supernovae or binary neutron star mergers, neutrinos play an important role in the synthesis of nuclides. Neutrinos in these environments can experience collective flavor oscillations driven by neutrino-neutrino interactions, including coherent forward scattering and incoherent (collisional) effects. Recently, there has been interest in exploring potential novel behaviors in collective oscillations of neutrinos by going beyond the one-particle effective or "mean-field" treatments. Here, we seek to explore implications of collective neutrino oscillations, in the mean-field treatment and beyond, for the nucleosynthesis yields in supernova environments with different astrophysical conditions and neutrino inputs. We find that collective oscillations can impact the operation of the $\nu p$-process and $r$-process nucleosynthesis in supernovae. The potential impact is particularly strong in high-entropy, proton-rich conditions, where we find that neutrino interactions can nudge an initial $\nu p$ process neutron rich, resulting in a unique combination of proton-rich low-mass nuclei as well as neutron-rich high-mass nuclei. We describe this neutrino-induced neutron capture process as the "$\nu$i process". In addition, nontrivial quantum correlations among neutrinos, if present significantly, could lead to different nuclide yields compared to the corresponding mean-field oscillation treatments, by virtue of modifying the evolution of the relevant one-body neutrino observables.</description>

      <title>The Low-Mass Stellar Initial Mass Function in Nearby Ultrafaint Dwarf Galaxies</title>

Abstract: The stellar initial mass function (IMF) describes the distribution of stellar masses that form in a given star formation event. The long main-sequence lifetimes of low-mass stars mean that the IMF in this regime (below $\sim 1 \rm{M}_\odot$) can be investigated through star counts. Ultrafaint dwarf galaxies are low-luminosity systems with ancient, metal-poor stellar populations. We investigate the low-mass IMF in four such systems (Reticulum II, Ursa Major II, Triangulum II, and Segue 1), using Hubble Space Telescope imaging data that reaches to $\lesssim 0.2 \rm{M}_\odot$ in each galaxy. The analysis techniques that we adopt depend on the number of low-mass stars in each sample. We use Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests for all four galaxies to determine whether their observed apparent magnitude distributions can reject a given combination of IMF parameters and binary fraction for the underlying population. We forward model 1000 synthetic populations for each combination of parameters, and reject those parameters only if each of the 1000 realizations reject the null hypothesis. We find that all four galaxies reject a variety of IMFs, and the IMFs that they cannot reject include those that are identical, or similar, to that of the stellar populations of the Milky Way. We determine the best-fit parameter values for the IMF in Reticulum II and Ursa Major II and find that the IMF in Reticulum II is generally consistent with that of the Milky Way, while the IMF in Ursa Major II is more bottom heavy. The interpretation of the results for Ursa Major II is complicated by possible contamination from two known background galaxy clusters.</description>
