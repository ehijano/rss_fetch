      <title>Compact, connected, complex manifolds that admit a compact transitive group of holomorphic automorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to develop a Lie algebraic approach to obtain new proofs of important results of H.-C. Wang, Tits and Wolf-Wang-Ziller on compact complex homogeneous manifolds emphasizing only those that admit a transitive compact group of biholomorphic transformations. The method only uses some standard results in Lie theory. The new approach provides a method of associating a canonical abelian Lie algebra with a given integrable complex structure on a compact Lie algebra which extends the earlier work of Samelson and Pittie.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian circle action, invariant hypersurface and the complex projective space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $M$ be a $2n$-dimensional closed symplectic manifold admitting a Hamiltonian circle action with isolated fixed points. We show that if $M$ contains an $S^1$-invariant symplectic hypersurface $D$ such that $M\setminus D$ is a homology cell, which is satisfied when $M\setminus D$ is contractible, then $M$ and $D$ are homotopy complex projective spaces with standard Chern classes and the $S^1$-representations on the fixed-point set of $(M,D)$ are the same as those arising from the standard linear actions on $(\mathbb{P}^n,\mathbb{P}^{n-1})$, provided that $n \not \equiv 3 \pmod 4$. This can be viewed as the transformation group analogue to a recent result obtained by Peternell and the author, where the latter was conjectured by Fujita more than four decades ago.</description>

      <title>On the governing equations of membrane O surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known that a shell membrane in equilibrium where a constant purely normal load $q_n$ acts on the membrane, and where the principal curvature lines coincide with the principal stress lines, forms an integrable system called a membrane O surface. This paper formulates the governing equations for membrane O surfaces of the 1st and 2nd kind, which are analogues to Guichard surfaces of the 1st and 2nd kind introduced by Calapso. Furthermore, under this formulation, we show that membrane O surfaces are a subclass of Demoulin's $\Omega$ surfaces, and that the B\"acklund transformation for membrane O surfaces preserves membrane O surfaces of the 1st and 2nd kind, respectively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.19431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gauge symmetric methods for data representation and analysis utilize tools from the differential geometry of vector bundles in order to achieve consistent data processing architectures with respect to local symmetry and equivariance. In this work, we elaborate concepts of geometric gauge theory for data science. Motivated by lattice gauge theory, we focus on discrete descriptions of vector bundles for data representation and analysis, with clear relations to the established mathematical bundle formalism. Our approach unifies various existing approaches to data processing via vector bundles, within the framework of gauge theory. We provide geometric insights into gauge symmetric heat kernel operators that are closely related to graph connection Laplacians, and into their data transformation properties in terms of the non-trivial nullspace of the corresponding gauged Laplacians. In particular, we utilize a discrete Yang-Mills energy in order to characterize significant properties of the heat kernel in terms of associated synchronization problems.</description>

      <title>Classification of adjustments on central crossed modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adjustments are additional structures on crossed modules of Lie groups, serving as a tool in higher gauge theory to circumvent the fake flatness of connections on 2-bundles. In this article, we investigate the existence and classification of adjustments, as well as their covariance under weak equivalences. Our approach is based on a differentiation/integration correspondence with an infinitesimal version of adjustments on the associated crossed module of Lie algebras, which we then study using Lie algebra techniques. Our main result is that infinitesimal adjustments exist if and only if the Kassel-Loday classof the crossed module lies in the image of the (Lie algebraic) Chern-Weil homomorphism.</description>

Abstract: A classical and long-staying problem addressed, among others, by Calabi and Chern, is that to find a complete list of mutually non-isometric Kaehler-Einstein manifolds immersed in a finite-dimensional Kaehler space form. We address the same problem in the para-Kaehler context and, then, we find a list of mutually non-isometric toric para-Kaehler manifolds analytically immersed in a finite-dimensional para-Kaehler space form</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.19756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate harmonic unit vector fields with totally geodesic integral curves on 3-manifolds. Under mild curvature assumptions, we classify both the vector fields and the manifolds that support them. Our results are inspired by Carriere's classification of Riemannian flows on compact three-manifolds, as well as by the works of Geiges and Belgun on Killing vector fields on Sasakian manifolds.</description>

      <title>Invariant Theory Beyond Reductivity: Hilbert and Schwarz Theorems for Discrete Lorentz and Cocompact Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classical invariant theory provides a complete framework for reductive and compact Lie groups, but the non-reductive and non-compact cases are significantly more complex and less completely understood. This work investigates two distinct regimes: discrete subgroups of the Lorentz group $O(n,1)$ acting on $\mathbb{R}^{n,1}$, and cocompact actions of discrete groups on $\mathbb{R}^n$. We prove that for discrete Lorentz groups, the ring of polynomial invariants remains finitely generated, yet the classical Schwarz Theorem, stating that smooth invariants are generated by polynomial ones, fails. Conversely, for cocompact actions, the polynomial invariant ring collapses to constants, but a persistent structure of smooth invariants persists and is finitely generated over the smooth functions on the quotient. These results reveal a fourfold classification of invariant-theoretic regimes, extending the classical framework and delineating the boundaries of the Hilbert-Weyl and Schwarz theorems.</description>

      <title>Monotonicity of the deficit in the local log-Brunn-Minkowski inequality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.19061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note we establish a monotonicity property of the deficit associated with the local log-Brunn-Minkowski inequality (LLBM) under addition of line segments. As a corollary, if the LLBM holds for a convex body K, then it also holds for K+Z for any zonoid Z, which in particular yields a new proof of the inequality for zonoids. Moreover, assuming the LLBM is valid, we prove that equality in the LLBM for smooth convex bodies with $C^2$ support functions occurs only for homothetic bodies.</description>

      <title>The Hopf--Rinow Theorem and Ma\~n\'e's Critical Value for Magnetic Geodesics on Half Lie-Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate \emph{right-invariant magnetic systems} on half-Lie groups, which consist of a strong right-invariant Riemannian metric and a right-invariant closed two-form. The main examples are groups of $H^s$ or $C^k$ diffeomorphisms of compact manifolds. In this setting, we define \emph{Ma\~n\'e's critical value} on the universal cover for weakly exact right-invariant magnetic fields. First, we prove that the lift of the magnetic flow to the universal cover coincides with a Finsler geodesic flow for energies above this threshold. Finally, we show that for energies above Ma\~n\'e's critical value, the full Hopf--Rinow theorem holds for such magnetic systems, thereby generalizing the work of Contreras and Merry from closed finite-dimensional manifolds to this infinite-dimensional context. Our work extends the recent results of Bauer, Harms, and Michor from geodesic flows to magnetic geodesic flows.</description>

      <title>Foundations of Noncommutative Carrollian Geometry via Lie-Rinehart Pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Carroll manifolds offer an intrinsic geometric framework for the physics in the ultra-relativistic limit. The recently introduced Carrollian Lie algebroids are generalised to the setting of $\rho$-commutative geometry, (also known as almost commutative geometry), where the underlying algebras commute up to a numerical factor. Via $\rho$-Lie-Rinehart pairs, it is shown that the foundational tenets of Carrollian geometry have analogous statements in the almost commutative world. We explicitly build two toy examples: we equip the extended quantum plane and the noncommutative $2$-torus with Carrollian structures. This opens up the rigorous study of noncommutative Carrollian geometry via almost commutative geometry.</description>

      <title>M5 branes on ADE singularities: BPS spectrum and partition functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of a stack of M5 branes probing a transverse multi-centered Taub-NUT space are described by a class of 6d $\mathcal{N}=(1,0)$ superconformal field theories known as the M-string orbifold SCFTs. We determine the equivariant partition functions for this class of theories on a geometric background of type $T^2\times\mathbb{C}^2/\Gamma$, where $\Gamma \in\{\mathcal{C}_N,\mathcal{Q}_N, \mathcal{T},\mathcal{O},\mathcal{I}\}$ is an arbitrary finite subgroup of $SU(2)$. The partition functions are built out of contributions from BPS strings as well as BPS particles that arise upon putting the 6d theory on a circle. We find that BPS particle contributions can be expressed in terms of $\Gamma$-covariant Hilbert series which count holomorphic sections of vector bundles on the orbifold singularity with monodromy specified by an irreducible representation of $\Gamma$. The BPS string contributions, on the other hand, are given by the elliptic genera of 2d $\mathcal{N}=(0,4)$ $\Gamma$-dressed quiver gauge theories, obtained by stacking Kronheimer-Nakajima quivers of type $\Gamma$ between interfaces that support current algebras for the McKay dual affine Lie algebra $\widehat{\mathfrak{g}}$. We obtain explicit expressions for the elliptic genera of arbitrary BPS string configurations corresponding to fractional instanton strings on $\mathbb{C}^2/\Gamma$, and for the case of star-shaped quivers of type $\Gamma\in\{\mathcal{Q}_4,\mathcal{T},\mathcal{O},\mathcal{I}\}$ we give a prescription to compute the elliptic genera by gluing 2d analogues of Gaiotto and Witten's $T[SU(N)]$ theories.</description>

Abstract: We establish an integration theory for singular subalgebroids, by diffeological groupoids. To do so, we single out a class of diffeological groupoids satisfying specific properties, and we introduce a differentiation-integration procedure under which they correspond to singular subalgebroids. Our definition of integration distinguishes the holonomy groupoid from the graph, although both differentiate to the original singular subalgebroid: the holonomy groupoid satisfies a certain submersive property, while the graph does not.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.19039v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to extend the coisotropic embedding theorem obtained by M. J. Gotay for pre-symplectic manifolds to more general geometric settings: cosymplectic, contact, cocontact, $k$-symplectic, $k$-cosymplectic, $k$-contact, and multisymplectic manifolds. The results are obtained by applying a generic methodology, which gives more relevance to the potential applications. In that sense, this paper gives the fundamental basis to be able to apply the results to the so-called regularization problem of singular Lagrangian systems, both in mechanics and in classical field theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.02299v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that every compactly supported smoothly calibrated integral current with connected $C^{3,\alpha}$ boundary is the unique solution to the oriented Plateau problem for its boundary data. The same holds true for compactly supported $``$continuously calibrated$"$ integral flat chains. This is proved as a consequence of the boundary regularity theory for area-minimizing currents and a unique continuation argument in the spirit of Frank Morgan. In codimension one, the argument yields a sufficient condition for uniqueness in the oriented Plateau problem expressed in terms of the regularity of the calibrating form.</description>

      <title>Is a complete Riemannian manifold with positively pinched Ricci curvature compact</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10279v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A result of R. Hamilton asserts that any convex hypersurface in an Euclidian space with pinched second fundamental form must be compact. Partly inspired by this result, twenty years ago, in \cite{Ancient}, Remark 3.1 on page 650, the author formulated a problem asking if a complete Riemannian manifold with positively pinched Ricci curvature must be compact. There are several recent progresses, which are all rigidity results concerning the flat metric except the special case for the steady solitons. In this note we provide a detailed alternate proof of Hamilton's result, in view of the recent proof via the mean curvature flow requiring additional assumptions and that the original argument by Hamilton does lack of complete details. The proof uses a result of the author in 1998 concerning quasi-conformal maps. The proof here allows a generalization as well. We dedicate this article to commemorate R. Hamilton, the creator of the Ricci flow, who also made fundamental contributions to many other geometric flows.</description>

Abstract: We show that the intrinsic diameter of mean curvature flow in $\mathbb{R}^3$ is uniformly bounded as one approaches the first singular time $T$. This confirms the bounded diameter conjecture of Haslhofer. In addition, we establish several sharp quantitative estimates: the second fundamental form $A$ has uniformly bounded $L^1$-norm on each time slice, $A$ belongs to the weak $L^3$ space on the space-time region, and the singular set $\mathcal{S}$ has finite $\mathcal{H}^1$-Hausdorff measure. All of the results are optimal due to the marriage ring example and our results do not require any convexity assumptions on the surfaces. Furthermore, our arguments extend naturally to flows through singularities, yielding the same sharp estimates.</description>

      <title>Stable Bernstein Problem in certain positively curved manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18079v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We formulate stable Bernstein type theorems in certain positively curved ambient manifolds.
  In all dimensions, we prove that for any complete Riemannian manifold $(X^{n+1},g)$, if the Ricci curvature is non-negative and it positive BiRic curvature with $\alpha$-decay, then any complete, two-sided, stable minimal immersion must be totally geodesic and $\text{Ric}(\nu,\nu)$ vanish along the minimal immersion.
  For $4\leq n+1\leq 6$, we prove that the result still holds if $(X^{n+1},g)$ has uniform positive $3$-intermediate curvature and non-negative $(n-1)$-Ricci curvature, which generalize Chodosh-Li-Stryker's result \cite{chodosh2024complete} for $n+1=4$ to higher dimensions.
  As an immediate corollary, we show that, in all dimensions, for a complete Riemannian manifold $(X^{n+1},g)$, if it has uniform positive Ricci curvature and non-negative $(n-1)$-Ricci curvature then there is no (not necessarily) complete, two-sided, stable minimal immersion in $(X^{n+1},g)$.</description>

      <title>Minimal surfaces with negative curvature in large dimensional spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18618v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this note, we answer positively a question of Yau by proving the existence of closed minimal surfaces with negative induced curvature in any sphere of large dimension. The proof follows the strategy of Song, applying it to closed Riemann surfaces with large automorphism groups, and obtaining almost hyperbolic minimal surfaces.</description>

      <title>Valuative invariants for linearized line bundles on a spherical variety</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.00269v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give formulas for various valuative invariants of linearized ample line bundles on a projective spherical variety. Then we show how to use these formulas to study $g$-solitons on a Fano spherical variety. As a corollary, we show that for a Fano horospherical manifold $X$, the corresponding cone $(K_{X})^{\times}$ always admits a Calabi-Yau cone metric.</description>

      <title>Self-similar solutions of semilinear heat equations with positive speed</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16641v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We classify the smooth self-similar solutions of the semilinear heat equation $u_t=\Delta u+|u|^{p-1}u$ in $\mathbb{R}^n\times (0,T)$ satisfying an integral condition for all $p&gt;1$ with positive speed. As a corollary, we prove that finite time blowing up solutions of this equation on a bounded convex domain with $u(\cdot,0)\geq 0$ and $u_t(\cdot,0)\geq 0$ converges to a positive constant after rescaling at the blow-up point for all $p&gt;1$.</description>

      <title>Minimal projective varieties satisfying Miyaoka's equality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07568v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish a structure theorem for minimal projective klt varieties $X$ that satisfiy Miyaoka's equality $3c_2(X) = c_1(X)^2$. Specifically, we prove that the canonical divisor $K_X$ is semi-ample and that the Kodaira dimension $\kappa(K_X)$ is either $0$, $1$, or $2$. Furthermore, based on this abundance result, we show that a maximally quasi-\'etale cover of $X$ is smooth, and we describe explicitly the structure of the Iitaka fibration. Additionally, we prove a similar result for projective klt varieties with a nef anti-canonical divisor.</description>

      <title>On cutoff via rigidity for high dimensional curved diffusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15969v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider overdamped Langevin diffusions in Euclidean space, with curvature equal to the spectral gap. This includes the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process as well as non Gaussian and non product extensions with convex interaction, such as the Dyson process from random matrix theory. We show that a cutoff phenomenon or abrupt convergence to equilibrium occurs in high-dimension, at a critical time equal to the logarithm of the dimension divided by twice the spectral gap. This cutoff holds for Wasserstein distance, total variation, relative entropy, and Fisher information. A key observation is a relation to a spectral rigidity, linked to the presence of a Gaussian factor. A novelty is the extensive usage of functional inequalities, even for short-time regularization, and the reduction to Wasserstein. The proofs are short and conceptual. Since the product condition is satisfied, an Lp cutoff hold for all p. We moreover discuss a natural extension to Riemannian manifolds, a link with logarithmic gradient estimates in short-time for the heat kernel, and ask about stability by perturbation. Finally, beyond rigidity but still for diffusions, a discussion around the recent progresses on the product condition for nonnegatively curved diffusions leads us to introduce a new curvature product condition.</description>
