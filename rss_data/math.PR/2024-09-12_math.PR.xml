      <title>On the limit law of the superdiffusive elephant random walk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When the memory parameter of the elephant random walk is above a critical threshold, the process becomes superdiffusive and, once suitably normalised, converges to a non-Gaussian random variable. In a recent paper by the three first authors, it was shown that this limit variable has a density and that the associated moments satisfy a nonlinear recurrence relation. In this work, we exploit this recurrence to derive an asymptotic expansion of the moments and the asymptotic behaviour of the density at infinity. In particular, we show that an asymmetry in the distribution of the first step of the random walk leads to an asymmetry of the tails of the limit variable. These results follow from a new, explicit expression of the Stieltjes transformation of the moments in terms of special functions such as hypergeometric series and incomplete beta integrals. We also obtain other results about the random variable, such as unimodality and, for certain values of the memory parameter, log-concavity.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the probability distribution of the number of common zeros of a system of $m$ random $n$-variate polynomials over a finite commutative ring $R$. We compute the expected number of common zeros of a system of polynomials over $R$. Then, in the case that $R$ is a field, under a necessary-and-sufficient condition on the sample space, we show that the number of common zeros is binomially distributed.</description>

      <title>Gelation in Vector Multiplicative Coalescence and Extinction in Multi-Type Poisson Branching Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Random coalescent processes and branching processes are two fundamental constructs in the field of stochastic processes, each with a rich history and a wide range of applications. Though developed within distinct contexts, in this note we present a novel connection between a multi-type (vector) multiplicative coalescent process and a multi-type branching process with Poisson offspring distributions. More specifically, we show that the equations that govern the phenomenon of gelation in the vector multiplicative coalescent process are equivalent to the set of equations that yield the extinction probabilities of the corresponding multi-type Poisson branching process. We then leverage this connection with two applications, one in each direction. The first is a new quick proof of gelation in the vector multiplicative coalescent process using a well known result of branching processes, and the second is a new series expression for the extinction probabilities of the multi-type Poisson branching process using results derived from the theory of vector multiplicative coalescence. While the correspondence is fairly straightforward, it illuminates a deep connection between these two paradigms which we hope will continue to reveal new insights and potential for cross-disciplinary research.</description>

      <title>Fokker-Planck equations for McKean-Vlasov SDEs driven by fractional Brownian motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the probability distribution of solutions of McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equations (SDEs) driven by fractional Brownian motion. We prove the associated Fokker-Planck equation, which governs the evolution of the probability distribution of the solution. For the case where the distribution is absolutely continuous, we present a more explicit form of this equation. To illustrate the result we use it to solve specific examples, including the law of fractional Brownian motion and the geometric McKean-Vlasov SDE, demonstrating the complex dynamics arising from the interplay between fractional noise and mean-field interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we define a tempered space-time fractional negative binomial process (TSTFNBP) by subordinating the fractional Poisson process with an independent tempered Mittag-Leffler L\'{e}vy subordinator. We study its distributional properties and its connection to partial differential equations. We derive the asymptotic behavior of its fractional order moments and long-range dependence property. It is shown that the TSTFNBP exhibits overdispersion. We also obtain some results related to the first-passage time.</description>

      <title>Fractional Backward Stochastic Partial Differential Equations with Applications to Stochastic Optimal Control of Partially Observed Systems driven by L\'evy Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the Cauchy problem for backward stochastic partial differential equations (BSPDEs) involving fractional Laplacian operator. Firstly, by employing the martingale representation theorem and the fractional heat kernel, we construct an explicit form of the solution for fractional BSPDEs with space invariant coefficients, thereby demonstrating the existence and uniqueness of strong solution. Then utilizing the freezing coefficients method as well as the continuation method, we establish H\"older estimates and well-posedness for general fractional BSPDEs with coefficients dependent on space-time variables. As an application, we use the fractional adjoint BSPDEs to investigate stochastic optimal control of the partially observed systems driven by $\alpha$-stable L\'evy processes.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This short note is devoted to establishing the almost sure central limit theorem for the parabolic/hyperbolic Anderson models driven by colored-in-time Gaussian noises, completing recent results on quantitative central limit theorems for stochastic partial differential equations. We combine the second-order Gaussian Poincar\'e inequality with Ibragimov and Lifshits' method of characteristic functions, effectively overcoming the challenge from the lack of It\^o tools in this colored-in-time setting, and achieving results that are inaccessible with previous methods.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of irreducible ultracontractive Dirichlet metric measure spaces, we demonstrate the discreteness of the Laplacian spectrum and the corresponding diffusion's irreducibility in connected open sets, without assuming regularity of the boundary. This general result can be applied to study various questions, including those related to small deviations of the diffusion and generalized heat content. Our examples include Riemannian and sub-Riemannian manifolds, as well as non-smooth and fractal spaces.</description>

      <title>A Stochastic Weather Model: A Case of Bono Region of Ghana</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper sought to fit an Ornstein Uhlenbeck model with seasonal mean and volatility, where the residuals are generated by a Brownian motion for Ghanian daily average temperature. This paper employed the modified Ornstein Uhlenbeck model proposed by Bhowan which has a seasonal mean and stochastic volatility process. The findings revealed that, the Bono region experiences warm temperatures and maximum precipitation up to 32.67 degree celsius and 126.51mm respectively. It was observed that the Daily Average Temperature (DAT) of the region reverts to a temperature of approximately 26 degree celsius at a rate of 18.72% with maximum and minimum temperatures of 32.67degree celsius and 19.75degree celsius respectively. Although the region is in the middle belt of Ghana, it still experiences warm(hot) temperatures daily and experiences dry seasons relatively more than wet seasons in the number of years considered for our analysis. Our model explained approximately 50% of the variations in the daily average temperature of the region which can be regarded as relatively a good model. The findings of this paper are relevant in the pricing of weather derivatives with temperature as an underlying variable in the Ghanaian financial and agricultural sector. Furthermore, it would assist in the development and design of tailored agriculture/crop insurance models which would incorporate temperature dynamics rather than extreme weather conditions/events such as floods, drought and wildfires.</description>

      <title>Current fluctuations in the Dyson Gas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study large fluctuations of the current in a Dyson gas, a 1D system of particles interacting through a logarithmic potential and subjected to random noise. We adapt the macroscopic fluctuation theory to the Dyson gas and derive two coupled partial differential equations describing the evolution of the density and momentum. These equations are nonlinear and non-local, and the `boundary' conditions are mixed: some at the initial time and others at the final time. If the initial condition can fluctuate (annealed setting), this boundary-value problem is tractable. We compute the cumulant generating function encoding all the cumulants of the current.</description>

      <title>Deep-water and shallow-water limits of statistical equilibria for the intermediate long wave equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the construction of invariant measures associated with higher order conservation laws of the intermediate long wave equation (ILW) and their convergence properties in the deep-water and shallow-water limits. By exploiting its complete integrability, we first carry out detailed analysis on the construction of appropriate conservation laws of ILW at the $H^\frac k2$-level for each $k \in \mathbb{N}$, and establish their convergence to those of the Benjamin-Ono equation (BO) in the deep-water limit and to those of the Korteweg-de Vries equation (KdV) in the shallow-water limit. In particular, in the shallow-water limit, we prove rather striking 2-to-1 collapse of the conservation laws of ILW to those of KdV. Such 2-to-1 collapse is novel in the literature and, to our knowledge, this is the first construction of a complete family of shallow-water conservation laws with non-trivial shallow-water limits. We then construct an infinite sequence of generalized Gibbs measures for ILW associated with these conservation laws and prove their convergence to the corresponding (invariant) generalized Gibbs measures for BO and KdV in the respective limits. Finally, for $k \ge 3$, we establish invariance of these measures under ILW dynamics, and also convergence in the respective limits of the ILW dynamics at each equilibrium state to the corresponding invariant dynamics for BO and KdV constructed by Deng, Tzvetkov, and Visciglia (2010-2015) and Zhidkov (1996), respectively. In particular, in the shallow-water limit, we establish 2-to-1 collapse at the level of the generalized Gibbs measures as well as the invariant ILW dynamics. As a byproduct of our analysis, we also prove invariance of the generalized Gibbs measure associated with the $H^2$-conservation law of KdV, which seems to be missing in the literature.</description>

      <title>Jump stochastic differential equations for the characterisation of the Bragg peak in proton beam radiotherapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Proton beam radiotherapy stands at the forefront of precision cancer treatment, leveraging the unique physical interactions of proton beams with human tissue to deliver minimal dose upon entry and deposit the therapeutic dose precisely at the so-called Bragg peak, with no residual dose beyond this point. The Bragg peak is the characteristic maximum that occurs when plotting the curve describing the rate of energy deposition along the length of the proton beam. Moreover, as a natural phenomenon, it is caused by an increase in the rate of nuclear interactions of protons as their energy decreases. From an analytical perspective, Bortfeld proposed a parametric family of curves that can be accurately calibrated to data replicating the Bragg peak in one dimension. We build, from first principles, the very first mathematical model describing the energy deposition of protons. Our approach uses stochastic differential equations and affords us the luxury of defining the natural analogue of the Bragg curve in two or three dimensions. This work is purely theoretical and provides a new mathematical framework which is capable of encompassing models built using Geant4 Monte Carlo, at one extreme, to pencil beam calculations with Bortfeld curves at the other.</description>

      <title>Jump Restore Light Transport</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07148v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms come to rescue when sampling from a complex, high-dimensional distribution by a conventional method is intractable. Even though MCMC is a powerful tool, it is also hard to control and tune in practice. Simultaneously achieving both \emph{local exploration} of the state space and \emph{global discovery} of the target distribution is a challenging task. In this work, we present a MCMC formulation that subsumes all existing MCMC samplers employed in rendering. We then present a novel framework for \emph{adjusting} an arbitrary Markov chain, making it exhibit invariance with respect to a specified target distribution. To showcase the potential of the proposed framework, we focus on a first simple application in light transport simulation. As a by-product, we introduce continuous-time MCMC sampling to the computer graphics community. We show how any existing MCMC-based light transport algorithm can be embedded into our framework. We empirically and theoretically prove that this embedding is superior to running the standalone algorithm. In fact, our approach will convert any existing algorithm into a highly parallelizable variant with shorter running time, smaller error and less variance.</description>

      <title>Probability Bracket Notation, Wick-Matsubara Relation, Density Operators, and Microscopic Probability Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/0909.1295</link>
      <description>arXiv:0909.1295v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Following the Dirac vector bracket notation (VBN), we proposed the probability bracket notation (PBN) in our previous paper. We mentioned that under the special Wick rotation (imaginary time), a stationary Schrodinger equation in the Hilbert space transforms into the master equation of a microscopic probabilistic process (MPP) in the probability space. In this article, we first study the MPP of the system of a single particle, we show that the energy expectation of the MPP eventually approaches the lowest energy level in its initial condition and its von Neumann entropy finally vanishes. Then we explore the MPP for the quantum system of identical particles in the Fock space, we recover the expected occupation number of particles and the grand partition function in quantum statistics by connecting time with temperature (the Wick-Matsubara relation). We also reproduce the internal energy of an ideal gas in thermodynamics by using the relation. To address the entropy issue and relate the PBN with research topics of statistics in the literature, we express the density operators and the von Neumann entropy in the probability space by using the PBN. The Wick-Matsubara relation plus the PBN might provide a new way of microscopic probability modeling.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolic site percolation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2203.00981v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Several results are presented for site percolation on quasi-transitive, planar graphs $G$ with one end, when properly embedded in either the Euclidean or hyperbolic plane. If $(G_1,G_2)$ is a matching pair derived from some quasi-transitive mosaic $M$, then $p_u(G_1)+p_c(G_2)=1$, where $p_c$ is the critical probability for the existence of an infinite cluster, and $p_u$ is the critical value for the existence of a unique such cluster. This fulfils and extends to the hyperbolic plane an observation of Sykes and Essam(1964), and it extends to quasi-transitive site models a theorem of Benjamini and Schramm (Theorem 3.8, J. Amer. Math. Soc. 14 (2001) 487--507) for transitive bond percolation.
  It follows that $p_u (G)+p_c (G_*)=p_u(G_*)+p_c(G)=1$, where $G_*$ denotes the matching graph of $G$. In particular, $p_u(G)+p_c(G)\ge 1$ and hence, when $G$ is amenable we have $p_c(G)=p_u(G) \ge \frac12$. When combined with the main result of the companion paper by the same authors ("Percolation critical probabilities of matching lattice-pairs", Random Struct. Alg. 2024), we obtain for transitive $G$ that the strict inequality $p_u(G)+p_c(G)&gt; 1$ holds if and only if $G$ is not a triangulation.
  A key technique is a method for expressing a planar site percolation process on a matching pair in terms of a dependent bond process on the corresponding dual pair of graphs. Amongst other things, the results reported here answer positively two conjectures of Benjamini and Schramm (Conjectures 7 and 8, Electron. Comm. Probab. 1 (1996) 71--82) in the case of quasi-transitive graphs.</description>

Abstract: Given a Brownian motion $W$ and a stationary Poisson point process $p$ with values in ${\mathbb R}^d$, we prove a Dynamic Programming Principle (DPP) in a strong formulation for a stochastic control problem involving controlled SDEs of the form \begin{align} \label{ci1} \nonumber dX_{t}=&amp;\,b(t, X_{t}, a_t) dt + \alpha \left(t, X_{t}, a_t \right) dW_t+ \! \! \int_{ |z| \le 1} g\left(X_{t-},t,z, a_t \right)\widetilde{N}_p\left(dt,dz\right) \\ &amp; + \int_{ |z| &gt;1 } f\left(X_{t-},t,z, a_t \right){N}_p\left(dt,dz\right), \quad \; X_s=x\in\mathbb{R}^d,\,0\le s \le t \le T. \;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\; (1) \end{align} Here $N_p$ [resp., $\widetilde{N}_p$] is the Poisson [resp., compensated Poisson] random measure associated with $p$. We consider arbitrary predictable controls $a \in {\mathcal P}_T$ with values in a closed convex set $C \subset {\mathbb R}^{l}$. The coefficients $b$, $\alpha$, and $g$ satisfy linear growth and Lipschitz--type conditions in the $x-$variable, and are continuous in the control variable. To prove the DPP for the value function $ v(s,x)=\sup_{a \in {\mathcal P}_T} \, \mathbb{E}\big[\int_{s}^{T}h\left(r,X_r^{s,x,a}, a_r\right)dr + j\left(X_T^{s,x,a}\right)\big] $, assuming that $h$ and $j$ are bounded and continuous, we establish the existence of a regular stochastic flow for (1) when the coefficients are independent of the control $a$. Notably, this regularity result is new even when there is no large--jumps component, i.e., $f\equiv0$ (cf. Kunita's recent book on stochastic flows). The proof of the DPP is completed by introducing an approach that relies on a suitable subclass of finitely generated step controls in $\mathcal{P}_T$. These controls allow us to apply a basic measurable selection theorem by L. D. Brown and R. Purves. We believe that this novel method is of independent interest and could be adapted to prove DPPs arising in other stochastic control problems.</description>

      <title>Probing the transition from polynomial to exponential complexity in spin glasses via N-particle branching Brownian motions</title>

Abstract: The CREM is a Gaussian process indexed by a binary tree of depth $T$, introduced by Derrida and Spohn, then Bovier and Kurkova as a toy model of a spin glass. Addario-Berry and the second author have established the existence of an algorithmic hardness threshold $x_*$ in the CREM: finding a state of energy lower than $-xT$ is possible in polynomial time if $x&lt;x_*$, and takes exponential time if $x&gt;x_*$, with high probability. In this article, we are interested in the nature of the transition from polynomial to exponential complexity near the algorithmic hardness threshold. We do this by studying in detail the performance of a certain beam-search algorithm of beam width $N=N(T)$ depending on $T$. The algorithm turns out to be essentially equivalent to the time-inhomogeneous version of the so-called $N$-particle branching Brownian motion ($N$-BBM), which has seen a lot of interest in the last two decades.
  We prove the existence of three regimes: a subcritical regime when $\log N(T)\ll T^{1/3}$, a critical regime when $\log N(T)\asymp T^{1/3}$ and a supercritical regime when $\log N(T)\gg T^{1/3}$. In the subcritical regime, the output of the algorithm, i.e. the maximal displacement of the $N$-BBM, behaves asymptotically as predicted by a generalization of the so-called Brunet-Derrida correction for the classical (homogeneous) $N$-BBM, In the supercritical regime, the output of the algorithm is subject to two phenomena: on the one hand it begins to grow very slowly (logarithmically) in terms of $N$; and on the other hand its dependency in the parameter $\sigma(\cdot)$ governing the time-inhomogeneity becomes more intricate. The critical regime interpolates continuously between the two other regimes, with the appearance of explicit formulae involving Airy functions, building on results on branching random walks by Mallein.</description>

      <title>Fixation probability in Moran-like Processes on graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12598v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The well-known Isothermal Theorem was introduced in a Nature Communications article in 2005 and has since contributed to the creation of the rich field of evolutionary graph theory. The theorem states under which conditions certain Moran-like processes on graphs ("spatial Moran Processes") have the same fixation probability as the classic one-dimensional Moran Process that was introduced by Moran in 1958. Unfortunately, the Isothermal Theorem has never been proven completely. The main argument, that the projection of the process on the graph dynamics onto a one-dimensional process is a Birth-and-Death-Process, is not true in general, as the projection does not need to be Markovian. The aim of this paper is to present a more general version of the Isothermal Theorem using martingale techniques and a generalised framework using matrix notation. We follow up with a short study of small population size that shows the set of spatial Moran Processes with Moran fixation probability is even richer than previously understood. We underline the role played by the initial condition, and how individuals of the population are chosen for procreation.</description>

Abstract: We study a nonlinear branching diffusion process in the sense of McKean, i.e., where particles are subjected to a mean-field interaction. We consider first a strong formulation of the problem and we provide an existence and uniqueness result by using contraction arguments. Then we consider the notion of weak solution and its equivalent martingale problem formulation. In this setting, we provide a general weak existence result, as well as a propagation of chaos property, i.e., the McKean-Vlasov branching diffusion is the limit of a large population branching diffusion process with mean-field interaction.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the Entropic Martingale Optimal Transport (EMOT) problem on R. We begin by introducing the dual formulation and prove the exponential convergence of Sinkhorn's algorithm on the dual potential coefficients. Our analysis does not require prior knowledge of the optimal potential and confirms that there is no primal-dual gap. Our findings provide a theoretical guarantee for solving the EMOT problem using Sinkhorn's algorithm. In applications, our result provides insight into the calibration of stochastic volatility models, as proposed by Henry-Labordere.</description>

      <title>Universality theorems for zeros of random real polynomials with fixed coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02717v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider a monic polynomial of degree $n$ whose subleading coefficients are independent, identically distributed, nondegenerate random variables having zero mean, unit variance, and finite moments of all orders, and let $m \geq 0$ be a fixed integer. We prove that such a random monic polynomial has exactly $m$ real zeros with probability $n^{-3/4+o(1)}$ as $n\to \infty$ through integers of the same parity as $m$. More generally, we determine conditions under which a similar asymptotic formula describes the corresponding probability for families of random real polynomials with multiple fixed coefficients. Our work extends well-known universality results of Dembo, Poonen, Shao, and Zeitouni, who considered the family of real polynomials with all coefficients random.
  As a number-theoretic consequence of these results, we deduce that an algebraic integer $\alpha$ of degree $n$ has exactly $m$ real Galois conjugates with probability $n^{-3/4+o(1)}$, when such $\alpha$ are ordered by the heights of their minimal polynomials.</description>

Abstract: The generalization gap of a classifier is related to the complexity of the set of functions among which the classifier is chosen. We study a family of low-complexity classifiers consisting of thresholding a random one-dimensional feature. The feature is obtained by projecting the data on a random line after embedding it into a higher-dimensional space parametrized by monomials of order up to k. More specifically, the extended data is projected n-times and the best classifier among those n, based on its performance on training data, is chosen. We show that this type of classifier is extremely flexible as, given full knowledge of the class conditional densities, under mild conditions, the error of these classifiers would converge to the optimal (Bayes) error as k and n go to infinity. We also bound the generalization gap of the random classifiers. In general, these bounds are better than those for any classifier with VC dimension greater than O(ln n). In particular, the bounds imply that, unless the number of projections n is extremely large, the generalization gap of the random projection approach is significantly smaller than that of a linear classifier in the extended space. Thus, for certain classification problems (e.g., those with a large Rashomon ratio), there is a potntially large gain in generalization properties by selecting parameters at random, rather than selecting the best one amongst the class.</description>

      <title>Graphical models for infinite measures with applications to extremes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.15769v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conditional independence and graphical models are well studied for probability distributions on product spaces. We propose a new notion of conditional independence for any measure $\Lambda$ on the punctured Euclidean space $\mathbb R^d\setminus \{0\}$ that explodes at the origin. The importance of such measures stems from their connection to infinitely divisible and max-infinitely divisible distributions, where they appear as L\'evy measures and exponent measures, respectively. We characterize independence and conditional independence for $\Lambda$ in various ways through kernels and factorization of a modified density, including a Hammersley-Clifford type theorem for undirected graphical models. As opposed to the classical conditional independence, our notion is intimately connected to the support of the measure $\Lambda$. Our general theory unifies and extends recent approaches to graphical modeling in the fields of extreme value analysis and L\'evy processes. Our results for the corresponding undirected and directed graphical models lay the foundation for new statistical methodology in these areas.</description>

      <title>Antithetic multilevel Monte Carlo method for approximations of SDEs with non-globally Lipschitz continuous coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.12992v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the field of computational finance, one is commonly interested in the expected value of a financial derivative whose payoff depends on the solution of stochastic differential equations (SDEs). For multi-dimensional SDEs with non-commutative diffusion coefficients in the globally Lipschitz setting, a kind of one-half order truncated Milstein-type scheme without L\'evy areas was recently introduced by Giles and Szpruch (2014), which combined with the antithetic multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) gives the optimal overall computational cost $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-2})$ for the required target accuracy $\epsilon$. Nevertheless, many nonlinear SDEs in applications have non-globally Lipschitz continuous coefficients and the corresponding theoretical guarantees for antithetic MLMC are absent in the literature. In the present work, we aim to fill the gap and analyze antithetic MLMC in a non-globally Lipschitz setting. First, we propose a family of modified Milstein-type schemes without L\'evy areas to approximate SDEs with non-globally Lipschitz continuous coefficients. The expected one-half order of strong convergence is recovered in a non-globally Lipschitz setting, where even the diffusion coefficients are allowed to grow superlinearly. This then helps us to analyze the relevant variance of the multilevel estimator and the optimal computational cost is finally achieved for the antithetic MLMC. Since getting rid of the L\'evy areas destroys the martingale properties of the scheme, the analysis of both the convergence rate and the desired variance becomes highly non-trivial in the non-globally Lipschitz setting. By introducing an auxiliary approximation process, we develop non-standard arguments to overcome the essential difficulties. Numerical experiments are provided to confirm the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>A remark on randomization of a general function of negative regularity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.16504v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the study of partial differential equations (PDEs) with random initial data and singular stochastic PDEs with random forcing, we typically decompose a classically ill-defined solution map into two steps, where, in the first step, we use stochastic analysis to construct various stochastic objects. The simplest kind of such stochastic objects is the Wick powers of a basic stochastic term (namely a random linear solution, a stochastic convolution, or their sum). In the case of randomized initial data of a general function of negative regularity for studying nonlinear wave equations (NLW), we show necessity of imposing additional Fourier-Lebesgue regularity for constructing Wick powers by exhibiting examples of functions slightly outside $L^2(\mathbb T^d)$ such that the associated Wick powers do not exist. This shows that probabilistic well-posedness theory for NLW with general randomized initial data fails in negative Sobolev spaces (even with renormalization). Similar examples also apply to stochastic NLW and stochastic nonlinear heat equations with general white-in-time stochastic forcing, showing necessity of appropriate Fourier-Lebesgue $\gamma$-radonifying regularity in the construction of the Wick powers of the associated stochastic convolution.</description>

      <title>Hoeffding decomposition of black-box models with dependent inputs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.06567v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Performing an additive decomposition of arbitrary functions of random elements is paramount for global sensitivity analysis and, therefore, the interpretation of black-box models. The well-known seminal work of Hoeffding characterized the summands in such a decomposition in the particular case of mutually independent inputs. Going beyond the framework of independent inputs has been an ongoing challenge in the literature.  Existing solutions have so far required constraining assumptions or suffer from a lack of interpretability.  In this paper, we generalize Hoeffding's decomposition for dependent inputs under very mild conditions. For that purpose, we propose a novel framework to handle dependencies based on probability theory, functional analysis, and combinatorics. It allows for characterizing two reasonable assumptions on the dependence structure of the inputs: non-perfect functional dependence and non-degenerate stochastic dependence. We then show that any square-integrable, real-valued function of random elements respecting these two assumptions can be uniquely additively decomposed and offer a characterization of the summands using oblique projections. We then introduce and discuss the theoretical properties and practical benefits of the sensitivity indices that ensue from this decomposition. Finally, the decomposition is analytically illustrated on bivariate functions of Bernoulli inputs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00659v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the theoretical framework of proof mining by establishing general logical metatheorems that allow for the extraction of the computational content of theorems with prima facie "non-computational" proofs from probability theory, thereby unlocking a major branch of mathematics as a new area of application for these methods. Concretely, we devise proof-theoretically tame logical systems that, for one, allow for the formalization of proofs involving algebras of sets together with probability contents as well as associated Lebesgue integrals on them and which, for another, are amenable to proof-theoretic metatheorems in the style of proof mining that guarantee the extractability of effective and tame bounds from large classes of ineffective existence proofs in probability theory. Moreover, these extractable bounds are guaranteed to be highly uniform in the sense that they will be independent of all parameters relating to the underlying probability space, particularly regarding events or measures of them. As such, these results, in particular, provide the first logical explanation for the success and the observed uniformities of the previous ad hoc case studies of proof mining in these areas and further illustrate their extent. Beyond these systems, we provide extensions for the proof-theoretically tame treatment of $\sigma$-algebras and associated probability measures using an intensional approach to infinite unions. Lastly, we establish a general proof-theoretic transfer principle that allows for the lift of quantitative information on a relationship between different modes of convergence for sequences of real numbers to sequences of random variables.</description>

Abstract: In this note, based on the recent remarkable results of Dufour and Prieto-Rumeau, we deduce that for an absorbing MDP with a given initial state, under a standard compactness-continuity condition, the space of occupation measures has the same convergent sequences, when it is endowed with the weak topology and with the weak-strong topology. We provided two examples demonstrating that imposed condition cannot be replaced with its popular alternative, and the above assertion does not hold for the space of marginals of occupation measures on the state space. Moreover, the examples also clarify some results in the previous literature.</description>

We aim to pioneer the establishment of the stochastic maximum principle (SMP) and the derivation of the backward SDE (BSDE) from the perspective of the constrained optimization using the method of Lagrangian multipliers. To this end, we first propose to embed the constrained extended mean-field control (C-MFC) problems into some abstract optimization problems with constraints on Banach spaces, for which we develop the generalized Fritz-John (FJ) optimality conditions. We then prove the stochastic maximum principle (SMP) for C-MFC problems by transforming the FJ type conditions into an equivalent stochastic first-order condition associated with a general type of constrained forward-backward SDEs (FBSDEs). Contrary to the existing literature, we treat the controlled Mckean-Vlasov SDE as an infinite-dimensional equality constraint such that the BSDE induced by the FJ first-order optimality condition can be interpreted as the generalized Lagrange multiplier to cope with the SDE constraint. Finally, we also present the SMP for stochastic control problems and mean field game problems under similar types of constraints as consequences of our main result for C-MFC problems.</description>

Abstract: For the problem of reconstructing a low-rank matrix from a few linear measurements, two classes of algorithms have been widely studied in the literature: convex approaches based on nuclear norm minimization, and non-convex approaches that use factorized gradient descent. Under certain statistical model assumptions, it is known that nuclear norm minimization recovers the ground truth as soon as the number of samples scales linearly with the number of degrees of freedom of the ground-truth. In contrast, while non-convex approaches are computationally less expensive, existing recovery guarantees assume that the number of samples scales at least quadratically with the rank $r$ of the ground-truth matrix. In this paper, we close this gap by showing that the non-convex approaches can be as efficient as nuclear norm minimization in terms of sample complexity. Namely, we consider the problem of reconstructing a positive semidefinite matrix from a few Gaussian measurements. We show that factorized gradient descent with spectral initialization converges to the ground truth with a linear rate as soon as the number of samples scales with $ \Omega (rd\kappa^2)$, where $d$ is the dimension, and $\kappa$ is the condition number of the ground truth matrix. This improves the previous rank-dependence in the sample complexity of non-convex matrix factorization from quadratic to linear. Our proof relies on a probabilistic decoupling argument, where we show that the gradient descent iterates are only weakly dependent on the individual entries of the measurement matrices. We expect that our proof technique is of independent interest for other non-convex problems.</description>

      <title>Valuation Model of Chinese Convertible Bonds Based on Monte Carlo Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06496v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We tackle the problem of pricing Chinese convertible bonds(CCBs) using Monte Carlo simulation and dynamic programming. At each exercise time, we use the state variables of the underlying stock to regress the continuation value, and apply standard backward induction to get the coefficients from the current time to time zero. This process ultimately determines the CCB price. We then apply this pricing method in simulations and evaluate an underpriced strategy: taking long positions in the 10 most undervalued CCBs and rebalancing daily. The results show that this strategy significantly outperforms the benchmark double-low strategy. In practice, CCB issuers often use a downward adjustment clause to prevent financial distress when a put provision is triggered. Therefore, we model the downward adjustment clause as a probabilistic event that triggers the put provision, thereby integrating it with the put provision in a straightforward manner.</description>
