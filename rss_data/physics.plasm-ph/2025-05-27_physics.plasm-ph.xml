      <title>Ionization potential depression model with the influence of neighboring ions for warm/hot and dense plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For warm or hot and dense plasma, ionization potential depression plays a crucial role in determining the ionization balance and understanding the resulting microscopic plasma properties. However, the applicability of the widely used IPD models is currently limited under WDP conditions, where the influence of neighboring ions on IPD becomes nonnegligible. Neighboring ions can directly influence the screening potential around the target ion, which then changes the ionization potential. Furthermore, similar to solid-state systems, outer atomic orbitals expand into continuous energy bands due to the existence of neighboring ions, and electrons in these continuous bands can travel from target ion into neighboring ions and become delocalized. As a result, even for their total energy E&lt;0, electrons excited into these continuous bands can be considered ionized, and the ionization conditions differ from those in isolated situations. In our previous work with an atomic state dependent screening model, we included the influence of temporarily recombined electron distributions due to inelastic collision processes between plasma electrons and ions, and evident contributions from these electrons to the screening potential were found under WDP conditions. We now further incorporate the direct contributions of neighboring ions to both screening potentials and ionization conditions. This extended framework reveals that the contribution from neighboring ions substantially influences IPD in WDP. The developed model demonstrates good agreement with experiments for Al, Mg, and Si plasmas with a wide range of 70 to 700 eV temperatures and 1 to 3 times the solid density as well as the hollow Al ions measured in the experiment.</description>

      <title>Towards Laboratory Electron-Positron Plasma via Electromagnetic Showers in Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The kinetic equations describing electromagnetic showers from high-energy electron beams interacting with targets are solved, building on the analytical framework developed in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 134, 135001 (2025)]. Two regimes are defined by the ratio of the target thickness L to the radiation length Lr , which depends on the electron energy and target composition. For thin targets (L &lt; Lr ), we derive explicit expressions for the spectra of produced photons and pairs, as well as the number of pairs. For thick targets (L&gt;Lr ), we obtain the total pair number and photon spectrum. Analytical results agree well with Geant4 simulations, which show that significant pair escape requires L&lt;Lr . The divergence, density and characteristic dimensions of the escaping pair jets are obtained, and a criterion for pair plasma formation is derived. While current laser wakefield beams are not well adapted, multi-petawatt lasers may provide new electron or photon sources suitable for laboratory pair plasma production, opening new avenues for studying extreme plasma astrophysics in the laboratory.</description>

      <title>First Demonstration of Resonant Pitch-Angle Scattering of Relativistic Electrons by Externally-Launched Helicon Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Helicon waves satisfying the normal wave-particle cyclotron resonance are observed to limit the growth and maximum energy of relativistic electrons (REs) in low-density Ohmic DIII-D tokamak plasmas. Following the application of helicon waves, pitch-angle scattering of high-energy REs causes an increase in both synchrotron and electron-cyclotron emissions. The hard x-ray emission, a proxy for the RE population, ceases to grow; and energy-resolved hard x-ray measurements also show a striking decrease in the number of high-energy REs (above the resonance at approximately \SI{8}{MeV}) to below the noise floor. This occurs despite the toroidal electric field remaining high enough to drive exponential RE growth in the absence of helicon waves. These results open new directions for limiting the maximum energy of RE populations in laboratory and fusion plasmas.</description>

      <title>Plasma fireball sheath dynamics: A brief review and meta-analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive overview of the formation mechanism of plasma fireball sheath (PFS) structures, sheath-induced collective phenomena, associated relevant instabilities, and corresponding onset conditions. It includes an optimum set of self-illustrative schematic figures, relevantly manifesting the instability triggering dynamics, various involved metastable stages, and parametric threshold conditions. The possible damping mechanisms of excited instabilities in the usual PFS systems are also highlighted. An up-to-date experimental glimpse of both the regular fireball (RFB) and inverted fireball (IFB) classes is specifically presented. We explicitly offer illustrative appendices showing the main distinctions between (a) RFB and IFB, (b) laboratory and astrocosmic fireballs, and (c) RFB sheath and IFB sheath formations. It provides a panoptic glimpse of the current RFB and IFB studies with a special mention to both laboratory and astrospace plasmas. A holistic outline on the chronological development of the PFS research investigations, since the inception of plasma-electrode coupling studies, is outlined. A clear indication of the future fireball scope in both theoretic and applied perspectives is finally emphasized.</description>

      <title>Understanding Plasma Turbulence Through Exact Coherent Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plasma turbulence is a key challenge in understanding transport phenomena in magnetically confined plasmas. This work presents a novel approach using periodic orbit theory to analyze plasma turbulence, identifying fundamental structures that underpin chaotic motion. By applying numerical optimization techniques to the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation - a reduced model for drift-wave-driven trapped particle turbulence - we extract coherent spacetime patterns that serve as building blocks of turbulent dynamics. These structures provide a framework to systematically describe turbulence as a composition of recurrent solutions, revealing an underlying order within chaotic plasma motion. Our findings suggest that multi-periodic orbit theory can be effectively applied to spatiotemporal turbulence, offering a new method for predicting and potentially controlling transport processes in fusion plasmas. This study provides a bridge between nonlinear dynamical systems theory and plasma physics, highlighting the relevance of periodic orbit approaches for understanding complex plasma behavior.</description>

      <title>Approximating the Particle Distribution in Rotating and Tandem Mirror Traps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Steady state distribution functions can be used to calculate stability conditions for modes, radiation energy losses, and particle loss rates. Heuristic analytic approximations to these distributions can capture key behaviors of the true distributions while possessing computational advantages over their numerical counterparts. In this paper, we motivate and present a closed-form analytic model for a distribution of particles in a centrifugal or tandem mirror. We find that our model outperforms other known models in approximating numerical steady-state simulations outside of a narrow range of low confining potentials. We demonstrate the model's suitability in the high confining potential regime for applications such as loss cone stability thresholds, fusion yields, and available energy.</description>

      <title>An electric circuital analysis of laboratory plasma sheath fluctuations and propagations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effective inductive (L), capacitive (C), and resistive (R) behavior of a plasma sheath in a conjoint coupled form is well familiar among plasma physics communities. A dynamic sheath instability in laboratory plasmas is systematically modelled herein as an electrical series-resonance LCR circuit of the above kind. It theoretically yields experimentally observed findings on coexistent plasma sheath oscillation, electric current perturbation, and subsequent plasma sheath waves (PSWs). The plasma current in the LCR circuit formalism is allowed to undergo linear (small-scale) spatiotemporal perturbations about its homogeneous equilibrium state. The oscillating sheath triggers ion-acoustic wave excitation in the bulk plasma through sheath-induced energy transfer processes. The obtained results could be applicable mainly in understanding electromagnetic communication antennas, ion energy modulation processes, diverse plasma probe diagnostics, etc.</description>

      <title>Thermal and Turbulence Characteristics of Fast and Slow Coronal Mass Ejections at 1 AU</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the thermal and turbulence properties of interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs) is essential for analyzing their evolution and interactions with the surrounding medium. This study explores these characteristics across different regions of two distinct ICMEs observed at 1 AU, utilizing in-situ measurements from the Wind spacecraft. The polytropic indices, Gamma_e for electrons and Gamma_p for protons) reveal significant deviations from adiabatic expansion, suggesting sustained heating mechanisms within the ICMEs even at 1AU. The effective polytropic index (Gamma_eff) of the magnetic ejecta (ME) in both ICME1 and ICME2 is found to be near-isothermal (Gamma_eff = 0.88 and 0.76), aligning with measurements near the Sun, highlighting consistent heating across heliospheric distances. Spectral analysis at the inertial scale reveals Kolmogorov-like turbulence in the fast ICME1's ME, while the ME of the slower ICME2 exhibits less developed turbulence with a shallower spectral index (alpha_B). The turbulence analysis in the dissipation scale indicates that the ME of slower ICME2 is less affected by the ambient medium than the faster ICME2. The MEs of both ICMEs show magnetic compressibility much smaller than unity (C_B &lt; 1), suggesting dominant Alfvenic fluctuations in the MEs. Notably, the partial variance of increments (PVI) method identifies more intermittent structures, such as current sheets and reconnection sites, in the sheath and post-ICME regions. Higher PVI values correlate with regions of increased electron and proton temperature (for the sheath region), as well as higher C_B values, highlighting their role in local energy dissipation. These results underscore the importance of ongoing heating and turbulence processes in shaping the evolution of ICMEs.</description>

      <title>Magnetothermal evolution of neutron star cores in the `weak-coupling' regime: implications of ambipolar diffusion for the quiescent X-ray luminosity of magnetars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The high quiescent X-ray luminosity observed in some magnetars is widely attributed to the decay and evolution of their ultra-strong magnetic fields. Several dissipation mechanisms have been proposed, each operating with different efficiencies depending on the region of the star. In this context, ambipolar diffusion, i.e., the relative motion of charged particles with respect to neutrons in the neutron star core, has been proposed as a promising candidate due to its strong dependence on magnetic field strength and its capacity to convert magnetic energy into heat. We perform axisymmetric magnetohydrodynamic simulations to study the long-term magnetic evolution of a NS core composed of normal (non-Cooper paired) matter under the influence of ambipolar diffusion. The core is modeled as a two-fluid system consisting of neutrons and a charged-particle fluid (protons and electrons), coupled to the magnetic field. Simulations are performed both at constant and variable temperatures. In the latter case, a strategy that decouples the magnetic and thermal evolution is employed, enabling efficient thermal modeling across a range of initial magnetic field strengths. At constant temperature, we obtained the expected result where neutrons reach diffusive equilibrium, the Lorentz force is balanced by chemical potential gradients of charged particles, and the magnetic field satisfies a non-linear Grad-Shafranov equation. When thermal evolution is included, fields $B \gtrsim 5 \times 10^{15} \,\text{G}$ can balance ambipolar heating and neutrino cooling, delaying the evolution over $\sim 10^{3} \,[B/(5 \times 10^{15}\,\text{G})]^{-6/5}$ yr. Although the surface luminosity is enhanced compared to passive cooling, the heating from ambipolar diffusion alone is insufficient to fully explain the persistent X-ray emission observed in magnetars.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical-embedding autoencoder with a predictor (HEAP) as efficient architecture for learning long-term evolution of complex multi-scale physical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel efficient architecture for learning long-term evolution in complex multi-scale physical systems which is based on the idea of separation of scales. Structures of various scales that dynamically emerge in the system interact with each other only locally. Structures of similar scale can interact directly when they are in contact and indirectly when they are parts of larger structures that interact directly. This enables modeling a multi-scale system in an efficient way, where interactions between small-scale features that are apart from each other do not need to be modeled. The hierarchical fully-convolutional autoencoder transforms the state of a physical system not just into a single embedding layer, as it is done conventionally, but into a series of embedding layers which encode structures of various scales preserving spatial information at a corresponding resolution level. Shallower layers embed smaller structures on a finer grid, while deeper layers embed larger structures on a coarser grid. The predictor advances all embedding layers in sync. Interactions between features of various scales are modeled using a combination of convolutional operators. We compare the performance of our model to variations of a conventional ResNet architecture in application to the Hasegawa-Wakatani turbulence. A multifold improvement in long-term prediction accuracy was observed for crucial statistical characteristics of this system.</description>

      <title>A structure-preserving multiscale solver for particle-wave interaction in non-uniform magnetized plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Particle-wave interaction is of fundamental interest in plasma physics, especially in the study of runaway electrons in magnetic confinement fusion. Analogous to the concept of photons and phonons, wave packets in plasma can also be treated as quasi-particles, called plasmons. To model the ``mixture" of electrons and plasmons in plasma, a set of ``collisional" kinetic equations has been derived, based on weak turbulence limit and the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) approximation.
  There are two main challenges in solving the electron-plasmon kinetic system numerically. Firstly, non-uniform plasma density and magnetic field results in high dimensionality and the presence of multiple time scales. Secondly, a physically reliable numerical solution requires a structure-preserving scheme that enforces the conservation of mass, momentum, and energy.
  In this paper, we propose a struture-preserving multiscale solver for particle-wave interaction in non-uniform magnetized plasmas. The solver combines a conservative local discontinuous Galerkin (LDG) scheme for the interaction part with a trajectory averaging method for the plasmon Hamiltonian flow part. Numerical examples for a non-uniform magnetized plasma in an infinitely long symmetric cylinder are presented. It is verified that the LDG scheme rigorously preserves all the conservation laws, and the trajectory averaging method significantly reduces the computational cost.</description>

      <title>Effective field theories of dissipative fluids with one-form symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12868v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A system with a one-form global symmetry at finite temperature can be viewed as a dissipative fluid of string-like objects. In this work, we classify and construct the most general effective field theories for hydrodynamics of such string fluids, in a probe limit where the one-form charge density is decoupled from the energy-momentum tensor. We show that at leading order in the derivative expansion, there are two distinct types of diffusive transport in a string fluid depending on the discrete spacetime symmetries present in it. One particular application of interest is magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), where the effective field theories describe the diffusion of magnetic field lines. Due to the distinction between the effective field theories for different discrete symmetries, we show that the MHD of a fluid with charge conjugation symmetry is qualitatively different from that of a neutron star, which we previously discussed in arXiv:2207.01636. The explicit effective actions that we write down can be used to obtain the dispersion relations $\omega(k)$ up to cubic order in momenta for each of the different discrete symmetry choices. As another application of this formalism, we show that when the one-form symmetry is spontaneously broken, the effective action reduces to the Maxwell theory. This confirms the interpretation of the photon as a Goldstone boson arising from the spontaneous breaking of a one-form symmetry.</description>

      <title>Solving the Nonlinear Vlasov Equation on a Quantum Computer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19310v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a mapping of the nonlinear, electrostatic Vlasov equation with Krook-type collision operators, discretized on a (1+1) dimensional grid, onto a recent Carleman linearization-based quantum algorithm for solving ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with quadratic nonlinearities. We derive upper bounds for the query- and gate complexities of the quantum algorithm in the limit of large grid sizes. We conclude that these are polynomially larger than the time complexity of the corresponding classical algorithms. We find that this is mostly due to the dimension, sparsity and norm of the Carleman linearized evolution matrix. We show that the convergence criteria of the quantum algorithm places severe restrictions on potential applications. This is due to the high level of dissipation required for convergence, that far exceeds the physical dissipation effect provided by the Krook operator for typical plasma physics applications.</description>

      <title>Collider-quality electron bunches from an all-optical plasma photoinjector</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09557v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel approach for generating collider-quality electron bunches using a plasma photoinjector. The approach leverages recently developed techniques for the spatiotemporal control of laser pulses to produce a moving ionization front in a nonlinear plasma wave. The moving ionization front generates an electron bunch with a current profile that balances the longitudinal electric field of an electron beam-driven plasma wave, creating a uniform accelerating field across the bunch. Particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations of the ionization stage show the formation of an electron bunch with 220 pC charge and low emittance ($\epsilon_x = 171$ nm-rad, $\epsilon_y = 76$ nm-rad). Quasistatic PIC simulations of the acceleration stage show that the bunch is efficiently accelerated to 20 GeV over 2 meters with a final energy spread of less than 1\% and emittances of $\epsilon_x = 177$ nm-rad and $\epsilon_y = 82$ nm-rad. This high-quality electron bunch meets the requirements outlined by the Snowmass process for intermediate-energy colliders and compares favorably to the beam quality of proposed and existing accelerator facilities. The results establish the feasibility of plasma photoinjectors for future collider applications making a significant step towards the realization of high-luminosity, compact accelerators for particle physics research.</description>
