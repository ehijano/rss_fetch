      <title>Rain from Solar Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Herein we propose a method mimicking natural processes for the creation of precipitation, rain, in a safe, economically feasible manner anywhere in the world. We propose accomplishing this via changing the target of the well established field of aerosol dispersal for large scale climate cooling from long term cooling to short term, locally targeted dispersal. We show that such should induce precipitation anywhere with sufficient humidity, and should be accomplishable at low cost and low or no safety concerns.</description>

      <title>Can aerodynamic noise from large offshore wind turbines affect marine life?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pressing demand for offshore wind energy has driven a significant increase in the size of wind turbines, as exemplified by the proposed 22MW turbine in the IEA Task 55 REFWIND. In addition, today it is common to see offshore farms with 100 or 150 turbines. The combination of turbines of increasing sizes in populated farms facilitates energy production but can lead to non-negligible aerodynamic noise emissions, which can be heard underwater. This paper quantifies the underwater aerodynamic noise footprint of three large offshore turbines (5MW, 10MW, and 22MW) and farms composed of these types of turbines. By comparing the underwater noise spectra with audiograms of marine animals, we confirm that the noise emissions of large offshore farms will soon pose an environmental problem. The proposed methodology allows wind turbine designers to predict and mitigate the impact of noise while promoting sustainable energy.</description>

      <title>Ensemble score filter with image inpainting for data assimilation in tracking surface quasi-geostrophic dynamics with partial observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data assimilation plays a pivotal role in understanding and predicting turbulent systems within geoscience and weather forecasting, where data assimilation is used to address three fundamental challenges, i.e., high-dimensionality, nonlinearity, and partial observations. Recent advances in machine learning (ML)-based data assimilation methods have demonstrated encouraging results. In this work, we develop an ensemble score filter (EnSF) that integrates image inpainting to solve the data assimilation problems with partial observations. The EnSF method exploits an exclusively designed training-free diffusion models to solve high-dimensional nonlinear data assimilation problems. Its performance has been successfully demonstrated in the context of having full observations, i.e., all the state variables are directly or indirectly observed. However, because the EnSF does not use a covariance matrix to capture the dependence between the observed and unobserved state variables, it is nontrivial to extend the original EnSF method to the partial observation scenario. In this work, we incorporate various image inpainting techniques into the EnSF to predict the unobserved states during data assimilation. At each filtering step, we first use the diffusion model to estimate the observed states by integrating the likelihood information into the score function. Then, we use image inpainting methods to predict the unobserved state variables. We demonstrate the performance of the EnSF with inpainting by tracking the Surface Quasi-Geostrophic (SQG) model dynamics under a variety of scenarios. The successful proof of concept paves the way to more in-depth investigations on exploiting modern image inpainting techniques to advance data assimilation methodology for practical geoscience and weather forecasting problems.</description>

      <title>A Survey: RTE Solutions for Underwater Optical Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Radiative Transfer Equation (RTE) is essential for solving the spatial distribution of light energy. It plays a crucial role in the link budget analysis of Underwater Wireless Optical Communication (UWOC). However, due to its complex integro-differential form, obtaining an exact solution is extremely challenging. This paper provides a systematic overview and comparison of key RTE solution strategies in case of UWOC scenario-including the Monte Carlo Method (MCM), Beer-Lambert Method (BLM), Beam Spread Function (BSF), Finite Element Method (FEM), and others-and analyzes how each approach balances accuracy, computational efficiency, and ease of implementation. Results show that MCM, though computationally intensive, to best match the three-dimensional spatial configuration of practical UWOC systems. BLM, while simplest, loses accuracy in turbid conditions. BSF partially corrects for scattering but yields only modest gains over BLM, and FEM struggles at longer ranges due to discretization. These findings help guide method selection for reliable estimation UWOC's system power budget.</description>

      <title>Monte-Carlo based non-line-of-sight underwater wireless optical communication channel modeling and system performance analysis under turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compared with line-of-sight (LOS) communication, nonline-of-sight (NLOS) underwater wireless optical communication (UWOC) systems have garnered extensive attention because of their heightened suitability for the intricate and dynamic underwater environment. In the NLOS channel, photons can reach the receiver by sea surface reflection or particle scattering. However, research lacks comprehensive channel models that incorporate sea surface reflection and particle scattering. Moreover, the presence of ocean turbulence introduces random fluctuations in the received optical signal based on the average light intensity. Consequently, this paper adopts the Monte Carlo simulation method (MCS) to solve the fading-free impulse response of the joint reflection-scattering channel. Furthermore, a weighted double gamma function (WDGF) is proposed to characterize the channel impulse response (CIR). Based on the closed CIR model, the average bit error rate and the performance of the interruption probability of the UWOC system under turbulence are analyzed. The conclusions obtained are intended to assist in the design and performance evaluation of NLOS UWOC systems.</description>

      <title>Seasonal Changes -- Time for Paradigm Shift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Season and their transitions play a critical role in sharpening ecosystems and human activities, yet traditional classifications, meteorological and astronomical, fail to capture the complexities of biosphere-atmosphere interactions. Conventional definitions often overlook the interplay between climate variables, biosphere processes, and seasonal anticipation, particularly as global climate change disrupts traditional patterns. This study addresses the limitations of current seasonal classification by proposing a framework based on phenological markers such as NDVI, EVI, LAI, fPAR, and the Bowen ratio, using plants as a nature-based sensor of seasonal transitions. Indicators derived from satellite data and ground observations provide robust foundations for defining seasonal boundaries. The normalized daily temperature range (DTRT), validated in crop and orchard regions, is hypothesized as a reliable seasonality index to capture transitions. We demonstrated the alignment of this index with phenological markers across boreal, temperate, and deciduous forests. Analyzing trends, extreme values and inflection points in the seasonality index time series, we established a methodology to identify seasonal onset, duration, and transitions. This universal, scalable classification aligns with current knowledge and perception of seasonal shifts and captures site-specific timing. Findings reveal shifts in the Euro-Mediterranean region, with winters shortening, summers extending, and transitions becoming more pronounced. Effects include the Gulf Stream s influence on milder transitions, urban heat islands accelerating seasonal shifts, and large inland lakes moderating durations. This underscores the importance of understanding seasonal transitions to enable climate change adaptive strategies in agriculture, forestry, urban planning, medicine, trade, marketing, and tourism.</description>

      <title>Spatial variation of future trends in Atlantic upwelling cells from two CMIP6 models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Eastern Boundary Upwelling Systems (EBUS) are characterized by wind-triggered upwelling of deep waters along the coast. They are hotspots of biological productivity and diversity and therefore have a high economic, ecological and social importance. In the past, different methods using surface data have been used to estimate upwelling. Recently, the IPCC has suggested directly assessing vertical velocities as a promising method. We use this method to study the two Atlantic EBUS from CMIP6 models from the HadGEM3-GC3.1 and the CNRM6-CM6 family, for both the historical period and a high-emission future scenario with spatial resolutions in the ocean component ranging from 1{\deg}to 1/12{\deg}. The two major upwelling regions are divided in subregions depending on their seasonality. The vertical transport index shows similar values to a wind-derived Ekman index. Directly evaluating upwelling from transport processes further provides information about the depth of the upwelling, which has previously been identified as an important factor for nutrient availability. We show that depending on the subregion of the upwelling system different cell structures can be seen in terms of depth and distance to the coast of maximum velocities. When looking at possible future changes high interannual variability limits the significance of the trends but could indicate a poleward shift of the upwelling regions.A detailed comparison of the spatial structures and the distinction in subregions is important to explain contradictory trends in previous works.</description>

      <title>Data fusion of complementary data sources using Machine Learning enables higher accuracy Solar Resource Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04381v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the present work, we collect solar irradiance and atmospheric condition data from several products, obtained from both numerical models (ERA5 and NORA3) and satellite observations (CMSAF-SARAH3). We then train simple supervised Machine Learning (ML) data fusion models, using these products as predictors and direct in-situ Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI) measurements over Norway as ground-truth. We show that combining these products by applying our trained ML models provides a GHI estimate that is significantly more accurate than that obtained from any product taken individually. Using the trained models, we generate a 30-year ML-corrected map of GHI over Norway, which we release as a new open data product. Our ML-based data fusion methodology could be applied, after suitable training and input data selection, to any geographic area on Earth.</description>

      <title>Atmospheric stability sets maximum moist heat and convection in the midlatitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05351v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extreme moist heatwaves pose a serious threat to society and human health. To manage heat-related risks, it is crucial to improve our understanding of what sets the maximum moist heat. This question has been extensively studied for moist heat in the tropics under the assumption of moist neutrality, but it remains less explored over midlatitude continents, where this assumption is not applicable. The frequent concurrent occurrence of extreme moist heat and intense convection over midlatitude land reinforces the prevailing hypothesis that deep convection terminates heatwaves and sets their peak intensity. Here, a theory is developed based on the onset of convection to provide a theoretical prediction for both the maximum near-surface moist heat and potential convection over midlatitude land. Our framework demonstrates that the intensities of moist heat and convection are constrained by a preexisting energy barrier in the lower free troposphere, which suppresses convection and enables the buildup of moist heat and convective instability. This barrier, often marked by a temperature or energy inversion, varies only slightly during moist heatwave evolution. Our results suggest the potential to predict maximum moist heat and convection from predefined lower free tropospheric properties and offer insights into the evolution of extreme heat and convection across climate states.</description>
