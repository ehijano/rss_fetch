      <title>Transfer of homological objects in exact categories via adjoint triples. Applications to functor categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a given family $\{(\mathrm{q}_i, \mathrm{t}_i, \mathrm{p_i} )\}_{i \in I}$ of adjoint triples between exact categories $\mathcal{C}$ or $\mathcal{D}$, we show that any cotorsion pair in $\mathcal{C}$ and $\mathcal{D}$ yield two canonical cotorsion pairs providing a concrete description of objects without using any injectives/projectives object hypothesis. We firstly apply this result for the evaluation functor on the functor category $\operatorname{Add}(\mathcal{A}, R \mbox{-Mod})$ equipped with an exact structure $\mathcal{E}$. Under mild conditions on $\mathcal{A}$, we introduce the stalk functor at any object of $\mathcal{A}$, and subsequently, we investigate cotorsion pairs induced by stalk functors. Finally, we use them to present an intrinsic characterization of projective/injective objects in $(\mbox{Add}(\mathcal{A}, R\mbox{-Mod}); \mathcal{E})$.</description>

      <title>Failures of Compositionality: A Short Note on Cohomology, Sheafification and Lavish Presheaves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03488v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In many sciences one often builds large systems out of smaller constituent parts. Mathematically, to study these systems, one can attach data to the component pieces via a functor F. This is of great practical use if F admits a compositional structure which is compatible with that of the system under study (i.e. if the local data defined on the pieces can be combined into global data). However, sometimes this does not occur. Thus one can ask: (1) Does F fail to be compositional? (2) If so, can this failure be quantified? and (3) Are there general tools to fix failures of compositionality? The kind of compositionality we study in this paper is one in which one never fails to combine local data into global data. This is formalized via the understudied notion of what we call a lavish presheaf: one that satisfies the existence requirement of the sheaf condition, but not uniqueness. Adapting \v{C}ech cohomology to presheaves, we show that a presheaf has trivial zeroth presheaf-\v{C}ech cohomology if and only if it is lavish. In this light, cohomology is a measure of the failure of compositionality. The key contribution of this paper is to show that, in some instances, cohomology can itself display compositional structure. Formally, we show that, given any Abelian presheaf F : C^op --&gt; A and any Grothendieck pretopology J, if F is flasque and separated, then the zeroth cohomology functor H^0(-,F) : C^op --&gt; A is lavish. This follows from observation that, for separated presheaves, H^0(-,F) can be written as a cokernel of the unit of the adjunction given by sheafification. This last fact is of independent interest since it shows that cohomology is a measure of ``distance'' between separated presheaves and their closest sheaves (their sheafifications). On the other hand, the fact that H^0(-,F) is a lavish presheaf has unexpected algorithmic consequences.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Quantum-Classical Machine Learning with String Diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Central to near-term quantum machine learning is the use of hybrid quantum-classical algorithms. This paper develops a formal framework for describing these algorithms in terms of string diagrams: a key step towards integrating these hybrid algorithms into existing work using string diagrams for machine learning and differentiable programming. A notable feature of our string diagrams is the use of functor boxes, which correspond to a quantum-classical interfaces. The functor used is a lax monoidal functor embedding the quantum systems into classical, and the lax monoidality imposes restrictions on the string diagrams when extracting classical data from quantum systems via measurement. In this way, our framework provides initial steps toward a denotational semantics for hybrid quantum machine learning algorithms that captures important features of quantum-classical interactions.</description>

      <title>Deligne-Knop tensor categories and functoriality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A general construction of Knop creates a symmetric monoidal category $\mathcal{T}(\mathcal{A},\delta)$ from any regular category $\mathcal{A}$ and a fixed degree function $\delta$. A special case of this construction are the Deligne categories $\underline{\operatorname{Rep}}(S_t)$ and $\underline{\operatorname{Rep}}(GL_t(\mathbb{F}_q))$. We discuss when a functor $F:\mathcal{A} \to \mathcal{A}'$ between regular categories induces a symmetric monoidal functor $\mathcal{T}(\mathcal{A},\delta) \to \mathcal{T}(\mathcal{A}',\delta')$. We then give a criterion when a pair of adjoint functors between two regular categories $\mathcal{A}, \ \mathcal{A}'$ lifts to a pair of adjoint functors between $\mathcal{T}(\mathcal{A},\delta)$ and $\mathcal{T}(\mathcal{A}',\delta')$.</description>

      <title>Homology of graph burnings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study graph burnings using methods of algebraic topology. We prove that the time function of a burning is a graph map to a path graph. Afterwards, we define a category whose objects are graph burnings and morphisms are graph maps which commute with the time functions of the burnings. In this category we study relations between burnings of different graphs and, in particular, between burnings of a graph and its subgraphs. For every graph, we define a simplicial complex, arising from the set of all the burnings, which we call a configuration space of the burnings. Further, simplicial structure of the configuration space gives burning homology of the graph. We describe properties of the configuration space and the burning homology theory. In particular, we prove that the one-dimensional skeleton of the configuration space of a graph $G$ coincides with the complement graph of $G$. The results are illustrated with numerous examples.</description>

      <title>Characterisation of Lawvere-Tierney Topologies on Simplicial Sets, Bicolored Graphs, and Fuzzy Sets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simplicial sets generalize many categories of graphs. In this paper, we give a complete characterization of the Lawvere-Tierney topologies on (semi-)simplicial sets, on bicolored graphs, and on fuzzy sets. We apply our results to establish that 'partially simple' simplicial sets and 'partially simple' graphs form quasitoposes.</description>

      <title>A Syntax for Strictly Associative and Unital $\infty$-Categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.05303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.05303v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first definition of strictly associative and unital $\infty$-category. Our proposal takes the form of a type theory whose terms describe the operations of such structures, and whose definitional equality relation enforces desired strictness conditions. The key technical device is a new computation rule in the definitional equality of the theory, which we call insertion, defined in terms of a universal property. On terms for which it is defined, this operation "inserts" one of the arguments of a substituted coherence into the coherence itself, appropriately modifying the pasting diagram and result type, and simplifying the syntax in the process. We generate an equational theory from this reduction relation and we study its properties in detail, showing that it yields a decision procedure for equality.
  Expressed as a type theory, our model is well-adapted for generating and verifying efficient proofs of higher categorical statements. We illustrate this via an OCaml implementation, and give a number of examples, including a short encoding of the syllepsis, a 5-dimensional homotopy that plays an important role in the homotopy groups of spheres.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15338v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend Deligne's original argument showing that locally coherent topoi have enough points, clarified using collage diagrams. We show that our refinement of Deligne's technique can be adapted to recover every existing result of this kind, including the most recent results about $\kappa$-coherent $\kappa$-topoi. Our presentation allows us to relax the cardinality assumptions typically imposed on the sites involved. We show that a larger class of locally finitely presentable toposes have enough points and that a closed subtopos of a topos with enough points has enough points.</description>

      <title>Non-additive derived functors via chain resolutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13398v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $F\colon \mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{E}$ be a functor from a category $\mathcal{C}$ to a homological (Borceux-Bourn) or semi-abelian (Janelidze-M\'arki-Tholen) category $\mathcal{E}$. We investigate conditions under which the homology of an object $X$ in $\mathcal{C}$ with coefficients in the functor $F$, defined via projective resolutions in $\mathcal{C}$, remains independent of the chosen resolution. Consequently, the left derived functors of $F$ can be constructed analogously to the classical abelian case.
  Our approach extends the concept of chain homotopy to a non-additive setting using the technique of imaginary morphisms. Specifically, we utilize the approximate subtractions of Bourn-Janelidze, originally introduced in the context of subtractive categories. This method is applicable when $\mathcal{C}$ is a pointed regular category with finite coproducts and enough projectives, provided these projectives are closed under protosplit subobjects, a new condition introduced in this article and naturally satisfied in the abelian context. We further assume that the functor $F$ meets certain exactness conditions: for instance, it may be protoadditive and preserve proper morphisms and binary coproducts - conditions that amount to additivity when $\mathcal{C}$ and $\mathcal{E}$ are abelian categories.
  Within this framework, we develop a basic theory of derived functors, compare it with the simplicial approach, and provide several examples.</description>

      <title>An elementary proof of a criterion for subfunctors of Ext to be closed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01203v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{A}$ be an abelian category and let $F$ be a subbifunctor of the additive bifunctor $\text{Ext}_{\mathcal{A}}^{1}(-,-)\colon \mathcal{A}^{\text{op}}\times \mathcal{A}\to \mathsf{Ab}$. Buan proved in [4] that $F$ is closed if, and only if, $F$ has the $3\times 3$-lemma property, a certain diagrammatic property satisfied by the class of $F$-exact sequences. The proof of this result relies on the theory of exact categories and on the Freyd--Mitchell embedding theorem, a very well-known overpowered result. In this paper we provide a proof of Buan's result only by means of elementary methods in abelian categories. To achieve this we survey the required theory of subfunctors leading us to a self-contained exposition of this topic.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2005.09038v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given an abelian category, we introduce a categorical concept of (strongly) Gorenstein projective (resp., injective) objects, by defining a new special class of objects. Then we study the transfer of these properties when passing to an abelian category and its n-trivial extension category and also give a characterization of Gorenstein object over it. We give, at the end, applications of this study on the category of modules over an associative ring and triangular matrix rings.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a single-set axiomatisation of cubical $\omega$-categories, including connections and inverses. We justify these axioms by establishing a series of equivalences between the category of single-set cubical $\omega$-categories, and their variants with connections and inverses, and the corresponding cubical $\omega$-categories. We also report on the formalisation of cubical $\omega$-categories with the Isabelle/HOL proof assistant, which has been instrumental in developing the single-set axiomatisation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02284v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce Graphical Quadratic Algebra (GQA), a string diagrammatic calculus extending the language of Graphical Affine Algebra with a new generator characterised by invariance under rotation matrices. We show that GQA is a sound and complete axiomatisation for three different models: quadratic relations, which are a compositional formalism for least-squares problems, Gaussian stochastic processes, and Gaussian stochastic processes extended with non-determinisms. The equational theory of GQA sheds light on the connections between these perspectives, giving an algebraic interpretation to the interplay of stochastic behaviour, relational behaviour, non-determinism, and conditioning. As applications, we discuss various case studies, including linear regression, probabilistic programming, and electrical circuits with realistic (noisy) components.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15868v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using the braided version of Lawvere's algebraic theories and Mac Lane's PROPs, we introduce polynomial identities for arbitrary algebraic structures in a braided monoidal category C as well as their codimensions in the case when C is linear over some field. The new cases include coalgebras, bialgebras, Hopf algebras, braided vector spaces, Yetter-Drinfel'd modules, etc. We find bases for polynomial identities and calculate codimensions in some important particular cases.</description>
