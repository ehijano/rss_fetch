      <title>VOLatility Archive for Realized Estimates (VOLARE)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: VOLARE (VOLatility Archive for Realized Estimates - https://volare.unime.it) is an open research infrastructure providing standardized realized volatility and covariance measures constructed from ultra-high-frequency financial data. The platform processes tick-level observations across equities, exchange rates, and futures using an asset-specific pipeline that addresses heterogeneous trading calendars, microstructure noise, and timestamp precision. For equities, price series are cleaned using a documented outlier detection procedure and sampled at regular intervals.
  VOLARE delivers a comprehensive set of realized estimators, including realized variance, range-based measures, bipower variation, semivariances, realized quarticity, realized kernels, and multivariate covariance measures, ensuring methodological consistency and cross-asset comparability. In addition to bulk dataset download, the platform supports interactive visualization and real-time estimation of established volatility models such as HAR and MEM specifications.</description>

      <title>Detecting and Explaining Unlawful Insider Trading: A Shapley Value and Causal Forest Approach to Identifying Key Drivers and Causal Relationships</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Corporate insiders trade for diverse reasons, often possessing Material Non-Public Information (MNPI). Determining whether specific trades leverage MNPI is a significant challenge due to inherent complexity. This study focuses on two critical objectives: accurately detecting Unlawful Insider Trading (UIT) and identifying key features explaining classification. The analysis demonstrates how combining Shapley Values (SHAP) and Causal Forest (CF) reveals these explanatory drivers.
  The findings underscore the necessity of causality in identifying and interpreting UIT, requiring the consideration of alternative scenarios and potential outcomes. Within a high-dimensional feature space, the proposed architecture integrates state-of-the-art techniques to achieve high classification accuracy. The framework provides robust feature rankings via SHAP and causal significance assessments through CF, facilitating the discovery of unique causal relationships.
  Statistically significant relationships are documented between the outcome and several key features, including director status, price-to-book ratio, return, and market beta. These features significantly influence the likelihood of UIT, suggesting potential links between insider behavior and factors such as information asymmetry, valuation risk, market volatility, and stock performance. The analysis draws attention to the complexities of financial causality, noting that while initial descriptors offer intuitive insights, deeper examination is required to understand nuanced impacts. These findings reaffirm the architectural flexibility of decision tree models. By incorporating heterogeneity during tree construction, these models effectively uncover latent structures within trade, finance, and governance data, characterizing fraudulent behavior while maintaining reliable results.</description>

      <title>Sub-City Real Estate Price Index Forecasting at Weekly Horizons Using Satellite Radar and News Sentiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reliable real estate price indicators are typically published at city level and low frequency, limiting their use for neighborhood-scale monitoring and long-horizon planning. We study whether sub-city price indices can be forecasted at weekly frequency by combining physical development signals from satellite radar with market narratives from news text. Using over 350,000 transactions from Dubai Land Department (2015-2025), we construct weekly price indices for 19 sub-city regions and evaluate forecasts from 2 to 34 weeks ahead. Our framework fuses regional transaction history with Sentinel-1 SAR backscatter, news sentiment combining lexical tone and semantic embeddings, and macroeconomic context. Results are strongly horizon dependent: at horizons up to 10 weeks, price history alone matches multimodal configurations, but beyond 14 weeks sentiment and SAR become critical. At long horizons (26-34 weeks), the full multimodal model reduces mean absolute error from 4.48 to 2.93 (35% reduction), with gains statistically significant across regions. Nonparametric learners consistently outperform deep architectures in this data regime. These findings establish benchmarks for weekly sub-city index forecasting and demonstrate that remote sensing and news sentiment materially improve predictability at strategically relevant horizons.</description>

      <title>Metaorder modelling and identification from public data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Market-order flow in financial markets exhibits long-range correlations. This is a widely known stylised fact of financial markets. A popular hypothesis for this stylised fact comes from the Lillo-Mike-Farmer (LMF) order-splitting theory. However, quantitative tests of this theory have historically relied on proprietary datasets with trader identifiers, limiting reproducibility and cross-market validation. We show that the LMF theory can be validated using publicly available Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) data by leveraging recently developed methods for reconstructing synthetic metaorders. We demonstrate the validation using 3 years of Transaction and Quote Data (TAQ) for the largest 100 stocks on the JSE when assuming that there are either N=50 or N=150 effective traders managing metaorders in the market.</description>
