      <title>Deviations from the von Laue Condition: Implications for the On-Shell Lagrangian of Particles and Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: According to the von Laue condition, the volume integral of the proper pressure inside isolated particles with a fixed structure and finite mass vanishes in the Minkowski limit of general relativity. In this work, we consider a simple illustrative example: non-standard static global monopoles with finite energy, for which the von Laue condition is satisfied when the proper pressure is integrated over the whole space. We demonstrate, however, that the absolute value of this integral, when calculated up to a finite distance from the center of the global monopole, generally deviates from zero, and that this deviation is bounded by the energy located outside the specified volume (under the assumption of the dominant energy condition). Furthermore, we find that the maximum deviation from unity of the ratio between the volume averages of the on-shell Lagrangian and the trace of the energy-momentum tensor cannot exceed three times the outer energy fraction. Additionally, we show that, as long as the dominant energy condition holds, these constraints generally apply to real particles with fixed structure and finite mass. We discuss the implications of this result in the context of stable atomic nuclei. Specifically, we argue that, except in extremely dense environments with energy densities comparable to that of an atomic nucleus (e.g., inside neutron stars), the volume average of the aforementioned ratio for atomic nuclei should remain extremely close to unity. Finally, we discuss the implications of our findings for the form of the on-shell Lagrangian of real fluids. This is often a crucial element for accurately describing fluid dynamics in the presence of non-minimal couplings to other matter fields or gravity.</description>

      <title>Charged quantum Oppenheimer-Snyder model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the framework of loop quantum cosmology, particularly within the quantum Oppenheimer-Snyder model, the semiclassical Ashtekar-Pawlowski-Singh (APS) metric is associated with a static, spherically symmetric black hole that incorporates quantum effects derived from the APS metric. This quantum-corrected black hole can be interpreted as a modified Schwarzschild black hole, where the Schwarzschild metric function is adjusted by an additional term proportional to $\frac{M^{2}}{r^{4}}$, with $r$ denoting the radial coordinate and $M,$ the black hole mass. In this study, we show that such a quantum-mechanically modified black hole can arise in the context of nonlinear electrodynamics with either electric or magnetic charge. This charged, quantum-corrected solution is then matched to a dust ball of constant mass $M_{APS}$, governed by the APS metric, at a timelike thin-shell possessing nonzero mass $m$ and electric charge $Q$ or magnetic charge $P$. Analytically, it is demonstrated that the thin-shell oscillates around an equilibrium radius $r=R_{eq}$, which is expressed in terms of $% M_{APS}$, $m$, and $Q$ or $P$.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic power-law inflation for the S\'aez-Ballester theory non-minimally coupled to a vector field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we would like to examine whether the S\'aez-Ballester theory admits stable and attractive Bianchi type I inflationary solutions in the presence of a non-minimal coupling between scalar and vector fields such as $f^2(\phi)F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu}$. As a result, such a solution will be shown to exist within this theory for a suitable setup of fields. However, the corresponding tensor-to-scalar ratio of this solution turns out to be higher than the latest observational value of the Planck satellite (Planck 2018) due to the fact that $c_s$, the corresponding speed of sound of scalar perturbations of the S\'aez-Ballester theory, turns out to be one. This result indicates an important hint that the speed of sound, $c_s$, could play an important role in making the corresponding non-canonical anisotropic inflation cosmologically viable in the light of the Planck 2018 data. To be more specific, we will point out that any modifications of the S\'aez-Ballester theory having $c_s \sim 0.1$ will have a great potential to be highly consistent with the Planck 2018 data.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Expansion of the Universe in Modified Symmetric Teleparallel Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the last century, theoretical and experimental developments have established the General Relativity theory as the most successful theory for describing the gravitational phenomenon. On the other hand, in the last two decades, multiple observational probes have strongly favored the discovery of the acceleration of cosmic expansion. The observational enhancement and development in precision cosmology indicate a requirement to go beyond General Relativity and to search for an alternate description that can resolve the persistent issues. In Chapter 1, we highlight some important elements of observational cosmology. In Chapters 2 and 3, we investigate the f(Q) gravity in the presence of viscosity in the cosmic fluid. In Chapters 4 and 5, we explore the constraints on the various classes of non-linear f(Q) gravity models in both coincident and non-coincident formalism, respectively. In Chapter 6, we present a covariant formulation and energy balance equation for the f(Q,T) gravity, which is an extension of f(Q) gravity. Finally, in Chapter 7, we briefly summarize the outcomes of the present thesis and the future scope.</description>

      <title>Particles acceleration by Bocharova-Bronnikov-Melnikov-Bekenstein black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have studied the motion of massive particles under the influence of scalar and gravitational fields, with particular emphasis on the BBMB black hole. It has been shown that the radius of the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) and marginally bound orbit are significantly affected by the scalar coupling parameter. We study the energy efficiency of thin accretion disks around BBMB black holes, showing that the efficiency decreases for positive $g_s$ and increases for negative $g_s$, with a maximum of approximately $30\%$ for specific $g_s$ values. We derive analytical expressions for the angular and linear velocities of orbiting particles, highlighting their dependence on $g_s$. The photon sphere is shown to be independent of $g_s$, but the linear velocity at the ISCO position varies significantly, with massive particles behaving like ultra-relativistic particles near the black hole under scalar field influence. Additionally, we examine the center-of-mass energy (CME) of colliding particles near the BBMB black hole, showing that the scalar field can lead to infinitely high CME near the horizon, consistent with the BSW process. Astrophysical implications include CME values reaching \(10^{20} \, {\rm eV}\), comparable to the energies of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECR).</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that introducing a deformed algebra with a minimum length modifies the field equations for an inhomogeneous spacetime, resulting in the emergence of acceleration. Specifically, we examine the analytic effects of the Generalized Uncertainty Principle on the classical field equations of the Szekeres system. Our findings show that the deformed algebra leads to a modified Szekeres system capable of describing cosmic acceleration. Moreover, the spatial curvature of the spacetime is influenced by the presence of the minimum length.</description>

      <title>Black-hole spectroscopy from a giant quantum vortex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Black-hole spectroscopy aims to infer physical properties of black holes by detecting the spectrum of quasinormal modes (QNMs) they emit while settling toward equilibrium. Unlike normal modes, which are resonances of energy-conserving systems, QNMs are damped oscillations that arise when a system loses energy. The detection of the full spectrum is challenging due to their rapid decay, limiting observations only to the longest-lived mode. Theoretical and numerical studies suggest that environmental confinement due to surrounding plasma or dark matter can modify the QNM spectrum and enhance its detectability. Here we show that spatial confinement similarly affects the noise spectrum of nanometre-scale interface waves surrounding a giant quantum vortex in superfluid helium-4, an experimentally accessible quantum system that emulates dynamics in rotating curved spacetime. In the available parameter space, we identify regimes that exhibit a multitude of QNMs whose real and imaginary frequencies are shifted with respect to those of the unbounded system, in agreement with theoretical predictions. Our results highlight the versatility of quantum liquids as experimental platforms for validating theoretical toolkits in spectral stability, demonstrating their effectiveness in simulating both rotating curved spacetime and relevant environmental effects.</description>

      <title>Analysing geodesic motion in Bocharova-Bronnikov-Melnikov-Bekenstein spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explored novel feature of the Bocharova-Bronnikov-Melnikov-Bekenstein (BBMB) black hole by analyzing geodesic motion. We first examined its thermodynamics and showed that Hawking temperature equals to zero. We investigated motion of both massive and massless particles around the BBMB black hole and studied the characteristic radii, namely, marginally stable circular orbit (MSCO) and marginally bound orbit (MBO) for massive particles orbiting the BBMB black hole. Additionally, we found that the energy efficiency of massive particles in the BBMB spacetime can reach up to $8\%$. We also studied the capture cross section of massless (photon) and massive particles by the BBMB black hole. From the equations of motion, we derived the radial function crucial for determining the critical value of the impact parameter for photons and particles. Comparing these findings with the Schwarzschild spacetime, we observed significant differences in gravitational properties. Specifically, the impact parameter for a photon is smaller in the Schwarzschild field than in the BBMB field, indicating weaker gravity around the BBMB black hole, as corroborated by the closer location of the photon sphere in the BBMB spacetime. We derived explicit expressions for the pericentric precession and the deflection angle of light by the BBMB black hole, along with the trajectory of massive particles orbiting the black hole. We showed that test particles on elliptical trajectories experience pericenter shifts, with pericentric precession in the BBMB spacetime being slightly less than that predicted by Einstein's general theory of relativity.</description>

      <title>Rotating Curzon-Chazy metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the Curzon metric for a positive mass configuration possesses a singular event horizon with infinite area. This singularity has significant implications, revealing that the three-dimensional spatial hypersurfaces, which are orthogonal to the Killing vector field, exhibit a multiply connected structure. Furthermore, we investigate the dynamics of a test particle orbiting a central $\gamma$-object within this spacetime. It is found that under certain conditions, the particle's velocity can approach the speed of light, leading to an exceptionally high total energy at a specific value of the deformation parameter governing the spacetime structure. Moreover, we uncover a causality issue for a critical value of the deformation parameter, where the test particle can exceed the speed of light, potentially offering new insights into the theoretical existence of tachyons. This study contributes to the understanding of relativistic objects in deformed spacetimes and suggests that such violations of causality could play a role in explaining the elusive nature of tachyonic phenomena in high-energy physics.</description>

      <title>Into the vortex: quasinormal and quasibound spectra of rotating acoustic geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong-field gravity simulators are laboratory experiments that can investigate a wide range of both classical and quantum phenomena occurring in nature. In this work, we introduce an effective geometry that captures most of the characteristics of the strong-field regime of astrophysical, rotating black holes. This geometry can represent a vortex made from a variety of fluid and superfluid profiles with zero viscosity, making it a promising finite-temperature quantum-field-theory simulator for rotating curved spacetimes. Our geometry includes not only the typical radial flow which gives rise to an acoustic horizon, but also azimuthal circulation of the fluid. We compute the quasinormal modes, semi-analytically, and the exact quasibound states of acoustic excitations interacting with this effective geometry. The resulting spectra can be identified for both co-rotating and counter-rotating surface acoustic waves. In particular, the behavior of our acoustic geometry with circulation aligns with the phenomenology observed in recent experiments that include superfluids.</description>

      <title>A large data semi-global existence and convergence theorem for vacuum Einstein's equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I prove a convergence theorem in the context of $3+1$ dimensional vacuum Einstein's equations including a positive cosmological constant on spacetimes $\widetilde{M}$ of topological type $M\times \mathbb{R}$, where $M$ is a closed connected oriented Riemannian $3-$manifold of negative Yamabe type. The theorem concerns the global existence of the solutions of the vacuum Einstein$-\Lambda$ equations for arbitrary large initial data and convergence of the spatial geometry to a constant negative scalar curvature metric in a constant mean extrinsic curvature (CMC) transported spatial gauge. This theorem could be interpreted as a weak cosmic censorship result in the cosmological framework under \textit{generic} initial data. An important corollary of the theorem is the failure of cosmological principle as a derived consequence of Einstein's equations including a positive cosmological constant as well as the failure of geometrization of spatial slice in the sense of Thurston. A similar theorem is stated for positive Yamabe slices under a technical assumption.</description>

      <title>Progress of the TianQin project</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: TianQin is a future space-based gravitational wave observatory targeting the frequency window of $10^{-4}$ Hz $\sim 1$ Hz. A large variety of gravitational wave sources are expected in this frequency band, including the merger of massive black hole binaries, the inspiral of extreme/intermediate mass ratio systems, stellar-mass black hole binaries, Galactic compact binaries, and so on. TianQin will consist of three Earth orbiting satellites on nearly identical orbits with orbital radii of about $10^5$ km. The satellites will form a normal triangle constellation whose plane is nearly perpendicular to the ecliptic plane. The TianQin project has been progressing smoothly following the ``0123" technology roadmap. In step ``0", the TianQin laser ranging station has been constructed and it has successfully ranged to all the five retro-reflectors on the Moon. In step ``1", the drag-free control technology has been tested and demonstrated using the TianQin-1 satellite. In step ``2", the inter-satellite laser interferometry technology will be tested using the pair of TianQin-2 satellites. The TianQin-2 mission has been officially approved and the satellites will be launched around 2026. In step ``3", i.e., the TianQin-3 mission, three identical satellites will be launched around 2035 to form the space-based gravitational wave detector, TianQin, and to start gravitational wave detection in space.</description>

      <title>Generalized quantum two level model and its application in astrophysics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complicated time-dependent curved spacetime and electric field are involved in many astrophysical situations, including the early universe, Hawking radiation, the Schwinger effect, and gravitational pair production. In this Letter, a generalized quantum two-level model (GQTLM) is developed, which is applicable to arbitrary time-dependent curved spacetime and electric field. The model is found to be consistent with quantum kinetic theory, and is characterized by its simplicity and versatility. The momentum distribution of particles and the effects of gravitational distortions can be correctly described. Quantum properties concerning vortex structures, such as the intrinsic orbital angular momentum of particles and antiparticles can also be conveniently calculated. The model is expected to significantly advance the quantum exploration of the universe. It could refine the prediction of primordial gravitational waves and relevant non-Gaussian signals, extend the calculation of Hawking radiation to general black hole configurations, help to distinguish neutron stars from strange quark stars, and elucidate the gravitational pair production mechanism.</description>

      <title>Higher-Dimensional Vacuum Einstein Equations: Symmetry, New Solutions, and Ricci Solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the system of vacuum Einstein equations (i.e., Ricci-flat metrics) with two hypersurface-orthogonal, commuting Killing vector fields in $d \ge 5$ dimensions is invariant under the action of a one-parameter Lie group, and the group action on any metric can be expressed in a closed, universal form. This enables the generation of a one-parameter family of solutions from any given ``seed" solution of the system without solving additional equations, as well as one-parameter families of local steady Ricci solitons. This extends the Lie point symmetry in four dimensions, found earlier for axisymmetric static vacuum systems, and provides the first example of solution generation in higher-dimensional vacuum Einstein equations that can be realized purely algebraically.</description>

      <title>Interference patterns for simple lens models in wave-optics regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work studies interference patterns created by simple lens models (point mass, Chang-Refsdal, and binary lens) in the wave optics regime, primarily in the context of lensing of gravitational waves (GWs) in the LIGO band at frequencies around 100 Hz. We study how the interference patterns behave close to the caustic curves which mark the high magnification regions in conventional geometric optics. In addition, we also look at the formation of highly de-amplified regions in the amplification maps close to caustics and how they differ under wave and geometric optics. We see that for a source close to caustics, the oscillations in the amplification factor (their amplitude and location of crests and troughs) can differ significantly in wave optics compared to geometric optics. As we move away from caustics, the wave optics amplification factor starts to converge towards geometric optics one, especially the frequencies at which crests and through occur in the amplification factor, although the amplitude of these oscillations can still be considerably different. For Chang-Refsdal and binary lens with ${\sim}100\:{\rm M_\odot}-200\:{\rm M_\odot}$ can introduce significant de-amplification at frequencies ${\sim}100$ Hz when the source is close to caustics which may help us distinguish such lenses from the point mass lens.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic Waves in Cosmological Space-Time II. Luminosity Distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we continue our investigation on how the electromagnetic waves propagate in the Friedman-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker spacetime. Unlike the standard approach, which relies on null geodesics and geometric optics approximation, we derive explicit solutions for electromagnetic waves in expanding spacetime and examine their implications for cosmological observations. In particular, our analysis reveals potential modifications to the standard luminosity distance formula. Its effect on other cosmological parameters, e.g., the amount of cold dust matter in the Universe, is considered and estimated from Type Ia supernovae data. We see that this alternative model is able to fit the supernova data, but it gives a qualitatively different Universe without a cosmological constant but with stiff or ultra-stiff matter.</description>

      <title>Gravitational lensing and accretion disk imaging of a Buchdahl dense core</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the gravitational lensing and accretion disk imaging characteristics of a dense core modeled by the Buchdahl spacetime. By imposing the appropriate energy conditions and ensuring the absence of curvature singularities, we delineate the parameter space in which the dense core mimics key gravitational features of black holes while exhibiting unique deviations. We derive the photon orbital equation and calculate deflection angles, clearly distinguishing between weak- and strong-deflection regimes. Furthermore, we construct a mapping from the illuminated, geometrically thin accretion disk onto the observer's screen -- focusing on the isoradial curves corresponding to a representative source ring. For compactness values below a critical threshold, only a finite number of disk images are formed. In this range, their secondary and higher-order images typically display double-loop structures, with each loop individually capturing the entire source ring. Notably, the highest-order image sometimes appears as a single, crescent-shaped loop that does not enclose the screen's center, implying the existence of a cutoff angle that restricts the imaged portion of the source ring. In contrast, for compactness values above the critical threshold, an infinite sequence of double-loop structures appears -- a behavior closely linked to the presence of a photon sphere. These findings suggest that the lensing signatures of dense cores can distinguish them from black holes, offering new insights for high-resolution observations.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal modes of massive scalar fields in five-dimensional Myers-Perry black holes with two arbitrary rotation parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the quasinormal modes of massive scalar fields in the background of five-dimensional Myers-Perry black holes. In particular, we explore the case for Myers-Perry black holes with two arbitrary rotation parameters. Since the Klein-Gordon equation for the scalar field is separable, we numerically compute the scalar quasinormal modes by using the radial and angular equations. Two methods, the continued fraction method and matrix method, are used in the numerical calculation. We find that all obtained modes have negative imaginary parts and are decaying modes. We also consider the impact of the rotation parameters, scalar field mass $\mu$ and azimuthal numbers on the scalar quasinormal modes. Besides, when the scalar mass $\mu$ becomes relatively large, we also find the long-living scalar modes. Our numerical results also demonstrate the symmetries of the QNMs explicitly.</description>

      <title>Identification of Stochastic Gravitational Wave Backgrounds from Cosmic String Using Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmic strings play a crucial role in enhancing our understanding of the fundamental structure and evolution of the universe, unifying our knowledge of cosmology, and potentially unveiling new physical laws and phenomena. The advent and operation of space-based detectors provide an important opportunity for detecting stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds (SGWB) generated by cosmic strings. However, the intricate nature of SGWB poses a formidable challenge in distinguishing its signal from the complex noise by some traditional methods. Therefore, we attempt to identify SGWB based on machine learning. Our findings show that the joint detection of LISA and Taiji significantly outperforms individual detectors, and even in the presence of numerous low signal-to-noise ratio(SNR) signals, the identification accuracy remains exceptionally high with 95%. Although our discussion is based solely on simulated data, the relevant methods can provide data-driven analytical capabilities for future observations of SGWB.</description>

      <title>Gravitational lensing by charged black hole with global monopole in strong field limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate gravitational lensing near a charged black hole with a global monopole in the strong field regime, focusing on two key observables: the angular separation between the first and subsequent images, and the ratio of the flux intensity of the first image to the cumulative flux intensity of all other images. By deriving analytical expressions for these observables, we explore the combined effects of the global monopole and black hole charge both analytically and numerically. Our results reveal that the dependence of the angular separation on charge is intricately tied to the deficit angle caused by the global monopole. In particular, we identify three critical values of the global monopole parameter that determine whether the angular separation increases monotonically, decreases monotonically, or exhibits extrema as the charge varies. A similar complex dependence is found for the flux ratio as a function of the deficit angle. These behaviors contrast sharply with the monotonic changes observed in the absence of either a global monopole or charge. Our findings highlight that the effects of the charge and global monopole on gravitational lensing cannot be described as simple additive contributions. Instead, their combined effects lead to a rich and interdependent behavior that enhances our understanding of strong-field gravitational lensing. While the charge and global monopole are expected to be small in typical astrophysical contexts, the results presented here could be experimentally explored in analogue gravity systems, where these parameters are not constrained. This opens the door to potential experimental verification of the phenomena predicted in this study.</description>

      <title>SFTs: a scalable data-analysis framework for long-duration gravitational-wave signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a framework based on Short-time Fourier Transforms (SFTs) to analyze long-duration gravitational wave signals from compact binaries. Targeted systems include binary neutron stars observed by third-generation ground-based detectors and massive black-hole binaries observed by the LISA space mission. In short, ours is an extremely fast, scalable, and parallelizable implementation of the gravitational-wave inner product, a core operation of gravitational-wave matched filtering. By operating on disjoint data segments, SFTs allow for efficient handling of noise non-stationarities, data gaps, and detector-induced signal modulations. We present a pilot application to early warning problems in both ground- and space-based next-generation detectors. Overall, SFTs reduce the computing cost of evaluating an inner product by three to five orders of magnitude, depending on the specific application, with respect to a standard approach. We release public tools to operate using the SFT framework, including a vectorized and hardware-accelerated re-implementation of a time-domain waveform. The inner product is the key building block of all gravitational-wave data treatments; by speeding up this low-level element so massively, SFTs provide an extremely promising solution for current and future gravitational-wave data-analysis problem</description>

      <title>Quasi-Local Black Hole Horizons: Recent Advances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While the early literature on black holes focused on event horizons, subsequently it was realized that their teleological nature makes them unsuitable for many physical applications both in classical and quantum gravity. Therefore, over the past two decades, event horizons have been steadily replaced by quasi-local horizons which do not suffer from teleology. In numerical simulations event horizons can be located as an `after thought' only after the entire space-time has been constructed. By contrast, quasi-local horizons naturally emerge in the course of these simulations, providing powerful gauge-invariant tools to extract physics from the numerical outputs. They also lead to interesting results in mathematical GR, providing unforeseen insights. For example, for event horizons we only have a qualitative result that their area cannot decrease, while for quasi-local horizons the increase in the area during a dynamical phase is quantitatively related to local physical processes at the horizon. In binary black hole mergers, there are interesting correlations between observables associated with quasi-local horizons and those defined at future null infinity. Finally, the quantum Hawking process is naturally described as formation and evaporation of a quasi-local horizon. This review focuses on the dynamical aspects of quasi-local horizons in classical general relativity, emphasizing recent results and ongoing research.</description>

      <title>Axisymmetric black hole in a non-commutative gauge theory: classical and quantum gravity effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work explores both classical and quantum aspects of an axisymmetric black hole within a non-commutative gauge theory. The rotating solution is derived using a modified Newman-Janis procedure. The analysis begins with the horizon structure, ergospheres, and angular velocity. The thermodynamic properties are examined through surface gravity, focusing on the Hawking temperature, entropy, and heat capacity. In addition, the remnant mass is calculated. The Hawking radiation is treated as a tunneling process for bosonic and fermionic particles, along with the corresponding particle creation density. Geodesic motion is explored, emphasizing null geodesics, radial accelerations, the photon sphere, and black hole shadows. Finally, the gravitational lensing in the strong deflection limit is investigated.</description>

      <title>Novel Brans-Dicke Wormhole Solutions in Non-Vacuum Spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present study we search for a new class of wormhole solutions in the framework of Brans-Dicke (BD) theory in the presence of anisotropic matter distribution. Considering a linear equation of state (EoS) between radial pressure and energy density profile we find exact static spherically symmetric solutions to the BD field equations which represent wormhole configurations. The solutions we obtain include both cases with zero and nonzero redshift functions, for which, the conditions on wormhole geometry together with the weak (WEC) and null (NEC) energy conditions put constraints on model parameters such as, the BD coupling and EoS parameters. These constraints also depend on other model parameters such as, the value of BD scalar field and energy density at the wormhole throat. The regularity of the obtained solutions is verified by calculating the Kretschmann scalar in order to ensure that curvature singularities are absent in the wormhole spacetime. We then find that BD wormholes in the presence of anisotropic matter can exist without violating NEC and WEC, either at the throat or across the entire spacetime.</description>

      <title>Sampling the full hierarchical population posterior distribution in gravitational-wave astronomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a full sampling of the hierarchical population posterior distribution of merging black holes using current gravitational-wave data. We directly tackle the the most relevant intrinsic parameter space made of the binary parameters (masses, spin magnitudes, spin directions, redshift) of all the events entering the GWTC-3 LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA catalog, as well as the hyperparameters of the underlying population of sources. This results in a parameter space of about 500 dimensions, in contrast with current investigations where the targeted dimensionality is drastically reduced by marginalizing over all single-event parameters. In particular, we have direct access to (i) population parameters, (ii) population-informed single-event parameters, and (iii) correlations between these two sets of parameters. Our implementation relies on modern probabilistic programming languages and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, with a continuous interpolation of single-event posterior probabilities. Sampling the full hierarchical problem is feasible, as demonstrated here, and advantageous as it removes some (but not all) of the Monte Carlo integrations that enter the likelihood together with the related variances.</description>

      <title>No evidence for dynamical dark energy from DESI and SN data: a symbolic regression analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent measurements of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Survey (DESI), combined with data from the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and Type Ia supernovae (SNe), challenge the $\Lambda$-Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) paradigm. They indicate a potential evolution in the dark energy equation of state (EoS), $w(z)$, as suggested by analyses that employ parametric models. In this paper, we use a model-independent approach known as high performance symbolic regression (PySR) to reconstruct $w(z)$ directly from observational data, allowing us to bypass prior assumptions about the underlying cosmological model. Our findings confirm that the DESI data alone agree with the $\Lambda$CDM model ($w(z) = -1$) at the redshift range considered. Notably, this agreement improves slightly when we exclude the data point at $z = 0.51$. Additionally, we observe similar conclusions when combining the DESI data with existing compilations of SNe distance measurements, such as Pantheon+ and the Dark Energy Survey Supernova 5-Year, regardless of the absolute magnitude prior values used. Therefore, these results suggest that it is premature to claim any statistically significant evidence for a dynamical EoS or deviations from the $\Lambda$CDM model based on the current DESI data, either alone or in combination with supernova measurements.</description>

Abstract: The relativistic inverse stellar structure problem determines the equation of state of the stellar matter given a knowledge of suitable macroscopic observable properties (e.g. their masses and radii) of the stars composed of that material. This study determines how accurately this equation of state can be determined using noisy mass and radius observations. The relationship between the size of the observational errors and the accuracy of the inferred equation of state is evaluated, and the optimal number of adjustable equation of state parameters needed to achieve the highest accuracy is determined.</description>

Abstract: We evaluate the roles general relativistic assumptions play in simulations used in recent observations of black holes including LIGO-Virgo and the Event Horizon Telescope. In both experiments simulations play an ampliative role, enabling the extraction of more information from the data than would be possible otherwise. This comes at a cost of theory-ladenness. We discuss the issue of inferential circularity, which arises in some applications; classify some of the epistemic strategies used to reduce the extent of theory-ladenness; and discuss ways in which these strategies are model independent.</description>

      <title>Dynamical friction by coupled dark energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine dynamical friction at galactic scales within the framework of coupled dark energy. This model posits dark energy as coupled quintessence, which maintains a minimal coupling to gravity but interacts non-minimally with both dark matter and baryonic matter. Since our focus is primarily on the Newtonian regime within galaxies, we begin by deriving the Newtonian limit of the model. Subsequently, we calculate the dynamical friction force using three different approaches. We demonstrate that, in the absence of interaction between dark energy and matter, standard quintessence does not generate any dynamical friction at the galactic scale. However, the presence of interaction does cause dynamical friction. By applying the resulting analytic expressions to a real self-gravitating system, namely the Fornax galaxy, and by implementing the constraints on the free parameter of the model obtained from galactic observations, we demonstrate that the coupled dark energy model leads to significant deviations from the standard cold dark matter model at galactic scales. On the other hand, if the cosmological constraints are assumed for the free parameter, the effects of the model are expected to be negligible at the galactic level, at least in dynamical friction.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave lensing: probing Fuzzy Dark Matter with LISA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational lensing is a universal phenomenon: it affects both gravitational waves (GWs) and electromagnetic signals travelling through the gravitational field of a massive object. In this work, we explore the prospects of observing lensed GW signals from the mergers of massive black holes, lensed by dark matter halos composed of Fuzzy Dark Matter (FDM), which form dense cores known as solitons. We focus on wave optics phenomena, where frequency-dependent signatures can be observed in the weak lensing regime (i.e. single-image). Our results show that lensing diffraction signatures differ for low-mass halos in FDM, and can reveal the presence of a solitonic core. Furthermore, we demonstrate that FDM and cold dark matter profiles can be distinguished in GW signals from binary massive black hole mergers, which will be observed by the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) mission. However, the dense solitonic core does not substantially enhance the detectability of FDM halos at large source-lens offsets, relative to standard cold dark matter. Our analysis confirms FDM halos as a promising signature of dark matter on GW observations</description>

      <title>Holographic timelike entanglement and $c$ theorem for supersymmetric QFTs in ($ 0+1 $)d</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a holographic set up that computes timelike Entanglement Entropy (tEE) in $ (0+1) $d QFTs preserving some amount of SUSY. The first example we consider is that of $\mathcal{N}=2$ matrix models with massive deformations. These are dual to non-Abelian T-dual of $AdS_5 \times S^5$ that asymptotes to \emph{smeared} D0 branes. The second example, that we consider is of $ \mathcal{N}=4 $ superconformal quantum mechanical quivers in ($ 0+1 $)d that are dual to a class of type IIB backgrounds with an $ AdS_2 $ factor. In both of these examples, tEE reveals a remarkable similarity with holographic $ c $ function pertaining to a RG flow. We further compute the complexity in these models, which also reveals an identical behaviour indicating the fact that tEE is a measure of number of degrees of freedom for these ($ 0+1 $)d SQFTs in a RG flow from UV to deep IR.</description>

      <title>Hyperdeterminism? Spacetime 'Analyzed'</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When modelling spacetime and classical physical fields, one typically assumes smoothness (infinite differentiability). But this assumption and its philosophical implications have not been sufficiently scrutinized. For example, we can appeal to analytic functions instead, which are also often used by physicists. Doing so leads to very different philosophical interpretations of a theory. For instance, our world would be 'hyperdeterministic' with analytic functions, in the sense that every field configuration is uniquely determined by its restriction to an arbitrarily small region. Relatedly, the hole argument of general relativity does not get off the ground. We argue that such an appeal to analytic functions is technically feasible and, conceptually, not obviously objectionable. The moral is to warn against rushing to draw philosophical conclusions from physical theories, given their drastic sensitivity to mathematical formalisms.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we explore the effects of shear deformations in a wide class of holographic amorphous solids. It is found that both the shear stress and the complexity of formation grow with the increase of the shear strain. Notably, in the regime of very large shear, they exhibit coordinated behavior and adhere to a universal scaling relation, uncovering a surprising connection between two seemingly unrelated aspects of amorphous systems. Furthermore, our findings also provide a counterexample to the previous understanding that the complexity scales linearly with the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy for large static black holes.</description>

      <title>Observable-based reformulation of time-delay interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spaceborne gravitational-wave observatories utilize a post-processing technique known as time-delay interferometry (TDI) to reduce the otherwise overwhelming laser frequency noise by around eight orders of magnitude. While, in its traditional form, TDI considers the spacecraft as point masses, recent studies have enhanced this simplified scenario by incorporating more realistic metrology chain models, which include onboard optical, electronic, and digital delays. These studies have updated the TDI algorithm to include onboard delays obtained from pre-launch and in-flight calibrations. Conversely, the processing scheme presented in this article naturally treats onboard delays as part of the TDI combinations: instead of having separate calibration stages, it directly expresses all delays appearing in the algorithm in terms of onboard measurements, especially pseudo-random-noise ranging (PRNR) measurements. The only onboard delays that need to be corrected in our processing scheme are PRNR delays in the digital domain, which are determined by commandable digital-signal-processing parameters; hence, they can be easily managed in post-processing. Furthermore, our processing scheme does not require a prior interspacecraft clock synchronization, and it automatically corrects for potential relative drifts between the clocks driving local phase measurement systems. The proposed observable-based processing scheme significantly strengthens the bond between TDI and the real metrology system.</description>

      <title>Natural weak mixing angle under $\text{U}(1, 3)$ colored gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Colored gravity, based on $\text{U}(1,3)$ symmetry, emerges naturally in the complexification of Lorentzian manifolds and integrates U(1) electromagnetism as a subcase. This work explores the viability of also including strong and electroweak interactions under the $\text{U}(1,3)$ gauge group of colored gravity. We identify specific generators linked to leptonic and quark interactions and embed the standard Higgs mechanism. Crucially, the weak mixing angle ($\sin^2\theta_W$) is predicted to exhibit about $\sim0.231$ for lepton-lepton interactions (close to observations) and $\sim0.222$ for hadron-lepton interactions, which is in 3$\sigma$ tension with some observations. These findings open pathways for reconciling experimental data with colored gravity and suggest avenues for quantum correction studies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11403v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The horizon of black hole is surrounded by the photon sphere and an outside observer cannot easily examine the geometry inside the photon sphere. In this note, we propose a way to investigate the region from dual conformal field theory by making use of AdS/CFT correspondence. We first construct gravaster geometry as an asymptotic anti-de Sitter spacetime, where the region inside the photon sphere is replaced by a horizon-less geometry. It is known that bulk-cone singularities in the retarded Green function in dual conformal field theory can encode the bulk null geodesics. We then compute numerically the retarded Green function from the bulk theory and observe bulk-cone singularities corresponding to null geodesics traveling into the interior region. In this way, we show that it is possible to examine the region inside the photon sphere from bulk-cone singularities of dual conformal field theory.</description>

      <title>The nature of gravitational wave events with host environment escape velocities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel method to probe the parameters and origin channels of gravitational wave events using the escape velocities of their host environments. This method could lead to more convergent posterior distributions offering additional insights into the physical properties, formation, and evolution of the sources. It also enables testing general relativity and improves source localization, which the latter is instrumental in multi-messenger astronomy. The method provides more accurate parameter estimation for events that represent previous mergers in the hierarchical triple merger scenario and is valuable for the search for such mergers with third-generation ground-based detectors. To demonstrate this approach, we take six recently identified events in LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA data, considered as potential previous mergers in hierarchical triple mergers, as examples. The use of escape velocities results in posterior spin distributions that are concentrated near zero, aligning with the expected birth spins of first-generation black holes formed from the collapse of stars. The uncertainty in the posterior primary mass distribution is significantly reduced comparing with the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA distributions, especially for events originating from globular clusters. We rule out the possibility that GW190512, GW170729, and GW190708 originates from globular clusters as previous mergers in the hierarchical triple merger scenario.</description>

      <title>Instability of marginally outer trapped surfaces from initial data set symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $(\tilde{\Sigma},h_{ab},K_{ab})$ be an initial data set and let $x^a$ be a symmetry vector of $\tilde{\Sigma}$. Consider a MOTS $\mathcal{S}$ in $\tilde{\Sigma}$ and let the symmetry vector be decomposable along the unit normal to $\mathcal{S}$ in $\tilde{\Sigma}$, and along $\mathcal{S}$. In this note we present some basic results with regards to the stability of $\mathcal{S}$. The vector decomposition allows us to characterize the instability of $\mathcal{S}$ by the nature of the zero set of the normal component to $\mathcal{S}$ and the divergence of the component along $\mathcal{S}$. Further observations are made under the assumption of $\mathcal{S}$ having a constant mean curvature, and $\tilde{\Sigma}$ being an Einstein manifold.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adding a sine-type interaction to inflationary models with two fields can evoke a classical trajectory with many turns in field space. Under conditions we discuss, the enhancement of the spectrum of adiabatic fluctuations resulting from each turn adds up. A special range of scales away from the CMB-constrained region can then be enhanced by several orders of magnitude, allowing for interesting phenomenological possibilities, such as induced gravitational waves or primordial black holes. A localized version of this interaction can also be used as an add-on to conventional inflationary models, thus allowing the injection of the large peak in their power spectra. The intuition and the conclusions drawn from this simple model remain relevant for more complicated applications that usually include extra terms that obscure the simplicity of the mechanism.</description>

      <title>Exploring lensing signatures through spectrotemporal correlations: implications for black hole parameter estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extreme gravitational lensing and relativistic frequency shifts, combined together, imply that radiation emitted from a black hole's vicinity can echo at different frequencies and times, leading to spectrotemporal correlations in observed signals. If such correlations are uncovered by future observations, they could provide a probe of the spacetime geometry in the strong-field region near black holes. Here, motivated by these prospects, we numerically compute the two-point correlation function of specific flux fluctuations in a simple model of line emission by a hotspot in an equatorial circular orbit. We make use of the Adaptive Analytical Ray Tracing (AART) code to generate the light curves we then correlate. Our results for the correlation maps show a clear decomposition into direct emission-dominated, and lensing-dominated contributions. The computation transcends past analytical approximations, studying the main contribution to the correlation function, which is not deep in the universal regime. We compute correlation maps for many combinations of black hole mass, spin, inclination, hotspot width, and orbital radius, and study their dependence on these parameters. The correlation maps are then used to train convolutional neural networks which can be used to estimate source parameters, achieving promisingly low evaluation errors within the model. Our results could be relevant for future X-ray spectroscopic missions, offering insights into black hole parameter inference.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, several papers have claimed that superhorizon curvature perturbations are not conserved at the one-loop level in single-field inflation models if there is a transient ultra-slow-roll period. In this work, we point out that the contributions from the counterterms were overlooked in the recent papers. We show that the counterterm contributions play a crucial role in canceling the one-loop power spectrum of superhorizon curvature perturbations in the comoving gauge.</description>

      <title>A nested sequence of inequivalent Rindler vacua : Universal Relic Thermality of Planckian origin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.03406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2107.03406v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Bogoliubov transformation connecting the standard inertial frame mode functions to the standard mode functions defined in the Rindler frame $R_0$, leads to the result that the inertial vacuum appears as a thermal state with temperature $T_0=a_0/2\pi$ where $a_0$ is the acceleration parameter of $R_0$. We construct an infinite family of nested Rindler-like coordinate systems $R_1, R_2, ...$ within the right Rindler wedge, with time coordinates $\tau_1, \tau_2, ...,$ and acceleration parameters $a_1, a_2, ...$ by shifting the origin along the inertial $x$-axis by amounts $\ell_1, \ell_2,\cdots$. We show that, apart from the inertial vacuum, the \textit{Rindler vacuum} of the frame $R_n$ also appears to be a thermal state in the frame $R_{n+1}$ with the temperature $a_{n+1}/2\pi$. \textit{In fact, the Rindler frame $R_{n+1}$ attributes to all the Rindler vacuum states of $R_1, R_2, ... R_n$, as well as to the inertial vacuum state, the same temperature $a_{n+1}/2\pi$.} We further show that our result is discontinuous in an essential way in the coordinate shift parameters. For a Rindler frame $R_i$, this thermality {\it turns on} with smallest non-zero $\ell_i$ allowed in the semiclassical framework and remains insensitive to $(\ell_i,a_{i-1})$ thereafter, indicating its universal Planckian origin. Similar structures can be introduced in the right wedge of any spacetime with bifurcate Killing horizon, like, for e.g., Schwarzschild spacetime. Apart from providing unsuppressed observables capturing Planck scale effects, these results have important implications for quantum gravity when flat spacetime is treated as the ground state of quantum gravity.

      <title>Can Chameleon fields be the source of both the dark energy dipole and the CMB dipole?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2203.03983v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent research reveals that the Local Group is in motion towards $(l, b) = (276, 30)$ relative to the cosmic background radiation, manifesting a velocity of 600 $\frac{km}{s}$ a phenomenon recognized as the cosmic background radiation dipole or CMB dipole. Despite its well-documented nature, the precise cause of this peculiar motion remains elusive. High mass-density regions, such as galactic superclusters, stand out among the potential contributors to this cosmic flow. This paper employs chameleon fields to investigate anisotropies on both small and large scales. The data utilized in this study comprise Type Ia supernovae from the Pantheon catalog, totaling 1,048 supernovae within the redshift range of $0.015 &lt; z &lt; 2.3$. The analysis of bulk flow at various redshifts has yielded noteworthy discoveries. On a smaller scale (less than 150 Mpc), the movement direction of the Local Group coincides with that of the bulk flow. On a larger scale, the bulk flow direction corresponds to the direction of the dark energy dipole. This implies that the anisotropy at the local scale originates from the same source as the anisotropy observed on a larger scale.</description>

      <title>Regular black hole from regular initial data</title>

Abstract: Recently, there has been an interest in exploring black holes that are regular in the sense that the central curvature singularity is avoided. Here, we depict a method to obtain a regular black hole (RBH) spacetime from the unhindered gravitational collapse, beginning with regular initial data of a spherically symmetric perfect fluid. In other words, we obtain the equilibrium (static) spacetime $(\mathcal{M}, \Tilde{g})$ as a limiting case of the time-evolving (non-stationary) spacetime $(\mathcal{M}, g)$. In the spirit of Joshi, Malafarina and Narayan (\textit{Class. Quantum Grav. 31, 015002, 2014}), our description of gravitational collapse is implicit in nature in the sense that we do not describe the data at each time-slice. Rather, we impose a condition in terms of geometric and matter variables for the collapse to have an end-state that is devoid of incomplete geodesics but admits a marginally trapped surface (MTS). The admission of MTS causally disconnects two mutually exclusive regions $\Hat{\mathcal{M}}_1$ and $\Hat{\mathcal{M}}_2\subset \mathcal{M}$ in the sense that $\forall~p\in\Hat{\mathcal{M}_2}$, the causal past of $p$ does not intersect $\Hat{\mathcal{M}}_1$. While the classic Oppenheimer-Snyder collapse model necessarily produces a black hole with a Schwarzschild singularity at the centre, we show here that there are classes of regular initial conditions for which the collapse gives rise to a RBH.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.09105v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: What if gravity is classical? If true, a consistent co-existence of classical gravity and quantum matter requires that gravity exhibit irreducible fluctuations. These fluctuations can mediate classical correlations, but not quantum entanglement, between the quantized motion of the gravitationally interacting matter. We use a consistent theory of quantum-classical dynamics in the Newtonian limit of gravity to show that experimentally relevant observables can conclusively test the hypothesis that gravity is classical. This can be done for example by letting highly coherent source masses interact with each other gravitationally, and performing precise measurements of the cross-correlation of their motion. Theory predicts a characteristic phase response that distinguishes classical gravity from quantum gravity, and from naive sources of decoherence. Such experiments are imminently viable.</description>

      <title>Solving the Regge-Wheeler and Teukolsky equations: supervised versus unsupervised physics-informed neural networks</title>

Abstract: To expand on the burgeoning research on physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and their ability to solve the eigenvalue problems in black hole (BH) perturbation theory, we implement a supervised learning approach to solve the Regge-Wheeler and Teukolsky equations, the equations of gravitational perturbations of Schwarzschild and Kerr BHs, respectively. To date, applications of PINNs using the data-free (unsupervised) learning approach have proven their ability to compute quasinormal mode frequencies of BHs, quantities with physical significance in gravitational wave astronomy. To investigate the potential use of PINNs to compute quasinormal mode overtones higher than the low-lying $n=0$ and $n=1$ modes (with $n$ indexing overtones), the present work has instead applied the supervised approach to simplify computations. Consistent with the universal approximation theory of neural networks, it is found that the PINN algorithm has the intrinsic ability to recover the complex frequencies for various spin sequences (i.e. $s=-2$, $a \in \{0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4\}$, $\ell = 2$, $m \in \{0, 1, 2\}$, $n \in \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\}$), with approximation errors increasing with the rotation parameter $a$ and overtone number $n$ as a result of the residuals from the training data.</description>

      <title>Photon Counting Interferometry to Detect Geontropic Space-Time Fluctuations with GQuEST</title>

Abstract: The GQuEST (Gravity from the Quantum Entanglement of Space-Time) experiment uses tabletop-scale Michelson laser interferometers to probe for fluctuations in space-time. We present a practicable interferometer design featuring a novel photon counting readout method that provides unprecedented sensitivity, as it is not subject to the interferometric standard quantum limit. We evaluate the potential of this design to measure space-time fluctuations motivated by recent `geontropic' quantum gravity models. The accelerated accrual of Fisher information offered by the photon counting readout enables GQuEST to detect the predicted quantum gravity phenomena within measurement times at least 100 times shorter than equivalent conventional interferometers. The GQuEST design thus enables a fast and sensitive search for signatures of quantum gravity in a laboratory-scale experiment.</description>

      <title>Possible Causes of False General Relativity Violations in Gravitational Wave Observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02197v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: General relativity (GR) has proven to be a highly successful theory of gravity since its inception. The theory has thrivingly passed numerous experimental tests, predominantly in weak gravity, low relative speeds, and linear regimes, but also in the strong-field and very low-speed regimes with binary pulsars. Observable gravitational waves (GWs) originate from regions of spacetime where gravity is extremely strong, making them a unique tool for testing GR, in previously inaccessible regions of large curvature, relativistic speeds, and strong gravity. Since their first detection, GWs have been extensively used to test GR, but no deviations have been found so far. Given GR's tremendous success in explaining current astronomical observations and laboratory experiments, accepting any deviation from it requires a very high level of statistical confidence and consistency of the deviation across GW sources. In this paper, we compile a comprehensive list of potential causes that can lead to a false identification of a GR violation in standard tests of GR on data from current and future ground-based GW detectors. These causes include detector noise, signal overlaps, gaps in the data, detector calibration, source model inaccuracy, missing physics in the source and in the underlying environment model, source misidentification, and mismodeling of the astrophysical population. We also provide a rough estimate of when each of these causes will become important for tests of GR for different detector sensitivities. We argue that each of these causes should be thoroughly investigated, quantified, and ruled out before claiming a GR violation in GW observations.</description>

      <title>$f(Q,L_m)$ gravity, and its cosmological implications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00989v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the present work, we extend the $f(Q)$ symmetric teleparallel gravity by introducing an arbitrary coupling between the non-metricity $Q$ and matter Lagrangian $L_m$ in the Lagrangian density $f$ of the theory, which thus leads to the $f\left(Q,L_m\right)$ theory. This generalisation encompasses Coincident General Relativity (CGR), and the Symmetric Teleparallel Equivalent to GR (STEGR). Using the metric formalism, we derive the field equation of the theory, which generalizes the field equations of $f(Q)$ gravity. From the study of the covariant divergence of the field equations, it follows that the presence of the geometry-matter coupling leads to the non-conservation of the matter energy-momentum tensor. The cosmological implications of the theory are investigated in the case of a flat, homogeneous, and isotropic Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker geometry. As a first step in this direction, we obtain the modified Friedmann equations for the $f(Q,L_m)$ gravity in a general form. Specific cosmological models are investigated for several choices of $f(Q,L_m)$, including $f(Q,L_m)=-\alpha Q + 2L_m + \beta$, and $f(Q,L_m)=- \alpha Q + (2L_m)^2 + \beta$, respectively. Comparative analyses with the standard $\Lambda$ CDM paradigm are carried out, and the observational implications of the models are investigated in detail.</description>

      <title>Gravitational odd-parity perturbation of a Horndeski hairy black hole: quasinormal mode and parameter constraint</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07418v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: During the binary black hole coalescence, gravitational waves emitted at the ringdown stage can be well described by black hole perturbation theory, where the quasinormal modes (QNMs) become the important ingredient in modeling the pattern waveform. In general relativity (GR), the QNMs can be obtained from solving the Regge-Wheeler (RW) equation of a non-rotating black hole. While in Horndeski gravity, the isospectrality between the odd and even parity perturbations is broken due to the scalar field, but the odd perturbation equation can be simplified into a modified RW equation from the perturbed action. In this paper, we propose a new auxiliary field and tortoise coordinate to refine the modified RW equation in Horndeski gravity, and calculate the QNMs frequencies of the odd perturbation of a specific hairy black hole. It is found that this proposal not only cures the superluminal propagation addressed in the previous literature, but also hold the original QNM spectrum of the odd perturbation. Moreover, our results indicate that such a Horndeski hairy black hole is stable under the odd perturbation, which is also verified by the time evolution of the perturbation. In particular, in contrary to GR, the modes with $\ell=2$ can decay faster than modes with $\ell&gt;2$ for a certain range of the Horndeski hair, and the link between the null geodesics and QNM for the odd perturbation in the current theory is violated. Then, we use the ringdown QNMs to preliminarily investigate the signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) rescaled measurement error of the Horndeski hair. We obtain significant effects of the angular momentum and overtone on the error bound of the hair parameter. We hope that our findings could inspire more theoretical and phenomenological work on the test of the no-hair theorem of black hole using gravitational wave physics.</description>

      <title>Unveiling a multi-component stochastic gravitational-wave background with the TianQin + LISA network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00778v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Space-borne detectors, including TianQin and Laser Interferometry Space Antenna (LISA), are tasked with simultaneously observing the Galactic foreground, astrophysical and cosmological stochastic gravitational-wave backgrounds (SGWBs). For the first time, we employ a space-borne detector network to identify these SGWBs. Specifically, we develop a tailored likelihood for cross-correlation detection with such networks. Combined with the likelihood, we use the simulated datasets of the TianQin + LISA network to conduct an analysis for model selection and parameter estimation. In our analysis, we adopt an astrophysical background originating from extragalactic white-dwarf binaries, along with a flat cosmological background associated with the early Universe. Our results indicate that, after 4 years of operation, the network could detect a single SGWB from either astrophysical or cosmological origins, with an energy density $\Omega_{\rm ast/cos}$ (10 mHz) on the order of $10^{-12}$, despite the presence of a Galactic foreground. Furthermore, to distinguish the cosmological background from both a Galactic foreground and an extragalactic background produced by white-dwarf binaries, the energy density $\Omega_{\rm cos}$ should reach around $2\times 10^{-11}$.</description>

      <title>Gravitational radiation from binary systems in Unimodular gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02909v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unimodular gravity (UG) is classically considered identical to General Relativity (GR). However, due to restricted diffeomorphism symmetry, the Bianchi identites do not lead to the conservation of energy-momentum tensor. Thus, the conservation of energy-momentum tensor needs to be separately assumed in order to reconcile with GR. Relaxing this assumption, one finds that the conservation violation can lead to differences with GR, which can be subsequently examined in astrophysical and cosmological scenarios. To this end, we examine the predictions of UG in the context of binary systems emitting gravitational radiation. Primarily, we show how the field equations involve a diffusion function which quantifies the measure of non-conservation. Due to this violation, the dispersion relation is modified. Incorporating these changes, we provide an expression for the energy loss by the binaries, which reduces to Peters-Mathews result in the GR limit. Using binary pulsar data, we constrain the theory parameter $\zeta$ (which signifies non-conservation) by determining the rate of orbital decay. The strongest constrain on $\zeta$ comes out to be $\vert \zeta \vert \leq 5\times 10^{-4}$ which is better by an order of magnitude than an existing equivalent constraint coming from the tidal deformability of the neutron stars.</description>

Abstract: The ringdown phase following a binary black hole coalescence is a powerful tool for measuring properties of the remnant black hole. Future gravitational wave detectors will increase the precision of these measurements and may be sensitive to the environment surrounding the black hole. This work examines how environments affect the ringdown from a binary coalescence. Our analysis shows that for astrophysical parameters and sensitivity of planned detectors, the ringdown signal is indistinguishable from its vacuum counterpart, suggesting that ringdown-only analyses can reliably extract the (redshifted) mass and spin of the remnant black hole. These conclusions include models with spectral instabilities, suggesting that these are not relevant from an observational viewpoint. Deviations from inspiral-only estimates could then enhance the characterisation of environmental effects present during the coalescence.</description>

      <title>A Unified Framework for Analyzing Gravitational Wave Effects in Modified Gravity Theories Based on the Isaacson Picture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11838v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Isaacson picture is established on two sets of basic equations and provides a necessary foundation for discussing gravitational wave effects without ambiguity. It is typically derived by expanding the field equations to second-order perturbations. In addition to the above method, the perturbation action method can also serve as an alternative derivation method. In this paper, we elaborate on this method, establishing its foundations more rigorously. Especially, the second-order perturbation action in the Minkowski background encapsulates all the required information for constructing the Isaacson picture far from the source. This approach provides a method that, in principle, allows for the construction of a model-independent parametric framework, encompassing the vast majority of modified gravitational theories. It enables a unified and generalized analysis of various gravitational wave effects across these theories, including the polarization modes, velocity dispersion relations, effective energy-momentum tensor, and memory effects. These properties have garnered significant attention due to their close connection with observable effects and are expected to be identified by the next generation of gravitational wave detectors, which aim to test potential modifications to gravity theory. We demonstrate this method using the most general second-order vector-tensor theory, including parity-violation terms, as an example, and specifically analyze the polarization modes of gravitational waves in this theory.</description>

Abstract: Detections of gravitational waves since GW150914 has gained renewed interest in potential quantum-classical correspondences between GWs and gravitons. While a complete quantum theory of gravity remains elusive, graviton fluctuations have been hypothesized as sources of stochastic noise in gravitational interactions. This study heuristically models a coalescing binary as a rotating, contracting Gaussian volume, treating gravitons within the gravitational bulk as an effectively thermal gas. Applying the Einstein-Langevin equation, we establish a scaling relation where quanta dissipation depends inversely with the contracting volume. Using an Euler iteration scheme, we simulate gravitonic Brownian motion throughout coalescence, revealing stochastic fluctuations that qualitatively resemble macroscopic GW waveforms. While inherently heuristic, this approach provides a computational framework for exploring graviton-scale perturbations in GW formation, with reproducible implementations in Wolfram Mathematica and equivalent Python code in the appendix.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10549v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The de Sitter state and the static Einstein Universe are the unique states, which have constant Ricci scalar curvature ${\cal R}$. Earlier it was shown that such unique symmetry of the de Sitter state leads to the special thermodynamic properties of this state, which are determined by the local temperature $T=1/(\pi R)$, where $R$ is the radius of the cosmological horizon. Then, what happens in static Universe? We consider the Einstein Universe, which has boundary. This can be the real physical boundary, or the border between two halves of the $R\times S^3$ Universe, if there is no contact between the halves. It appears that the static Einstein Universe with boundary is characterized by the same local temperature $T=1/(\pi R)$ as the de Sitter state. The thermodynamics of the bounded Einstein Universe is also similar to that of de Sitter. If this Universe contains Zel'dovich stiff matter, there is the holographic connection between the entropy of the Universe and the surface entropy $A/4G$ of the boundary. This means that in thermodynamics the physical boundary of the static Einstein Universe plays the role of the de Sitter cosmological horizon.</description>

Abstract: We present exact solutions describing a fake Schwarzschild black hole that cannot be distinguished from the Schwarzschild black hole by observations. They are constructed by attaching a spherically symmetric dynamical interior solution with a matter field to the Schwarzschild exterior solution at the event horizon without a lightlike thin shell. The dynamical region inside a Killing horizon of a static spherically symmetric perfect-fluid solution obeying an equation of state $p=\chi\rho$ for $\chi\in[-1/3,0)$ can be the interior of a fake Schwarzschild black hole. The matter field inside such a black hole is an anisotropic fluid that violates at least the weak energy condition and can be interpreted as a spacelike (tachyonic) perfect fluid. While the author constructed the first model of fake Schwarzschild black holes using Semiz's solution for $\chi=-1/5$, we present another one using Whittaker's solution for $\chi=-1/3$ in this paper. We also present a model of fake Kerr black holes whose interior is filled with a different matter field violating only the dominant energy condition near the event horizon. Whether a fake Schwarzschild or Kerr black hole can be realized under the dominant energy condition is an open question.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous Vectorization in the Einstein-Maxwell-Vector Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16920v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate spontaneous vectorization in the Einstein-Maxwell-Vector (EMV) model, introducing a novel mechanism driven by the interplay between electromagnetic and vector fields. A key innovation in our work is the resolution of an apparent divergence in the vector field near the event horizon, achieved by employing a generalized coordinate transformation. This not only extends the domain of existence for vectorized Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes (VRNBHs), but also refines the theoretical understanding of such solutions. We introduce a new concept of combined charge $\sqrt{\tilde{Q}^2 + \tilde{P}^2}$, which better captures the underlying physics of these black holes and provides a unified framework for analyzing thermodynamics and observable phenomena such as light ring structures. Our findings suggest that VRNBHs exhibit enhanced thermodynamic preference and distinctive light ring properties compared to Reissner-Nordstr\"om solutions. Moreover, we demonstrate how this combined charge approach reveals connections to two-charge black hole solutions, offering promising avenues for observational verification within the context of effective field theories.</description>

      <title>Dark universe inspired by the Kaluza-Klein gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14176v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the potential implications of Kaluza-Klein (KK) gravity in unifying the dark sector of the Universe. Through dimensional reduction in KK gravity, the 5D spacetime framework can be reformulated in terms of a 4D spacetime metric, along with additional scalar and vector fields. From the 4D perspective, this suggests the existence of a tower of particle states, including KK gravitons with massive spin-0 and spin-1 states, in addition to the massless spin-2 gravitons of general relativity (GR). The key idea in the present paper is the analogy with superconductivity theory. By assuming a minimal coupling between an additional complex scalar field and the gauge field, a "mass" term emerges for the spin-1 gravitons. This, in turn, leads to long-range gravitational effects that could modify Newton's law of gravity through Yukawa-type corrections. Assuming an environment-dependent mass for the spin-1 graviton, near the galactic center the repulsive force from this spin-1 graviton is suppressed by an additional attractive component from Newton's constant corrections, resulting in a Newtonian-like, attraction-dominated effect. In the galaxy's outer regions, the repulsive force fades due to its short range, making dark matter appear only as an effective outcome of the dominant attractive corrections. This approach also explains dark matter's emergence as an apparent effects on cosmological scales while our model is equivalent to the scalar-vector-tensor gravity theory. Finally, we examine the impact of dark matter on the primordial gravitational wave (PGW) spectrum and show that it is sensitive to dark matter effects, providing an opportunity to test this theory through future GW observatories.</description>

Abstract: Models of evaporating black holes are constructed using the new solutions of Einstein's equations with perfect fluid in space-times with FLRW asymptotic behaviour derived recently [I. I. Cotaescu, Eur. Phys. J. C (2022) 82:86]. The dynamics of these models is exclusively due to the interplay between black holes and their environments, without resorting to additional matter sources or thermodynamic considerations. During evaporation the black hole mass dissipates into a cloud of dust which replaces the black hole while the background expands tending to the asymptotic one.</description>

      <title>Frolov Black Hole Surrounded by Quintessence - II: Quasinormal Modes, Greybody Factors, Deflection Angle and Chaos Bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09143v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we have examined the scalar quasinormal modes, greybody factors, weak gravitational lensing, and the chaos bound of a Frolov black hole surrounded by a quintessence field. We studied the quasinormal frequencies and deduced that an increase in the value of the quintessence parameter $c$ dissipates the oscillatory behavior and thus slow down the decay of perturbations. The greybody factors are highly dependent on the multipole moment $l$ and BH parameters, with a larger $q$ hindering the transmission and smaller $\alpha_0$ making the barrier steeper. The deflection angle of weak lensing under thin lens approximation, monotonically decreases as the value of impact parameter $b$ increases, and is visibly affected by the parameter $c$, and that $\alpha_0$ and $q$ has very minimal effect. Lastly, we investigated the chaos bound behaviour of photon trajectories in the near-horizon neighbourhood, which indicates that it is satisfied for bigger circular photon orbits but broken for smaller ones, with high-angular-momentum photons being chaotic. This violation of the bound points towards the role of quintessence in modifying the thermodynamic features of the BH, with possible adjustments to the standard Bekenstein-Hawking entropy.</description>

      <title>Searching for stellar-origin binary black holes in LISA Data Challenge 1b: Yorsh</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10501v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper reports the first search for stellar-origin binary black holes within the LISA Data Challenges (LDC). The search algorithm and the \Yorsh{} LDC datasets, both previously described elsewhere, are only summarized briefly; the primary focus here is to present the results of applying the search to the challenge of data. The search employs a hierarchical approach, leveraging semi-coherent matching of template waveforms to the data using a variable number of segments, combined with a particle swarm algorithm for parameter space exploration. The computational pipeline is accelerated using graphical processing unit (GPU) hardware. The results of two searches using different models of the LISA response are presented. The most effective search finds all five sources in the data challenge with injected signal-to-noise ratios $\gtrsim 12$. Rapid parameter estimation is performed for these sources.</description>

      <title>Repulsive quantum gravitoelectric-gravitomagnetic interaction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02470v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate, in the framework of linearized quantum gravity, the quantum gravitational interaction between a gravitoelectrically polarizable object and a gravitomagnetically polarizable object. This interaction originates from the coupling between the instantaneous mass quadrupole moment and the mass-current quadrupole moment of the objects, induced by fluctuating gravitoelectric and gravitomagnetic fields in a vacuum. Using leading-order perturbation theory, we derive the explicit expression of the quantum gravitoelectric-gravitomagnetic interaction energy, which shows a distance dependence of $r^{-8}$ in the near regime and $r^{-11}$ in the far regime, where $r$ is the distance between the two objects. Remarkably, this interaction energy is positive, indicating that the force is repulsive. Since interactions between objects polarizable in the same gravitoelectric or gravitomagnetic manner are inherently attractive, for objects which are both gravitoelectrically and gravitomagnetically polarizable, the overall quantum gravitational interaction potential is reduced when the repulsive quantum gravitoelectric-gravitomagnetic interaction is taken into account. However, for two isotropically polarizable objects with identical gravitoelectric and gravitomagnetic polarizabilities and energy level spacing, the repulsive quantum interaction cannot surpass the attractive interactions.</description>

Abstract: Inertia of a particle is due to its mass as well as intrinsic spin. The latter is revealed via the coupling of intrinsic spin with rotation. The spin-rotation coupling and the concomitant spin-gravity coupling are discussed in connection with the nature of inertia. The spin-rotation-gravity coupling leads to a gravitomagnetic Stern-Gerlach type of force on the particle that is independent of the particle's mass and thus violates the universality of free fall. This effect is extremely small and its measurement is far beyond present capabilities.</description>

Abstract: We investigate a recently proposed one-to-one correspondence between quantum field theories in two-dimensional curved spacetime and quantum many-body systems, which enables the simulation of Hawking radiation in static background spacetimes. In particular, we demonstrate that deviations from the thermal spectrum, as predicted by the well-known tunneling method, can be observed in many-body simulations.</description>

      <title>The Statistical Mechanics of Hawking Radiation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08816v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hawking radiation and black hole thermodynamics are well understood in the frameworks of quantum field theory and general relativity, with contemporary extensions in string theory, AdS/CFT, and loop quantum gravity. However, an open question remains: Can Hawking radiation be consistently described using statistical mechanics? This challenge arises due to the ambiguous quantum nature of Hawking particles and constraints imposed by information conservation. This study develops a heuristic statistical model using a worldine Lagrangian formalism, treating Hawking particles as timelike with an effective mass and following an arbitrary statistical distribution. The flow of information is modeled as a transfer of microstates from the event horizon to the radiation background within a closed ensemble. From this framework, the Hawking particle mass $m_H=\hbar/(2\pi r_S)$ is recovered, and the worldline Lagrangian yields the black hole's thermal energy, $E=\hbar/(8\pi GM)$. Beyond preserving conventional insights, reinforcing the statistical nature of black hole evaporation, this approach introduces novel perspectives: modeling the black hole as a structured energy well containing microstates, quantifying the evaporation rate of individual microstates, and determining the total number of microstates from the horizon's surface area. This study leaves the door open for a stochastic mechanical analysis, which is introduced in the Discussion section.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.00171v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: AdS supergravity admits supersymmetric solutions that describe BPS defects. Here, we investigate such solutions in AdS$_3$ supergravity, which is formulated as a Chern-Simons theory on $\mathrm{OSp}(2|1)\,\times\, \mathrm{OSp}(2|1)$. We compute the Killing spinor equation on the BTZ geometry in different ways, looking for BPS solutions on the entire space of parameters. We focus our attention on defects that represent geometries with integer angular excesses; these correspond to specific negative values of the BTZ mass. We compare our solutions with other results in the literature, finding exact agreement. We argue that, in the semiclassical limit, the BPS defects can be associated to degenerate representations of the Virasoro symmetry at the boundary. The case of non-diagonal representations, describing stationary, non-static defects, is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Properties of Dynamical Black Hole Entropy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07140v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the first law for non-stationary perturbations of a stationary black hole whose event horizon is a Killing horizon, that relates the first-order change in the mass and angular momentum to the change in the entropy of an arbitrary horizon cross-section. Recently, Hollands, Wald and Zhang [1] have shown that the dynamical black hole entropy that satisfies this first law, for general relativity, is $S_{\text{dyn}}=(1-v\partial_v)S_{\text{BH}}$, where $v$ is the affine parameter of the null horizon generators and $S_{\text{BH}}$ is the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, and for general diffeomorphism covariant theories of gravity $S_{\text{dyn}}=(1-v\partial_v)S_{\text{Wall}}$, where $S_{\text{Wall}}$ is the Wall entropy. They obtained the first law by applying the Noether charge method to non-stationary perturbations and arbitrary cross-sections. In this formalism, the dynamical black hole entropy is defined as an ``improved'' Noether charge, which is unambiguous to first order in the perturbation. In the present article we provide a pedagogical derivation of the physical process version of the non-stationary first law for general relativity by integrating the linearised Raychaudhuri equation between two arbitrary horizon cross-sections. Moreover, we generalise the derivation of the first law in [1] to non-minimally coupled matter fields that are smooth on the horizon, using boost weight arguments rather than Killing field arguments, and we relax some of the gauge conditions on the perturbations by allowing for non-zero variations of the horizon Killing field and surface gravity. Finally, for $f(\text{Riemann})$ theories of gravity we show explicitly using Gaussian null coordinates that the improved Noether charge is $S_{\text{dyn}}=(1-v\partial_v)S_{\text{Wall}}$, which is a non-trivial check of [1].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13124v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a methodology to measure the cosmological spatial curvature by employing the deviation from statistical isotropy due to the Alcock-Paczy\'nski effect of large scale galaxy clustering. This approach has a higher degree of model independence than most other proposed methods, being independent of calibration of standard candles, rulers, or clocks, of the power spectrum shape (and thus also of the pre-recombination physics), of the galaxy bias, of the theory of gravity, of the dark energy model and of the background cosmology in general. We find that a combined DESI-Euclid galaxy survey can achieve $\Delta \Omega_{k0}=0.057$ at 1$\sigma$ C.L. in the redshift range $z&lt;2$ by combining power-spectrum and bispectrum measurements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03426v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a vertex representation of the tensor network (TN) for classical spin systems on hyperbolic lattices. The tensors form a network of regular $p$-sided polygons ($p&gt;4$) with the coordination number four. The response to multi-state spin systems on the hyperbolic TN is analyzed for their entire parameter space. We show that entanglement entropy is sensitive to distinguish various hyperbolic geometries whereas other thermodynamic quantities are not. We test the numerical accuracy of vertex TNs in the phase transitions of the first, second, and infinite order at the point of maximal entanglement entropy. The hyperbolic structure of TNs induces non-critical properties in the bulk although boundary conditions significantly affect the total free energy in the thermodynamic limit. Thus developed vertex-type TN can be used for the lowest-energy quantum states on the hyperbolic lattices.</description>

Abstract: The interplay between cosmology and strongly coupled dynamics can yield transient spectral features that vanish at late times, but which may leave behind phenomenological signatures in the spectrum of primordial fluctuations. Of particular interest are strongly coupled extensions of the standard model featuring approximate conformal invariance. In flat space, the spectral density for a scalar operator in a conformal field theory is characterized by a continuum with scaling law governed by the dimension of the operator, and is otherwise featureless. AdS/CFT arguments suggest that for large $N$, in an inflationary background with Hubble rate $H$, this continuum is gapped. We demonstrate that there can be additional peak structures that become sharp and particle-like at phenomenologically interesting regions in parameter space, and we estimate their contribution to cosmological observables. We find phenomena that are potentially observable in future experiments that are unique to these models, including displaced oscillatory features in the squeezed limit of the bi-spectrum. These particles can be either fundamental, and localized to a UV brane, or composite at the Hubble scale, $H$, and bound to a horizon in the bulk of the 5D geometry. We comment on how stabilization of conformal symmetry breaking vacua can be correlated with these spectral features and their phenomenology.</description>

      <title>On the mechanism of black hole energy reduction in the Blandford-Znajek process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09993v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Blandford-Znajek (BZ) process is steady electromagnetic energy release from rotating black holes (BHs) along magnetic field lines threading them and widely believed to drive relativistic jets. This process is successfully demonstrated in general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations with the coordinate system regular on the event horizon, in which the outward Poynting flux on the horizon is considered to reduce BH energy. Meanwhile, alternative pictures for the BH energy reduction that invoke infall of negative energy objects were also discussed, although all of the proposed definitions of the negative energy and/or its infall velocity were ambiguous. We revisit the mechanism of BH energy reduction in the BZ process under the ideal MHD condition by utilizing the coordinate system singular on the horizon, in which the falling membrane of past accreted matter should exist above the horizon. We find that the Poynting flux is produced at the boundary between the falling membrane and the magnetically-dominated inflow, and the front of the inflow creates the negative electromagnetic energy, which reduces the rotational energy of spacetime. We also clarify that the poloidal electric current does not form a closed circuit within the magnetically-dominated flow. Previous interpretations of the BZ process and possibilities of violation of ideal MHD condition and BH charging are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Quantum Energy Density of Cosmic Strings with Nonzero Radius</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03723v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Zero-point fluctuations in the background of a cosmic string provide an opportunity to study the effects of topology in quantum field theory. We use a scattering theory approach to compute quantum corrections to the energy density of a cosmic string, using the "ballpoint pen" and "flowerpot" models to allow for a nonzero string radius. For computational efficiency, we consider a massless field in $2+1$ dimensions. We show how to implement precise and unambiguous renormalization conditions in the presence of a deficit angle, and make use of Kontorovich-Lebedev techniques to rewrite the sum over angular momentum channels as an integral on the imaginary axis.</description>

      <title>On a model of variable curvature that mimics the observed Universe acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08306v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new model based on General Relativity in where a subtle change of curvature at late times is able to produce the observed Universe acceleration and an oscillating behavior in the effective equation of state. This model aims to test the cosmological principle, by introducing a slight modification in the traditional FLRW metric, through a non-constant curvature parameter. This model is defined by a smooth step-like function with a slight transition between two curvature values, fulfilling the premise that the derivative of this curvature parameter is preserved as approximately zero, $\dot{\kappa}\approx0$. To test our model, we implemented a MCMC likelihood analysis using Cosmic Chronometers and Type Ia supernovae data in order to constrain the free parameters of the model and reconstruct $H(z)$, $q(z)$, $w_{eff}(z)$, also comparing the results with the $\Lambda$CDM model. The main result is that this model provides an alternative to the acceleration of the Universe without the need of a dark energy component. In particular, it gives an equivalent phase transition at $z \sim 0.5$, while obtaining the same fraction of matter density, similar to what is expected for the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. Remarkably, it also predicts a slight decelerated state at $z=0$ in agreement with diverse Dark Energy parameterizations. We conclude that the behavior of our proposed model points towards a new and intriguing way to investigate slight violations to the cosmological principle, in particular the case of inhomogenities during low phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Spectrum of high-frequency gravitational waves from graviton bremsstrahlung by the decay of inflaton: case with polynomial potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11175v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the generation of high-frequency gravitational waves (GWs) through graviton bremsstrahlung during the decay of inflaton in the post-inflationary universe, focusing on scenarios with a polynomial inflaton potential. Two main reheating channels are considered: decays into bosons (spin 0) and fermions (spin $\frac{1}{2}$). We compute the resulting GW spectra from three-body decays, where the inflaton decays into a pair of daughter particles and a graviton. We numerically compute the GW spectra for various polynomial exponents by employing two distinct approaches: one treating the inflaton as a collection of rest particles and the other treating it as a coherently oscillating classical field. In the former approach, only gravitons with energies below half the inflaton mass are produced, while the latter allows for the production of gravitons with arbitrarily high energies when the potential exponent is 4 or greater. This difference arises because the inflaton's oscillations are no longer described by a single harmonic mode but instead consist of infinitely many harmonic modes with different frequencies. As a result, the GW spectrum exhibits multiple peaks, with these peaks being less pronounced for higher powers of the potential. We also examine the dependence of the GW spectrum on the coupling constant between the inflaton and daughter particles. Our findings suggest that future GW detectors targeting GWs in the GHz band, such as resonant cavities, may have the capability to detect these signals, offering potential insights into the reheating phase of the early universe.</description>

      <title>Exploring cosmological imprints of phantom crossing with dynamical dark energy in Horndeski gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00931v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the current era of precision cosmology, the persistence of cosmological tensions, most notably the Hubble tension and the $S_8$ tension, challenges the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. To reconcile these tensions via late-time modifications to expansion history, various features such as phantom crossing in the dark energy equation of state, a negative energy density at high redshifts, etc., are favoured. However, these scenarios cannot be realized within the framework of GR without introducing ghost or gradient instabilities. In this work, we investigate a dynamical dark energy scenario within the framework of Horndeski gravity, incorporating nonminimal coupling to gravity and self-interactions. We highlight that the model can exhibit novel features like phantom crossing and negative dark energy densities at high redshifts without introducing any instabilities. For this specific Horndeski model, we perform a comprehensive analysis of the background evolution along with the effects on perturbations, examining observables like growth rate, matter and CMB power spectrum. To check the consistency of the model with the observational data, we employ MCMC analysis using BAO/$f\sigma_8$, Supernovae, and CMB data. While the model does not outperform the standard $\Lambda$CDM framework in a combined likelihood analysis, there remains a preference for non-zero values of the model parameters within the data. This suggests that dynamical dark energy scenarios, particularly those with non-minimal couplings, merit further exploration as promising alternatives to GR, offering rich phenomenology that can be tested against a broader range of current and upcoming observational datasets.</description>

      <title>Modeling Confinement in Analogy with Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01521v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The confinement of quarks is analyzed by establishing a correspondence between the effective actions inside a black hole and the QCD action, formulated as a scalar field theory in the Carrollian regime. We first demonstrate that both QCD (in the instanton-dominance limit) and the interior of a black hole can be described at one-loop as the effective action of a soliton in the Carrollian limit. At one-loop, QCD confinement is shown to be entirely analogous to confinement within a black hole, with the event horizon acting as the hadron radius. Higher-order corrections to the effective action do not destabilize the solitons but may produce subtle observable effects, such as deconfinement or a partial resolution to the information loss problem.</description>

      <title>On symmetries of gravitational on-shell boundary action at null infinity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07136v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the gravitational boundary action at null infinity of asymptotically flat spacetimes. We fix the corner ambiguities in the boundary action by using the constraint that (exponential of) the on-shell action leads to tree-level 5-point amplitude in eikonal approximation in a generic supertranslated vacuum. The subleading soft graviton theorem follows naturally from the on-shell action when the BMS group is extended to include superrotations. An infinite tower of Goldstone modes is proposed by `generalizing' the Geroch tensor to incorporate a set of divergence-free symmetric traceless tensors on the sphere. This generalization leads to $\text{sub}^{n}$-leading soft insertions in the tree-level $\mathcal{S}$ matrix, thus paving the way to understanding the infinite tower of tree-level symmetries within this framework.</description>

      <title>De Sitter quantum gravity within the covariant Lorentzian approach to asymptotic safety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05135v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent technical and conceptual advancements in the asymptotic safety approach to quantum gravity have enabled studies of the UV completion of Lorentzian Einstein gravity, emphasizing the role of the state dependence. We present here the first complete investigation of the flow equations of the Einstein-Hilbert action within a cosmological spacetime, namely de Sitter spacetime. Using the newly derived graviton propagator for general gauges and masses in de Sitter spacetime, we analyze the dependence on the gauge and on finite renormalization parameters. Our results provide evidence of a UV fixed point for the most commonly used gauges.</description>

      <title>Conservation of superhorizon curvature perturbations at one loop: Backreaction in the in-in formalism and Renormalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08707v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the superhorizon-limit curvature perturbations are conserved at one-loop level in single-field inflation models with a transient non-slow-roll period. We take the spatially-flat gauge, where the backreaction plays a crucial role for the conservation of superhorizon curvature perturbations unless the counter terms are tuned. We calculate the backreaction with the in-in formalism. In addition, we explicitly show the renormalization of the UV divergences with the counter terms.</description>
