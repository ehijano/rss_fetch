      <title>Quantifying Local Point-Group-Symmetry Order in Complex Particle Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Crystals and other condensed phases are defined primarily by their inherent symmetries, which play a crucial role in dictating their structural properties. In crystallization studies, local order parameters (OPs) that describe bond orientational order are widely employed to investigate crystal formation. Despite their utility, these traditional metrics do not directly quantify symmetry, an important aspect for understanding the development of order during crystallization. To address this gap, we introduce a new set of OPs, called Point Group Order Parameters (PGOPs), designed to continuously quantify point group symmetry order. We demonstrate the strength and utility of PGOP in detecting order across different crystalline systems and compare its performance to commonly used bond-orientational order metrics. PGOP calculations for all non-infinite point groups are implemented in the open-source package SPATULA (Symmetry Pattern Analysis Toolkit for Understanding Local Arrangements), written in parallelized C++ with a Python interface. The code is publicly available on GitHub.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking thermostat algorithms in molecular dynamics simulations of a binary Lennard-Jones glass-former model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A systematic comparison was carried out to assess the influence of representative thermostat methods in constant-temperature molecular dynamics simulations. The thermostat schemes considered include the Nos\'e--Hoover thermostat and its chain generalisation, the Bussi velocity rescaling method, and several implementations of the Langevin dynamics. Using a binary Lennard-Jones liquid as a model glass former, we investigated how the sampling of physical observables, such as particle velocities and potential energy, responds to changes in time step across these thermostats. While the Nos\'e--Hoover chain and Bussi thermostats provide reliable temperature control, a pronounced time-step dependence was observed in the potential energy. Amongst the Langevin methods, the Gr{\o}nbech-Jensen--Farago scheme provided the most consistent sampling of both temperature and potential energy. Nonetheless, Langevin dynamics typically incurs approximately twice the computational cost due to the overhead of random number generation, and exhibits a systematic decrease in diffusion coefficients with increasing friction. This study presents a broad comparison of thermostat methods using a binary Lennard-Jones glass-former model, offering practical guidance for the choice of thermostats in classical molecular dynamics simulations. These findings provide useful insights for diverse applications, including glass transition, phase separation, and nucleation.</description>

      <title>Weak Generative Sampler for Stationary Distributions of McKean-Vlasov System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic interacting particle systems are widely used to model collective phenomena across diverse fields, including statistical physics, biology, and social dynamics. The McKean-Vlasov equation arises as the mean-field limit of such systems as the number of particles tends to infinity, while its long-time behaviour is characterized by stationary distributions as time tends to infinity. However, the validity of interchanging the infinite-time and infinite-particle limits is not guaranteed. Consequently, simulation methods that rely on a finite-particle truncation may fail to accurately capture the mean-field system's stationary distributions, particularly when the coexistence of multiple metastable states leads to phase transitions. In this paper, we adapt the framework of the Weak Generative Sampler (WGS) -- a generative technique based on normalizing flows and a weak formulation of the nonlinear Fokker-Planck equation -- to compute and generate i.i.d. samples satisfying the stationary distributions of McKean-Vlasov processes. Extensive numerical experiments validate the efficacy of the proposed methods, showcasing their ability to accurately approximate stationary distributions and capture phase transitions in complex systems.</description>

      <title>From higher-order moments to time correlation functions in strongly correlated systems: A DMRG-based memory kernel coupling theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a hybrid approach for computing dynamical observables in strongly correlated systems using higher-order moments. This method integrates memory kernel coupling theory (MKCT) with the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG), extending our recent work on MKCT to strongly correlated systems. The method establishes that correlation functions can be derived from the moments. Within our framework, operators and wavefunctions are represented as matrix product operators (MPOs) and matrix product states (MPSs), respectively. Crucially, the repeated application of the Liouville operator is achieved through an iterative procedure analogous to the DMRG algorithm itself. We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of MKCT-DMRG by computing the spectral function of the Hubbard model. Furthermore, we successfully apply the method to compute the electronic friction in the Hubbard-Holstein model. In all cases, the results show excellent agreement with time-dependent DMRG (TD-DMRG) benchmarks. The advantage of MKCT-DMRG over TD-DMRG is the computational efficiency, which avoids expensive real-time propagation in TD-DMRG. These findings establish MKCT-DMRG as a promising and accurate framework for simulating challenging dynamical properties in strongly correlated quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Enhancement of torque transmission capability in Magneto-Rheological fluid-based Clutch using novel hybrid corrugated plane transmission surface strategy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In an increased automated world, miniaturization is the key to widespread deployment of advanced technologies. Enhancing the torque transmissibility by abiding to the spatial constraints imposed by radial space availability has consistently remained a hurdle in the implementation of Magneto-Rheological (MR) clutches that use shear mode of MR fluid (MRF). This proves the necessity of a novel design capable of providing required transmission capability with a reduced transmission surface area. The present study analyzes a corrugated transmissible surface design which improves torque transmissibility with the help of increased transmission area and proper alignment of field lines passing through the MRF gap. In this paper, the impact of various dimensional parameters of a hybrid corrugated plane type MR clutch (MRC) design was studied with the aid of magnetic analysis performed on COMSOL Multiphysics software. The results obtained shows that various parameters in the design of MR clutches, such as annular and radial MR gaps, disc width, individual corrugation heights, corrugation width, bobbin thickness and radii of plane surface influences the torque transmission capability of MR clutches. Also, an optimization of the hybrid corrugated plane MR Clutch of the chosen geometry has been conducted with the transmission capability increasing by 39.37% compared with the non-optimized geometrical configuration.</description>

      <title>Accurate ground states of $SU(2)$ lattice gauge theory in 2+1D and 3+1D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a neural network wavefunction framework for solving non-Abelian lattice gauge theories in a continuous group representation. Using a combination of $SU(2)$ equivariant neural networks alongside an $SU(2)$ invariant, physics-inspired ansatz, we learn a parameterization of the ground state wavefunction of $SU(2)$ lattice gauge theory in 2+1 and 3+1 dimensions. Our method, performed in the Hamiltonian formulation, has a straightforward generalization to $SU(N)$. We benchmark our approach against a solely invariant ansatz by computing the ground state energy, demonstrating the need for bespoke gauge equivariant transformations. We evaluate the Creutz ratio and average Wilson loop, and obtain results in strong agreement with perturbative expansions. Our method opens up an avenue for studying lattice gauge theories beyond one dimension, with efficient scaling to larger systems, and in a way that avoids both the sign problem and any discretization of the gauge group.</description>

      <title>GPU-Accelerated MATLAB Software for Atom-Ion Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a MATLAB script which can use GPU acceleration to simulate a trapped ion interacting with a low-density cloud of atoms. This script, called atomiongpu.m, can massively parallelize MD simulations of trajectories of a trapped ion and an atom starting far away. The script uses ode45gpu, which is our optimized and specialized implementation of the Runge-Kutta algorithm used in MATLAB's ODE solver ode45. We first discuss the physical system and show how ode45gpu can solve it up to 22x faster than MATLAB's ode45. Then, we show how to easily modify the inputs to atomiongpu.m to account for different kinds of atoms, ions, atom-ion interactions, trap potentials, simulation parameters, initial conditions, and computational hardware, so that atomiongpu.m automatically finds the probability of complex formation, the distribution of observables such as the scattering angle and complex lifetime, and plots of specific trajectories.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Machine Learning Force Fields (MLFFs) to Simulate Large Atomistic Systems for Fidelity Improvement of Superconducting Qubits and Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Materials engineering using atomistic modeling is an essential tool for the development of qubits and quantum sensors. Traditional density-functional theory (DFT) does however not adequately capture the complete physics involved, including key aspects and dynamics of superconductivity, surface states, etc. There are also significant challenges regarding the system sizes that can be simulated, not least for thermal properties which are key in quantum-computing applications. The QuantumATK tool combines DFT, based on LCAO basis sets, with non-equilibrium Green's functions, to compute the characteristics of interfaces between superconductors and insulators, as well as the surface states of topological insulators. Additionally, the software leverages machine-learned force-fields to simulate thermal properties and to generate realistic amorphous geometries in large-scale systems. Finally, the description of superconducting qubits and sensors as two-level systems modeled with a double-well potential requires many-body physics, and this paper demonstrates how electron-electron interaction can be added to the single-particle energy levels from an atomistic tight-binding model to describe a realistic double-quantum dot system.</description>

      <title>Emergent complexity and rhythms in evoked and spontaneous dynamics of human whole-brain models after tuning through analysis tools</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The simulation of whole-brain dynamics should reproduce realistic spontaneous and evoked neural activity across different scales, including emergent rhythms, spatio-temporal activation patterns, and macroscale complexity. Once a mathematical model is selected, its configuration must be determined by properly setting its parameters. A critical preliminary step in this process is defining an appropriate set of observables to guide the selection of model configurations (parameter tuning), laying the groundwork for quantitative calibration of accurate whole-brain models. Here, we address this challenge by presenting a framework that integrates two complementary tools: The Virtual Brain (TVB) platform for simulating whole-brain dynamics, and the Collaborative Brain Wave Analysis Pipeline (Cobrawap) for analyzing the simulations using a set of standardized metrics. We apply this framework to a 998-node human connectome, using two configurations of the Larter-Breakspear neural mass model: one with the TVB default parameters, the other tuned using Cobrawap. The results reveal that the tuned configuration exhibits several biologically relevant features, absent in the default model for both spontaneous and evoked dynamics. In response to external perturbations, the tuned model generates non-stereotyped, complex spatio-temporal activity, as measured by the perturbational complexity index. In spontaneous activity, it displays robust alpha-band oscillations, infra-slow rhythms, scale-free characteristics, greater spatio-temporal heterogeneity, and asymmetric functional connectivity. This work demonstrates the potential of combining TVB and Cobrawap to guide parameter tuning and lays the groundwork for data-driven calibration and validation of accurate whole-brain models.</description>

      <title>Generalization of the viscous stress tensor to the case of non-small gradients of hydrodynamic velocity: a path to numerical modeling of turbulence non-locality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generalization of the Chapman-Enskog method to the case of large gradients of hydrodynamic velocity allowed us to obtain an integral (over spatial coordinates) representation of the viscous stress tensor in the Navier-Stokes equation. In the case of small path lengths of the medium disturbance, the tensor goes over to the standard form, which, as is known, is difficult to apply to the description of tangential discontinuities and separated flows. The obtained expression can allow numerical modeling of the nonlocality of turbulence, expressed by the empirical Richardson t^3 law for pair correlations in a turbulent medium.</description>

      <title>Mitigating the sign problem by quantum computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13017v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The notorious sign problem severely limits the applicability of quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations, as statistical errors grow exponentially with system size and inverse temperature. A recent proposal of a quantum-computing stochastic series expansion (qc-SSE) method suggested that the problem could be avoided by introducing constant energy shifts into the Hamiltonian. Here we critically examine this framework and show that it does not strictly resolve the sign problem for Hamiltonians with non-commuting terms. Instead, it provides a practical mitigation strategy that suppresses the occurrence of negative weights. Using the antiferromagnetic anisotropic XY chain as a test case, we analyze the dependence of the average sign on system size, temperature, anisotropy, and shift parameters. An operator contraction method is introduced to improve efficiency. Our results demonstrate that moderate shifts optimally balance sign mitigation and statistical accuracy, while large shifts amplify errors, leaving the sign problem unresolved but alleviated.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.13138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful surrogates for mesh-based computational fluid dynamics (CFD), but training them on high-resolution unstructured meshes with hundreds of thousands of nodes remains prohibitively expensive. We study a \emph{coarse-to-fine curriculum} that accelerates convergence by first training on very coarse meshes and then progressively introducing medium and high resolutions (up to \(3\times10^5\) nodes). Unlike multiscale GNN architectures, the model itself is unchanged; only the fidelity of the training data varies over time. We achieve comparable generalization accuracy while reducing total wall-clock time by up to 50\%. Furthermore, on datasets where our model lacks the capacity to learn the underlying physics, using curriculum learning enables it to break through plateaus.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20978v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The molecular dynamics (MD) simulation technique has been widely used in complex systems, but the accessible time scale is limited due to the requirement of small integration timesteps. Here, we propose a novel method, named Exploratory dynamics Sampling with recursion (EdSr), inspired by ordinary differential equation and Taylor expansion formula, which enables flexible adjustment of timestep in MD simulations. By setting up four groups of experiments including simple functions, ideal physical models, all-atom simulations and coarse-grained simulations, we demonstrate that EdSr can dynamically and flexibly adjust the simulation timestep according to the requirements during simulation period, and operate with larger timesteps than the widely used velocity-Verlet integrator. Although the method can not perform perfectly at flexible timestep across all simulation systems, we believe that it provides a promising direction for future studies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18314v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a generative modeling framework for atomistic systems that combines score-based diffusion for atomic positions with a novel continuous-time discrete diffusion process for atomic types. This approach enables flexible and physically grounded generation of atomic structures across chemical and structural domains. Applied to metallic clusters and two-dimensional materials using the QCD and C2DB datasets, our models achieve strong performance in fidelity and diversity, evaluated using precision-recall metrics against synthetic baselines. We demonstrate atomic type interpolation for generating bimetallic clusters beyond the training distribution, and use classifier-free guidance to steer sampling toward specific crystallographic symmetries in two-dimensional materials. These capabilities are implemented in Atomistic Generative Diffusion (AGeDi), an open-source, extensible software package for atomistic generative diffusion modeling.</description>

Abstract: The study of multiphase flows in porous media is fundamental to various fields, including oil recovery, CO2 sequestration, hydrogeology, and others. Accurate predictions of fluid behavior in these systems can enhance process efficiency while mitigating environmental and health risks. In this context, numerical simulation serves as a powerful tool for anticipating complex flow phenomena and optimizing engineering strategies. Both commercial simulators and open-source softwares, such as the porousMultiphaseFoam repository based on the OpenFOAM framework, have been developed to model these processes. However, simulating heterogeneous porous media with complex porosity and permeability distributions poses significant numerical challenges. To address these, we introduce coupledMatrixFoam, a new OpenFOAM-based solver designed for enhanced robustness and numerical stability. coupledMatrixFoam integrates the Eulerian multi-fluid formulation for phase fractions with Darcy's law for porous media flow, employing a fully implicit, block-coupled solution for the governing equations. Built on foam-extend 5.0, it leverages the latest fvBlockMatrix developments to improve computational efficiency. This approach enables a significant increase in time step sizes, particularly in cases involving capillary pressure effects and other complex physical interactions. This work details the development, implementation, and validation of coupledMatrixFoam, including comparisons with porousMultiphaseFoam to assess performance improvements. Additionally, a scalability analysis is conducted, demonstrating the solver's suitability for high-performance computing (HPC) applications, which are essential for large-scale, real-world simulations.</description>
