      <title>Assessing Human Judgment Forecasts in the Rapid Spread of the Mpox Outbreak: Insights and Challenges for Pandemic Preparedness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In May 2022, mpox (formerly monkeypox) spread to non-endemic countries rapidly. Human judgment is a forecasting approach that has been sparsely evaluated during the beginning of an outbreak. We collected -- between May 19, 2022 and July 31, 2022 -- 1275 forecasts from 442 individuals of six questions about the mpox outbreak where ground truth data are now available. Individual human judgment forecasts and an equally weighted ensemble were evaluated, as well as compared to a random walk, autoregressive, and doubling time model. We found (1) individual human judgment forecasts underestimated outbreak size, (2) the ensemble forecast median moved closer to the ground truth over time but uncertainty around the median did not appreciably decrease, and (3) compared to computational models, for 2-8 week ahead forecasts, the human judgment ensemble outperformed all three models when using median absolute error and weighted interval score; for one week ahead forecasts a random walk outperformed human judgment. We propose two possible explanations: at the time a forecast was submitted, the mode was correlated with the most recent (and smaller) observation that would eventually determine ground truth. Several forecasts were solicited on a logarithmic scale which may have caused humans to generate forecasts with unintended, large uncertainty intervals. To aide in outbreak preparedness, platforms that solicit human judgment forecasts may wish to assess whether specifying a forecast on logarithmic scale matches an individual's intended forecast, support human judgment by finding cues that are typically used to build forecasts, and, to improve performance, tailor their platform to allow forecasters to assign zero probability to events.</description>

      <title>Mechanisms promoting biodiversity in ecosystems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Explaining biodiversity is a central focus in theoretical ecology. A significant obstacle arises from the Competitive Exclusion Principle (CEP), which states that two species competing for the same type of resources cannot coexist at constant population densities, or more generally, the number of consumer species cannot exceed that of resource species at steady states. The conflict between CEP and biodiversity is exemplified by the paradox of the plankton, where a few types of limiting resources support a plethora of plankton species. In this review, we introduce mechanisms proposed over the years for promoting biodiversity in ecosystems, with a special focus on those that alleviate the constraints imposed by the CEP, including mechanisms that challenge the CEP in well-mixed systems at a steady state or those that circumvent its limitations through contextual differences.</description>

      <title>Generalized Lotka-Volterra Systems with Time Correlated Stochastic Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.02851v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the dynamics of species abundances within ecological communities using the Generalized Lotka-Volterra (GLV) model. At variance with previous approaches, we present an analysis of stochastic GLV dynamics with temporal fluctuations in interaction strengths between species. We develop a dynamical mean field theory (DMFT) tailored for scenarios with annealed colored noise and simple functional responses. We show that time-dependent interactions can be effectively modeled as environmental noise in the DMFT and we obtain analytical predictions for the species abundance distribution that well matches empirical observations. Our results suggest that environmental noise favors species coexistence and allows to overcome the complexity-stability paradox, especially in comparison to dynamics with quenched disorder. This study offers new insights not only into the modeling of large ecosystem dynamics, but also proposes novel methodologies for examining ecological systems.</description>

      <title>Approaches to biological species delimitation based on genetic and spatial dissimilarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12126v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The delimitation of biological species, i.e., deciding which individuals belong to the same species and whether and how many different species are represented in a data set, is key to the conservation of biodiversity. Much existing work uses only genetic data for species delimitation, often employing some kind of cluster analysis. This can be misleading, because geographically distant groups of individuals can be genetically quite different even if they belong to the same species. We investigate the problem of testing whether two potentially separated groups of individuals can belong to a single species or not based on genetic and spatial data. Existing methods such as the partial Mantel test and jackknife-based distance-distance regression are considered as well as new approaches, i.e., an adaptation of a mixed effects model, a bootstrap approach, and a jackknife version of partial Mantel. All these methods address the issue that distance data violate the independence assumption for standard inference regarding correlation and regression; a standard linear regression is also considered. The approaches are compared on simulated meta-populations generated with SLiM and GSpace - two software packages that can simulate spatially-explicit genetic data at an individual level. Simulations showed that partial Mantel tests and mixed-effects models have larger power than jackknife-based methods, but tend to display type I error rates slightly above the significance level. An application on brassy ringlets concludes the paper.</description>
