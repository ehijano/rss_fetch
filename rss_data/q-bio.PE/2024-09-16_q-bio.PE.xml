      <title>How Combined Pairwise and Higher-Order Interactions Shape Transient Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how species interactions shape biodiversity is a core challenge in ecology. While much focus has been on long-term stability, there is rising interest in transient dynamics-the short-lived periods when ecosystems respond to disturbances and adjust toward stability. These transitions are crucial for predicting ecosystem reactions and guiding effective conservation. Our study introduces a model that blends pairwise and higher-order interactions, offering a more realistic view of natural ecosystems. We find pairwise interactions slow the journey to stability, while higher-order interactions speed it up. This model provides fresh insights into ecosystem resilience and recovery, helping improve strategies for managing species and ecological disruptions.</description>

      <title>Aggregation-diffusion in heterogeneous environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aggregation-diffusion equations are foundational tools for modelling biological aggregations. Their principal use is to link the collective movement mechanisms of organisms to their emergent space use patterns in a rigorous, non-speculative way. However, most existing studies implicitly assume that organism movement is not affected by the underlying environment. In reality, the environment is a key determinant of emergent space use patterns, albeit in combination with collective aspects of motion. This work studies aggregation-diffusion equations in a heterogeneous environment in one spatial dimension. Under certain assumptions, it is possible to find exact analytic expressions for the steady-state solutions to the equation when diffusion is quadratic. Minimising the associated energy functional across these solutions provides a rapid way of determining the likely emergent space use pattern, which can be verified via numerics. This energy-minimisation procedure is applied to a simple test case, where the environment consists of a single clump of attractive resources. Here, self-attraction and resource-attraction combine to shape the emergent aggregation. Two counter-intuitive results emerge from the analytic results: (a) a non-monotonic dependence of clump width on the aggregation width, (b) a positive correlation between self-attraction strength and aggregation width when the resource attraction is strong. These are verified through numerical simulations. Overall, the study shows rigorously how environment and collective behaviour combine to shape organism space use, sometimes in counter-intuitive ways.</description>

      <title>Infector characteristics exposed by spatial analysis of SARS-CoV-2 sequence and demographic data analysed at fine geographical scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Characterising drivers of SARS-CoV-2 circulation is crucial for understanding COVID-19 because of the severity of control measures adopted during the pandemic. Whole genome sequence data augmented with demographic metadata provides the best opportunity to do this. We use Random Forest Decision Tree models to analyse a combination of over 4000 SARS-CoV2 sequences from a densely sampled, mixed urban and rural population (Tayside) in Scotland in the period from August 2020 to July 2021, with fine scale geographical and socio-demographic metadata. Comparing periods in versus out of "lockdown" restrictions, we show using genetic distance relationships that individuals from more deprived areas are more likely to get infected during lockdown but less likely to spread the infection further. As disadvantaged communities were the most affected by both COVID-19 and its restrictions, our finding has important implications for informing future approaches to control future pandemics driven by similar respiratory infections.</description>

      <title>Assortativity in sympatric speciation and species classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the role of assortative mating in speciation using the sympatric model of Derrida and Higgs. The model explores the idea that genetic differences create incompatibilities between individuals, preventing mating if the number of such differences is too large. Speciation, however, only happens in this mating system if the number of genes is large. Here we show that speciation with small genome sizes can occur if assortative mating is introduced. In our model individuals are represented by three chromosomes: one responsible for reproductive compatibility, one for coding the trait on which assortativity will operate, and a neutral chromosome. Reproduction is possible if individuals are genetically similar with respect to the first chromosome, but among these compatible mating partners, the one with the most similar trait coded by the second chromosome is selected. We show that this type of assortativity facilitates speciation, which can happen with a small number of genes in the first chromosome. Species, classified according to reproductive isolation, dictated by the first chromosome, can display different traits values, as measured by the second and the third chromosomes. Therefore, species can also be identified based on similarity of the neutral trait, which works as a proxy for reproductive isolation.</description>

      <title>Structural causal influence (SCI) captures the forces of social inequality in models of disease dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mathematical modelling has served a central role in studying how infectious disease transmission manifests at the population level. These models have demonstrated the importance of population-level factors like social network heterogeneity on structuring epidemic risk and are now routinely used in public health for decision support. One barrier to broader utility of mathematical models is that the existing canon does not readily accommodate the social determinants of health as distinct, formal drivers of transmission dynamics. Given the decades of empirical support for the organizational effect of social determinants on health burden more generally and infectious disease risk more specially, addressing this modelling gap is of critical importance. In this study, we build on prior efforts to integrate social forces into mathematical epidemiology by introducing several new metrics, principally structural causal influence (SCI). Here, SCI leverages causal analysis to provide a measure of the relative vulnerability of subgroups within a susceptible population, which are crafted by differences in healthcare, exposure to disease, and other determinants. We develop our metrics using a general case and apply it to specific one of public health importance: Hepatitis C virus in a population of persons who inject drugs. Our use of the SCI reveals that, under specific parameters in a multi-community model, the "less vulnerable" community may sustain a basic reproduction number below one when isolated, ensuring disease extinction. However, even minimal transmission between less and more vulnerable communities can elevate this number, leading to sustained epidemics within both communities. Summarizing, we reflect on our findings in light of conversations surrounding the importance of social inequalities and how their consideration can influence the study and practice of mathematical epidemiology.</description>

      <title>Exact solution for a discrete-time SIR model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a nonstandard finite difference scheme for the Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) continuous model. We prove that our discretized system is dynamically consistent with its continuous counterpart and we derive its exact solution. We end with the analysis of the long-term behavior of susceptible, infected and removed individuals, illustrating our results with examples. In contrast with the SIR discrete-time model available in the literature, our new model is simultaneously mathematically and biologically sound.</description>

      <title>The Future of Decoding Non-Standard Nucleotides: Leveraging Nanopore Sequencing for Expanded Genetic Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Expanding genetic codes from natural standard nucleotides to artificial non-standard nucleotides marks a significant advancement in synthetic biology, with profound implications for biotechnology and medicine. Decoding the biological information encoded in these non-standard nucleotides presents new challenges, as traditional sequencing technologies are unable to recognize or interpret novel base pairings. In this perspective, we explore the potential of nanopore sequencing, which is uniquely suited to decipher both standard and non-standard nucleotides by directly measuring the biophysical properties of nucleic acids. Nanopore technology offers real-time, long-read sequencing without the need for amplification or synthesis, making it particularly advantageous for expanded genetic systems like Artificially Expanded Genetic Information Systems (AEGIS). We discuss how the adaptability of nanopore sequencing and advancements in data processing can unlock the potential of these synthetic genomes and open new frontiers in understanding and utilizing expanded genetic codes.</description>

      <title>Costly punishment sustains indirect reciprocity under low defection detectability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cooperation is fundamental to human societies, and indirect reciprocity, where individuals cooperate to build a positive reputation for future benefits, plays a key role in promoting it. Previous theoretical and experimental studies have explored both the effectiveness and limitations of costly punishment in sustaining cooperation. While empirical observations show that costly punishment by third parties is common, some theoretical models suggest it may not be effective in the context of indirect reciprocity, raising doubts about its potential to enhance cooperation. In this study, we theoretically investigate the conditions under which costly punishment is effective. Building on a previous model, we introduce a new type of error in perceiving actions, where defection may be mistakenly perceived as cooperation. This extension models a realistic scenario where defectors have a strong incentive to disguise their defection as cooperation. Our analysis reveals that when defection is difficult to detect, norms involving costly punishment can emerge as the most efficient evolutionarily stable strategies. These findings demonstrate that costly punishment can play a crucial role in promoting cooperation within indirect reciprocity.</description>

      <title>On the correctness of Maximum Parsimony for data with few substitutions in the NNI neighborhood of phylogenetic trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01282v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Estimating phylogenetic trees, which depict the relationships between different species, from aligned sequence data (such as DNA, RNA, or proteins) is one of the main aims of evolutionary biology. However, tree reconstruction criteria like maximum parsimony do not necessarily lead to unique trees and in some cases even fail to recognize the \enquote{correct} tree (i.e., the tree on which the data was generated). On the other hand, a recent study has shown that for an alignment containing precisely those binary characters (sites) which require up to two substitutions on a given tree, this tree will be the unique maximum parsimony tree.
  It is the aim of the present paper to generalize this recent result in the following sense: We show that for a tree $T$ with $n$ leaves, as long as $k&lt;\frac{n}{8}+\frac{11}{9}-\frac{1}{18}\sqrt{9\cdot \left(\frac{n}{4}\right)^2+16}$ (or, equivalently, $n&gt;9 k-11+\sqrt{9k^2-22 k+17} $, which in particular holds for all $n\geq 12k$), the maximum parsimony tree for the alignment containing all binary characters which require (up to or precisely) $k$ substitutions on $T$ will be unique in the NNI neighborhood of $T$ and it will coincide with $T$, too. In other words, within the NNI neighborhood of $T$, $T$ is the unique most parsimonious tree for the said alignment. This partially answers a recently published conjecture affirmatively. Additionally, we show that for $n\geq 8$ and for $k$ being in the order of $\frac{n}{2}$, there is always a pair of phylogenetic trees $T$ and $T'$ which are NNI neighbors, but for which the alignment of characters requiring precisely $k$ substitutions each on $T$ in total requires fewer substitutions on $T'$.</description>

      <title>Good Modelling Software Practices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.21051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.21051v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Frequently in socio-environmental sciences, models are used as tools to represent, understand, project and predict the behaviour of these complex systems. Along the modelling chain, Good Modelling Practices have been evolving that ensure -- amongst others -- that models are transparent and their results replicable. Whenever such models are represented in software, Good Modelling meet Good Software Practices, such as a tractable development workflow, good code, collaborative development and governance, continuous integration and deployment; and they meet Good Scientific Practices, such as attribution of copyrights and acknowledgement of intellectual property, publication of a software paper and archiving. Too often in existing socio-environmental model software, these practices have been regarded as an add-on to be considered at a later stage only; modellers have shied away from publishing their model as open source out of fear that having to add good practices is too demanding. We here argue for making a habit of following a list of simple and not so simple practices early on in the implementation of the model life cycle. We contextualise cherry-picked and hands-on practices for supporting Good Modelling Practice, and we demonstrate their application in the example context of the Viable North Sea fisheries socio-ecological systems model.</description>
