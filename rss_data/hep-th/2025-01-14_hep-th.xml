      <title>No-go Theorem for Cosmological Parity Violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A no-go theorem for parity-violation in even $D$-dimensional spacetimes invariant under $ISO(d)$ and dilatations (as well as the implications for odd $D$) is derived. For the case of real massless scalar and gravitons (as well as any massless even integer spin-$s$ field) at $\mathcal{I}^+$, the reality of wavefunction coefficients in Fourier space to all orders in perturbation theory (any order in loops) coming from a local, unitary, IR- and UV-finite theory, which start from the initial \CRT-invariant Bunch-Davies state in the infinite past, is proven. From this it is inferred that a parity-odd correlator with any massless scalar fields and even integer spin-$s$ fields vanishes in the presence of any number of interactions of massless fields. The same is true for correlators with an even number of conformally-coupled and massless odd integer spin-$s$ external fields, which is used to derive the cosmological analogue of Furry's theorem. The fundamental implications of \CRT symmetry for theories with chemical potentials, such as Chern-Simons and Axion inflation, is also discussed. Given the recent interest in parity-violation coming from observational claims of parity-violation detection, these results provide clear constraints on parity-violating models of inflation and establish the measurement of any parity-odd correlator as an exceptionally sensitive probe of new physics beyond vanilla inflation.</description>

      <title>Holographic Entanglement Entropy as a Probe of Dynamical Criticality in Scalarizing Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that holographic entanglement entropy (HEE) serves as a powerful diagnostic tool for both static and dynamical critical phenomena in the Einstein-Born-Infeld-Scalar (EBIS) model. While HEE is well-known for capturing static phase transitions, we reveal its novel ability to probe dynamical criticality, particularly the ''flip'' phenomenon-a sign inversion in the scalar field at a critical point. Near the flip, HEE exhibits relaxation dynamics that closely mirror those of the scalar field, with both relaxation times scaling logarithmically with the distance from the critical point. This intimate connection between the relaxation of HEE and the scalar field highlights HEE as a sensitive probe of dynamical critical phenomena. Our findings provide new insights into the interplay between quantum information and gravitational dynamics, offering a deeper understanding of critical behavior in strongly coupled systems.</description>

      <title>Self-dual pp-wave solutions in chiral higher-spin gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that chiral higher-spin gravity with a vanishing cosmological constant admits a class of exact self-dual pp-wave solutions derived from harmonic scalar functions and two principal spinors. These solutions satisfy both the linear and non-linear equations of motion, as they annihilate all higher-order vertices, leading to the equations of motion for free fields on a self-dual background sourced by a positive-helicity spin-2 field. Our method employs a simple light-cone ansatz for positive-helicity chiral higher-spin fields, along with a modified Kerr-Schild ansatz adapted for the self-dual gravity framework.</description>

      <title>Three-loop verification of the equations relating running of the gauge couplings in ${\cal N}=1$ SQCD+SQED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We verify a recently derived equations relating the renormalization group running of two gauge couplings in ${\cal N}=1$ SQCD+SQED by the explicit three-loop calculation. It is demonstrated that these equations are really valid in the HD+MSL scheme. In other words, if a theory is regularized by higher covariant derivatives and the renormalization is made by minimal subtractions of logarithms, the analogs of the strong and electromagnetic gauge couplings do not run independently. However, in the $\overline{\mbox{DR}}$ scheme the considered equations do not hold starting from the three-loop order, where the scheme dependence becomes essential. Therefore, they are valid only for a certain set of the renormalization prescriptions. We prove that all of them can be obtained from the HD+MSL scheme by finite renormalizations which satisfy a special constraint and illustrate how this works in the three-loop approximation.</description>

      <title>Non-planar corrections to ABJM Bremsstrahlung function from quantum M2 brane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As was shown in arXiv:2303.15207, the leading large $N$, fixed $k$ correction in the localization result for the expectation value of the $\frac{1}{2}$-BPS circular Wilson loop in $U(N)_{k}\times U(N)_{-k}$ ABJM theory given by the $(\sin\frac{2\pi}{ k})^{-1}$ factor can be reproduced on the dual M-theory side as the one-loop correction in the partition function of an M2 brane in AdS$_{4}\times S^{7}/\mathbb{Z}_{k}$ with AdS$_{2}\times S^{1}$ world volume. Here we prove, following the suggestion in arXiv:2408.10070, that the analogous fact is true also for the corresponding correction $B_1=-\frac{1}{2\pi k}\cot\frac{2\pi}{k}$ in the localization result for the Bremsstrahlung function associated with the Wilson line with a small cusp in either AdS$_4$ or $\rm CP^3$. The corresponding M2 brane is wrapped on the 11d circle and generalizes the type IIA string solution in AdS$_{4}\times \rm CP^3$ ending on the cusped line. We show that the one-loop term in the M2 brane partition function reproduces the localization expression for $B_1$ as the coefficient of the leading term in its small cusp expansion.</description>

      <title>Universal Constraints for Conformal Line Defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel framework for deriving integral constraints for correlators on conformal line defects. These constraints emerge from the non-linearly realized ambient-space conformal symmetry. To validate our approach, we examine several examples and compare them against existing data for the four-point function of the displacement operator. Additionally, we provide a few new predictions that extend the current understanding of these correlators.</description>

      <title>A holographic understanding of correlation and information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The status of the two-point connected correlator is holographically probed by using the well-known prescription of holographic mutual information. In particular, we calculate the two-point connected correlator for a specific bulk spacetime geometry which was not done explicitly earlier. We then carefully study the inequality between the mutual information and the two-point connected correlator, namely, $I(A:B)\ge\frac{(\expval{\mathcal{O}_{A}\mathcal{O}_{B}}-\expval{\mathcal{O}_{A}}\expval{\mathcal{O}_{B}})^2}{2\expval{\mathcal{O}_{A}^2}\expval{\mathcal{O}_{B}^2}}$. We observe that by considering the standard set up of two strip-like subsystems which are separated by a distance, one can show that there exists two critical separation distances, namely, $sT|_c$ and $sT|_I$ depicting the vanishing of quantum dependencies and classical dependencies between the subsystems respectively. We also make a proposal in this context.</description>

      <title>Confinement of 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ Gauge Theories from M-theory on CY4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present a new geometric transition in non-compact Calabi-Yau 4-folds, specifically for the cone over the 7d Sasaki-Einstein manifold $Q^{\scriptscriptstyle(1,1,1)}/\mathbb{Z}_{N}$. We discover a new smoothing of such Calabi-Yau 4-fold singularity via a partial resolution+deformation, which can be interpreted as a confined phase for a 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ $SU(N)$ gauge theory. The confining strings are realized as M2-branes wrapping the torsional 1-cycles in this new geometric phase. We have also computed the generalized global symmetries and SymTFT action using the link topology and intersection numbers of the resolved Calabi-Yau 4-fold.</description>

      <title>On symmetries of gravitational on-shell boundary action at null infinity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the gravitational boundary action at null infinity of asymptotically flat spacetimes. We fix the corner ambiguities in the boundary action by using the constraint that (exponential of) the on-shell action leads to tree-level 5-point amplitude in eikonal approximation in a generic supertranslated vacuum. The subleading soft graviton theorem follows naturally from the on-shell action when the BMS group is extended to include superrotations. We also show that an infinite tower of soft theorems can be derived from the on-shell action if we consider a 'generalization' of the Geroch tensor by including a set of divergence-free symmetric traceless tensors on the sphere.</description>

      <title>Black Holes and Black Strings in M-theory on Calabi-Yau threefolds with four K\"{a}hler parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Combining toric geometry techniques and $\mathcal{N}=2$ supergravity formalisms, we study 5D black branes in the M-theory compactification on a four parameter Calabi-Yau threefold. First, we investigate 5D BPS and non-BPS black holes that are derived by wrapping M2-branes on non-holomorphic 2-cycles in such a toric Calabi-Yau manifold. Concretely, we provide the allowed electric charge regions of BPS and non-BPS black hole states that are obtained by surrounding M2-branes over appropriate 2-cycles. Then, we approach the black hole thermodynamic behavior by computing the entropy and the temperature. By evaluating the recombination factor, we examine the stability of such non-BPS black holes. Precisely, we find stable and unstable solutions depending on the allowed electric charge regions. After that, we study 5D black strings by wrapping M5-branes on non-holomorphic dual 4-cycles in the proposed toric Calabi-Yau manifold by focusing on the stability behaviors. In the allowed regions of the moduli space of the non-BPS stringy solutions, we find stable and unstable states depending on the magnetic charge values.</description>

Abstract: In this paper,we extend the definition of the Chern-Simons type characteristic classes in the continuous case to abelian lattice gauge theory. Then, we show that the exterior differential of a k-th Chern-Simons type characteristic class is exactly equal to the coboundary of the cochain of the (k-1)-th Chern-Simons type characteristic classes based upon the noncommutative differential calculus on the lattice.</description>

      <title>Large charge operators at large spin from relativistically rotating vortices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the ground states of CFTs with a global $U(1)$ symmetry on $\mathbb{R}\times S^2$ in the regime of large charge $Q$ and large angular momentum $J$, using large charge EFT. We find that in the range $Q \ll J \ll Q^2$, the ground state solution is a superfluid densely populated with vortices rotating at a constant angular velocity $\Omega$. This is a relativistic generalization of the known (non-relativistic) rigid rotation phase, which corresponds to the small $\Omega$ limit of our solution. In the regime $Q^{3/2}\ll J\ll Q^2$, our solution achieves lower energy than previously identified states. In this regime, most of the vortices move near the speed of light, and we obtain the chiral fluctuation modes propagating at the speed of light. Interestingly, we find that our ground state can be interpreted as a zero temperature charged normal fluid rotating at a constant angular velocity $\Omega$. We rederive this solution purely from the fluid dynamics. Based on the (already established) applicability of fluid description to large non-supersymmetric extremal AdS black holes, we find that the boundary stress tensor and $U(1)$ current of extremal AdS Kerr-Newman black hole align with those of our solution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how an isolated quantum system evolves toward a thermal state from an initial state far from equilibrium such as one prepared by a global quantum quench has attracted significant interest in recent years. This phenomenon can be elucidated through the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH), which has had a profound impact across various fields, from high-energy physics to condensed matter physics. The purpose of this review article is to present the fundamental concepts of quantum equilibrium and the ETH to a broad audience within the physics community, particularly for those in high-energy physics who seek a comprehensive understanding of these important topics.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the $\mathbb{Z}_2^n$-graded Lie (super)algebras as novel possible generators of symmetries of $S$-matrix. As the results, we demonstrate that a $\mathbb{Z}_2^n$-graded extension of the supersymmetric algebra can be a symmetry of $S$-matrix. Furthermore, it turns out that a $\mathbb{Z}_2^n$-graded Lie algebra appears as internal symmetries. They are natural extensions of Coleman-Mandula theorem and Haag-Lopszanski-Sohnius theorem, which are the no-go theorems for generators of symmetries of $S$-matrix.</description>

      <title>All Order Classical Electromagnetic Soft Theorems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If a set of charged objects collide in space and the fragments disperse, then this process will emit electromagnetic waves. Classical soft photon theorem determines the constant term and the leading power law fall-off of the wave-form at late and early times in terms of only the momenta and charges of the incoming and outgoing objects. In this paper we determine an infinite set of subleading terms in the late and early time expansion of the wave-form, which also depend only on the momenta and charges of the incoming and outgoing particles. For two-particle scattering, we derive a resummed low-frequency electromagnetic wave-form, as well as the resummed wave-form at early and late times. In this analysis we ignore the effect of long range gravitational interaction, but our result is unaffected by any other short range interactions among the objects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recent proposal reinterprets the eikonal as the scattering generator, which computes scattering observables through an action as a symmetry generator. The aim of this study is to incorporate dissipative effects from radiation into this framework, where the eikonal is generalised to the radiation eikonal by including mediator field degrees of freedom. The proposed generalisation is tested through several post-Minkowskian scattering observables; scattering waveform, radiated momentum, and (time asymmetric) radiation loss in the impulse.</description>

RG flows leaving unbroken a subcategory of non-invertible symmetries are associated with anomaly-matching conditions that we employ systematically to map the space of flows between Virasoro Minimal models beyond the $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetric proposed recently in the literature. We introduce a family of non-linear integral equations that appear to encode the exact finite-size, ground-state energies of these flows, including non-integrable cases, such as the recently proposed $\mathcal{M}(k q + I,q) \to \mathcal{M}(k q - I,q)$. Our family of NLIEs encompasses and generalises the integrable flows known in the literature: $\phi_{(1,3)}$, $\phi_{(1,5)}$, $\phi_{(1,2)}$ and $\phi_{(2,1)}$. This work uncovers a new interplay between exact solvability and non-invertible symmetries. Furthermore, our non-perturbative description provides a non-trivial test for all the flows conjectured by anomaly matching conditions, but so far not-observed by other means.</description>

Abstract: Classical studies as the conservation laws and the radiation fields are investigated in the pseudo-electrodynamics. We explore the action symmetry under infinitesimal transformations to obtain the energy-momentum, the Belinfante-Rosenfeld, and the general angular momentum tensors for this nonlocal planar electrodynamics. Through the results such as the retarded potentials and fields generated by a point particle in an arbitrary motion, we study the radiation of an electric dipole and it radiated power in 1+2 dimensions. In addition, we propose a way to introduce magnetic monopoles in pseudo-electrodynamics, in which the solutions and conservation laws are also presented.</description>

      <title>Boundary operator expansion and extraordinary phase transition in the tricritical O(N) model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the boundary extraordinary transition of a 3D tricritical $O(N)$ model. We first compute the mean-field Green's function with a general coupling of $|\vec \phi|^{2n}$ (with $n=3$ corresponding to the tricritical point) at the extraordinary phase transition. Then, by employing the technique of layer susceptibility, we solve the boundary operator expansion using the $\epsilon=3 - d$ expansion. Based on these results, we demonstrate that the tricritical point exhibits an extraordinary transition characterized by an ordered boundary for any $N$. This provides the first nontrivial example of continuous symmetry breaking in 2D dimensions in the context of boundary criticality.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Heavy Quarks in Strongly Coupled $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06289v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We calculate the probability distribution $P({\bf k})$ for a heavy quark with velocity $v$ propagating through strongly coupled $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM plasma in the 't Hooft limit at a temperature $T$ to acquire a momentum ${\bf k}$ due to interactions with the plasma. This distribution encodes the well-known drag coefficient $\eta_D$ and the transverse and longitudinal momentum diffusion coefficients $\kappa_T$ and $\kappa_L$. Furthermore, our calculation determines all of the higher order and mixed moments to leading order in $1/\sqrt{\lambda}$ for the first time. These non-Gaussian features of $P({\bf k})$ include qualitatively novel correlations between longitudinal energy loss and transverse momentum broadening at nonzero $v$. We demonstrate that these non-Gaussian characteristics can be sizable in magnitude and even dominant in physically relevant situations. We use these results to derive a Kolmogorov equation for the evolution of the probability distribution for the total momentum of a heavy quark that propagates through strongly coupled plasma. This evolution equation accounts for all higher order correlations between transverse momentum broadening and longitudinal energy loss, which we have calculated from first principles. It reduces to a Fokker-Planck (FP) equation when truncated to only include the effects of $\eta_D$, $\kappa_T$ and $\kappa_L$. Remarkably, while heavy quarks do not reach kinetic equilibrium with the plasma if evolved with this FP equation, we demonstrate that heavy quarks do reach kinetic equilibrium if evolved with the all-order Kolmogorov equation we have derived. Our results thus provide a dynamically complete framework for understanding the thermalization of a heavy quark that may be initially far from equilibrium in the strongly coupled $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM plasma -- as well as new insight into heavy quark transport and equilibration in quark-gluon plasma.</description>

      <title>The impact of memory-burdened primordial black holes on high-scale leptogenesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the impact of the back-reaction of evaporation on the quantum state of Primordial Black Holes (PBHs), known as ``memory burden", on the baryon asymmetry production in the Universe through high-scale leptogenesis. Focusing on PBH masses ranging from 1 to 1000 grams, we investigate the interplay between the non-thermal production of heavy sterile neutrinos and the entropy injection within this non-standard cosmological framework. By assuming appropriate values for the memory-burden parameters, $q=1/2$ and $k=1$, we derive mutual exclusion limits between PBHs and thermal leptogenesis in the mixed parameter space. Our analysis reveals that the primary contribution of PBHs to baryon asymmetry stems from entropy injection. Indeed, we find that, differently from earlier studies based on the semi-classical Hawking evaporation, the memory-burden effect suppresses the non-thermal source term in the PBH mass range explored. This has significant implications for understanding baryogenesis in such alternative cosmological scenarios.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Primordial Magnetic Fields from the Lyman-{\alpha} forest</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first constraints on primordial magnetic fields from the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest using full cosmological hydrodynamic simulations. At the scales and redshifts probed by the data, the flux power spectrum is extremely sensitive to the extra power induced by primordial magnetic fields in the linear matter power spectrum, at a scale that we parametrize with $k_{\rm peak}$. We rely on a set of more than a quarter million flux models obtained by varying thermal, reionization histories and cosmological parameters. We find a hint of extra power that is well fitted by the PMF model with $B\sim 0.2$ nG, corresponding to $k_{\rm peak}\sim 20$ Mpc$^{-1}$. However, when applying very conservative assumptions on the modelling of the noise, we obtain a 3$\sigma$ C.L. lower limit $k_{\rm peak}&gt; 30$ Mpc$^{-1}$ which translates into the tightest bounds on the strength of primordial intergalactic magnetic fields: $B &lt; 0.30$ nG (for fixed, nearly scale-invariant $n_{\rm B}=-2.9$).</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we studied line operators in the Left-Right Symmetric Model. The gauge group of Left-Right Symmetric Electroweak Model is ${G} = SU(3) \times SU(2)_{L} \times SU(2)_{R} \times U(1)_{B - L}$. We derived the spectrum of line operators in all possible scenarios within left-right symmetric models. We then studied the $\theta$ angles in left-right symmetric model. We also discuss the effect of symmetry breaking on the spectrum of line operators and $\theta$ angles.</description>

      <title>On Legacy of Starobinsky Inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Alexei Alexandrovich Starobinsky was outstanding theoretical physicist who made fundamental contributions to gravitational theory and cosmology, based on geometrical ideas in physics, in the spirit of Einstein. One of his greatest achievements is the famous Starobinsky model of cosmological inflation in the early universe, proposed in 1979-1980. In this paper, the Starobinsky inflation model is systematically reviewed from the modern perspective. Its deformation to include production of primordial black holes is proposed, and possible quantum corrections in the context of superstring theory and the Swampland Program are discussed. Starobinsky inflation also leads to the universal reheating mechanism for particle production after inflation.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial quantization of 4d 2-Chern-Simons theory I: the Hopf category of higher-graph states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 2-Chern-Simons theory, or more commonly known as 4d BF-BB theory with gauged shift symmetry, is a natural generalization of Chern-Simons theory to 4-dimensional manifolds. It is part of the bestiary of higher-homotopy Maurer-Cartan theories. In this article, we present a framework towards the combinatorial quantization of 2-Chern-Simons theory on the lattice, taking inspiration from the work of Aleskeev-Grosse-Schomerus three decades ago. The central geometric input is the 2-truncation $\Gamma^2$ of the $\infty$-groupoid of simplices formed by the underlying lattice $\Gamma$. On such a "2-graph", we model states of 2-Chern-Simons holonomies as Crane-Yetter's \textit{measureable fields}. We show that the 2-Chern-Simons action endows the 2-graph states -- as well as their quantum 2-gauge symmetries -- the structure of a Hopf category, and that their associated higher $R$-matriex gives it a comonoidal {\it cobraiding} structure. This is an explicit realization of the categorical ladder proposal of Baez-Dolan, in the context of Lie group lattice 2-gauge theories. Moreover, we will also analyze the lattice 2-algebra on the graph $\Gamma$, and extract the observables of discrete 2-Chern-Simons theory from it.</description>

      <title>Equivalent Gravities and Equivalence Principle: Foundations and experimental implications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The so-called Geometric Trinity of Gravity includes General Relativity (GR), based on spacetime curvature; the Teleparallel Equivalent of GR (TEGR), which relies on spacetime torsion; and the Symmetric Teleparallel Equivalent of GR (STEGR), grounded in nonmetricity. Recent studies demonstrate that GR, TEGR, and STEGR are dynamically equivalent, raising questions about the fundamental structure of spacetime, the under-determination of these theories, and whether empirical distinctions among them are possible. The aim of this work is to show that they are equivalent in many features but not exactly in everything. In particular, their relationship with the Equivalence Principle (EP) is different. The EP is a deeply theory-laden assumption, which is assumed as fundamental in constructing GR, with significant implications for our understanding of spacetime. However, it introduces unresolved conceptual issues, including its impact on the nature of the metric and connection, its meaning at the quantum level, tensions with other fundamental interactions and new physics, and its role in dark matter and dark energy problems. In contrast, TEGR and STEGR recover the EP but do not rely on it as a foundational principle. The fact that GR, TEGR, and STEGR are equivalent in non-trivial predictions, but the EP is not necessary for TEGR and STEGR, suggests that it may not be a fundamental feature but an emergent one, potentially marking differences in the empirical content of the three theories. Thus, the developments within the Geometric Trinity framework challenge traditional assumptions about spacetime and may help to better understand some of the unresolved foundational difficulties related to the EP.</description>

      <title>Shadow of the Scalar Hairy Black Hole with Inverted Higgs Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the imaging of a hairy black hole (HBH) in the Einstein-Klein-Gordon theory, where Einstein gravity is minimally coupled to a scalar potential $V(\phi)=-\Lambda \phi^4 + \mu \phi^2$ with $\Lambda$ and $\mu$ are constants. As a consequence, a nontrivial scalar field at the event horizon $\phi_H$ allows the HBH to evade the no-hair theorem, bifurcate from the Schwarzschild black hole by acquiring some new properties, which can affect the shadow of the HBH received by a distant observer. The framework of ray-tracing is adopted to investigate the optical appearance of the HBH, thus the trajectories of light rays around the HBH can be classified into three emissions: direct, lensed and photon ring. Employing three models of optically and geometrically thin accretion disk, we compare the differences between the Schwarzschild black hole and HBH with same horizon radius in a specific model, and find that the size of the shadow and accretion disk increases as $\phi_H$ increases, but the brightness of the rings remain nearly unaffected, this implies our HBH can potentially mimic the Schwarzschild black hole if we vary the horizon radius of the HBH. Finally, we also constraint the parameter $\Lambda$ from the observations of supermassive black holes in the galactic center of M87 and Sgr A$^{*}$, which could offer new insights for imaging of black holes and astrophysical observations.</description>

Abstract: We propose a relativistic model of spontaneous wave-function collapse, based on a random nonHermitian action where the fermion density operator is coupled to a universal colored noise. Upon quantization, the wave function obeys a nonlinear stochastic differential equation that respects statistical Lorentz symmetry. The localization mechanism is driven by the colored noise, derived from the d'Alembert equation using generalized stochastic calculus in 1+3-dimensional spacetime. We analytically determine the noise-induced localization length, which decreases as the size of the observable universe increases.</description>

      <title>Impact of dark matter distribution on neutron star properties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the structural and observable impacts of dark matter (DM) on neutron stars using a combined equation of state that integrates the relativistic mean field (RMF) model for baryonic matter with a variable density profile for DM, incorporating DM-baryon interactions mediated by the Higgs field. Employing three RMF parameter sets (NL3, BigApple, and IOPB-I) for baryonic matter, we analyze mass-radius relations, maximum mass, and tidal deformability, focusing on DM density scaling ($\alpha$) and steepness ($\beta$) parameters. Our findings reveal that increased DM concentration significantly enhances NS compactness, shifting mass-radius profiles and reducing tidal deformability. The DM influence strongly depends on the steepness of the DM density profile, where high $\beta$ values lead to strongly confined DM within the NS core, resulting in more compact and less deformable configurations. Observational constraints from PSR J0740+6620 and GW170817 impose consistent structural limits on DM fractions across different equations of state models, narrowing the allowable parameter space for DM and linking specific combinations of $\alpha M_{\chi}$ ($M_{\chi}$ being the mass of dark matter particle) and $\beta$ values to viable NS structures. This study highlights the interplay among DM concentration, nuclear stiffness, and observational data in shaping NS structure, offering insights into future constraints on DM in high-density astrophysical environments.</description>

      <title>Inferring Interpretable Models of Fragmentation Functions using Symbolic Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning is rapidly making its path into natural sciences, including high-energy physics. We present the first study that infers, directly from experimental data, a functional form of fragmentation functions. The latter represent a key ingredient to describe physical observables measured in high-energy physics processes that involve hadron production, and predict their values at different energy. Fragmentation functions can not be calculated in theory and have to be determined instead from data. Traditional approaches rely on global fits of experimental data using a pre-assumed functional form inspired from phenomenological models to learn its parameters. This novel approach uses a ML technique, namely symbolic regression, to learn an analytical model from measured charged hadron multiplicities. The function learned by symbolic regression resembles the Lund string function and describes the data well, thus representing a potential candidate for use in global FFs fits. This study represents an approach to follow in such QCD-related phenomenology studies and more generally in sciences.</description>

      <title>Dominance of Electric Fields in the Charge Splitting of Elliptic Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the impact of electromagnetic fields, highlighting the dominant effect of electric fields on the splitting of elliptic flow, \( \Delta v_2 \) with transverse momentum ($p_T$). The velocity and temperature profiles of quark-gluon plasma (QGP) is described through thermal model calculations. The electromagnetic field evolution is however determined from the solutions of Maxwell's equations, assuming constant electric and chiral conductivities. We find that the slower decay of the electric fields compared to the magnetic fields makes its impact on the splitting of the elliptic flow more dominant. We further estimated that the maximum value of \( |\langle eF \rangle| \), evaluated by averaging the field values over all spatial points on the hypersurface and across all field components, is approximately \( (0.010003 \pm 0.000195) \, m_{\pi}^2 \) for \( \sqrt{s_{\text{NN}}} = 7.7 \, \text{GeV} \), which could describe the splitting of elliptic flow data within the current experimental uncertainty reasonably well.</description>

      <title>Instantons with continuous conformal symmetries: Hyperbolic and singular monopoles and more, oh my!</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Throughout this paper, we comprehensively study instantons with every kind of continuous conformal symmetry. Examples of these objects are hard to come by due to non-linear constraints. However, by applying previous work on moduli spaces, we introduce a linear constraint, whose solution greatly simplifies these non-linear constraints. This simplification not only allows us to easily find a plethora of novel instantons with various continuous conformal symmetries and higher rank structure groups, it also provides a framework for classifying such symmetric objects. We also prove that the basic instanton is essentially the only instanton with two particular kinds of conformal symmetry. Additionally, we discuss the connections between instantons with continuous symmetries and other gauge-theoretic objects: hyperbolic and singular monopoles as well as hyperbolic analogues to Higgs bundles and Nahm data.</description>

      <title>Gravitational-wave memory effects in the Damour-Esposito-Far\`ese extension of Brans-Dicke theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07488v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational-wave memory effects are lasting changes in the strain and its time integrals. They can be computed in asymptotically flat spacetimes using the conservation and evolution equations in the Bondi-Sachs framework. Modified theories of gravity have additional degrees of freedom with their own asymptotic evolution equations; these additional fields can produce differences in the memory effects in these theories from those in general relativity. In this work, we study a scalar-tensor theory of gravity known as the Damour-Esposito-Far\`ese extension of Brans-Dicke theory. We use the Bondi-Sachs framework to compute the field equations in Bondi-Sachs form, the asymptotically flat solutions, and the leading gravitational-wave memory effects. Although Damour-Esposito-Far\`ese theory has additional nonlinearities not present in Brans-Dicke theory, these nonlinearities are subleading effects; thus, the two theories share many similarities in the leading (and some subleading) solutions to hypersurface equations, asymptotic symmetries, and types of memory effects. The conservation equations for the mass and angular momentum aspects differ between the two theories, primarily because of the differences in the evolution equation for the scalar field. This leads to differences in the time dependence of the gravitational-wave memory signals that are produced during the quasicircular inspiral of compact binaries. These differences, however, are of second-order in a small coupling parameter of these theories, which suggests that it would be challenging to use memory effects to distinguish between these two theories.</description>

      <title>Rationalisation of multiple square roots in Feynman integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Feynman integrals are very often computed from their differential equations. It is not uncommon that the $\varepsilon$-factorised differential equation contains only dlog-forms with algebraic arguments, where the algebraic part is given by (multiple) square roots. It is well-known that if all square roots are simultaneously rationalisable, the Feynman integrals can be expressed in terms of multiple polylogarithms. This is a sufficient, but not a necessary criterium. In this paper we investigate weaker requirements. We discuss under which conditions we may use different rationalisations in different parts of the calculation. In particular we show that we may use different rationalisations if they correspond to different parameterisations of the same integration path. We present a non-trivial example -- the one-loop pentagon function with three adjacent massive external legs involving seven square roots -- where this technique can be used to express the result in terms of multiple polylogarithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07495v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct new classes of the dynamical black hole solutions in five or higher dimensional Einstein-Maxwell theory, coupled to a dilaton field, in the presence of arbitrary cosmological constant. The dilaton field interacts non-trivially with the Maxwell field, as well as the cosmological constant, with two arbitrary coupling constants. The solutions are non-stationary, and almost conformally regular everywhere. To construct the solutions, we use the four-dimensional Bianchi type IX geometry, as the base space. We find three different classes of solutions, based on the values of the coupling constants. We notice that our solutions could be asymptotically de-Sitter, anti-de-Sitter or flat. We find the relevant quantities of the solutions, and discuss the properties of the solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a particular system of partial differential equations in which the harmonic, the divergence and the gradient operators of the unknown functions appear (harmonic-divgrad system). Using the Killing Hopf theorem and leveraging the properties of Riemannian manifolds with constant sectional curvature we establish the conditions under which these equations admit only the trivial solutions proving their trivialization on positive curvature space forms. The analysis of this particular system is motivated by its occurrence in the study of asymptotic symmetries in $p$-form gauge theories and in mixed symmetry tensor gauge theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As an extension of our previous work [1] (arXiv:2409.02308), we study a complete family of type D black holes with Kerr-like rotation, NUT twist, acceleration, electric and magnetic charges, and any value of the cosmological constant $\Lambda$. We relate various metric forms of these spacetimes, namely those found by Plebanski-Demianski (PD), Griffiths-Podolsky (GP), and most recently Astorino (A). By explicit coordinate transformations and proper identification of the physical parameters we show that these representations are locally equivalent, and cover the entire class of type D solutions of the Einstein-Maxwell-$\Lambda$ equations, such that the (non-null) electromagnetic field is aligned with both the (double-degenerate) principal null directions of the Weyl tensor. In particular, we concentrate on the subclass which describes accelerating NUT black holes without the Kerr-like rotation.</description>

Abstract: We initiate the study of one-loop gluon amplitudes in AdS space. These amplitudes were recently computed at tree level for a variety of backgrounds of the form $AdS_{d+1} \times S^3$. For concreteness, we compute the one-loop correction to the massless gluon amplitude on $AdS_5\times S^3$, which corresponds to the four-point correlator of the flavor current multiplet in the dual 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ SCFT. This requires solving a mixing problem that involves tree-level amplitudes of arbitrarily massive Kaluza-Klein modes. The final answer has the same color structure as in flat space but the dependence on Mandelstam variables is more complicated, with logarithms replaced by polygamma functions.</description>

Abstract: Using brane quantization, we study the representation theory of the spherical double affine Hecke algebra of type $A_1$ in terms of the topological A-model on the moduli space of flat SL(2,C)-connections on a once-punctured torus. In particular, we provide an explicit match between finite-dimensional representations and A-branes with compact support; one consequence is the discovery of new finite-dimensional indecomposable representations. We proceed to embed the A-model story in an M-theory brane construction, closely related to the one used in the 3d/3d correspondence; as a result, we identify modular tensor categories behind particular finite-dimensional representations with PSL(2,Z) action. Using a further connection to the fivebrane system for the class S construction, we go on to study the relationship of Coulomb branch geometry and algebras of line operators in 4d N=2* theories to the double affine Hecke algebra.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.01701v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using a theorem of Jackiw and Pi expressing the delicate balance of the spin and the orbital momentum, we systematically classify the flat-space massless Lagrangian quantum field theories that are invariant under the global conformal group SO(D,2). We recover in a uniform way the facts that scalars and spinors are invariant in any dimension, and that gauge p-tensors are invariant only in 2 p + 2 dimensions. This case includes the Maxwell theory in 4 dimensions and the Kalb-Ramond 2-forms theory in 6 dimensions. We then construct two new classes of Lagrangians extending the Avdeev-Chizhov self-dual tensor model to higher dimensions, one class using a symmetric metric and the other a skew metric in internal space. Finally, we prove in the same uniform way that both classes are conformal invariant in any even dimension. In 4 dimensions, these self-dual tensors naturally couple to the chiral Fermions of the standard model.</description>

      <title>New Rotating Black Hole Solutions With Imperfect Fluid Energy-Momentum Tensor In $f(R)$ Gravity</title>

Abstract: We find a new class of exact solutions for rotating black holes in $f(R)$ gravity in presence of imperfect fluid. We find that the exact solutions are holographically dual to a hidden conformal field theory. Moreover we consider another class of exact solutions for rotating black holes in $f(R)$ gravity, which is obtained through a Lorentz boost transformation on a static spherical symmetry solutions in $f(R)$ gravity. We also find that the boosted exact solutions are holographically dual to a hidden conformal field theory. Comparing the CFT temperatures and the mode numbers of the two CFTs, we suggest a conjecture that, "Two identical rotating black holes (the same mass and the horizon) in $f(R)$ theory could be distinguished by looking at their dual CFT temperatures, and the dual CFT mode numbers. The rotating black hole in the presence of matter has higher CFT temperatures and higher CFT mode numbers, compared to the vacuum boosted rotating black hole".</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we analysis the dynamics, at the quantum level, of the self-dual field minimally coupled to bosons with Lorentz symmetry breaking. We quantize the model by applying the Dirac bracket canonical quantization procedure. In addition, we test the relativistic invariance of the model by computing the boson-boson elastic scattering amplitude. Therefore, we show that the Lorentz symmetry breaking has been restored at the quantum level. We finalize our analysis by computing the dual equivalence between the self-dual model with Lorentz symmetry breaking coupled with bosonic matter and the Maxwell-Chern-Simons with Lorentz invariance violation coupled with bosonic field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13830v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute new exact analytic expressions for one-loop scalar effective actions in Kerr (A)dS black hole (BH) backgrounds in four and five dimensions. These are computed by the connection coefficients of the Heun equation via a generalization of the Gelfand-Yaglom formalism to second-order linear ODEs with regular singularities. The expressions we find are in terms of Nekrasov-Shatashvili special functions, making explicit the analytic properties of the one-loop effective actions with respect to the gravitational parameters and the precise contributions of the quasi-normal modes. The latter arise via an associated integrable system. In particular, we prove asymptotic formulae for large angular momenta in terms of hypergeometric functions and give a precise mathematical meaning to Rindler-like region contributions. Moreover we identify the leading terms in the large distance expansion as the point particle approximation of the BH and their finite size corrections as encoding the BH tidal response. We also discuss the exact properties of the thermal version of the BH effective actions by providing a proof of the DHS formula and explicitly computing it for new relevant cases. Although we focus on the real scalar field in dS-Kerr and (A)dS-Schwarzschild in four and five dimensions, similar formulae can be given for higher spin matter and radiation fields in more general gravitational backgrounds.</description>

      <title>Exact lattice bosonization of finite N matrix quantum mechanics and c = 1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07629v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe a new exact lattice bosonization of matrix quantum mechanics (equivalently of non-relativistic fermions) that is valid for arbitrary rank N of the matrix, based on an exact operator bosonization introduced earlier in [1]. The trace identities are automatically incorporated in this formalism. The finite number N of fermions is reflected in the finite number N of bosonic oscillators, or equivalently to the finite number N of lattice points. The fermion Hamiltonian is exactly mappable to a bosonic Hamiltonian. At large N, the latter becomes local and corresponds to the lattice version of a relativistic boson Hamiltonian, with a lattice spacing of order 1/N. The finite lattice spacing leads to a finite entanglement entropy (EE) of the bosonic theory, which reproduces the finite EE of the fermionic theory. Such a description is not available in the standard bosonization in terms of fermion density fluctuations on the Fermi surface, which does not have a built-in short distance cut-off (see, however, [2]). The bosonic lattice is equipped with a geometry determined by the matrix potential or equivalently by the shape of the Fermi surface. Our bosonization also works in the double scaled c=1 model, where the bosonic EE again turns out to be finite, with the short distance cut-off turning as g_s l_s, and reproduces the matrix result. Once again, such a short distance cut-off cannot appear in the conventional dual of c=1 in terms of the 2D string ``tachyon'', where the expected short distance scale is l_s. This indicates our bosonization as a possibly different dual description to the c=1 matrix model appropriate for ``local physics'' like quantum entanglement, by contrast with the conventional duality to the eigenvalue density which works well for asymptotic observables like S-matrices. We briefly discuss possible relation of our bosonization to D0 branes.</description>

      <title>Primordial black holes in SB SUSY Gauss-Bonnet inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15445v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Here, we explore the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs) within a scalar field inflationary model coupled to the Gauss-Bonnet (GB) term, incorporating the low-scale spontaneously broken supersymmetric (SB SUSY) potential. The coupling function amplifies the curvature perturbations, consequently leading to the formation of PBHs and detectable secondary gravitational waves (GWs). Through the adjustment of the model parameters, the inflaton can be decelerated during an ultra-slow-roll (USR) phase, thereby augmenting curvature perturbations. Beside the observational constraints, the swampland criteria are investigated. Our computations forecast the formation of PBHs with masses around ${\cal O}(10)M_{\odot}$, aligning with the observational data of LIGO-Virgo, and PBHs with masses ${\cal O}(10^{-6})M_{\odot}$ as potential explanation for the ultrashort-timescale microlensing events recorded in the OGLE data. Additionally, our proposed mechanism can generate PBHs with masses around ${\cal O}(10^{-13})M_{\odot}$, constituting roughly 99$\%$ of the dark matter. The density parameters of the produced GWs ($\Omega_{\rm GW_0}$) intersect with the sensitivity curves of GW detectors. Two cases of our model fall within the nano-Hz frequency regime. One of them satisfies the power-law scaling as $\Omega_{\rm{GW}}(f) \sim f^{5-\gamma}$, with the $\gamma = 3.51$, which is consistent with the data of NANOGrav 15-year.</description>

Abstract: In the context of four-dimensional ${\cal N} = 1$ type IIB superstring compactifications, the U-dual completion of the holomorphic flux superpotential leads to four S-dual pairs of fluxes, namely $(F, H), (Q, P), (P', Q')$ and $(H', F')$. It has been observed that the scalar potentials induced by such generalized superpotentials typically have an enormous amount of terms, making it hard to study any phenomenological aspects such as moduli stabilization. In this regard, we present a set of generic master formulae which not only formulate the scalar potential in a compact way but also enable one to {\it read-off} the various scalar potential pieces by simply knowing a set of topological data of the compactifying Calabi Yau and its mirror threefold. We demonstrate the applicability of our master formulae by {\it reading-off} the scalar potentials for five explicit models, and using a set of {\it axionic flux} combinations we show that 76276 terms arising from the flux superpotential in a ${\mathbb T}^6/({\mathbb Z}_2\times{\mathbb Z}_2)$-based model can be equivalently expressed by using 2816 terms, while 11212 terms arising from the flux superpotential in a Quintic-based model can be equivalently expressed by 668 terms! We argue that the master formulae presented in this work can be useful in an analytic exploration of the rich landscape of the non-geometric flux vacua.</description>

      <title>Tensionless AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$ and Single Trace $T\overline{T}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00823v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the few cases of AdS/CFT where both sides of the duality are under good control relates tensionless $k=1$ strings on AdS$_3$ to a two-dimensional symmetric product CFT. Building on prior observations, we propose an exact duality between string theory on a spacetime which is not asymptotically AdS and a non-conformal field theory. The bulk theory is constructed as a marginal deformation of the $k=1$ AdS$_3$ string while the spacetime dual is a single trace $T\overline{T}$-deformed symmetric orbifold theory. As evidence for the duality, we match the one-loop bulk and boundary torus partition functions. This correspondence provides a framework to both learn about quantum gravity beyond AdS and understand how to define physical observables in $T\overline{T}$-deformed field theories.</description>

      <title>Analytical short- and long-range kink-like structures in scalar field models with polynomial interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01961v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a class of scalar field models which engender kink-like solutions in the presence of polynomial potentials that allows for modifications of the tails of the localized configurations. We introduce a parameter in the potential that controls the classical mass associated to its minima. By using the first-order framework developed by Bogomol'nyi, we obtain analytical solutions that become more and more interactive as we increase such parameter. By investigating the limit in which the parameter tends to infinite, the kink solution gets power law tails, and we show that this feature is related to the behavior of the classical mass, which vanishes in the aforementioned limit. We also investigate the stability against small fluctuations, with the results unveiling that, depending on the values of the parameter, the stability potential may support several bound states and also, it may attain a volcano-like profile.</description>

      <title>6d Large Charge and 2d Virasoro Blocks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05944v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute observables in the interacting rank-one 6d $\mathcal{N}=(2,0)$ SCFT at large R-charge. We focus on correlators involving $\Phi^n$, namely symmetric products of the bottom component of the supermultiplet containing the stress-tensor. By using the moduli space effective action and methods from the large-charge expansion, we compute the OPE coefficients $\langle\Phi^n\Phi^m\Phi^{n+m}\rangle$ in an expansion in 1/n. The coefficients of the expansion are only partially determined from the 6d perspective, but we manage to fix them order-by-order in 1/n numerically by utilizing the 6d/2d correspondence. This is made possible by the fact that this $6d$ observable can be extracted in 2d from a specific double-scaling limit of the vacuum Virasoro block, which can be efficiently computed numerically. We also extend the computation to higher-rank SCFTs, and discuss various applications of our results to 6d as well as 2d.</description>

      <title>The full electroweak interaction: an autonomous account</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10668v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The precise renormalizable interactions in the bosonic sector of electroweak theory are intrinsically determined in the autonomous approach to perturbation theory. This proceeds directly on the Hilbert-Fock space built on the Wigner unirreps of the physical particles, with their given masses: those of three massive vector bosons, a photon, and a massive scalar (the "higgs"). Neither "gauge choices" nor an unobservable "mechanism of spontaneous symmetry breaking" are invoked. Instead, to proceed on Hilbert space requires using string-localized fields to describe the vector bosons. In such a framework, the condition of string independence of the S-matrix yields consistency constraints on the coupling coefficients, the unique outcome being the experimentally known one. The analysis can be largely carried out for other configurations of massive and massless vector bosons, paving the way towards consideration of consistent mass patterns beyond those of the electroweak theory.</description>

      <title>Bridging 4D QFTs and 2D VOAs via 3D high-temperature EFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18130v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The high-temperature limit of the superconformal index, especially on higher sheets, often captures useful universal information about a theory. In 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ superconformal field theories with fractional r-charges, there exists a special notion of high-temperature limit on higher sheets that captures data of three-dimensional topological quantum field theories arising from r-twisted circle reduction. These TQFTs are closely tied with the VOA of the 4d SCFT. We study such high-temperature limits. More specifically, we apply Di~Pietro-Komargodski type supersymmetric effective field theory techniques to r-twisted circle reductions of $(A_1,A_{2n})$ Argyres-Douglas theories, leveraging their Maruyoshi-Song Lagrangian with manifest $\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetry. The result on the second sheet is the Gang-Kim-Stubbs family of 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ SUSY enhancing rank-$0$ theories with monopole superpotentials, whose boundary supports the Virasoro minimal model VOAs $M(2,2n+3)$. Upon topological twist, they give non-unitary TQFTs controlled by the $M(2,2n+3)$ modular tensor category (MTC). The high-temperature limit on other sheets yields their unitary or non-unitary Galois conjugates. This opens up the prospect of a broader four-supercharge perspective on the celebrated correspondence between 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ SCFTs and 2d VOAs via interpolating 3d EFTs. Several byproducts follow, including a systematic approach to 3d SUSY enhancement from 4d SUSY enhancement, and a 3d QFT handle on Galois orbits of various MTCs associated with 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ SCFTs.</description>

Abstract: The late time behaviour of OTOCs involving generic non-conserved local operators show exponential decay in chaotic many body systems. However, it has been recently observed that for certain holographic theories, the OTOC involving the $U(1)$ conserved current for a gauge field instead varies diffusively at late times. The present work generalizes this observation to conserved currents corresponding to higher-form symmetries that belong to a wider class of symmetries known as generalized symmetries. We started by computing the late time behaviour of OTOCs involving $U(1)$ current operators in five dimensional AdS-Schwarzschild black hole geometry for the 2-form antisymmetric $B$-fields. The bulk solution for the $B$-field exhibits logarithmic divergences near the asymptotic AdS boundary which can be regularized by introducing a double trace deformation in the boundary CFT. Finally, we consider the more general case with antisymmetric $p$-form fields in arbitrary dimensions. In the scattering approach, the boundary OTOC can be written as an inner product between asymptotic 'in' and 'out' states which in our case is equivalent to computing the inner product between two bulk fields with and without a shockwave background. We observe that the late time OTOCs have power law tails which seems to be a universal feature of the higher-form fields with $U(1)$ charge conservation.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the shear elasticity and the shear viscosity in a simple holographic axion model with broken translational symmetry and rotational symmetry in space via the perturbation computation. We find that, in the case of spontaneous symmetry breaking, the broken translations and anisotropy both enhance the shear elasticity of the system. While in all cases, the broken symmetries introduce a double suppression on the shear viscosity, which is in contrast to the result from the study of the p-wave holographic superfluid where the shear viscosity is enhanced when the rotational symmetry is broken spontaneously.</description>

Abstract: Generalizing from previous work on the integer quantum Hall effect, we construct the effective action for the analog of Laughlin states for the fractional quantum Hall effect in higher dimensions. The formalism is a generalization of the parton picture used in two spatial dimensions, the crucial ingredient being the cancellation of anomalies for the gauge fields binding the partons together. Some subtleties which exist even in two dimensions are pointed out. The effective action is obtained from a combination of the Dolbeault and Dirac index theorems. We also present expressions for some transport coefficients such as Hall conductivity and Hall viscosity for the fractional states.</description>

      <title>The Reggeon Vertex for DDF States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17093v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a compact expression for the generating function of correlators involving an arbitrary number of bosonic open string DDF states. The explicit correlators for $M$ DDF states can then be obtained by differentiating this generating function with respect to the DDF polarization tensors. The generating function depends on single and double complex integrals centred around the punctures corresponding to the insertion points of the DDF vertices on the real axis in the upper half-plane. We have explicitly evaluated these integrals for an arbitrary number of DDF states. To check our results, we computed some massive scalars and spin-2 amplitudes for $M=3$ and $M=4$, verifying that these amplitudes have the form expected from Lorentz invariance.
  Moreover, for the first excited levels, we also show that the DDF amplitudes with generic polarizations can be reassembled into Lorentz-covariant amplitudes, with emergent covariant polarizations that match the expressions obtained by comparing the string states in both the DDF and covariant formalisms.</description>

      <title>A Note on Kinematic Flow and Differential Equations for Two-Site One-Loop Graph in FRW Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17192v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the canonical differential equations dictate the behavior of cosmological wavefunction coefficients for two-site loop-level configurations in conformally-coupled scalar field theory within a general power-law FRW cosmology. Employing the tools of relative twisted cohomology and integration-by-parts techniques, we systematically derive these equations, thereby establishing a comprehensive framework for loop-level correlators for the first time. A novel contribution of this work is the extension of kinematic flow framework to the loop-level scenarios. Using a graphical approach based on family trees generated by marked tubing graphs, we efficiently construct the differential equations while capturing the singularity structure and hierarchical relationships within the associated integral families. Furthermore, we present new insights into the tadpole systems, uncovering that their integral families can exhibit multiple parent functions due to distinct, non-overlapping relative hyperplanes, in contrast with the single parent function of bubble and tree-level systems. Additionally, we demonstrate that tadpole wavefunction coefficients selectively probe only a subset of the cohomology space, despite the hyperplane arrangement suggesting a higher-dimensional structure. Beyond these findings, we provide a preliminary discussion on generalization to two-site higher-loop configurations, laying the groundwork for future exploration of more intricate scenarios. This work introduces several first-time methodologies and results, advancing our understanding of the geometric, topological, and dynamical properties of loop-level wavefunction coefficients and offering new insights for probing the fundamental mechanisms of the early universe.</description>

      <title>Toroidal Swampland of Non-geometric Fluxes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22444v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given the huge size of the generic four-dimensional scalar potentials arising from the type II supergravities based on toroidal orientifolds, it is even hard to analytically solve the extremization conditions, and therefore the previous studies have been mainly focused on taking some numerical approaches. In this work, using the so-called {\it axionic flux polynomials} we demonstrate that the scalar potential and the extremization conditions can be simplified to a great extent, leading to the possibility of performing an analytic exploration of the flux landscape. In this regard, we consider the isotropic case of a type IIB model based on the standard ${\mathbb T}^6/({\mathbb Z}_2 \times {\mathbb Z}_2)$ orientifold having the three-form fluxes $F_3/H_3$ and the non-geometric $Q$-flux. This model results in around 300 terms in the scalar potential which depend on 6 moduli/axionic fields and 14 flux parameters. Considering that the axionic flux polynomials can take either zero or non-zero values results in the need of analyzing $2^{14}=16384$ candidate configurations, and we find that more than 16200 of those result in No-Go scenarios for Minkowskian/de-Sitter vacua. Based on our systematic exploration of non-tachyonic flux vacua, we present a detailed classification of such No-Go scenarios as well as the leftover ``undecided" configurations for which we could not conclude about the presence/absence of the stable Minkowskian/de-Sitter vacua.</description>

      <title>A Two-Loop Four-Point Form Factor at Function Level</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01571v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, the maximally-helicity-violating four-point form factor for the chiral stress-energy tensor in planar $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills was computed to three loops at the level of the symbol associated with multiple polylogarithms. It exhibits {\it antipodal self-duality}, or invariance under the combined action of a kinematic map and reversing the ordering of letters in the symbol. Here we lift the two-loop form factor from symbol level to function level. We provide an iterated representation of the function's derivatives (coproducts). In order to do so, we find a three-parameter limit of the five-parameter phase space where the symbol's letters are all rational. We also use function-level information about dihedral symmetries and the soft, collinear, and factorization limits, as well as limits governed by the form-factor operator product expansion (FFOPE). We provide plots of the remainder function on several kinematic slices, and show that the result is compatible with the FFOPE data. We further verify that antipodal self-duality is valid at two loops beyond the level of the symbol.</description>

Abstract: These notes were presented at the Young Researchers School (YRS) in Maynooth in April 2024 and provide an introduction to Conformal Field Theory CFT, Boundary Conformal Field Theory (BCFT) and Defect Conformal Field Theory (DCFT). This class is mostly self-contained and includes exercises with solutions. The first part of these notes is concerned with the basics of CFT, and was taught by the author during the pre-school for the YRS 2024. Here the aim is to convey the notion of conformal families, their fusion and the construction of partition functions. The second part of these notes is dedicated to boundaries and defects in CFT and was presented by the author at the main school. As far as boundaries are concerned, emphasis is placed on boundary operators and their state spaces, as well as the boundary state formalism with the Cardy constraint. Topological defects are discussed in analogy, i.e. defect state spaces and the relevant consistency constraint are derived. Verlinde lines are constructed as their simplest solution and their properties are inspected.</description>

Abstract: An effective action for NS5-branes coupled to supergravity is used to derive the full 10d form of horizon-free BPS solutions of fivebranes carrying momentum waves, including both transverse scalar and internal gauge excitations of the branes. When internal modes are highly excited, we find solutions that plausibly mediate the transition between the Coulomb phase of NS5-branes and the black hole phase. We also compute the two-point functions of fivebrane density fluctuations and of gravitons absorbed by the branes. Finally, we begin an exploration of near-BPS perturbations of the fivebrane ensemble, and propose the use of the brane+bulk effective action as a tool to explore the black hole phase, even in the AdS decoupling limit.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Symmetries of Galilean Electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19217v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this letter, we revisit the symmetries of Galilean Electrodynamics (GED) in a spacetime of generic dimension $d+1$. We show that these symmetries are infinitely many, and in $d=3$ they correspond to the conformal Milne algebra extended by an additional generator. We discuss their application in the context of non-relativistic AdS$_5$/CFT$_4$ correspondence.</description>

      <title>$\mathcal{N}=2$ superconformal gravitino in harmonic superspace</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14822v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the harmonic superspace formulation of $\mathcal{N}=2$ gravitino multiplet, the simplest $\mathcal{N}=2$ half-integer spin gauge supermultiplet. It is shown that, quite similar to other $\mathcal{N}=2$ gauge multiplets, the gravitino supermultiplet is described by unconstrained analytic prepotentials $h^{++\alpha}$ and $h^{+++}$ which contain a conformal gravitino in the Wess-Zumino gauge. The analytic prepotentials naturally come out from the study of $\mathcal{N}=2$ supercurrents associated with hidden symmetries of $\mathcal{N}=2$ vector-hypermultiplet system. We construct the covariant $\mathcal{N}=2$ superfield strengths and the invariant $\mathcal{N}=2$ superfield actions and sketch their component contents. We observe that, at cost of introducing new auxiliary coordinates $\Psi^\alpha$ and $\omega^+$, the gravitino analytic prepotentials acquire a nice geometric interpretation as extra veilbeins of the covariant harmonic derivative $\mathfrak{D}^{++}$. We speculate on a possible origin of the additional coordinates, including their relationship with $\mathcal{N}=2$ supertwistors.</description>

      <title>Notes on Quasinormal Modes of charged de Sitter Blackholes from Quiver Gauge Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18359v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give the connection formulae for ordinary differential equations with 5 and 6 (and in principle can be generalized to more) regular singularities from the data of instanton partition functions of quiver gauge theories. We check the consistency of these connection formulae by numerically computing the quasinormal modes (QNMs) of Reissner-Nordstr\"om de Sitter (RN-dS) blackhole. Analytic expressions are obtained for all the families of QNMs, including the photon-sphere modes, dS modes, and near-extremal modes. We also argue that a similar method can be applied to the dS-Kerr-Newman blackhole.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18997v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The formation of composite solitons produced by scalar fields without thermal phase transitions in the early Universe is considered. We present numerical simulations of the formation and evolution of soliton structures at the post-inflationary stage. The realistic initial conditions are obtained through the simulation of multiple quantum fluctuations during the inflation epoch. The initial field distributions allow to form local soliton clusters in the early Universe without the need for the thermal production of a soliton network throughout the Universe. We find that in three-dimensional space, the nontrivial composite field structures are formed in the form of &lt;&lt;soliton foam&gt;&gt;, consisting of closed domain walls, domain walls bounded by cosmic strings, and scalar field radiation. The possible cosmological implications of the soliton foam are discussed.</description>

      <title>Branes and Representations of DAHA $C^\vee C_1$: affine braid group action on category</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19647v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the representation theory of the spherical double affine Hecke algebra (DAHA) of $C^\vee C_1$, using brane quantization. By showing a one-to-one correspondence between Lagrangian $A$-branes with compact support and finite-dimensional representations of the spherical DAHA, we provide evidence of derived equivalence between the $A$-brane category of $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{C})$-character variety of a four-punctured sphere and the representation category of DAHA of $C^\vee C_1$. The $D_4$ root system plays an essential role in understanding both the geometry and representation theory. In particular, this $A$-model approach reveals the action of an affine braid group of type $D_4$ on the category. As a by-product, our geometric investigation offers detailed information about the low-energy effective dynamics of the SU(2) $N_f=4$ Seiberg-Witten theory.</description>

      <title>Search for NS 3-form Flux Induced Vacua for the Critical Non-Abelian Vortex String</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01215v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has been demonstrated that the non-Abelian solitonic vortex string in four-dimensional (4D) $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric QCD (SQCD) with gauge group U(2) and $N_f=4$ quark hypermultiplets behaves as a critical superstring. This string propagates in a ten-dimensional space comprising the flat 4D space and an internal Calabi-Yau noncompact threefold, specifically, the conifold. The lowest state of this string is a massless BPS baryon associated with the deformation of the conifold's complex structure modulus, $b$. Previous studies considered deformations of the 10-dimensional background by a nonzero Neveu-Schwarz (NS) 3-form flux, which was interpreted as selecting specific quark masses in 4D SQCD. These deformations and the corresponding back reaction on the metric were analyzed at the leading order at small 3-form flux. In this paper, we first derive the exact potential for the conifold complex structure modulus $b$ generated by the 3-form flux assuming a fixed conifold background. Then we include the back reaction effects and solve the corresponding gravity equations of motion. We show that the resulting potential gives a runaway vacuum. At this runaway vacuum the conifold undergoes degeneration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01856v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently is has been shown \cite{Gladden:2024ssb} that strongly coupled ${\cal N}=4$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills plasma with diagonal $U(1)$ $R$-charge chemical potential is unstable at $\frac{\mu}{2\pi T}=\sqrt{2}$. We construct a new homogeneous and isotropic phase of this plasma that dominates in the microcanonical ensemble (but not in the grand canonical one). The new phase extends to arbitrary high temperatures, \ie as $T\gg \mu$, and is characterized by an expectation value of a dimension-2 operator, with ${\cal O}_2\propto T^2$ -- it is the {\it ordered conformal phase}. In the limit $\frac\mu T\to 0$, this ordered phase has vanishing energy density $\frac{{\cal E}}{T^4}\propto \frac{\mu^2}{T^2}$ and is a low entropy density state $\frac{{\cal S}}{T^3}\propto \frac{\mu^2}{T^2}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1910.13653v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study an SL(2, Z) symmetry of a variant of BCOV theory in three complex dimensions. Using conjectural descriptions of twists of superstrings in terms of topological strings, we argue that this action can be thought of as a version of S-duality that preserves an SU(3)-invariant twist of type IIB supergravity. We analyze how SL(2,Z) acts on various deformations of the holomorphic-topological twist of 4-dimensional N = 4 supersymmetric gauge theory, which come from residual supertranslations and superconformal symmetries, and are of relevance to geometric Langlands theory and gauge-theoretic constructions of the Yangian.</description>

      <title>Tidal properties of neutron stars in scalar-tensor theories of gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.11323v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A major science goal of gravitational-wave (GW) observations is to probe the nature of gravity and constrain modifications to General Relativity. An established class of modified gravity theories are scalar-tensor models, which introduce an extra scalar degree of freedom. This affects the internal structure of neutron stars (NSs), as well as their dynamics and GWs in binary systems, where distinct novel features can arise from the appearance of scalar condensates in parts of the parameter space. To improve the robustness of the analyses of such GW events requires advances in modeling internal-structure-dependent phenomena in scalar-tensor theories. We develop an effective description of potentially scalarized NSs on large scales, where information about the interior is encoded in characteristic Love numbers or equivalently tidal deformabilities. We demonstrate that three independent tidal deformabilities are needed to characterize the configurations: a scalar, tensor, and a novel 'mixed' parameter, and develop the general methodology to compute these quantities. We also present case studies for different NS equations of state and scalar properties and provide the mapping between the deformabilities in different frames often used for calculations. Our results have direct applications for future GW tests of gravity and studies of potential degeneracies with other uncertain physics such as the equation of state or presence of dark matter in NS binary systems.</description>

      <title>Dirac spin liquid as an "unnecessary" quantum critical point on square lattice antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11654v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum spin liquids are exotic phases of quantum matter especially pertinent to many modern condensed matter systems. Dirac spin liquids (DSLs) are a class of gapless quantum spin liquids that do not have a quasi-particle description and are potentially realized in a wide variety of spin $1/2$ magnetic systems on $2d$ lattices. In particular, the DSL in square lattice spin-$1/2$ magnets is described at low energies by $(2+1)d$ quantum electrodynamics with $N_f=4$ flavors of massless Dirac fermions minimally coupled to an emergent $U(1)$ gauge field. The existence of a relevant, symmetry-allowed monopole perturbation renders the DSL on the square lattice intrinsically unstable. We argue that the DSL describes a stable continuous phase transition within the familiar Neel phase (or within the Valence Bond Solid (VBS) phase). In other words, the DSL is an "unnecessary" quantum critical point within a single phase of matter. Our result offers a novel view of the square lattice DSL in that the critical spin liquid can exist within either the Neel or VBS state itself, and does not require leaving these conventional states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18397v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the microscopic behavior of spacetime is critical for developing a theory of quantum gravity and perhaps solving the cosmological constant problem. In this context, it has been proposed that the quantity of interest is the quantum uncertainty in the Ricci scalar and here we investigate this for a discrete baby quantum gravity model based a single square cell. We find that the averaged Ricci scalar vanishes to leading order but has UV-divergent fluctuations. While this behavior is stable under renormalization, it appears not to be under the introduction of a small cosmological constant.</description>

      <title>Corner Charge Fluctuation as an Observable for Quantum Geometry and Entanglement in Two-dimensional Insulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17023v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Measuring bipartite fluctuations of a conserved charge, such as the particle number, is a powerful approach to understanding quantum systems. When the measured region has sharp corners, the bipartite fluctuation receives an additional contribution known to exhibit a universal angle-dependence in 2D isotropic and uniform systems. Here we establish that, for generic lattice systems of interacting particles, the corner charge fluctuation is directly related to quantum geometry. We first provide a practical scheme to isolate the corner contribution on lattices, and analytically prove that its angle-dependence in the small-angle limit measures exclusively the integrated quantum metric. A model of a compact obstructed atomic insulator is introduced to illustrate this effect analytically, while numerical verification for various Chern insulator models further demonstrate the experimental relevance of the corner charge fluctuation in a finite-size quantum simulator as a probe of quantum geometry. Last but not least, for free fermions, we unveil an intimate connection between quantum geometry and quantum information through the lens of corner entanglement entropies.</description>

      <title>$\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM cosmology: Alleviating major cosmological tensions by predicting standard neutrino properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18496v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a two-parameter extension of the $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM model by allowing variations in the effective number of neutrino species $N_{\rm eff}$ and their total mass $\sum m_\nu$. Our motivation is twofold: (i) to examine whether $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM retains its success in fitting the data and addressing major cosmological tensions, without suggesting a need for a deviation from the standard model of particle physics, and (ii) to determine whether the data indicate new physics that could potentially address cosmological tensions, either in the post-recombination universe through the late-time mirror AdS-dS transition, or in the pre-recombination universe through modifications in the standard values of $N_{\rm eff}$ and $\sum m_\nu$, or both. Within the extended $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM model, referred to as $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM+$N_{\rm eff}$+$\sum m_{\rm \nu}$, we find no significant tension when considering the Planck-alone analysis. We observe that incorporating BAO data limits the further success of the $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM extension. However, the weakly model-dependent BAOtr data, along with Planck and Planck+PP\&amp;SH0ES, favor $H_0\sim 73\,{\rm km\, s^{-1}\, Mpc^{-1}}$. In cases where BAOtr dataset is used, the mirror AdS-dS transition is very effective in providing enhanced $H_0$ values, and thus the model requires no significant deviation from the standard value of $N_{\rm eff} = 3.044$. Both the $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions are effectively addressed, with some compromise in the case of the Planck+BAO dataset. Finally, the upper bounds obtained on $\sum m_\nu \lesssim 0.5$~eV are fully compatible with neutrino oscillation experiments. Our findings provide evidence that late-time physics beyond $\Lambda$CDM, such as $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM, without altering the standard pre-recombination universe, can suffice to alleviate the major cosmological tensions.</description>

      <title>Theory of Complex Particle without Extra Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03378v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Complex particle is a kind of bilocal particle having unexpected symmetry, which was proposed by the authour. In the present paper, we show that critical dimension of the complex particle in Minkowski spacetime is $D = 4$, while $D = 2, 4$ or $6$ are permitted in Euclid spacetime. The origin of the restriction to the dimension is the existence of tertiary constraint in the canonical theory, quantization of which leads to an eigenvalue equation having single-valued and bounded solutions only in particular dimension of spacetime. The derivation is based on a detailed analysis of Laplace-Beltrami operator on $S^{1,D-2}$ or $S^{D-1}$.</description>

      <title>Clarifying Kasner dynamics inside anisotropic black hole with vector hair</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06122v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the internal dynamics of hairy black holes in the Einstein-Maxwell-vector theory. The development of the charged vector hair necessarily removes the inner Cauchy horizon and results in an anisotropic black hole ending at a spacelike singularity. The far interior evolution is characterized by the chaotic alternations among different Kasner epochs. We show that those late interior time dynamics of bounces and epochs can be captured analytically. In particular, we obtain three distinct types of transformation laws for the alternation of Kasner epochs analytically, including the Kasner inversion, Kasner transition, and Kasner reflection. Our analytical approach is corroborated by numerical solutions to the full equations of motion. Moreover, we provide a clear explanation of the alternation of Kasner epochs found numerically in the literature.</description>

      <title>Impact of extreme magnetic fields on the QCD topological susceptibility in the vicinity of the crossover region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00796v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first determination of the topological susceptibility from lattice QCD in the presence of strong background magnetic fields. Our simulations employ 2+1 flavours of stout improved staggered quarks with physical masses and cover a broad range of temperatures and magnetic field values. The results are extrapolated to the continuum limit using four different lattice spacings and an eigenvalue reweighting technique to reduce discretisation errors. For low temperatures, our calculations show an enhancement of the topological susceptibility due to the magnetic field, compatible with predictions from chiral perturbation theory. At high temperatures, we observe the impact of inverse magnetic catalysis on the susceptibility.</description>

      <title>Supertranslations at Spatial and Timelike Infinities in the First-Order Formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01783v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study supertranslations at spatial and future timelike infinity in the first-order formalism. We relax the Ashtekar-Engle-Sloan boundary conditions to allow supertranslations at the spatial infinity and obtain the precise form of the tetrads and Lorentz connections. Employing the covariant phase space technique we obtain the Hamiltonian charges for the supertranslations at both timelike and spatial infinities. The charges obtained are shown to match the expressions reported adopting the metric-based approach.</description>

      <title>Analytical solutions for Maxwell-scalar system on radially symmetric spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07633v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate Maxwell-scalar models on radially symmetric spacetimes in which the gauge and scalar fields are coupled via the electric permittivity. We find the conditions that allow for the presence of minimum energy configurations. In this formalism, the charge density must be written exclusively in terms of the components of the metric tensor and the scalar field is governed by first-order equations. We also find a manner to map the aforementioned equation into the corresponding one associated to kinks in $(1,1)$ spacetime dimensions, so we get analytical solutions for three specific spacetimes. We then calculate the energy density and show that the energy is finite. The stability of the solutions against contractions and dilations, following Derrick's argument, and around small fluctuations in the fields is also investigated. In this direction, we show that the solutions obeying the first-order framework are stable.</description>

      <title>SPECTER: Efficient Evaluation of the Spectral EMD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05379v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Energy Mover's Distance (EMD) has seen use in collider physics as a metric between events and as a geometric method of defining infrared and collinear safe observables. Recently, the Spectral Energy Mover's Distance (SEMD) has been proposed as a more analytically tractable alternative to the EMD. In this work, we obtain a closed-form expression for the Riemannian-like p = 2 SEMD metric between events, eliminating the need to numerically solve an optimal transport problem. Additionally, we show how the SEMD can be used to define event and jet shape observables by minimizing the distance between events and parameterized energy flows (similar to the EMD), and we obtain closed-form expressions for several of these observables. We also present the SPECTER framework, an efficient and highly parallelized implementation of the SEMD metric and SEMD-derived shape observables as an analogue of the previously-introduced SHAPER for EMD-based computations. We demonstrate that computing the SEMD with SPECTER can be up to a thousand times faster than computing the EMD with standard optimal transport libraries.</description>

      <title>Remarks on a nonlinear electromagnetic extension in AdS Reissner-Nordstr\"om spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23165v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the gravitational properties of a nonlinear electromagnetic extension of an AdS Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole. Our study begins with an analysis of the metric function and horizon structure, followed by calculations of the Ricci and Kretschmann scalars and an evaluation of the non-vanishing Christoffel symbols. These calculations allow us to examine geodesics and their influence on the photon sphere, and shadow formation. In the thermodynamic framework, we evaluate essential quantities, including the Hawking temperature, entropy, heat capacity, Gibbs free energy, and Hawking radiation emission. We further investigate black hole evaporation by estimating the evaporation timescale as the black hole approaches its final state. Additionally, quasinormal modes for scalar and vector perturbations are computed using the WKB approximation to characterize oscillatory behavior of the system. Finally, a time-domain analysis is provided in order to examine the evolution of these perturbations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01681v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the Heisenberg double and the Drinfeld double of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$-graded Hopf algebras. To present the constructions, we consider in detail the Borel half of $U_q(sl(2))$ and two super Hopf algebra examples: the Borel half of $U_q(osp(1|2))$ and the Borel half of $U_q(gl(1|1))$ for $q$ being a root of unity. We prove an isomorphism between the graded Heisenberg doubles and the handle algebras in the context of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$-graded generalisation of Alekseev-Schomerus combinatorial quantisation of Chern-Simons theory and illustrate it on the example of the Heisenberg double of the full $U_q(gl(1|1))$ Hopf algebra.</description>

      <title>Introduction to Thermal Field Theory: From First Principles to Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02498v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This review article provides the basics and discusses some important applications of thermal field theory, namely the combination of statistical mechanics and relativistic quantum field theory. In a first part the fundamentals are covered: the density matrix, the corresponding averages and the treatment of fields of various spin in a medium. A second part is dedicated to the computation of thermal Green's function for scalars, vectors and fermions with path-integral methods. These functions play a crucial role in thermal field theory, as explained here. A more applicative part of the review is dedicated to the production of particles in a medium and to phase transitions in field theory, including the process of vacuum decay in a general theory featuring a first-order phase transition. To understand this review, the reader should only have a good knowledge of non-statistical quantum field theory.</description>

      <title>Statistical features of quantum chaos using the Krylov operator complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18436v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently the variance of Lanzcos coefficients in the Krylov space of an initial operator is recognized as an important indicator of quantum chaos. In this paper, we generate samples of random initial operators from given probability distribtions (GOE, GUE and the uniform distribution) and do statistics on the variance of Lanczos coefficients over these initial operators. Using the Sinai billiard with an integrability-breaking term, we propose two statistical quantities that have distinct behaviors as the system changes from nonchaotic to chaotic. One is the average correlation matrix $\langle x_{i} x_{j}\rangle$ of Lanczos coefficients, which exhibits different patterns in the nonchaotic and the chaotic regime. The other one is the resulting distribution of the variance of Lanzcos coefficients. In the nonchaotic case, the resulting distributions are almost overlapping together. In the chaotic case, they split into two well-separated groups. Furthermore, the resulting statistics of these two quantities are the Wishart distribution and the (rescaled) chi-square distribution respectively, which are independent of the distributions of initial operators and become the normal distribution in the case of large matrix size.</description>

      <title>New Black Hole Solutions of Second and First Order Formulations of Nonlinear Electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20989v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the so-called Palatini formulation of General Relativity and of its modifications and extensions, we consider an analogous formulation of the dynamics of a self-interacting gauge field which is determined by non-linear extension of Maxwell's theory, usually known as nonlinear electrodynamics. In this first order formalism the field strength and the gauge potential are treated, a priori as independent, and, as such, varied independently in order to produce the field equations. Accordingly we consider within this formalism alternative and generalized non-linear Lagrangian densities. Several new spherically-symmetric objects are constructed analytically and their main properties are studied. The solutions are obtained in flat spacetime ignoring gravity and for the self-gravitating case with emphasis on black holes. As a background for comparison between the first and second order formalisms, some of the solutions are obtained by the conventional second order formalism, while for others a first order formalism is applied. Among the self-gravitating solutions we find new black holes and study their main characteristics. Some of the solutions can regularize the total energy of a point charge although their black hole counterparts are not regular.</description>

      <title>A primer of the complex WKB method, with application to the ODE/IM correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05957v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In these lectures, we provide an introduction to the complex WKB method, using as a guiding example a class of anharmonic oscillators that appears in the ODE/IM correspondence. In the first three lectures, we introduce the main objects of the method, such as the WKB function, the integral equations of Volterra type, the quadratic differential and its horizontal/Stokes lines, the Stokes phenomenon, the notion of asymptotic values, the Fock-Goncharov coordinates and their WKB approximation. In the fourth and last lecture, we compute (and prove) the asymptotic behaviour of the spectrum of the anharmonic oscillators in two asymptotic regimes, when the momentum is fixed and the energy is large, and when the momentum (hence also the energy) is large.</description>
