      <title>A Frobenius integrability theorem for plane fields generated by quasiconformal deformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalize the classical Frobenius integrability theorem to plane fields of class $C^Q$, a regularity class introduced by Reimann [Rei76] for vector fields in Euclidean spaces. A $C^Q$ vector field is uniquely integrable and its flow is a quasiconformal deformation. We show that an a.e. involutive $C^Q$ plane field (defined in a suitable way) in $\R^n$ is integrable, with integral manifolds of class $C^1$.</description>

      <title>An average intersection estimate for families of diffeomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that for any sufficiently rich compact family $\mathcal{H}$ of $C^1$ diffeomorphisms of a closed Riemannanian manifold $M$, the average geometric intersection number over $h \in \mathcal{H}$ between $h(V)$ and $W$, for $V, W$ any complementary dimensional submanifolds of $M$, is approximately (i.e. up to a uniform multiplicative error depending only on $\mathcal{H}$) the product of their volumes. We also give a construction showing that such families always exist.</description>

      <title>Allard-Type Regularity for Varifolds with Prescribed Contact Angle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a bounded $C^2$ domain in $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ and an integral $n$-rectifiable varifold $V$ with bounded first variation and bounded generalized mean curvature. Given a $C^1$ function $\theta$ defined on the boundary of the domain with range $(0,\pi)$, we assume $V$ has prescribed contact angle $\theta$ with $\partial \Omega$ and the tangent cone of $V$ at a point $X \in \partial \Omega$ is a half-hyperplane of density one. Then we can show that the support of $V$ is a $C^{1,\gamma}$ hypersurface with boundary near $X$ for some $\gamma \in (0,1)$.</description>

      <title>Restrictions of holomorphic sections to products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We associate quantum states with subsets of a product of two compact connected K\"ahler manifolds $M_1$ and $M_2$. To associate the quantum state with the subset, we use the map that restricts holomorphic sections of the quantum line bundle over the product of the two K\"ahler manifolds to the subset. We present a description of the kernel of this restriction map when the subset is a finite union of products. This in turn shows that the quantum states associated with the finite union of products are separable. Finally, for every pure state and certain mixed state, we construct subsets of $M_1\times M_2$ such that the states associated with these subsets are the original states, to begin with.</description>

      <title>On the exterior product of H\"older differential forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a complex of cochains, $\alpha$-fractional charges ($0 &lt; \alpha \leq 1$), whose regularity is between that of De Pauw-Moonens-Pfeffer's charges and that of Whitney's flat cochains. We show that $\alpha$-H\"older differential forms and their exterior derivative can be realized as $\alpha$-fractional charges, and that it is possible to define the exterior product between an $\alpha$-fractional and a $\beta$-fractional charge, under the condition that $\alpha + \beta &gt; 1$. This construction extends the Young integral in arbitrary dimension and codimension.</description>

      <title>Stable non-Hausdorff Riemannian foliations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper aims to construct foliations $\mathcal{F}$ that are stable, meaning that any other foliation close to $\mathcal{F}$ is conjugate to $\mathcal{F}$ by a diffeomorphism. Our main result yields examples of stable Riemannian foliations $\mathcal{F}$ with dense leaves. To our knowledge, these are the first examples of stable Riemannian foliations that are not Hausdorff.</description>

      <title>Tian's stabilization problem for toric Fanos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 1988, Tian posed the stabilization problem for equivariant global log canonical thresholds. We solve it in the case of toric Fano manifolds. This is the first general result on Tian's problem. A key new estimate involves expressing complex singularity exponents associated to orbits of a group action in terms of support and gauge functions from convex geometry. These techniques also yield a resolution of another conjecture of Tian from 2012 on more general thresholds associated to Grassmannians of plurianticanonical series.</description>

      <title>Manifold-Guided Lyapunov Control with Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to generating stabilizing controllers for a large class of dynamical systems using diffusion models. The core objective is to develop stabilizing control functions by identifying the closest asymptotically stable vector field relative to a predetermined manifold and adjusting the control function based on this finding. To achieve this, we employ a diffusion model trained on pairs consisting of asymptotically stable vector fields and their corresponding Lyapunov functions. Our numerical results demonstrate that this pre-trained model can achieve stabilization over previously unseen systems efficiently and rapidly, showcasing the potential of our approach in fast zero-shot control and generalizability.</description>

      <title>WKB asymptotics of Stokes matrices, spectral curves and rhombus inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider an $n\times n$ system of ODEs on $\mathbb{P}^1$ with a simple pole $A$ at $z=0$ and a double pole $u={\rm diag}(u_1, \dots, u_n)$ at $z=\infty$. This is the simplest situation in which the monodromy data of the system are described by upper and lower triangular Stokes matrices $S_\pm$, and we impose reality conditions which imply $S_-=S_+^\dagger$. We study leading WKB exponents of Stokes matrices in parametrizations given by generalized minors and by spectral coordinates, and we show that for $u$ on the caterpillar line (which corresponds to the limit $(u_{j+1}-u_j)/(u_j- u_{j-1}) \to \infty$ for $j=2, \cdots, n-1$), the real parts of these exponents are given by periods of certain cycles on the degenerate spectral curve $\Gamma(u_{\rm cat}(t), A)$.
  These cycles admit unique deformations for $u$ near the caterpillar line. Using the spectral network theory, we give for $n=2$, and $n=3$ exact WKB predictions for asymptotics of generalized minors in terms of periods of these cycles. Boalch's theorem from Poisson geometry implies that real parts of leading WKB exponents satisfy the rhombus (or interlacing) inequalities. We show that these inequalities are in correspondence with finite webs of the canonical foliation on the root curve $\Gamma^r(u, A)$, and that they follow from the positivity of the corresponding periods. We conjecture that a similar mechanism applies for $n&gt;3$.
  We also outline the relation of the spectral coordinates with the cluster structures considered by Goncharov-Shen, and with ${\mathcal N}=2$ supersymmetric quantum field theories in dimension four associated with some simple quivers.</description>

      <title>Shortest closed curve to contain a sphere in its convex hull</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.05988v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that in Euclidean 3-space any closed curve $\gamma$ which contains the unit sphere within its convex hull has length $L\geq4\pi$, and characterize the case of equality. This result generalizes the authors' recent solution to a conjecture of Zalgaller. Furthermore, for the analogous problem in $n$ dimensions, we include the estimate $L\geq Cn\sqrt{n}$ by Nazarov, which is sharp up to the constant $C$.</description>

      <title>Relative aspherical conjecture and higher codimensional obstruction to positive scalar curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11957v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the solution of the aspherical conjecture up to dimension 5 [CL20][Gro20], we want to study a relative version of the aspherical conjecture. We present a natural condition generalizing the model $X\times\mathbb{T}^k$ to the relative aspherical setting. Such model is closely related to submanifold obstruction of positive scalar curvature (PSC), and would be in similar spirit as [HPS15][CRZ23] in codim 2 case. In codim 3 and 4, we prove results on how 3-manifold obstructs the existence of PSC under our relative aspherical condition, the proof of which relies on a newly introduced geometric quantity called the it spherical width. This could be regarded as a relative version extension of the aspherical conjecture up to dim 5.</description>

      <title>$\mathrm{SU}(r)$ Vafa-Witten invariants, Ramanujan's continued fractions, and cosmic strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.13413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.13413v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We conjecture a structure formula for the $\mathrm{SU}(r)$ Vafa-Witten partition function for surfaces with holomorphic 2-form. The conjecture is based on $S$-duality and a structure formula for the vertical contribution previously derived by the third-named author using Gholampour-Thomas's theory of virtual degeneracy loci.
  For ranks $r=2,3$, conjectural expressions for the partition function in terms of the theta functions of $A_{r-1}, A_{r-1}^{\vee}$ and Seiberg-Witten invariants were known. We conjecture new expressions for $r=4,5$ in terms of the theta functions of $A_{r-1}, A_{r-1}^{\vee}$, Seiberg-Witten invariants, and continued fractions studied by Ramanujan. The vertical part of our conjectures is proved for low virtual dimensions by calculations on nested Hilbert schemes.
  The horizontal part of our conjectures gives predictions for virtual Euler characteristics of Gieseker-Maruyama moduli spaces of stable sheaves. In this case, our formulae are sums of universal functions with coefficients in Galois extensions of $\mathbb{Q}$. The universal functions, corresponding to different quantum vacua, are permuted under the action of the Galois group.
  For $r=6, 7$ we also find relations with Hauptmoduln of $\Gamma_0(r)$. We present $K$-theoretic refinements for $r=2,3,4$ involving weak Jacobi forms.</description>

      <title>Nash-Moser iteration approach to the logarithmic gradient estimates and Liouville Properties of quasilinear elliptic equations on manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.02568v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide a new routine to employ the Nash-Moser iteration technique to analyze the local and global properties of positive solutions to the equation $$\Delta_pv + a|\nabla v|^qv^r =0$$ on a complete Riemannian manifold with Ricci curvature bounded from below, where $p&gt;1$, $q$, $r$ and $a$ are some real constants. Assuming certain conditions on $a,\, p,\, q$ and $r$, we can derive universal and succinct Cheng-Yau type logarithmic gradient estimates for such solutions. In particular, we give the obvious expressions of constants in the logarithmic gradient estimate for entire solutions to the above equation (see \thmref{t10}). The gradient estimates enable us to obtain some Liouville-type theorems, Harnack inequalities and some local estimates near singularities for positive solutions. Some of our results are new even in the case the domain is an Euclidean space and $p=2$.</description>
