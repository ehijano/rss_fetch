      <title>Interaction between two hadrons in lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I report recent developments on hadron interactions in lattice QCD by the HAL QCD method. As an introduction, I summarize the lattice community's consensus on the absence of the deeply bound dinucleons at heavier pion masses. We then present 4 results by the HAL QCD method using $2+1$ flavor QCD gauge configurations at $m_\pi \simeq 146$ MeV and $a\simeq 0.0846$ fm, which are the $\Lambda\Lambda-N\Xi$ interactions, $N\Omega$ dibaryon, the tetra-quark state $T_{cc}$ and the $N-\phi$ interaction with the 2-pion tail. A brief summary follows.</description>

      <title>Real time simulations of scalar fields with kernelled complex Langevin equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real time evolution of a scalar field theory is investigated. The severe sign problem is circumvented using the Complex Langevin equation. The naive application of the method breaks down for extended real times due to the appearance of boundary terms. We use the kernel freedom of the complex Langevin equation to push the breakdown to larger real-times. We search for the optimal kernel using machine learning methods. Thus, we extend the available range for 1+1d scalar simulations beyond the state of the art simulations.</description>

      <title>Mean Field Approaches to Lattice Gauge Theories: A Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to their broad applicability, gauge theories (GTs) play a crucial role in various areas of physics, from high-energy physics to condensed matter. Their formulations on lattices, lattice gauge theories (LGTs), can be studied, among many other methods, with tools coming from statistical mechanics lattice models, such as mean field methods, which are often used to provide approximate results. Applying these methods to LGTs requires particular attention due to the intrinsic local nature of gauge symmetry, how it is reflected in the variables used to formulate the theory, and the breaking of gauge invariance when approximations are introduced. This issue has been addressed over the decades in the literature, yielding different conclusions depending on the formulation of the theory under consideration. In this article, we focus on the mean field theoretical approach to the analysis of GTs and LGTs, connecting both older and more recent results that, to the best of our knowledge, have not been compared in a pedagogical manner. After a brief overview of mean field theory in statistical mechanics and many-body systems, we examine its application to pure LGTs with a generic compact gauge group. Finally, we review the existing literature on the subject, discussing the results obtained so far and their dependence on the formulation of the theory.</description>

      <title>A model-independent parameterization of $B\rightarrow\pi\pi\ell\nu$ decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel parameterization of $B\rightarrow\pi\pi\ell\nu$ form factors relying on partial-wave decompositions and series expansions in suitable variables. We bound the expansion coefficients through unitarity and include left-hand cut contributions using established dispersive methods. The two-hadron lineshapes are treated in a model-independent manner using Omn\`es functions, thus allowing for a data-driven determination of the expansion parameters. We study the underlying composition of the di-pion system in $B\rightarrow\pi\pi\ell\nu$ decays through fits to differential spectra of $B^{+} \rightarrow \pi^{+}\pi^{-} \ell^+ \nu$ measured by the Belle experiment. In contrast to previous works, we are able to study the full phase-space and are not limited to certain kinematic regions. As a consequence, we extract branching fractions for the different partial waves of the di-pion system. We find: \begin{align*}
  \mathcal{B}(B^+\rightarrow (\pi^+ \pi^-)_S \ell^+ \nu) &amp;= 2.2^{+1.4}_{-1.0}\times 10^{-5}\,,\\
  \mathcal{B}(B^+\rightarrow (\pi^+ \pi^-)_P \ell^+\nu) &amp;= 19.6^{+2.8}_{-2.7}\times 10^{-5}\,,\\
  \mathcal{B}(B^+\rightarrow (\pi^+ \pi^-)_D \ell^+ \nu) &amp;= 3.5^{+1.3}_{-1.1}\times 10^{-5}\,. \end{align*} In addition, we derive predictions for the thus far unobserved $B^+\rightarrow \pi^0\pi^0\ell^+\nu$ decay and obtain a sizeable branching fraction of $\mathcal{B}(B^+\rightarrow \pi^0\pi^0\ell^+\nu) = 2.9^{+0.9}_{-0.7}\times 10^{-5}$.</description>

      <title>BBGKY hierarchy for quantum error mitigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mitigation of quantum errors is critical for current NISQ devices. In the current work, we address this task by treating the execution of quantum algorithms as the time evolution of an idealized physical system. We use knowledge of its physics to assist the mitigation of the quantum noise produced on the real device. In particular, the time evolution of the idealized system obeys a corresponding BBGKY hierarchy of equations. This is the basis for the novel error mitigation scheme that we propose. Specifically, we employ a subset of the BBGKY hierarchy as supplementary constraints in the ZNE method for error mitigation. We ensure that the computational cost of the scheme scales polynomially with the system size. We test our method on digital quantum simulations of the lattice Schwinger model under noise levels mimicking realistic quantum hardware. We demonstrate that our scheme systematically improves the error mitigation for the measurements of the particle number and the charge within this system. Relative to ZNE we obtain an average reduction of the error by 18.2% and 52.8% for the respective above observables. We propose further applications of the BBGKY hierarchy for quantum error mitigation.</description>

      <title>Block Lanczos for lattice QCD spectroscopy and matrix elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04444v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent work introduced a new framework for analyzing correlation functions with improved convergence and signal-to-noise properties, as well as rigorous quantification of excited-state effects, based on the Lanczos algorithm and spurious eigenvalue filtering with the Cullum-Willoughby test. Here, we extend this framework to the analysis of correlation-function matrices built from multiple interpolating operators in lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD) by constructing an oblique generalization of the block Lanczos algorithm, as well as a new physically motivated reformulation of the Cullum-Willoughby test that generalizes to block Lanczos straightforwardly. The resulting block Lanczos method directly extends generalized eigenvalue problem (GEVP) methods, which can be viewed as applying a single iteration of block Lanczos. Block Lanczos provides qualitative and quantitative advantages over GEVP methods analogous to the benefits of Lanczos over the standard effective mass, including faster convergence to ground- and excited-state energies, explicitly computable two-sided error bounds, straightforward extraction of matrix elements of external currents, and asymptotically constant signal-to-noise. No fits or statistical inference are required. Proof-of-principle calculations are performed for noiseless mock-data examples as well as two-by-two proton correlation-function matrices in lattice QCD.</description>

      <title>Moments from Momentum Derivatives in Lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19862v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the traditional moments approach in lattice QCD, based on operator product expansion (OPE), can be realized in a way that utilizes derivatives in momentum rather than in distance. This also avoids power divergent mixings, and thus allows to extract moments order by order, to all orders in principle. Moreover, by exploiting the symmetry of lattice matrix elements,we can determine the even and odd moments separately. As a demonstrative example, we determine the first three moments beyond the tensor charge gT of the isovector quark transversity distribution in the nucleon.</description>

      <title>Gauge Theory Bootstrap: Pion amplitudes and low energy parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10772v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Following the Gauge Theory Bootstrap method proposed in our previous work [arXiv:2309.12402], we compute pion scattering phase shifts for all partial waves with angular momentum $\ell\le 3$ up to 2 GeV and calculate the low energy $\chi$PT coefficients $\bar{\ell}_{1,2,4,6}$. The method looks for the most general S-matrix that matches at low energy the tree level amplitudes of the non-linear sigma model and at high energy, QCD sum rules and form factors. This is a theoretical/numerical calculation that uses as only data the pion mass $m_\pi$, pion decay constant $f_\pi$ and the QCD parameters $N_c=3$, $N_f=2$, $m_q$ and $\alpha_s$. All results are in reasonable agreement with experiment. In particular, we find the $\rho(770)$, $f_2(1270)$ and $\rho(1450)$ resonances. The interplay between the UV gauge theory and low energy pion physics is an example of a general situation where we know the microscopic theory as well as the effective theory of long wavelength fluctuations but we want to solve the strongly coupled dynamics at intermediate energies. The bootstrap builds a bridge between the low and high energy by determining the consistent S-matrix that matches both and provides, in this case, a new direction to understand the strongly coupled physics of gauge theories.</description>

      <title>Effects of threshold resummation for large-$x$ PDF in large momentum effective theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12910v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Parton distribution functions (PDFs) at large $x$ are challenging to extract from experimental data, yet they are essential for understanding hadron structure and searching for new physics beyond the Standard Model. Within the framework of the large momentum $P^z$ expansion of lattice quasi-PDFs, we investigate large $x$ PDFs, where the matching coefficient is factorized into the hard kernel, related to the active quark momentum $x P^z$, and the threshold soft function, associated with the spectator momentum $(1-x) P^z$. The renormalization group equation of the soft function enables the resummation of the threshold double logarithms $\alpha^{k} \ln^{2k}(1-x)$, which is crucial for a reliable and controllable calculation of large $x$ PDFs. Our analysis with pion valence PDFs indicates that perturbative matching breaks down when the spectator momentum $(1-x)P^z$ approaches $\Lambda_{\rm QCD}$, but remains valid when both $x P^z$ and $(1-x)P^z$ are much larger than $\Lambda_{\rm QCD}$. Additionally, we incorporate leading renormalon resummation within the threshold framework, demonstrating good perturbative convergence in the region where both spectator and active quark momenta are perturbative scales.</description>

      <title>Fully charmed P-wave tetraquark resonant states in the quark model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17962v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We conduct the first comprehensive P-wave four-body dynamical calculations of the fully charmed tetraquark systems within the quark potential model. We apply the Gaussian expansion method to solve the four-body Schr\"odinger equation, incorporating both dimeson and diquark-antidiquark spatial configurations. The matrix elements of P-wave states are calculated analytically using the infinitesimally-shifted Gaussian basis functions. With the complex scaling method, we obtain several fully charmed P-wave resonant states with compact tetraquark configuration in the mass region of $(7.0,7.2)$ GeV, including states with exotic quantum numbers $J^{PC}=0^{--},1^{-+}$. However, we find no resonant states with the mass $M&lt;7$ GeV and width $\Gamma&lt;200$ MeV. Combining the present investigation with our previous results on S-wave fully charmed tetraquark systems, we find no candidates for the experimental states $X(6400)$ and $X(6600)$ in the quark model.</description>
