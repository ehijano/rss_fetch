      <title>Room-temperature optomechanics with light-matter condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we develop an optomechanical formalism for macroscopic quantum states in exciton-polariton systems with strong exciton-phonon interactions. We show that polariton optomechanical interactions induce dynamical backaction, resulting in dispersive and dissipative shifts in the complex vibrational response functions. Unlike conventional optomechanical systems, polariton optomechanics features high-dimensionality and phase-space confinement due to the dispersion relations of exciton-polaritons. Consequently, vibrational modes exhibit effective positive or negative mass depending on the detuning parameter, and are capable for the vibrational Bose condensation under the resonant conditions. We demonstrate the potential for vibrational control of polariton condensates at room temperature.</description>

      <title>Magnetic trapping of an ultracold $^{39}$K-$^{40}$K mixture with a versatile potassium laser system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a dual isotope magneto-optical trap (MOT), simultaneous sub-Doppler laser cooling, and magnetic trapping of a spin-polarized $^{39}$K-$^{40}$K Bose-Fermi mixture realized in a single-chamber setup with an unenriched potassium dispenser as the source of atoms. We are able to magnetically confine more than $2.2\times10^5$ fermions ($F=9/2\,m_F=9/2$) and $1.4\times10^7$ bosons ($F=2\,m_F=2$) with a lifetime exceeding 1.2 s. For this work, we have developed a versatile laser tailored for sub-Doppler cooling of all naturally occurring potassium isotopes and their mixtures. This laser system incorporates innovative features, such as the capability to select an isotope by activating or deactivating specific acousto-optic modulators that control the light seeding tapered amplifiers. Switching between isotopes takes $\sim$1 $\mathrm{\mu}$s without any mechanical adjustment of the components. As a final step in characterizing the laser system, we demonstrate sub-Doppler cooling of $^{41}$K.</description>

      <title>Observation of Generalized t-J Spin Dynamics with Tunable Dipolar Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18916v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Long-range and anisotropic dipolar interactions profoundly modify the dynamics of particles hopping in a periodic lattice potential. Here, we report the realization of a generalized t-J model with dipolar interactions using a system of ultracold fermionic molecules with spin encoded in the two lowest rotational states. We systematically explore the role of dipolar Ising and spin-exchange couplings and the effect of motion on spin dynamics. The model parameters can be controlled independently, with dipolar couplings tuned by electric fields and motion regulated by optical lattices. Using Ramsey spectroscopy, we observed interaction-driven contrast decay that depends strongly both on the strength of the anisotropy between Ising and spin-exchange couplings and on motion. These observations are supported by theory models established in different motional regimes that provide intuitive pictures of the underlying physics. This study paves the way for future exploration of kinetic spin dynamics and quantum magnetism with highly tunable molecular platforms in regimes challenging for existing numerical and analytical methods, and it could shed light on the complex behaviors observed in real materials.</description>

      <title>Amoeba Formulation of Non-Bloch Band Theory in Arbitrary Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.11743v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect dramatically reshapes the energy bands of non-Hermitian systems, meaning that the usual Bloch band theory is fundamentally inadequate as their characterization. The non-Bloch band theory, in which the concept of Brillouin zone is generalized, has been widely applied to investigate non-Hermitian systems in one spatial dimension. However, its generalization to higher dimensions has been challenging. Here, we develop a formulation of the non-Hermitian skin effect and non-Bloch band theory in arbitrary spatial dimensions, which is based on a natural geometrical object known as the amoeba. Our theory provides a general framework for studying non-Hermitian bands beyond one dimension. Key quantities of non-Hermitian bands, including the energy spectrum, eigenstates profiles, and the generalized Brillouin zone, can be efficiently obtained from this approach.</description>

      <title>Self-consistent many-body metrology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.02580v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate performing classical and quantum metrology and parameter estimation by using interacting trapped bosons, which we theoretically treat by a self-consistent many-body approach of the multiconfigurational Hartree type. Focusing on a tilted double-well geometry, we compare a self-consistently determined and monitored two-mode truncation, with dynamically changing orbitals, to the conventional two-mode approach of fixed orbitals, where only Fock space coefficients evolve in time. We demonstrate that, as a consequence, various metrological quantities associated to a concrete measurement such as the classical Fisher information and the maximum likelihood estimator are deeply affected by the orbitals' change during the quantum evolution. Self-consistency of the quantum many-body dynamics of interacting trapped ultracold gases thus fundamentally affects the attainable parameter estimation accuracy of a given metrological protocol.</description>

      <title>Superradiant phase transition in a large interacting driven atomic ensemble in free space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12939v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Atomic ensembles strongly interacting with light constitute rich quantum-optical many-body systems, with the potential for observing cooperative effects and dissipative nonequilibrium phase transitions. We theoretically analyze the conditions under which a driven atomic ensemble in free space, characterized by strong dipole-dipole interactions and large spatial extent, can undergo a superradiant phase transition, also known as cooperative resonance fluorescence. In an atomic array, stationary states that conserve the collective pseudospin exhibit completely cooperative decay and undergo a second-order phase transition in the large atom number limit. In contrast, decay mechanisms on longer timescales that fail to conserve pseudospin can lead to discontinuous first-order phase transition at a critical finite atom number, disrupting cooperation despite sharing many similar observable characteristics. A hallmark of the superradiant phase transition is an abrupt shift from total light reflection off the atoms to rapidly increasing transmission, accompanied by significant quantum fluctuations, as a function of light intensity.</description>

      <title>Imaginary Stark Skin Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16774v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) is a unique phenomenon in non-Hermitian systems. However, studies on NHSE in systems without translational symmetry remain largely unexplored. Here, we unveil a new class of NHSE, dubbed "imaginary Stark skin effect" (ISSE), in a one-dimensional lossy lattice with a spatially increasing loss rate. The energy spectrum of this model exhibits a T-shaped feature, with approximately half of the eigenstates localized at the left boundary. These skin modes exhibit peculiar behaviors, expressed as a single stable exponential decay wave within the bulk region. We use the transfer matrix method to analyze the formation of the ISSE in this model. According to the eigen-decomposition of the transfer matrix, the wave function is divided into two parts, one of which dominates the behavior of the skin modes in the bulk. Our findings provide insights into the NHSE in systems without translational symmetry and contribute to the understanding of non-Hermitian systems in general.</description>
