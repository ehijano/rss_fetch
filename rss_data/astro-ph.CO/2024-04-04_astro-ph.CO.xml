      <title>A Consistent Cosmic Shear Analysis in Harmonic and Real Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent cosmic shear analyses have exhibited inconsistencies of up to $1\sigma$ between the inferred cosmological parameters when analyzing summary statistics in real space versus harmonic space. In this paper, we demonstrate the consistent measurement and analysis of cosmic shear two-point functions in harmonic and real space using the $i${\sc Master} algorithm. This algorithm provides a consistent prescription to model the survey window effects and scale cuts in both real space (due to observational systematics) and harmonic space (due to model limitations), resulting in a consistent estimation of the cosmic shear power spectrum from both harmonic and real space estimators. We show that the $i$\textsc{Master} algorithm gives consistent results using measurements from the HSC Y1 mock shape catalogs in both real and harmonic space, resulting in consistent inferences of $S_8=\sigma_8(\Omega_m/0.3)^{0.5}$. This method provides an unbiased estimate of the cosmic shear power spectrum, and $S_8$ inference that has a correlation coefficient of 0.997 between analyses using measurements in real space and harmonic space. We observe the mean difference between the two inferred $S_8$ values to be 0.0004, far below the observed difference of 0.042 for the published HSC Y1 analyses and well below the statistical uncertainties. While the notation employed in this paper is specific to photometric galaxy surveys, the methods are equally applicable and can be extended to spectroscopic galaxy surveys, intensity mapping, and CMB surveys.</description>

      <title>No need to know: astrophysics-free gravitational-wave cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational waves from merging compact objects encode direct information about the luminosity distance to the binary. When paired with a redshift measurement, this enables standard-siren cosmology: a Hubble diagram can be constructed to directly probe the Universe's expansion. This can be done in the absence of electromagnetic measurements as features in the mass distribution of GW sources provide self-calibrating redshift measurements without the need for a definite or probabilistic host galaxy association. This technique has thus far only been applied with simple parametric representations of the mass distribution. However, the use of an inaccurate representation leads to biases in the cosmological inference, an acute problem given the current uncertainties in true source population. Furthermore, it is commonly presumed that the form of the mass distribution must be known a priori to obtain unbiased measurements of cosmological parameters in this fashion. Here, we demonstrate that spectral sirens can accurately infer cosmological parameters without such prior assumptions. We apply a flexible, non-parametric model for the mass distribution of compact binaries to a simulated catalog of 1,000 gravitational-wave events, consistent with expectations for the next LVK observing run. We find that, despite our model's flexibility, both the source mass model and cosmological parameters are correctly reconstructed. We predict a $5.8\%$ measurement of $H_0$, keeping all other cosmological parameters fixed, and a $6.4\%$ measurement of $H(z=0.9)$ when fitting for multiple cosmological parameters ($1\sigma$ uncertainties). This astrophysically-agnostic spectral siren technique will be essential to arrive at precise and unbiased cosmological constraints from GW source populations.</description>

      <title>Neural network reconstruction of density and velocity fields from the 2MASS Redshift Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We reconstruct the 3D matter density and peculiar velocity fields in the local Universe up to a distance of $200\,h^{-1}\,\mathrm{Mpc}$ from the Two-Micron All-Sky Redshift Survey (2MRS), using a neural network (NN). We employ a NN with U-net autoencoder architecture and a weighted mean squared error loss function, trained separately to output either the density or velocity field for a given input grid of galaxy number counts. The NN is trained on mocks derived from the Quijote N-body simulations, incorporating redshift-space distortions (RSD), galaxy bias and selection effects, closely mimicking the characteristics of 2MRS. The trained NN is benchmarked against a standard Wiener filter (WF) on a validation set of mocks, before applying it to 2MRS. The NN reconstructions effectively approximate the mean posterior estimate of the true density and velocity fields conditioned on the observations. They consistently outperform the WF in terms of reconstruction accuracy, and effectively capture the nonlinear relation between velocity and density. The NN-reconstructed bulk flow of the total survey volume exhibits a significant correlation with the true mock bulk flow, demonstrating that the NN is sensitive to information on super-survey scales encoded in the RSD. When applied to 2MRS, the NN successfully recovers the main known clusters, some of which are partially in the Zone of Avoidance. The reconstructed bulk flows in spheres of different radii less than $100\,h^{-1}\,\mathrm{Mpc}$ are in good agreement with a previous 2MRS analysis that required an additional external bulk flow component inferred from directly observed peculiar velocities. The NN-reconstructed peculiar velocity of the Local Group closely matches the observed CMB dipole in amplitude and Galactic latitude, and only deviates by $18^\circ$ in longitude. The NN-reconstructed fields are publicly available.</description>

      <title>Large curvature fluctuations from no-scale supergravity with a spectator field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the large curvature perturbations which can lead to the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs) in the context of no-scale supergravity. Our study does not depend on any exotic scenario, such as scalar potentials with inflection points or bulks, and aims to avoid the fine-tuning of model parameters to achieve the formation of PBHs. This formation relies on the quantum fluctuations of a light spectator stochastic field after the inflationary period. Our analysis is based on the SU(2,1)/SU(2)$\times$U(1) symmetry, considering both the inflaton and the spectator field. Specifically, we examine existing no-scale models with Starobinsky-like scalar potentials that are consistent with observable constraints on inflation from measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). These models involve two chiral fields: the inflaton and the modulus field. We propose a novel role for the modulus field as a spectator field, responsible for generating PBHs. Our hypothesis suggests that while the inflaton field satisfies the CMB constraints of inflation, it is the modulus field acting as the spectator that leads to large curvature perturbations, capable to explain the production of PBHs. Additionally, we prioritize retaining the inflationary constraints from the CMB through the consideration of spectator fluctuations. Therefore, by exploring the relationship between these fields within the framework of the SU(2,1)/SU(2)$\times$U(1) symmetry, our aim is to unveil their implications for the formation of PBHs.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Curvature Perturbation and Primordial Black Hole Formation in Two-stage Inflation with a break</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a model of $R^2$-gravity with a non-minimally coupled scalar field that gives rise to two-stage inflation with a break, that is, with an intermediate stage where inflation momentarily halts. We find that the power spectrum of the primordial curvature perturbation is significantly enhanced at the break scale, which can account for the primordial black hole (PBH) formation, without affecting the CMB constraint on large scales. The behavior of the curvature perturbation is carefully analyzed and we find a few notable new features in the spectrum. In particular, we find that the $k^3$ growth of the spectrum of toward the end of the first stage of inflation. We argue that this is a universal feature common to all two-stage models where the field dominating the second stage is heavy during the first stage. By appropriately tuning the model parameters, we find that our model can realize the scenario of PBHs as the cold dark matter of the Universe. We also find that we can choose the parameters so that the spectrum of the induced gravitational waves from the enhanced curvature perturbation fits the NANOGrav-15yr data of pulsar timing array observation.</description>

      <title>Beyond Gaps and Bumps: Spectral Siren Cosmology with Non-Parametric Population Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational wave standard sirens typically require electromagnetic (EM) data to obtain redshift information to constrain cosmology. Difficult to find EM counterparts for bright sirens and galaxy survey systematics for dark sirens make cosmological constraints with spectral sirens, a gravitational wave data-only approach, extremely appealing. In this work, we use the GWTC-3 BBH detections as spectral sirens to constrain the BBH population and the underlying cosmological expansion with a flexible model for the black hole mass spectrum. We use a binned Gaussian process to model the BBH mass distribution in the source frame without any astrophysical assumptions on the shape and or inclusion (or lack of) features that drive the cosmological constraints as the redshifted detector frame masses become consistent with the underlying astrophysical mass distribution features. For GWTC-3 we find a measurement on the Hubble constant of $H_0=73.0^{+13.3}_{-7.7} \ {\rm{km \ s^{-1} \ Mpc^{-1}}}$ at $68\%$ C.L. when combined with that obtained from the bright standard siren analysis with GW170817 and its associated host galaxy NGC 4993. We find an improved estimate for the Hubble constant of around a factor of 1.4 times better than the GW170817 measurement alone. We validate our nonparametric spectral siren approach with simulations and benchmark its scalability and constraining performance when compared with parametric methods.</description>

      <title>Revised bounds on local cosmic strings from NANOGrav observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recent paper, the NANOGrav collaboration studied new physics explanations of the observed pulsar timing residuals consistent with a stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB), including cosmic strings in the Nambu-Goto (NG) approximation. Analysing one of current models for the loop distribution, it was found that the cosmic string model is disfavored compared to other sources, for example, super massive black hole binaries (SMBHBs). When both SMBHB and cosmic string models are included in the analysis, an upper bound on a string tension $G\mu \lesssim 10^{-10}$ was derived. However, the analysis did not accommodate results from cosmic string simulations in an underlying field theory, which indicate that at most a small fraction of string loops survive long enough to emit GW. Following and extending our previous study, we suppose that a fraction $f_{\rm NG}$ of string loops follow NG dynamics and emit only GWs, and study the three different models of the loop distribution discussed in the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) collaboration analyses. We re-analyze the NANOGrav 15yrs data with our signal models by using the NANOGrav $\texttt{ENTERPRISE}$ analysis code via the wrapper $\texttt{PTArcade}$. We find that loop distributions similar to LVK Model B and C yield higher Bayes factor than Model A analyzed in the NANOGrav paper, as they can more easily accommodate a blue-tilted spectrum of the observed amplitude. Furthermore, because of the degeneracy of $G\mu$ and $f_{\rm NG}$ in determining the signal amplitude, our posterior distribution extends to higher values of $G\mu$, and in some cases the uppermost value of credible intervals is close to the Cosmic Microwave Background limit $G\mu \lesssim 10^{-7}$. Hence, in addition to the pulsar timing array data, further information about the fraction of long-lived loops in a cosmic string network is required to constrain the string tension.</description>

      <title>Simulating the Universe from the cosmological horizon to halo scales</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultra-large scales close to the cosmological horizon will be probed by the upcoming observational campaigns. They hold the promise to constrain single-field inflation as well as general relativity, but in order to include them in the forthcoming analyses, their modelling has to be robust. In particular, fictitious gauge modes may be mistaken for primordial signals, and no consensus has emerged either from analytical modelling nor from the numerical route, obstructed by the large dynamical range to be simulated. In this work, we present a numerical technique to overcome the latter limitation: we compute the general relativistic displacement field with the N-body relativistic code gevolution and combine it with the accurate Newtonian simulation Gadget-4. This combination leads to an effective simulation reproducing the desired behaviour at the level of the matter power spectrum and bispectrum. We then measure, for the first time in a simulation, the relativistic scale-dependent bias in Poisson gauge; at redshift $z=0$, we find $b_1^{\mathrm{GR}}=-5.7 \pm 1.7$. Our results at the field level are only valid in the Poisson gauge and need to be complemented with a relativistic ray tracing algorithm to compute the number count observable.</description>

      <title>The Primordial Black Hole Formation -- Null Geodesic Correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide evidence for a correspondence between the formation of primordial black holes and the stability of circular null geodesics around the collapsing perturbation. We first show that the critical threshold of the compaction function to form a black hole in radiation is well approximated by the critical threshold for the appearance of the first unstable circular orbit. We also show that the critical exponent in the scaling law of the primordial black hole mass close to the threshold is set by the inverse of the Lyapunov coefficient of the unstable orbits when a self-similar stage is developed close to criticality.</description>

      <title>Forecasting the sensitivity of Pulsar Timing Arrays to gravitational wave backgrounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) observations hinted towards the existence of a stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) in the nHz frequency band. Still, the nature of the SGWB signal cannot be confidently inferred from current data, and the leading explanation invokes mergers of supermassive black holes. If confirmed, such discovery would not only represent a turning point in our understanding of astrophysics, but it may severely limit the capability of searching for additional cosmological sources in the nHz frequency range. In this work, we build a simple framework to forecast the sensitivity of future PTA configurations and assess the parameter estimation of SGWB, which could consist of several contributions. We release the python code fastPTA implementing this framework and ready to use.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a symmetric teleparallel gravity with a Lagrangian of logarithmic form. The full model leads to an accelerated universe and for specific values of the free parameters the Hubble rate reduces to the well-known Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati model, though the evolution of the gravitational potentials are different. We consider different branches of the logarithmic model, among which are self-accelerated branch and normal branch. The phenomenology of both the background and linear perturbations is discussed, including all the relevant effects on cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB) angular power spectrum, lensing and matter power spectra. To this purpose, we modified the Einstein-Boltzmann code mgcamb. Finally, we derive bounds on the free parameters which are in agreement with early dark energy constraint from CMB and big bang nucleosynthesis constraint on the helium abundance.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the Cosmic Neutrino Background from NGC 1068</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02202v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use recent evidence of TeV neutrino events from NGC 1068, detected by the IceCube experiment, to constrain the overdensity of relic neutrinos locally and globally. Since these high-energy neutrinos have travelled long distances through a sea of relic neutrinos, they could have undergone scattering, altering their observed flux on Earth. Considering only Standard Model interactions, we constrain the relic overdensity to be $\eta\leq 3.85 \times 10^8 (5.39 \times 10^{11})$ at the 95$\%$ confidence level for overdensities with a radius of 14 Mpc (10 kpc), assuming the sum of neutrino masses saturates the cosmological bound, $\sum_i m_i = 0.13$ eV. We demonstrate that this limit improves with larger neutrino masses and how it depends on the scale of the overdensity region.</description>

      <title>A Scotogenic Model as a Prototype for Leptogenesis with One Single Gauge Singlet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the potential of a minimal Scotogenic model with two additional scalar doublets and a single heavy Majorana fermion to explain neutrino masses, dark matter, and the baryon asymmetry of the Universe. In this minimal setup, Leptogenesis is purely flavored, and a second Majorana neutrino is not necessary because the Yukawa couplings of the extra doublets yield the necessary $CP$-odd phases. The mechanism we employ can also be applied to a wide range of scenarios with at least one singlet and two gauge multiplets. Despite stringent limits from the dark matter abundance, direct detection experiments, and the baryon asymmetry of the Universe, we find a parametric region consistent with all bounds which could resolve the above shortcomings of the Standard Model of particle physics. Methodically, we improve on the calculation of correlations between the mixing scalar fields given their finite width. We also present an argument to justify the kinetic equilibrium approximation for out-of-equilibrium distribution functions often used in calculations of Baryogenesis and Leptogenesis.</description>

      <title>The JWST-PRIMAL Legacy Survey. A JWST/NIRSpec reference sample for the physical properties and Lyman-$\alpha$ absorption and emission of $\sim 500$ galaxies at $z=5.5-13.4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the surprising early findings with JWST has been the discovery of a strong "roll-over" or a softening of the absorption edge of Ly$\alpha$ in a large number of galaxies at ($z\gtrsim 6$), in addition to systematic offsets from photometric redshift estimates and fundamental galaxy scaling relations. This has been interpreted as damped Ly$\alpha$ absorption (DLA) wings from high column densities of neutral atomic hydrogen (HI), signifying major gas accretion events in the formation of these galaxies. To explore this new phenomenon systematically, we assemble the JWST/NIRSpec PRImordial gas Mass AssembLy (PRIMAL) legacy survey of 494 galaxies at $z=5.5-13.4$. We characterize this benchmark sample in full and spectroscopically derive the galaxy redshifts, metallicities, star-formation rates, and ultraviolet slopes. We define a new diagnostic, the Ly$\alpha$ damping parameter $D_{\rm Ly\alpha}$ to measure and quantify the Ly$\alpha$ emission strength, HI fraction in the IGM, or local HI column density for each source. The JWST-PRIMAL survey is based on the spectroscopic DAWN JWST Archive (DJA-Spec). All the software, reduced spectra, and spectroscopically derived quantities and catalogs are made publicly available in dedicated repositories. The fraction of strong galaxy DLAs are found to be in the range $65-95\%$ at $z&gt;5.5$. The fraction of strong Ly$\alpha$ emitters (LAEs) is found to increase with decreasing redshift, in qualitative agreement with previous observational results, and are predominantly associated with low-metallicity and UV faint galaxies. By contrast, strong DLAs are observed in galaxies with a variety of intrinsic physical properties. Our results indicate that strong DLAs likely reflect a particular early assembly phase of reionization-era galaxies, at which point they are largely dominated by pristine HI gas accretion.

      <title>Licking the plate: dusty star-forming galaxies buried in the ALMA calibration data</title>

Abstract: Deep, unbiased surveys are essential to decipher the cosmic evolution of galaxies. The submillimetre (submm) and millimetre (mm) windows complement the UV/optical waveband and are key to revealing the cold and dusty Universe. Traditional ways of conducting deep surveys resort to either lensed fields or target small areas for ultra-long integrations. These surveys have greatly advanced our understanding of dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs), but are susceptible to lensing uncertainties and cosmic variance and will be expensive to expand. Here, we summarise our recent multi-wavelength survey of DSFGs in the vicinity of ALMA's calibrators: the ALMACAL survey. These fields have accumulated many hundreds of hours of on-source time, reaching depths and effective areas that are competitive with bespoke cosmological surveys. We summarise the multi-wavelength number counts from ALMACAL and the resolved fraction of the Cosmic Infrared Background (CIB) from submm to mm wavelengths. Meanwhile, combining all available ALMA observations in each field results in impressive frequency coverage, which often yields the redshifts of these DSFGs. The ALMACAL survey has demonstrated the scientific value of calibration scans for all submm/mm and radio telescopes, existing and planned.</description>

      <title>Ultralight scalar dark matter versus non-adiabatic perfect fluid dark matter in pulsar timing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent evidence of direct detection of stochastic gravitational waves reported by pulsar timing array collaborations might open a new window for studying cosmology and astrophysical phenomena. In addition to signals from gravitational waves, there is motivation to explore residual signals from oscillating dark matter, which might partially comprise the galactic halo. We investigate fluctuations in pulsar timing originating from the coherent oscillation of scalar dark matter up to the subleading order of $\mathcal{O}(k/m)$, as well as from acoustic oscillations of non-adiabatic perfect fluid dark matter. Both types of dark matter can generate oscillating Newtonian potential perturbations and curvature perturbations, thereby affecting pulsar timing. Our results show distinctive signatures in pulsar timing residuals and angular correlations for these dark matters. Specifically, pulsar timing residuals from non-adiabatic perfect fluid dark matter exhibit different directional dependence and are shown to be more sensitive to the distance to a pulsar. We also study the angular correlation patterns from these dark matters in the NANOGrav 15-year data set. The best fit might suggest that the composition of non-adiabatic perfect fluid dark matter in our galaxy is much greater than that of ultralight scalar dark matter.</description>

      <title>Modelling the star-formation activity and ionizing properties of high-redshift galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Early results from the JWST observations have reported a surprisingly high number of UV-bright galaxies at $z \geq 10$, which appears to challenge the theoretical predictions from standard galaxy formation models in the $\Lambda$CDM framework at these redshifts. To alleviate this tension, several cosmological and astrophysical interpretations have been advanced. However, all of these proposed scenarios carry noteworthy consequences for other large-scale processes in the early Universe, particularly cosmic reionization, since high-redshift galaxies are believed to be the primary ionizing sources during the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). To investigate this, we introduce a semi-analytical model of galaxy formation and evolution that explains the evolving galaxy UV luminosity function (UVLF) over $6 \lesssim z \lesssim 15$, and also jointly tracks the time evolution of the globally averaged neutral hydrogen fraction in the intergalactic medium. The model self-consistently accounts for the suppression of star formation in low-mass galaxies due to reionization feedback and is constrained by comparing the model predictions with various observational probes like the UVLF data from HST and JWST, recent measurements of the neutral hydrogen fraction, and the CMB scattering optical depth. Our analysis confirms that a rapid enhancement in the star-formation rate efficiency and/or UV luminosity per stellar mass formed is necessary for consistency with the JWST UVLF estimates at $z \geq 10$. We further find that it is possible to jointly satisfy the current reionization constraints when the escape fraction is assumed to be halo-mass dependent, requiring higher Lyman-continuum leakage from low-mass galaxies. We also examine the relative contribution of galaxies with different UV luminosities towards the ionizing photon budget for the EoR and investigate the large-scale bias of high-$z$ galaxies.</description>

      <title>Scalar induced gravity waves from ultra slow-roll Galileon inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.09273v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the production of secondary gravity waves in Galileon inflation with an ultra-slow roll (USR) phase and show that the spectrum of scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs) in this case is consistent with the recent NANOGrav 15-year data and with sensitivities of other ground and space-based missions, LISA, BBO, DECIGO, CE, ET, HLVK (consists of aLIGO, aVirgo, and KAGRA), and HLV(03). Thanks to the non-renormalization property of Galileon theory, the amplitude of the large fluctuation is controllable at the sharp transitions between SR and USR regions. We show that the behaviour of the GW spectrum, when one-loop effects are included in the scalar power spectrum, is preserved under a shift of the sharp transition scale with peak amplitude $\Omega_{\rm GW}h^2\sim {\cal O}(10^{-6})$, and hence it can cover a wide range of frequencies within ${\cal O}(10^{-9}{\rm Hz} - 10^{7}{\rm Hz})$. An analysis of the allowed mass range for primordial black holes (PBHs) is also performed, where we find that mass values ranging from ${\cal O}(1M_{\odot} - 10^{-18}M_{\odot})$ can be generated over the corresponding allowed range of low and high frequencies.</description>

      <title>Power spectrum estimation methods on intracluster medium surface brightness fluctuations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.07117v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate estimation of galaxy cluster masses is a central problem in cosmology. Turbulence is believed to introduce significant deviations from the hydrostatic mass estimates. Estimation of turbulence properties is complicated by projection of the 3D cluster onto the 2D plane of the sky, and is commonly done in the form of indirect probes from fluctuations in the X-ray surface brightness and Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect maps. In this paper, we address this problem using simulations. We examine different methods for estimating the power spectrum on 2D projected fluctuation data, emulating data projected onto a 2D plane of the sky, and comparing them to the original, expected 3D power spectrum. Noise can contaminate the power spectrum of ICM observations, so we also briefly compare a few methods of reducing noise in the images for better spectral estimation.</description>

      <title>How much information can be extracted from galaxy clustering at the field level?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03220v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present optimal Bayesian field-level cosmological constraints from nonlinear tracers of the large-scale structure, specifically the amplitude $\sigma_8$ of linear matter fluctuations inferred from rest-frame simulated dark matter halos in a comoving volume of $8\,(h^{-1}\mathrm{Gpc})^3$. Our constraint on $\sigma_8$ is entirely due to nonlinear information, and obtained by explicitly sampling the initial conditions along with bias and noise parameters via a Lagrangian EFT-based forward model, LEFTfield. The comparison with a simulation-based inference analysis employing the power spectrum and bispectrum -- likewise using the LEFTfield forward model -- shows that, when including precisely the same modes of the same data up to $k_{\mathrm{max}}= 0.10\,h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ ($0.12\,h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$), the field-level approach yields a factor of 3.5 (5.2) improvement on the $\sigma_8$ constraint, from 20.0% to 5.7% (17.0% to 3.3%). This study provides direct insights into cosmological information encoded in galaxy clustering beyond low-order $n$-point functions.</description>

Abstract: The age of the Universe at a given redshift is a fundamental relationship in cosmology. For many years, the uncertainties in it were dauntingly large, close to a factor of 2. In this age of precision cosmology, they are now at the percent level and dominated by the uncertainty in the Hubble constant. The uncertainties due to the parameters that describe the current cosmological model, $\Lambda$CDM, are much less important. In decreasing order they are: uncertainty due to the matter density $\Omega_M$ around 0.9\% for $z&gt; 3$; uncertainty due to the dark energy equation-of-state parameter $w$, less than 0.3\% for $z&gt;3$; and uncertainty due to the curvature parameter $\Omega_k$, at most 0.07\%.</description>

      <title>Lensed Type Ia Supernova "Encore" at z=2: The First Instance of Two Multiply-Imaged Supernovae in the Same Host Galaxy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02139v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A bright ($m_{\rm F150W,AB}$=24 mag), $z=1.95$ supernova (SN) candidate was discovered in JWST/NIRCam imaging acquired on 2023 November 17. The SN is quintuply-imaged as a result of strong gravitational lensing by a foreground galaxy cluster, detected in three locations, and remarkably is the second lensed SN found in the same host galaxy. The previous lensed SN was called "Requiem", and therefore the new SN is named "Encore". This makes the MACS J0138.0$-$2155 cluster the first known system to produce more than one multiply-imaged SN. Moreover, both SN Requiem and SN Encore are Type Ia SNe (SNe Ia), making this the most distant case of a galaxy hosting two SNe Ia. Using parametric host fitting, we determine the probability of detecting two SNe Ia in this host galaxy over a $\sim10$ year window to be $\approx3\%$. These observations have the potential to yield a Hubble Constant ($H_0$) measurement with $\sim10\%$ precision, only the third lensed SN capable of such a result, using the three visible images of the SN. Both SN Requiem and SN Encore have a fourth image that is expected to appear within a few years of $\sim2030$, providing an unprecedented baseline for time-delay cosmography.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.01338v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the present work, we generalize the theory of perturbations in a D + 1 dimensional space-time with cosmological constant, studying scalar, vector and tensor perturbations, as well as its structure in Newtonian and Synchronous gauge. We also show the theory of perturbations in the context of brane cosmology, where branes are embedded in a set of D-spatial dimensions, a temporal dimension, and an additional spatial dimension. In both, standard and brane cosmology an unperturbed spacetime is provided with a Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker metric and arbitrary sectional curvature, the matter content has the shape of a perfect fluid. In addition, we consider the arbitrary sectional curvature, obtaining the respective equations in the Newtonian and Synchronous gauge. We highlight that the results presented in this article can be used to treat brane cosmology with two concentric branes or tackle the \sigma_{8} tension with a braneworld approach. Finally, as an example of the utility of all the technology presented in this paper, we show an application to the energy ux and the repercussions in the framework of the brane-worlds.</description>

      <title>Self-Interacting Forbidden Dark Matter under a Cannibally Co-Decaying Phase</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.17037v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a usual dark matter (DM) model without a huge mass difference between the DM and lighter mediator, using the coupling strength suitable for having the correct relic density, the resulting self-interaction becomes several orders of magnitude smaller than that required to interpret the small scale structures. We present a framework that can offer a solution for this point. We consider a model that contains the vector DM and a heavier but unstable Higgs-like scalar in the hidden sector. When the temperature drops below $\sim m_{\rm DM}$, the hidden sector, which is thermally decoupled from the visible sector, enters a cannibal phase, during which the DM density is depleted with the out-of-equilibrium decay of the scalar. The favored parameter region, giving the correct relic density and the proper size of self-interactions, shows the scalar-to-DM mass ratio $\in [1.1,1.33]$ and the scalar mass $\in[9,114]\,{\rm MeV}$. A sizable parameter space still survives the most current constraints and can be further probed by the near future NA62 beam dump experiment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.18394v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB) produced by merging neutron stars exhibits a peak in the kHz band. In this paper, we develop a theoretical framework to exploit this distinctive feature through a Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis using a simulated dataset of SGWB measurements within this frequency range. The aim is to use the SGWB peak as an observable to constrain a set of astrophysical and cosmological parameters that accurately describe the sources of the SGWB. We examine how variations in these parameters impact the morphology of the SGWB and investigate the necessary sensitivity to effectively constrain them. Given our priors on astrophysical and cosmological parameters, and assuming a power-law integrated sensitivity curve of the order of $10^{-11}$ between 1 kHz and 5 kHz, we show that the values of the chirp mass and common envelope efficiency of the binary systems are retrieved with percent accuracy. Furthermore, the method allows for the reconstruction of the cosmological expansion history populated by these binaries, encompassing the Hubble constant, matter abundance, and the effective equation of state of dark energy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05274v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The effective field theory of single-field inflation characterizes the inflationary epoch in terms of a pattern of symmetry breaking. An operator acquires a time-dependent vacuum expectation value, defining a preferred spatial slicing. In the absence of dynamical gravity, the fluctuations around the time-dependent background are described by the Goldstone boson associated with this symmetry breaking process. With gravity, the Goldstone is eaten by the metric, becoming the scalar metric fluctuation. In this paper, we will show that in general single-field inflation, the statistics of scalar metric fluctuations are given by the statistics of this Goldstone boson decoupled from gravity up to corrections that are controlled as an expansion in slow-roll parameters. This even holds in the presence of additional parameters, like the speed of sound, that naively enhance the impact of the gravitational terms. In the process, we derive expressions for leading and sub-leading gravitational corrections to all-orders in the Goldstone boson.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10240v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scalar-tensor theories have taken on a key role in attempts to confront the growing open questions in standard cosmology. It is important to understand entirely their dynamics at perturbative level including any possible spatial dependence in their growth of large scale structures. In this work, we investigate the spatial dependence of the growth rate of scalar-tensor theories through the M\'{e}sz\'{a}ros equation. We confirm that at subhorizon level this dependence does not play a major role for viable models. However, we establish conditions on which this criterion is met which may be important for developing new models. In our work, we consider three specific models that exhibit spatial dependence of the growth rate at subhorizon modes, which may also be important for early Universe models.</description>

Abstract: We provide a concrete example exhibiting marked deviation from the parametrized post-Newtonian (PPN) approximation in a modified theory of gravity. Specifically, we derive the exact formula for the Robertson parameter $\gamma$ in Brans-Dicke gravity for compact mass sources, explicitly incorporating the pressure content of these sources. We achieve this by exploiting the $\textit integrability$ of the 00-component of the Brans-Dicke field equation. In place of the conventional PPN result $\gamma_{\,PPN}=\frac{\omega+1}{\omega+2}$, we obtain the analytical expression $\gamma_{\,exact}=\frac{\omega+1+(\omega+2)\varTheta}{\omega+2+(\omega+1)\varTheta}$ where $\varTheta$ is the ratio of the total pressure $P_\parallel^*+2P_\perp^*$ and total energy $E^*$ contained within the mass source. Our non-perturbative formula is valid for all field strengths and types of matter comprising the mass source. We draw four key conclusions: (1) The usual $\gamma_{\,PPN}$ formula is violated in the presence of pressure, viz. when $\varTheta\neq0$, revealing a limitation of the PPN approximation in Brans-Dicke gravity. (2) The PPN result mainly stems from the assumption of pressureless matter. Even in the weak-field star case, non-zero pressure leads to a violation of the PPN $\gamma$ formula. Conversely, the PPN result is a good approximation for low-pressure matter, i.e. when $\varTheta\approx0$, for all field strengths. (3) Observational constraints on $\gamma$ set joint bounds on $\omega$ and $\varTheta$, with the latter representing a global characteristic of a mass source. If the equation of state of matter in the mass source approaches the ultra-relativistic form, entailing $\varTheta\simeq1$, $\gamma_{\,exact}$ converges to 1 irrespective of $\omega$. (4) In a broader context, our findings indicate the latent significance of considering the interior structure of stars in observational astronomy.</description>
