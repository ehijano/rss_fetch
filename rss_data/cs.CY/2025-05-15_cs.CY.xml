      <title>Healthy Distrust in AI systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Under the slogan of trustworthy AI, much of contemporary AI research is focused on designing AI systems and usage practices that inspire human trust and, thus, enhance adoption of AI systems. However, a person affected by an AI system may not be convinced by AI system design alone -- neither should they, if the AI system is embedded in a social context that gives good reason to believe that it is used in tension with a person's interest. In such cases, distrust in the system may be justified and necessary to build meaningful trust in the first place. We propose the term "healthy distrust" to describe such a justified, careful stance towards certain AI usage practices. We investigate prior notions of trust and distrust in computer science, sociology, history, psychology, and philosophy, outline a remaining gap that healthy distrust might fill and conceptualize healthy distrust as a crucial part for AI usage that respects human autonomy.</description>

      <title>Which Demographic Features Are Relevant for Individual Fairness Evaluation of U.S. Recidivism Risk Assessment Tools?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite its U.S. constitutional foundation, the technical ``individual fairness'' criterion has not been operationalized in state or federal statutes/regulations. We conduct a human subjects experiment to address this gap, evaluating which demographic features are relevant for individual fairness evaluation of recidivism risk assessment (RRA) tools. Our analyses conclude that the individual similarity function should consider age and sex, but it should ignore race.</description>

      <title>To what extent can current French mobile network support agricultural robots?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The large-scale integration of robots in agriculture offers many promises for enhancing sustainability and increasing food production. The numerous applications of agricultural robots rely on the transmission of data via mobile network, with the amount of data depending on the services offered by the robots and the level of on-board technology. Nevertheless, infrastructure required to deploy these robots, as well as the related energy and environmental consequences, appear overlooked in the digital agriculture literature. In this study, we propose a method for assessing the additional energy consumption and carbon footprint induced by a large-scale deployment of agricultural robots. Our method also estimates the share of agricultural area that can be managed by the deployed robots with respect to network infrastructure constraints. We have applied this method to metropolitan France mobile network and agricultural parcels for five different robotic scenarios. Our results show that increasing the robot's bitrate needs leads to significant additional impacts, which increase at a pace that is poorly captured by classical linear extrapolation methods. When constraining the network to the existing sites, increased bitrate needs also comes with a rapidly decreasing manageable agricultural area.</description>

      <title>Top-Down vs. Bottom-Up Approaches for Automatic Educational Knowledge Graph Construction in CourseMapper</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The automatic construction of Educational Knowledge Graphs (EduKGs) is crucial for modeling domain knowledge in digital learning environments, particularly in Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs). However, identifying the most effective approach for constructing accurate EduKGs remains a challenge. This study compares Top-down and Bottom-up approaches for automatic EduKG construction, evaluating their effectiveness in capturing and structuring knowledge concepts from learning materials in our MOOC platform CourseMapper. Through a user study and expert validation using Simple Random Sampling (SRS), results indicate that the Bottom-up approach outperforms the Top-down approach in accurately identifying and mapping key knowledge concepts. To further enhance EduKG accuracy, we integrate a Human-in-the-Loop approach, allowing course moderators to review and refine the EduKG before publication. This structured comparison provides a scalable framework for improving knowledge representation in MOOCs, ultimately supporting more personalized and adaptive learning experiences.</description>

      <title>Lost in Models? Structuring Managerial Decision Support in Process Mining with Multi-criteria Decision Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Process mining is increasingly adopted in modern organizations, producing numerous process models that, while valuable, can lead to model overload and decision-making complexity. This paper explores a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) approach to evaluate and prioritize process models by incorporating both quantitative metrics (e.g., fitness, precision) and qualitative factors (e.g., cultural fit). An illustrative logistics example demonstrates how MCDM, specifically the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), facilitates trade-off analysis and promotes alignment with managerial objectives. Initial insights suggest that the MCDM approach enhances context-sensitive decision-making, as selected models address both operational metrics and broader managerial needs. While this study is an early-stage exploration, it provides an initial foundation for deeper exploration of MCDM-driven strategies to enhance the role of process mining in complex organizational settings.</description>

      <title>Formalising Human-in-the-Loop: Computational Reductions, Failure Modes, and Legal-Moral Responsibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The legal compliance and safety of different Human-in-the-loop (HITL) setups for AI can vary greatly. This manuscript aims to identify new ways of choosing between such setups, and shows that there is an unavoidable trade-off between the attribution of legal responsibility and the technical explainability of AI. We begin by using the notion of oracle machines from computability theory to formalise different HITL setups, distinguishing between trivial human monitoring, single endpoint human action, and highly involved interaction between the human(s) and the AI. These correspond to total functions, many-one reductions, and Turing reductions respectively. A taxonomy categorising HITL failure modes is then presented, highlighting the limitations on what any HITL setup can actually achieve. Our approach then identifies oversights from UK and EU legal frameworks, which focus on certain HITL setups which may not always achieve the desired ethical, legal, and sociotechnical outcomes. We suggest areas where the law should recognise the effectiveness of different HITL setups and assign responsibility in these contexts, avoiding unnecessary and unproductive human "scapegoating". Overall, we show how HITL setups involve many technical design decisions, and can be prone to failures which are often out of the humans' control. This opens up a new analytic perspective on the challenges arising in the creation of HITL setups, helping inform AI developers and lawmakers on designing HITL to better achieve their desired outcomes.</description>

      <title>Campus AI vs Commercial AI: A Late-Breaking Study on How LLM As-A-Service Customizations Shape Trust and Usage Patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) by students, lecturers and researchers becomes more prevalent, universities - like other organizations - are pressed to develop coherent AI strategies. LLMs as-a-Service (LLMaaS) offer accessible pre-trained models, customizable to specific (business) needs. While most studies prioritize data, model, or infrastructure adaptations (e.g., model fine-tuning), we focus on user-salient customizations, like interface changes and corporate branding, which we argue influence users' trust and usage patterns. This study serves as a functional prequel to a large-scale field study in which we examine how students and employees at a German university perceive and use their institution's customized LLMaaS compared to ChatGPT. The goals of this prequel are to stimulate discussions on psychological effects of LLMaaS customizations and refine our research approach through feedback. Our forthcoming findings will deepen the understanding of trust dynamics in LLMs, providing practical guidance for organizations considering LLMaaS deployment.</description>

      <title>Trustless Autonomy: Understanding Motivations, Benefits and Governance Dilemma in Self-Sovereign Decentralized AI Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent trend of self-sovereign Decentralized AI Agents (DeAgents) combines Large Language Model (LLM)-based AI agents with decentralization technologies such as blockchain smart contracts and trusted execution environments (TEEs). These tamper-resistant trustless substrates allow agents to achieve self-sovereignty through ownership of cryptowallet private keys and control of digital assets and social media accounts. DeAgent eliminates centralized control and reduces human intervention, addressing key trust concerns inherent in centralized AI systems. However, given ongoing challenges in LLM reliability such as hallucinations, this creates paradoxical tension between trustlessness and unreliable autonomy. This study addresses this empirical research gap through interviews with DeAgents stakeholders-experts, founders, and developers-to examine their motivations, benefits, and governance dilemmas. The findings will guide future DeAgents system and protocol design and inform discussions about governance in sociotechnical AI systems in the future agentic web.</description>

      <title>Learn, Explore and Reflect by Chatting: Understanding the Value of an LLM-Based Voting Advice Application Chatbot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Voting advice applications (VAAs), which have become increasingly prominent in European elections, are seen as a successful tool for boosting electorates' political knowledge and engagement. However, VAAs' complex language and rigid presentation constrain their utility to less-sophisticated voters. While previous work enhanced VAAs' click-based interaction with scripted explanations, a conversational chatbot's potential for tailored discussion and deliberate political decision-making remains untapped. Our exploratory mixed-method study investigates how LLM-based chatbots can support voting preparation. We deployed a VAA chatbot to 331 users before Germany's 2024 European Parliament election, gathering insights from surveys, conversation logs, and 10 follow-up interviews. Participants found the VAA chatbot intuitive and informative, citing its simple language and flexible interaction. We further uncovered VAA chatbots' role as a catalyst for reflection and rationalization. Expanding on participants' desire for transparency, we provide design recommendations for building interactive and trustworthy VAA chatbots.</description>

      <title>Rhetorical XAI: Explaining AI's Benefits as well as its Use via Rhetorical Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09862v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores potential benefits of incorporating Rhetorical Design into the design of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) systems. While XAI is traditionally framed around explaining individual predictions or overall system behavior, explanations also function as a form of argumentation, shaping how users evaluate system perceived usefulness, credibility, and foster appropriate trust. Rhetorical Design offers a useful framework to analyze the communicative role of explanations between AI systems and users, focusing on: (1) logical reasoning conveyed through different types of explanations, (2) credibility projected by the system and its developers, and (3) emotional resonance elicited in users. Together, these rhetorical appeals help us understand how explanations influence user perceptions and facilitate AI adoption. This paper synthesizes design strategies from prior XAI work that align with these three rhetorical appeals and highlights both opportunities and challenges of integrating rhetorical design into XAI design.</description>

      <title>Determining Absence of Unreasonable Risk: Approval Guidelines for an Automated Driving System Release</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper provides an overview of how the determination of absence of unreasonable risk can be operationalized. It complements previous theoretical work published by existing developers of Automated Driving Systems (ADS) on the overall engineering practices and methodologies for readiness determination. Readiness determination is, at its core, a risk assessment process. It is aimed at evaluating the residual risk associated with the deployment of a new software release candidate. The paper proposes methodological criteria to ground the readiness review process for an ADS release. While informed by Waymo's experience in this domain, the criteria presented are agnostic of any specific ADS technological solution and/or architectural choice, to support broad implementation by others in the industry. The paper continues with a discussion on governance and decision-making toward approval of a new software release candidate for the ADS. The implementation of the presented criteria requires the existence of appropriate safety management practices in addition to many other cultural, procedural, and operational considerations. As such, the paper is concluded by a statement of limitations for those wishing to replicate part or all of its content.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation to Support Learners' Understanding of Knowledge Concepts in MOOCs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) lack direct interaction between learners and instructors, making it challenging for learners to understand new knowledge concepts. Recently, learners have increasingly used Large Language Models (LLMs) to support them in acquiring new knowledge. However, LLMs are prone to hallucinations which limits their reliability. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this issue by retrieving relevant documents before generating a response. However, the application of RAG across different MOOCs is limited by unstructured learning material. Furthermore, current RAG systems do not actively guide learners toward their learning needs. To address these challenges, we propose a Graph RAG pipeline that leverages Educational Knowledge Graphs (EduKGs) and Personal Knowledge Graphs (PKGs) to guide learners to understand knowledge concepts in the MOOC platform CourseMapper. Specifically, we implement (1) a PKG-based Question Generation method to recommend personalized questions for learners in context, and (2) an EduKG-based Question Answering method that leverages the relationships between knowledge concepts in the EduKG to answer learner selected questions. To evaluate both methods, we conducted a study with 3 expert instructors on 3 different MOOCs in the MOOC platform CourseMapper. The results of the evaluation show the potential of Graph RAG to empower learners to understand new knowledge concepts in a personalized learning experience.</description>

      <title>Digital Natives, Digital Activists: Youth, Social Media and the Rise of Environmental Sustainability Movements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The research examines the challenges revolving around young people's social movements, activism regarding sustainability, as well as the accompanying social media aspect, and how social media impacts environmental action. This study focuses on the environmental craze on social media platforms and its impact on young activists aged 16-25. With the advancement of social media, new avenues have opened for participation in sustainability issues, especially for the marginalized, as information moved through transnational networks at lightning speed. Along with specific Formative Visual Storytelling methods, the young leaders of the movement deploy hashtags and other online tools to capture the attention of their peers and decision makers. Challenges persist with "clicktivism" fatigue from the internet, and site limitations. This article contributes to insights on emerging forms of civic activism by explaining how digital natives adapt technology to reframe green activism. The research suggests that effective digital environmental movements integrate online and offline action, make it simple for individuals to get involved, and promote tolerance to algorithmic modifications and climate care among participants.</description>

      <title>Position: Contextual Integrity is Inadequately Applied to Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19173v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning community is discovering Contextual Integrity (CI) as a useful framework to assess the privacy implications of large language models (LLMs). This is an encouraging development. The CI theory emphasizes sharing information in accordance with privacy norms and can bridge the social, legal, political, and technical aspects essential for evaluating privacy in LLMs. However, this is also a good point to reflect on use of CI for LLMs. This position paper argues that existing literature inadequately applies CI for LLMs without embracing the theory's fundamental tenets.
  Inadequate applications of CI could lead to incorrect conclusions and flawed privacy-preserving designs. We clarify the four fundamental tenets of CI theory, systematize prior work on whether they deviate from these tenets, and highlight overlooked issues in experimental hygiene for LLMs (e.g., prompt sensitivity, positional bias).</description>

      <title>The Lazy Student's Dream: ChatGPT Passing an Engineering Course on Its Own</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05760v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive investigation into the capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to successfully complete a semester-long undergraduate control systems course. Through evaluation of 115 course deliverables, we assess LLM performance using ChatGPT under a "minimal effort" protocol that simulates realistic student usage patterns. The investigation employs a rigorous testing methodology across multiple assessment formats, from auto-graded multiple choice questions to complex Python programming tasks and long-form analytical writing. Our analysis provides quantitative insights into AI's strengths and limitations in handling mathematical formulations, coding challenges, and theoretical concepts in control systems engineering. The LLM achieved a B-grade performance (82.24\%), approaching but not exceeding the class average (84.99\%), with strongest results in structured assignments and greatest limitations in open-ended projects. The findings inform discussions about course design adaptation in response to AI advancement, moving beyond simple prohibition towards thoughtful integration of these tools in engineering education. Additional materials including syllabus, examination papers, design projects, and example responses can be found at the project website: https://gradegpt.github.io.</description>

      <title>Implicit Bias-Like Patterns in Reasoning Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11572</link>

Abstract: Implicit bias refers to automatic mental processes that shape perceptions, judgments, and behaviors. Previous research on "implicit bias" in LLMs focused primarily on outputs rather than the processes underlying the outputs. We present the Reasoning Model Implicit Association Test (RM-IAT) to study implicit bias-like processing in reasoning models, which are LLMs using step-by-step reasoning for complex tasks. Using RM-IAT, we find o3-mini and DeepSeek R1 require more tokens when processing association-incompatible information, mirroring human implicit bias patterns. Conversely, Claude 3.7 Sonnet displays reversed patterns for race and gender tests, requiring more tokens for association-compatible information. This reversal appears linked to differences in safety mechanism activation, increasing deliberation in sensitive contexts. These findings suggest AI systems can exhibit processing patterns analogous to both human implicit bias and bias correction mechanisms.</description>

      <title>How Students Use AI Feedback Matters: Experimental Evidence on Physics Achievement and Autonomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08672</link>

Abstract: Despite the precision and adaptiveness of generative AI (GAI)-powered feedback provided to students, existing practice and literature might ignore how usage patterns impact student learning. This study examines the heterogeneous effects of GAI-powered personalized feedback on high school students' physics achievement and autonomy through two randomized controlled trials, with a major focus on usage patterns. Each experiment lasted for five weeks, involving a total of 387 students. Experiment 1 (n = 121) assessed compulsory usage of the personalized recommendation system, revealing that low-achieving students significantly improved academic performance (d = 0.673, p &lt; 0.05) when receiving AI-generated heuristic solution hints, whereas medium-achieving students' performance declined (d = -0.539, p &lt; 0.05) with conventional answers provided by workbook. Notably, high-achieving students experienced a significant decline in self-regulated learning (d = -0.477, p &lt; 0.05) without any significant gains in achievement. Experiment 2 (n = 266) investigated the usage pattern of autonomous on-demand help, demonstrating that fully learner-controlled AI feedback significantly enhanced academic performance for high-achieving students (d = 0.378, p &lt; 0.05) without negatively impacting their autonomy. However, autonomy notably declined among lower achievers exposed to on-demand AI interventions (d = -0.383, p &lt; 0.05), particularly in the technical-psychological dimension (d = -0.549, p &lt; 0.05), which has a large overlap with self-regulation. These findings underscore the importance of usage patterns when applying GAI-powered personalized feedback to students.</description>

      <title>Biomedical Open Source Software: Crucial Packages and Hidden Heroes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06672v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the importance of scientific software for research, it is often not formally recognized and rewarded. This is especially true for foundation libraries, which are used by the software packages visible to the users, being ``hidden'' themselves. The funders and other organizations need to understand the complex network of computer programs that the modern research relies upon.
  In this work we used CZ Software Mentions Dataset to map the dependencies of the software used in biomedical papers and find the packages critical to the software ecosystems. We propose the centrality metrics for the network of software dependencies, analyze three ecosystems (PyPi, CRAN, Bioconductor) and determine the packages with the highest centrality.</description>

      <title>PersLLM: A Personified Training Approach for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12393v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit human-like intelligence, enabling them to simulate human behavior and support various applications that require both humanized communication and extensive knowledge reserves. Efforts are made to personify LLMs with special training data or hand-crafted prompts, while correspondingly faced with challenges such as insufficient data usage or rigid behavior patterns. Consequently, personified LLMs fail to capture personified knowledge or express persistent opinion. To fully unlock the potential of LLM personification, we propose PersLLM, a framework for better data construction and model tuning. For insufficient data usage, we incorporate strategies such as Chain-of-Thought prompting and anti-induction, improving the quality of data construction and capturing the personality experiences, knowledge, and thoughts more comprehensively. For rigid behavior patterns, we design the tuning process and introduce automated DPO to enhance the specificity and dynamism of the models' personalities, which leads to a more natural opinion communication. Both automated metrics and expert human evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Case studies in human-machine interactions and multi-agent systems further suggest potential application scenarios and future directions for LLM personification.</description>
