      <title>High-Dimensional Bayesian Optimisation with Large-Scale Constraints via Latent Space Gaussian Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Design optimisation offers the potential to develop lightweight aircraft structures with reduced environmental impact. Due to the high number of design variables and constraints, these challenges are typically addressed using gradient-based optimisation methods to maintain efficiency. However, this approach often results in a local solution, overlooking the global design space. Moreover, gradients are frequently unavailable. Bayesian Optimisation presents a promising alternative, enabling sample-efficient global optimisation through probabilistic surrogate models that do not depend on gradients. Although Bayesian Optimisation has shown its effectiveness for problems with a small number of design variables, it struggles to scale to high-dimensional problems, particularly when incorporating large-scale constraints. This challenge is especially pronounced in aeroelastic tailoring, where directional stiffness properties are integrated into the structural design to manage aeroelastic deformations and enhance both aerodynamic and structural performance. Ensuring the safe operation of the system requires simultaneously addressing constraints from various analysis disciplines, making global design space exploration even more complex. This study seeks to address this issue by employing high-dimensional Bayesian Optimisation combined with a dimensionality reduction technique to tackle the optimisation challenges in aeroelastic tailoring. The proposed approach is validated through experiments on a well-known benchmark case with black-box constraints, as well as its application to the aeroelastic tailoring problem, demonstrating the feasibility of Bayesian Optimisation for high-dimensional problems with large-scale constraints.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Learning Rate Decay for Stochastic Variational Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Like many optimization algorithms, Stochastic Variational Inference (SVI) is sensitive to the choice of the learning rate. If the learning rate is too small, the optimization process may be slow, and the algorithm might get stuck in local optima. On the other hand, if the learning rate is too large, the algorithm may oscillate or diverge, failing to converge to a solution. Adaptive learning rate methods such as Adam, AdaMax, Adagrad, or RMSprop automatically adjust the learning rate based on the history of gradients. Nevertheless, if the base learning rate is too large, the variational parameters might still oscillate around the optimal solution. With learning rate schedules, the learning rate can be reduced gradually to mitigate this problem. However, the amount at which the learning rate should be decreased in each iteration is not known a priori, which can significantly impact the performance of the optimization. In this work, we propose a method to decay the learning rate based on the history of the variational parameters. We use an empirical measure to quantify the amount of oscillations against the progress of the variational parameters to adapt the learning rate. The approach requires little memory and is computationally efficient. We demonstrate in various numerical examples that our method reduces the sensitivity of the optimization performance to the learning rate and that it can also be used in combination with other adaptive learning rate methods.</description>

      <title>Bi-directional Mapping of Morphology Metrics and 3D City Blocks for Enhanced Characterization and Generation of Urban Form</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Urban morphology, examining city spatial configurations, links urban design to sustainability. Morphology metrics play a fundamental role in performance-driven computational urban design (CUD) which integrates urban form generation, performance evaluation and optimization. However, a critical gap remains between performance evaluation and complex urban form generation, caused by the disconnection between morphology metrics and urban form, particularly in metric-to-form workflows. It prevents the application of optimized metrics to generate improved urban form with enhanced urban performance. Formulating morphology metrics that not only effectively characterize complex urban forms but also enable the reconstruction of diverse forms is of significant importance. This paper highlights the importance of establishing a bi-directional mapping between morphology metrics and complex urban form to enable the integration of urban form generation with performance evaluation. We present an approach that can 1) formulate morphology metrics to both characterize urban forms and in reverse, retrieve diverse similar 3D urban forms, and 2) evaluate the effectiveness of morphology metrics in representing 3D urban form characteristics of blocks by comparison. We demonstrate the methodology with 3D urban models of New York City, covering 14,248 blocks. We use neural networks and information retrieval for morphology metric encoding, urban form clustering and morphology metric evaluation. We identified an effective set of morphology metrics for characterizing block-scale urban forms through comparison. The proposed methodology tightly couples complex urban forms with morphology metrics, hence it can enable a seamless and bidirectional relationship between urban form generation and optimization in performance-driven urban design towards sustainable urban design and planning.</description>

      <title>MAD-NG, a standalone multiplatform tool for linear and non-linear optics design and optimisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The presentation will provide an overview of the capabilities of the Methodical Accelerator Design Next Generation (MAD-NG) tool. MAD-NG is a standalone, all-in-one, multi-platform tool well-suited for linear and nonlinear optics design and optimization, and has already been used in large-scale studies such as HiLumi-LHC or FCC-ee. It embeds LuaJIT, an extremely fast tracing just-in-time compiler for the Lua programming language, delivering exceptional versatility and performance for the forefront of computational physics. The core of MAD-NG relies on the fast Generalized Truncated Power Series Algebra (GTPSA) library, which has been specially developed to handle many parameters and high-order differential algebra, including Lie map operators. This ecosystem offers powerful features for the analysis and optimization of linear and nonlinear optics, thanks to the fast parametric nonlinear normal forms and the polyvalent matching command. A few examples and results will complete this presentation of MAD-NG.</description>

      <title>Electric Vehicle Charging Stations Placement Optimization in Vietnam Using Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Programming Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vietnam is viewed as one of the promising markets for electric vehicles (EVs), especially automobiles when it is predicted to reach 1 million in 2028 and 3.5 million in 2040. However, the lack of charging station infrastructure has hindered the growth rate of EVs in this country. This study aims to propose an optimization model using Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP) to implement an optimal location strategy for EVs charging stations in Ho Chi Minh (HCM) City. The problem is solved by a solver named Gurobi and using the Brand-and-Cut method. There are 2 perspectives including Charging Station Operators and EV users. In addition, 7 kinds of costs considered include installation cost, land rental cost, maintenance cost, operational cost, charging cost, waiting cost, and traveling cost. From 1509 Point of Interest and 199 residential areas, 134 POIs were chosen with 923 charging stations including 592 Level-2 chargers and 331 Level-3 chargers to fully satisfy the customer demand. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the proposed model is proved by a minor MIP Gap and running in a short time with full feasibility.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in language understanding, generation, and reasoning, yet their potential in finance remains underexplored due to the complexity and specialization of financial knowledge. In this work, we report the development of the Baichuan4-Finance series, including a comprehensive suite of foundational Baichuan4-Finance-Base and an aligned language model Baichuan4-Finance, which are built upon Baichuan4-Turbo base model and tailored for finance domain. Firstly, we have dedicated significant effort to building a detailed pipeline for improving data quality. Moreover, in the continual pre-training phase, we propose a novel domain self-constraint training strategy, which enables Baichuan4-Finance-Base to acquire financial knowledge without losing general capabilities. After Supervised Fine-tuning and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback and AI Feedback, the chat model Baichuan4-Finance is able to tackle various financial certification questions and real-world scenario applications. We evaluate Baichuan4-Finance on many widely used general datasets and two holistic financial benchmarks. The evaluation results show that Baichuan4-Finance-Base surpasses almost all competitive baselines on financial tasks by significant margins without sacrificing performance on general LLM benchmarks. At the same time, Baichuan4-Finance demonstrates even more impressive performance on financial application scenarios, showcasing its potential to foster community innovation in the financial LLM field.</description>

      <title>Microservices-Based Framework for Predictive Analytics and Real-time Performance Enhancement in Travel Reservation Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper presents a framework of microservices-based architecture dedicated to enhancing the performance of real-time travel reservation systems using the power of predictive analytics. Traditional monolithic systems are bad at scaling and performing with high loads, causing backup resources to be underutilized along with delays. To overcome the above-stated problems, we adopt a modularization approach in decoupling system components into independent services that can grow or shrink according to demand. Our framework also includes real-time predictive analytics, through machine learning models, that optimize forecasting customer demand, dynamic pricing, as well as system performance. With an experimental evaluation applying the approach, we could show that the framework impacts metrics of performance such as response time, throughput, transaction rate of success, and prediction accuracy compared to their conventional counterparts. Not only does the microservices approach improve scalability and fault tolerance like a usual architecture, but it also brings along timely and accurate predictions, which imply a greater customer satisfaction and efficiency of operation. The integration of real-time analytics would lead to more intelligent decision-making, thereby improving the response of the system along with the reliability it holds. A scalable, efficient framework is offered by such a system to address the modern challenges imposed by any form of travel reservation system while considering other complex, data-driven industries as future applications. Future work will be an investigation of advanced AI models and edge processing to further improve the performance and robustness of the systems employed.</description>

      <title>On the optimal growth of autocatalytic subnetworks: A Mathematical Optimization Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chemical reaction networks (CRNs) are essential for modeling and analyzing complex systems across fields, from biochemistry to economics. Autocatalytic reaction network -- networks where certain species catalyze their own production -- are particularly significant for understanding self-replication dynamics in biological systems and serve as foundational elements in formalizing the concept of a circular economy. In a previous study, we developed a mixed-integer linear optimization-based procedure to enumerate all minimal autocatalytic subnetworks within a network. In this work, we define the maximum growth factor (MGF) of an autocatalytic subnetwork, develop mathematical optimization approaches to compute this metric, and explore its implications in the field of economics and dynamical systems. We develop exact approaches to determine the MGF of any subnetwork based on an iterative procedure with guaranteed convergence, which allows for identifying autocatalytic subnetworks with the highest MGF. We report the results of computational experiments on synthetic CRNs and two well-known datasets, namely the Formose and E. coli reaction networks, identifying their autocatalytic subnetworks and exploring their scientific ramifications. Using advanced optimization techniques and interdisciplinary applications, our framework adds an essential resource to analyze complex systems modeled as reaction networks.</description>

      <title>Trust Dynamics and Market Behavior in Cryptocurrency: A Comparative Study of Centralized and Decentralized Exchanges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17227v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the rapidly evolving cryptocurrency landscape, trust is a critical yet underexplored factor shaping market behaviors and driving user preferences between centralized exchanges (CEXs) and decentralized exchanges (DEXs). Despite its importance, trust remains challenging to measure, limiting the study of its effects on market dynamics. The collapse of FTX, a major CEX, provides a unique natural experiment to examine the measurable impacts of trust and its sudden erosion on the cryptocurrency ecosystem. This pivotal event raised questions about the resilience of centralized trust systems and accelerated shifts toward decentralized alternatives. This research investigates the impacts of the FTX collapse on user trust, focusing on token valuation, trading flows, and sentiment dynamics. Employing causal inference methods, including Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD) and Difference-in-Differences (DID), we reveal significant declines in WETH prices and NetFlow from CEXs to DEXs, signaling a measurable transfer of trust. Additionally, natural language processing methods, including topic modeling and sentiment analysis, uncover the complexities of user responses, highlighting shifts from functional discussions to emotional fragmentation in Binance's community, while Uniswap's sentiment exhibits a gradual upward trend. Despite data limitations and external influences, the findings underscore the intricate interplay between trust, sentiment, and market behavior in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. By bridging blockchain analytics, behavioral finance, and decentralized finance (DeFi), this study contributes to interdisciplinary research, offering a deeper understanding of distributed trust mechanisms and providing critical insights for future investigations into the socio-technical dimensions of trust in digital economies.</description>

      <title>Data Publishing in Mechanics and Dynamics: Challenges, Guidelines, and Examples from Engineering Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18358v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data-based methods have gained increasing importance in engineering, especially but not only driven by successes with deep artificial neural networks. Success stories are prevalent, e.g., in areas such as data-driven modeling, control and automation, as well as surrogate modeling for accelerated simulation. Beyond engineering, generative and large-language models are increasingly helping with tasks that, previously, were solely associated with creative human processes. Thus, it seems timely to seek artificial-intelligence-support for engineering design tasks to automate, help with, or accelerate purpose-built designs of engineering systems, e.g., in mechanics and dynamics, where design so far requires a lot of specialized knowledge. However, research-wise, compared to established, predominantly first-principles-based methods, the datasets used for training, validation, and test become an almost inherent part of the overall methodology. Thus, data publishing becomes just as important in (data-driven) engineering science as appropriate descriptions of conventional methodology in publications in the past. This article analyzes the value and challenges of data publishing in mechanics and dynamics, in particular regarding engineering design tasks, showing that the latter raise also challenges and considerations not typical in fields where data-driven methods have been booming originally. Possible ways to deal with these challenges are discussed and a set of examples from across different design problems shows how data publishing can be put into practice. The analysis, discussions, and examples are based on the research experience made in a priority program of the German research foundation focusing on research on artificially intelligent design assistants in mechanics and dynamics.</description>

      <title>SHAP zero Explains Genomic Models with Near-zero Marginal Cost for Future Queried Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19236v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the rapid growth of large-scale machine learning models in genomics, Shapley values have emerged as a popular method for model explanations due to their theoretical guarantees. While Shapley values explain model predictions locally for an individual input query sequence, extracting biological knowledge requires global explanation across thousands of input sequences. This demands exponential model evaluations per sequence, resulting in significant computational cost and carbon footprint. Herein, we develop SHAP zero, a method that estimates Shapley values and interactions with a near-zero marginal cost for future queried sequences after paying a one-time fee for model sketching. SHAP zero achieves this by establishing a surprisingly underexplored connection between the Shapley values and interactions and the Fourier transform of the model. Explaining two genomic models, one trained to predict guide RNA binding and the other to predict DNA repair outcome, we demonstrate that SHAP zero achieves orders of magnitude reduction in amortized computational cost compared to state-of-the-art algorithms, revealing almost all predictive motifs -- a finding previously inaccessible due to the combinatorial space of possible interactions.</description>
