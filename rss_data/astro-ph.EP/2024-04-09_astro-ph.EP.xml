      <title>Tidal Disruption of Planetesimals from an Eccentric Debris Disk Following a White Dwarf Natal Kick</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The surfaces of many white dwarfs are polluted by metals, implying a recent accretion event. The tidal disruption of planetesimals is a viable source of white dwarf pollution and offers a unique window into the composition of exoplanet systems. The question of how planetary material enters the tidal disruption radius of the white dwarf is currently unresolved. Using a series of $N$-body simulations, we explore the response of the surrounding planetesimal debris disk as the white dwarf receives a natal kick caused by anisotropic mass loss on the asymptotic giant branch. We find that the kick can form an apse-aligned, eccentric debris disk in the range 30 to 240 AU which corresponds to the orbits of Neptune, the Kuiper Belt, and the scattered disk in our solar system. In addition, many planetesimals beyond 240 AU flip to counter-rotating orbits. Assuming an isotropic distribution of kicks, we predict that approximately 80% of white dwarf debris disks should exhibit significant apsidal alignment and fraction of counter-rotating orbits. The eccentric disk is able to efficiently and continuously torque planetesimals onto radial, star-grazing orbits. We show that the kick causes both an initial burst in tidal disruption events as well as an extended period of 100 Myr where tidal disruption rates are consistent with observed mass accretion rates on polluted white dwarfs.</description>

      <title>Long-term variability in debris transiting white dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Combining archival photometric observations from multiple large-area surveys spanning the past 17 years, we detect long-term variability in the light curves of ZTFJ032833.52-121945.27 (ZTFJ0328-1219), ZTFJ092311.41+423634.16 (ZTFJ0923+4236) and WD1145+017, all known to exhibit transits from planetary debris. ZTFJ0328-1219 showed an overall fading in brightness from 2011 through to 2015, with a maximum dimming of ~0.3 mag, and still remains ~0.1 mag fainter compared to 2006. We complement the analysis of the long-term behaviour of these systems with high-speed photometry. In the case of ZTFJ0923+4236 and WD1145+017, the time-series photometry exhibits vast variations in the level of transit activity, both in terms of numbers of transits, as well as their shapes and depths, and these variations correlate with the overall brightness of the systems. Inspecting the current known sample of white dwarfs with transiting debris, we estimate that similar photometric signatures may be detectable in one in a few hundred of all white dwarfs. Accounting for the highly aligned geometry required to detect transits, our estimates imply that a substantial fraction of all white dwarfs exhibiting photospheric metal pollution from accreted debris host close-in planetesimals that are currently undergoing disintegration.</description>

      <title>Constraining free-free emission and photoevaporative mass loss rates for known proplyds and new VLA-identified candidate proplyds in NGC 1977</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array observations covering the NGC 1977 region at 3.0, 6.4, and 15.0 GHz. We search for compact radio sources and detect continuum emission from 34 NGC 1977 cluster members and 37 background objects. Of the 34 radio-detected cluster members, 3 are associated with known proplyds in NGC 1977, 22 are associated with additional young stellar objects in NGC 1977, and 9 are newly-identified cluster members. We examine the radio spectral energy distributions, circular polarization, and variability of the detected NGC 1977 sources, and identify 10 new candidate proplyds whose radio fluxes are dominated by optically thin free-free emission. We use measurements of free-free emission to calculate the mass-loss rates of known proplyds and new candidate proplyds in NGC 1977, and find values $\sim10^{-9}-10^{-8}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, which are lower than the mass-loss rates measured towards proplyds in the Orion Nebula Cluster, but consistent with the mass-loss rates predicted by external photoevaporation models for spatially-extended disks that are irradiated by the typical external UV fields encountered in NGC 1977. Finally, we show that photoevaporative disk winds in NGC 1977 may be illuminated by internal or external sources of ionization, depending on their positions within the cluster. This study provides new constraints on disk properties in a clustered star-forming region with a weaker UV environment than the Orion Nebula Cluster, but a stronger UV environment than low-mass star-forming regions like Taurus. Such intermediate UV environments represent the typical conditions of Galactic star and planet formation.</description>

      <title>First ALMA observations of the HD 105211 debris disc: A warm dust component close to a gigayear-old star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most debris discs consist of a gas-poor, cold dust belt located tens to hundreds of astronomical units away from the host star. Many cold dust belts exhibit distinct structures attributed to the dynamic interaction of planetary systems. Moreover, in a few systems, additional warm components can be found closer to the central star, resembling the asteroid belt or zodiacal dust in our Solar System. In this work, we investigate the structure of the disc surrounding the nearby F2V star HD 105211, which has a warm excess and a potential asymmetry in the cold belt. We applied the CASA pipeline to obtain the ALMA 1.3 mm continuum images. Then we constructed the SED and performed MCMC simulations to fit a model to the ALMA visibility data. To characterise the disc asymmetry, we analysed the ALMA images of two individual observation blocks and compared them to the previous Herschel images. Our modelling reveals that the disc is a narrow ring (23.6+-4.6 au) with low eccentricity positioned at a distance of 133.7+-1.6 au from the central star, which differs from the broad disc (100+-20 au) starting at an inner edge of 87+-2.5 au, inferred from the Herschel images. We found that both observation blocks show excess emission at the stellar position, while OB1 shows an offset between the star and the phase centre, and OB2 shows brightness clumps. We used a two-temperature model to fit the infrared SED and used the ALMA detection to constrain the warm component to a nearly pure blackbody model. The relatively low ratio of actual radius to blackbody radius of the HD105211 debris disc indicates that this system is depleted in small grains, which could indicate that it is dynamically cold. The excess emission from the stellar position suggests that there should be a warm mm-sized dust component close to the star, for which we suggest two possible origins: in situ asteroid belt or comet delivery.</description>

      <title>Main-belt and Trojan Asteroid Phase Curves from the ATLAS Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sparse and serendipitous asteroid photometry obtained by wide field surveys such as the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (\ATLAS) is a valuable resource for studying the properties of large numbers of small Solar System bodies. We have gathered a large database of \ATLAS photometry in wideband optical cyan and orange filters, consisting of 9.6\e{7} observations of 4.5\e{5} main belt asteroids and Jupiter Trojans. We conduct a phase curve analysis of these asteroids considering each apparition separately, allowing us to accurately reject outlying observations and to remove apparitions and asteroids not suitable for phase curve determination. We obtain a dataset of absolute magnitudes and phase parameters for over 100,000 selected asteroids observed by \ATLAS, $\sim66,000$ of which had sufficient measurements to derive colours in the \ATLAS filters. To demonstrate the power of our dataset we consider the properties of the Nysa-Polana complex, for which the \ATLAS colours and phase parameters trace the S-like and C-like compositions amongst family members. We also compare the properties of the leading and trailing groups of Jupiter Trojans, finding no significant differences in their phase parameters or colours as measured by \ATLAS, supporting the consensus that these groups were captured from a common source population during planetary migration. Furthermore, we identify $\sim9000$ asteroids that exhibit large shifts in derived absolute magnitude between apparitions, indicating that these objects have both elongated shapes and spin axes with obliquity $\sim 90$ degrees.</description>

      <title>Singular Spectrum Analysis of Exoplanetary Transits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transit photometry is currently the most efficient and sensitive method for detecting extrasolar planets (exoplanets) and a large majority of confirmed exoplanets have been detected with this method. The substantial success of space-based missions such as NASA's Kepler/K2 and Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) has generated a large and diverse sample of confirmed and candidate exoplanets. Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) provides a useful tool for studying photometric time series and exoplanetary transits. SSA is a technique for decomposing a time series into a sum of its main components, where each component is a separate time series that incorporates specific information from the behavior of the initial time series. SSA can be implemented for extracting important information (such as main trends and signals) from the photometry data or reducing the noise factors. The detectability and accurate characterization of an exoplanetary transit signal is principally determined by its signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Stellar variability of the host star, small planet to star radius ratio, background noises from other sources in the field of observations and instrumental noise can cause lower SNRs and consequently, more complexities or inaccuracies in the modeling of the transit signals, which in turn leads to the inaccurate inference of the astrophysical parameters of the planetary object. Therefore, implementing SSA leads to a more accurate characterization of exoplanetary transits and is also capable of detecting transits with low SNRs ($SNR&lt;10$). In this paper, after discussing the principles and properties of SSA, we investigate its applications for studying photometric transit data and detecting low SNR exoplanet candidates.</description>

      <title>Necessary Conditions for Earthly Life Floating in the Venusian Atmosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Millimeter-waveband spectra of Venus from both the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) and the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) provide conclusive evidence (signal-to-noise ratio of about $15\sigma$) of a phosphine absorption-line profile against the thermal background from deeper, hotter layers of the atmosphere. Phosphine is an important biomarker; e.g., the trace of phosphine in the Earth's atmosphere is uniquivocally associated with anthropogenic activity and microbial life (which produces this highly reducing gas even in an overall oxidizing environment). Motivated by the JCMT and ALMA tantalizing observations we reexamine whether Venus could accommodate Earthly life. More concretly, we hypothesize that the microorganisms populating the venusian atmosphere are not free floating but confined to the liquid environment inside cloud aerosols or droplets. Armed with this hypothesis, we generalize a study of airborne germ transmission to constrain the maximum size of droplets that could be floating in the venusian atmosphere and estimate whether their Stokes fallout times to reach moderately high temperatures are pronouncedly larger than the microbe's replication time. We also comment on the effect of cosmic ray showers on the evolution of aerial microbial life.</description>

      <title>ALMA Spectroscopy of Europa: A Search for Active Plumes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The subsurface ocean of Europa is a high priority target in the search for extraterrestrial life, but direct investigations are hindered by the presence of a thick, exterior ice shell. Here we present spectral line and continuum maps of Europa obtained over four epochs in May-June 2021 using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), to search for molecular emission from atmospheric plumes, with the aim of investigating subsurface processes. Using a 3D physical model, we obtained upper limits for the plume abundances of HCN, H$_2$CO, SO$_2$ and CH$_3$OH. If active plume(s) were present, they contained very low abundances of these molecules. Assuming a total gas production rate of $10^{29}$ s$^{-1}$, our H$_2$CO abundance upper limit of $&lt;0.016$\% is more than an order of magnitude less than measured in the Enceladus plume by the Cassini spacecraft, implying a possible chemical difference between the plume source materials for these two icy moons.</description>

      <title>Thermal Structure Determines Kinematics: Vertical Shear Instability in Stellar Irradiated Protoplanetary Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Turbulence is crucial for protoplanetary disk dynamics, and Vertical Shear Instability (VSI) is a promising mechanism in outer disk regions to generate turbulence. We use Athena++ radiation module to study VSI in full and transition disks, accounting for radiation transport and stellar irradiation. We find that the thermal structure and cooling timescale significantly influence VSI behavior. The inner rim location and radial optical depth affect disk kinematics. Compared with previous vertically-isothermal simulations, our full disk and transition disks with small cavities have a superheated atmosphere and cool midplane with long cooling timescales, which suppresses the corrugation mode and the associated meridional circulation. This temperature structure also produces a strong vertical shear at $\mathrm{\tau_*}$ = 1, producing an outgoing flow layer at $\tau_* &lt; 1$ on top of an ingoing flow layer at $\tau_* \sim 1$. The midplane becomes less turbulent, while the surface becomes more turbulent with effective $\alpha$ reaching $\sim10^{-2}$ at $\tau_* \lesssim$1. This large surface stress drives significant surface accretion, producing substructures. Using temperature and cooling time measured/estimated from radiation-hydro simulations, we demonstrate that less computationally-intensive simulations incorporating simple orbital cooling can almost reproduce radiation-hydro results. By generating synthetic images, we find that substructures are more pronounced in disks with larger cavities. The higher velocity dispersion at the gap edge could also slow particle settling. Both properties are consistent with recent Near-IR and ALMA observations. Our simulations predict that regions with significant temperature changes are accompanied by significant velocity changes, which can be tested by ALMA kinematics/chemistry observations.</description>

      <title>Doppler Tomography as a tool for characterising exoplanet atmospheres II: an analysis of HD 179949 b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-resolution Doppler spectroscopy provides an avenue to study the atmosphere of both transiting and non-transiting planets. This powerful method has also yielded some of the most robust atmospheric detections to date. Currently, high-resolution Doppler spectroscopy detects atmospheric signals by cross-correlating observed data with a model atmospheric spectrum. This technique has been successful in detecting various molecules such as H2O, CO, HCN and TiO, as well as several atomic species. Here we present an alternative method of performing high-resolution Doppler spectroscopy, using a technique known as Doppler tomography. We present an analysis of HD 179949 b using Doppler tomography and provide Doppler tomograms confirming previous detections of CO at 2.3 microns, and H2O at both 2.3 microns, and 3.5 microns within the atmosphere of HD 179949 b, showing significantly lower background noise levels when compared to cross-correlation methods applied to the same data. We also present a novel detection of H2O at 2.1 microns, as well as a tentative detection of CO on the night side of the planet at 2.3 microns. This represents the first observational evidence for molecular absorption in the night-side emission spectrum of an exoplanet using Doppler spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Optimized Bandpasses for the Habitable Worlds Observatory's ExoEarth Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A primary scientific goal of the future Habitable Worlds Observatory will be the direct detection and characterization of Earth-like planets. Estimates of the exoplanet yields for this concept will help guide mission design through detailed trade studies. It is therefore critical that yield estimation codes optimally adapt observations to the mission's performance parameters to ensure accurate trade studies. To aid in this, we implement wavelength optimization in yield calculations for the first time, allowing the yield code to determine the ideal detection and characterization bandpasses. We use this new capability to confirm the observational wavelength assumptions made for the LUVOIR-B study, namely that the optimum detection wavelength is 500 nm for the majority of targets and the optimum wavelength to detect water is near 1000 nm, given LUVOIR-B's assumed instrument performance parameters. We show that including the wavelength dependent albedo of an Earth twin as a prior provides no significant benefit to the yields of exoEarth candidates and caution against tuning observations to modern Earth twins. We also show that coronagraphs whose inner working angles are similar to step functions may benefit from wavelength optimization and demonstrate how wavelength-dependent instrument performance can impact the optimum wavelengths for detection and characterization. The optimization methods we implement automate wavelength selection and remove uncertainties regarding these choices, helping to adapt the observations to the instrument's performance parameters.</description>

      <title>Carbon isotope chemistry in protoplanetary disks: Effects of C/O ratios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01635v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Carbon isotope fractionation of CO has been reported in the disk around TW Hya,where elemental carbon is more abundant than elemental oxygen ([C/O]$_{\rm elem}$&gt; 1). We investigated the effects of the [C/O]$_{\rm elem}$ ratio on carbon fractionation using astrochemical models that incorporate isotope-selective photodissociation and isotope-exchange reactions. The $^{12}$CO/$^{13}$CO ratio could be lower than the elemental carbon isotope ratio due to isotope exchange reactions when the [C/O]$_{\rm elem}$ ratio exceeds unity. The observed $^{12}$CO/$^{13}$CO and H$^{12}$CN/H$^{13}$CN ratios around TW Hya could be reproduced when the [C/O]$_{\rm elem}$ ratio is 2~5. In the vicinity of the lower boundary of the warm molecular layer, the formation of ices leads to the gas phase [C/O]$_{\rm elem}$ ratio approaching unity, irrespective of the total (gas + ice) [C/O]$_{\rm elem}$ ratio. This phenomenon reduces the variation in the $^{12}$CO/$^{13}$CO ratio across different [C/O]$_{\rm elem}$ ratios.</description>

      <title>PHL 5038AB: Is the brown dwarf causing pollution of its white dwarf host star?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05488v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present new results on PHL 5038AB, a widely separated binary system composed of a white dwarf and a brown dwarf, refining the white and brown dwarf parameters and determining the binary separation to be $66^{+12}_{-24}$~AU. New spectra of the white dwarf show calcium absorption lines suggesting the hydrogen-rich atmosphere is weakly polluted, inferring the presence of planetesimals in the system, which we determine are in an S-type orbit around the white dwarf in orbits closer than 17-32 AU. We do not detect any infrared excess that would indicate the presence of a disc, suggesting all dust present has either been totally accreted or is optically thin. In this system, we suggest the metal pollution in the white dwarf atmosphere can be directly attributed to the presence of the brown dwarf companion disrupting the orbits of planetesimals within the system.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning in Orbit Estimation: a Survey</title>

Abstract: Since the late 1950s, when the first artificial satellite was launched, the number of Resident Space Objects has steadily increased. It is estimated that around one million objects larger than one cm are currently orbiting the Earth, with only thirty thousand larger than ten cm being tracked. To avert a chain reaction of collisions, known as Kessler Syndrome, it is essential to accurately track and predict debris and satellites' orbits. Current approximate physics-based methods have errors in the order of kilometers for seven-day predictions, which is insufficient when considering space debris, typically with less than one meter. This failure is usually due to uncertainty around the state of the space object at the beginning of the trajectory, forecasting errors in environmental conditions such as atmospheric drag, and unknown characteristics such as the mass or geometry of the space object. Operators can enhance Orbit Prediction accuracy by deriving unmeasured objects' characteristics and improving non-conservative forces' effects by leveraging data-driven techniques, such as Machine Learning. In this survey, we provide an overview of the work in applying Machine Learning for Orbit Determination, Orbit Prediction, and atmospheric density modeling.</description>

      <title>Multiple timestep reversible $N$-body integrators for close encounters in planetary systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07113v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present new almost time-reversible integrators for solution of planetary systems consisting of "planets" and a dominant mass ("star"). The algorithms can be considered adaptive generalizations of the Wisdom--Holman method, in which all pairs of planets can be assigned timesteps. These timesteps, along with the global timestep, can be adapted time-reversibly, often at no appreciable additional compute cost, without sacrificing any of the long-term error benefits of the Wisdom--Holman method. The method can also be considered a simpler and more flexible version of the \texttt{SYMBA} symplectic code. We perform tests on several challenging problems with close encounters and find the reversible algorithms are up to $2.6$ times faster than a code based on \texttt{SYMBA}. The codes presented here are available on Github. We also find adapting a global timestep reversibly and discretely must be done in block-synchronized manner or similar.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Extended H$_{2}$O Cross-Sections on Temperate Anoxic Planet Atmospheres: Implications for Spectral Characterization of Habitable Worlds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03031v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: JWST has created a new era of terrestrial exoplanet atmospheric characterization, and with it the possibility to detect potential biosignature gases like CH$_{4}$. Our interpretation of exoplanet atmospheric spectra, and the veracity of these interpretations, will be limited by our understanding of atmospheric processes and the accuracy of input modeling data. Molecular cross-sections are essential inputs to these models. The photochemistry of temperate planets depends on photolysis reactions whose rates are governed by the dissociation cross-sections of key molecules. H$_{2}$O is one such molecule; the photolysis of H$_{2}$O produces OH, a highly reactive and efficient sink for atmospheric trace gases. We investigate the photochemical effects of improved H$_{2}$O cross-sections on anoxic terrestrial planets as a function of host star spectral type (FGKM) and CH$_{4}$ surface flux. Our results show that updated H$_{2}$O cross-sections, extended to wavelengths $&gt;$200 nm, substantially impact the predicted abundances of trace gases destroyed by OH. The differences for anoxic terrestrial planets orbiting Sun-like host stars are greatest, showing changes of up to three orders of magnitude in surface CO levels, and over an order of magnitude in surface CH$_{4}$ levels. These differences lead to observable changes in simulated planetary spectra, especially important in the context of future direct-imaging missions. In contrast, the atmospheres of planets orbiting M-dwarf stars are substantially less affected. Our results demonstrate a pressing need for refined dissociation cross-section data for H$_{2}$O, where uncertainties remain, and other key molecules, especially at mid-UV wavelengths $&gt;$200 nm.</description>

      <title>Effect of magnetospheric conditions on the morphology of Jupiter's UV main auroral emission, as observed by Juno-UVS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04030v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Auroral emissions are a reflection of magnetospheric processes, and, at Jupiter, it is not entirely certain how the morphology of the UV main emission (ME) varies with magnetospheric compression or the strength of the central current sheet. This work leverages the observations from Juno-UVS to link ME variability with magnetospheric states. Novel arc-detection techniques are used to determine new reference ovals for the ME from perijoves 1 through 54, in both hemispheres, and analyse how the size and shape of the ME vary compared to this reference oval. The morphology and brightness of the ME vary in local time: the dawn-side ME is typically expanded and the dusk-side ME typically contracted compared to the reference oval, and the dusk-side ME being typically twice as bright as the dawn-side ME. Both the northern and southern ME, and the day-side and night-side ME, expand and contract from their reference ovals synchronously, which indicates that the variable size of the ME is caused by a process occurring throughout the jovian magnetosphere. The poleward latitudinal shift of the auroral footprint of Ganymede correlates with the poleward motion of the ME, whereas a similar relation is not present for the footprint of Io. Additionally, the expansion of the ME correlates well with an increase in magnetodisc current. These two results suggest that a changing current-sheet magnetic field is partially responsible for the variable size of the ME. Finally, magnetospheric compression is linked to a global ME contraction and brightening, though this brightening occurs predominantly in the day-side ME. This observation, and the observation that the dusk-side ME is typically brighter than the dawn-side ME, stands in contrast to the modelled and observed behaviour of field-aligned currents and thus weakens the theoretical link between field-aligned currents and the generation of the auroral ME.</description>
