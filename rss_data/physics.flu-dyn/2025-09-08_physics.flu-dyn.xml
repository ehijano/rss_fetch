      <title>Multiscale Graph Neural Network for Turbulent Flow-Thermal Prediction Around a Complex-Shaped Pin-Fin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents the development of a domain-responsive edge-aware multiscale Graph Neural Network for predicting steady, turbulent flow and thermal behavior in a two-dimensional channel containing arbitrarily shaped complex pin-fin geometries. The training dataset was constructed through an automated framework that integrated geometry generation, meshing, and flow-field solutions in ANSYS Fluent. The pin-fin geometry was parameterized using piecewise cubic splines, producing 1,000 diverse configurations through Latin Hypercube Sampling. Each simulation was converted into a graph structure, where nodes carried a feature vector containing spatial coordinates, a normalized streamwise position, one-hot boundary indicators, and a signed distance to the nearest boundary such as wall. This graph structure served as input to the newly developed Graph Neural Network, which was trained to predict temperature, velocity magnitude, and pressure at each node using data from ANSYS. The network predicted fields with outstanding accuracy, capturing boundary layers, recirculation, and the stagnation region upstream of the pin-fins while reducing wall time by 2-3 orders of magnitude. In conclusion, the novel graph neural network offered a fast and reliable surrogate for simulations in complex flow configurations.</description>

      <title>Modeling and Computational Fluid Dynamics Validation of a Nonholonomically Constrained Two-Rigid-Body Swimming System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A simple nonholonomic dynamics model is developed as a low-order model for generating undulatory swim-like motions, validated through computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. The rigid-body-dynamics model generates swimming motion by imposing a nonholonomic (NH) constraint on the tail of a two-body system, requiring that tail-fin velocity aligns with the tail angle under rigid fluid idealization, while the head moves in a straight line. The system has one degree of freedom, with equations of motion derived using Lagrange multipliers. Two-dimensional CFD simulations validate the model in an incompressible Newtonian fluid, where the resolved tail fin interacts with fluid through the immersed boundary method until steady-state swimming is achieved. The validation demonstrates excellent quantitative agreement between CFD and model predictions for body orientation angle and normal fluid force across variations in fin motion amplitude, period, and Reynolds number. While an exact NH constraint point does not exist, an effective period-averaged NH location can be identified for successful model predictions. At higher Reynolds numbers, the two-body kinematics displays independence from the Reynolds number variation. The CFD data reveal that the two-body model captures the type of power-law relationship between Reynolds and Strouhal numbers governing undulatory swimming from tadpoles to whales, indicating that the simplified two-link model is representative of swimming dynamics in continuous geometries at various scales. The results demonstrate that the low-order NH constraint-based model effectively captures essential swimming dynamics, offering a robust alternative to existing fluid-force models.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Stability in the Two-Fluid Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 1-D Two-Fluid Model (TFM) promises a powerful and computationally cheap platform for simulating multi-fluid flow phenomena. However, runaway Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities plagued previous approaches, necessitating aphysical regularizations. We demonstrate a novel physics-based approach, using a simple turbulent viscosity model to provide nonlinear stabilization, compatible with inertial coupling. We develop a set of analytical and numerical tools to investigate the resulting dynamics, including turbulent cascades, chaos, and formation of churn or slug flow. Our approach opens up a wide range of new capabilities for the TFM by capturing the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability physically.</description>

      <title>Magnetorotational and convective instabilities in a thin layer of electrically conductive nanofluid under an external helical magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This review summarizes recent advances in the theoretical analysis of the stability of magnetized flows in a non-uniformly rotating layer of electrically conductive nanofluid, incorporating the effects of Brownian diffusion and thermophoresis. In the absence of temperature gradients, different forms of magnetorotational instability (MRI): standard (SMRI), azimuthal (AMRI), and helical (HMRI) are investigated for nanofluid layers subjected to axial, azimuthal, and helical magnetic fields. The corresponding growth rates and instability regions are analyzed in relation to the rotation profile (quantified by the Rossby number $\textrm{Ro}$) and the radial wave number $k$. When temperature gradients and nanoparticle concentration effects are present, stationary convective modes in both axial and helical magnetic fields are examined under conditions of non-uniform rotation. Analytical expressions for the critical Rayleigh number $\textrm{Ra}_{st}$ are derived, and neutral stability curves are constructed as functions of the angular velocity profile, the azimuthal magnetic field inhomogeneity (magnetic Rossby number $\textrm{Rb}$), and the wave number $k$. The study identifies and discusses key mechanisms responsible for the stabilization or destabilization of stationary convection in axial and spiral magnetic field configurations, highlighting the role of nanoparticle-driven effects in modifying classical magnetoconvective behavior.</description>

      <title>Improving Spatial Resolution of Background Oriented Schlieren Based on Directional Rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The background-oriented Schlieren technique has emerged as a promising method for visualizing density gradients and performing quantitative measurements. However, an inherent constraint of BOS is the compromise between spatial resolution and measurement sensitivity, as the BOS camera typically remains focused on the background pattern. To overcome the resolution-sensitivity constraint, a new variant of BOS based on nominally directional rays has been proposed in this paper. Instead of utilizing diffusively reflective background patterns, a spherically concave mirror etched with random dots has been used to create a dotted background that reflects rays directionally. Combined with coaxial LED light illumination, we demonstrate that the current setup can improve the spatial resolution of canonical BOS without compromising measurement sensitivity. Moreover, the proposed setup decouples the requirement of a small lens aperture to achieve a large depth of field, thereby significantly alleviating the need for strong background light illumination in high-speed BOS applications. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in improving the BOS spatial resolution, both synthetic BOS image generations and experiments on low- and high-speed jets are conducted. Results show that the proposed variant of BOS can be advantageous for measuring density-varying flows with a limited field of view.</description>

      <title>Numerical study of mass transfer in model metallurgical ladles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use direct numerical simulation (DNS) to investigate mass transfer between liquid steel and slag during a metallurgical secondary refinement process through two reduced-scale water experiments, which reproduce the dynamics seen in an industrial bottom-blown ladle. A container is filled with water and topped by a thin layer of oil, representing the molten steel and slag, respectively. The system is agitated by a bubble plume that impinges on the oil layer and forms an open-eye. A tracer species, dissolved in the water, acts as a passive scalar that is progressively absorbed into the oil layer. Both the hydrodynamics and mass transfer in the system are studied and compared with experiments from the literature of different size and geometry.
  The numerical simulation of mass transfer is challenging due to the high P\'eclet number, leading to extremely thin species boundary layers at the interface. Resolving the boundary layer is prohibitive even with adaptive grid techniques. A subgrid-scale (SGS) boundary layer model corrects the scalar transport equation, allowing us to solve convection-dominated transport on relatively coarse grids. The hydrodynamics is investigated, and we analyze how the resultant flow field governs mass transport. The numerical results recover two flow regimes: a quasi-steady regime at low flow rates with small deformations of the oil-water interface and an atomizing regime at large flow rates. Interfacial species transport is determined to be dominated in an annulus surrounding the open eye caused by a shear layer at the oil-water interface. It is observed that we achieve grid-independent macroscopic quantities that match relatively well with those observed in experiments, allowing use of simulation techniques as a complementary tool going forward.</description>

      <title>A quantitative analysis of leading edge vortices in flapping wing aerodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The leading edge vortex (LEV) is one of the most important lift augmentation mechanisms in flapping wing aerodynamics. We propose a methodology that aims to provide a quantitative description of the LEV. The first step of the method consists of the identification of the vortical structures surrounding the wing using the Q criterion. The impact of the employed threshold is shown to be minor, not influencing the observed trends. In the second step we identify the core of the LEV using a thinning algorithm, discriminating the LEV using the orientation of the locally averaged vorticity vector. Finally, we compute relevant flow quantities along the LEV core, by averaging in planes perpendicular to the local vorticity at the LEV core points. We have applied this methodology to flow data corresponding to a pair of wings performing a flapping motion in forward flight at moderate Reynolds number. We have performed a geometrical characterization of the LEV, and we have computed several flow quantities along the LEV core. For the particular configuration under study, we have shown that the LEV, during the first half of the downstroke develops and grows increasing its circulation smoothly. Approximately at mid-downstroke the leading edge vortex starts splitting, and its downstream part is advected towards the wake while keeping its circulation rather constant. Finally, we have briefly explored the link between the sectional lift on the wing and the local circulation obtained with the present methodology.</description>

      <title>A second-order volumetric boundary treatment for the lattice Boltzmann method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05035v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new volumetric-type boundary treatment is introduced for the lattice Boltzmann method. Populations are projected onto a discontinuous piecewise linear basis and streamed using an exact geometrical mapping. The method is implemented in 2D for convex, stationary geometries. Stability is verified through a novel analysis tool based on the eigenvalues of the streaming operation. A convergence rate of $\geq2$ is achieved, indicating improved accuracy over precursor methods. For flow around a 2D airfoil, the method yields better lift and drag predictions.</description>

      <title>Surface Wave-Aerodynamic Roughness Length Model for Air-Sea Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13491v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new model to evaluate the equivalent hydrodynamic length or surface roughness, z0, of ocean waves is developed and tested. The proposed Surface Wave-Aerodynamic Roughness Length (SWARL) model requires maps of the wave surface height at consecutive times and the air flow characteristic Reynolds number as inputs. Pressure drag is accounted for by approximating the relative velocity in a frame moving with the local wave phase-speed assuming ideal inviscid ramp flow (Ayala et al. 2024). Drag from viscous and unresolved ripples is modeled using the standard equilibrium model. The SWARL model is tested using over 300 datasets for monochromatic and broad-spectrum wave surfaces. The model-predicted z0 and drag coefficients are compared to measured values, as well as commonly used wave parametrization methods found in the literature. For datasets with well-characterized surfaces, the proposed model shows significantly better agreement with data compared to prior models. For data that did not include a full characterization of the wave fields (typically field data), the model yields predictions with accuracy similar to prior models. Results highlight that including detailed flow physics and extensive wave-field characterization in the modeling of z0 can provide significant improvements in roughness-length based modeling of air-sea interactions.</description>

      <title>Quantum implicit representation of vortex filaments in turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18212v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Entangled vortex filaments are essential to turbulence, serving as coherent structures that govern nonlinear fluid dynamics and support the reconstruction of fluid fields to reveal statistical properties. This study introduces an quantum implicit representation of vortex filaments in turbulence, employing a level-set method that models the filaments as the intersection of the real and imaginary zero iso-surfaces of a complex scalar field. Describing the fluid field via the scalar field offers distinct advantages in capturing complex structures, topological properties, and fluid dynamics, while opening new avenues for innovative solutions through quantum computing platforms. The representation is reformulated into an eigenvalue problem for Hermitian matrices, enabling the conversion of velocity fields into complex scalar fields that embed the vortex filaments. The resulting optimization is addressed using a variational quantum eigensolver, with Pauli operator truncation and deep learning techniques applied to improve efficiency and reduce noise. The proposed quantum framework achieves a near-linear time complexity and a exponential storage reduction while maintaining a balance of accuracy, robustness, and versatility, presenting a promising tool for turbulence analysis, vortex dynamics research, and machine learning dataset generation.</description>

      <title>The effect of self-induced Marangoni flow on polar-nematic waves in active-matter systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03956v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the formation of propagating large-scale density waves of mixed polar-nematic symmetry in a colony of self-propelled agents that are bound to move along the planar surface of a thin viscous film. The agents act as an insoluble surfactant, i.e. the surface tension of the liquid depends on their density. Therefore, density gradients generate a Marangoni flow. We demonstrate that for active matter in the form of self-propelled surfactants with local (nematic) aligning interactions such a Marangoni flow nontrivially influences the propagation of the density waves. Upon gradually increasing the Marangoni parameter, which characterises the relative strength of the Marangoni flow as compared to the self-propulsion speed, the density waves broaden while their speed may either increase or decrease depending on wavelength and overall mean density. A further increase of the Marangoni parameter eventually results in the disappearance of the density waves. This may occur either discontinuously at finite wave amplitude via a saddle-node bifurcation or continuously with vanishing wave amplitude at a wave bifurcation, i.e. a finite-wavelength Hopf bifurcation.</description>
