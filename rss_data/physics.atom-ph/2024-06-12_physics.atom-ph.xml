      <title>Vacuum polarization and Wichmann-Kroll correction in the finite basis set approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The finite basis set method is commonly used to calculate atomic spectra, including QED contributions such as bound-electron self-energy. Still, it remains problematic and underexplored for vacuum-polarization calculations. We fill this gap by trying this approach in its application to the calculation of the vacuum-polarization charge density and the Wichmann-Kroll correction to the electron binding energy in a hydrogen-like ion. We study the convergence of the method with different types and sizes of basis sets. We cross-check our results for the Wichmann-Kroll correction by direct integration of the Green's function. As a relevant example, we consider several heavy hydrogen-like ions and evaluate the vacuum polarization correction for $S$ and $P$ electron orbitals.</description>

      <title>Isotope shift measurement of the 423-nm transition in neutral Ca</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on saturated absorption spectroscopy measurements of the $(4s^2) ^{1}S_0\rightarrow(4s4p) ^{1}P_1$ transition for the four most abundant even-mass isotopes in calcium. By referencing the laser locked to an ultralow expansion cavity and carefully investigating systematic errors, isotope shifts are determined with a precision below 100 kHz, improving previously reported values by a factor of about five. A King plot analysis employing literature values of the 729-nm transition in Ca ions shows excellent linearity. The field and mass shift parameters are determined from King plots with other transitions.</description>

      <title>Alignment and Optimisation of Optical Tweezers on Trapped Ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a routine to align an optical tweezer on a single trapped ion and use the ion as a probe to characterize the tweezer. We find a smallest tweezer waist of $2.3(2)\,\mu$m, which is in agreement with the theoretical minimal attainable waist of $2.5(2)\,\mu$m in our setup. We characterize the spatial dependence of the tweezer Rabi frequency which is suppressed by a factor of 19(3) in the immediate surrounding of the ion. We investigate the effects of optical forces and coherent population trapping on the ion. Finally, we show that the challenges posed by these forces can be overcome, and that the number of tweezers can be easily scaled up to reach several ions by using a spatial light modulator.</description>

      <title>Physical coherent cancellation of optical addressing crosstalk in a trapped-ion experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an experimental investigation of coherent crosstalk cancellation methods for light delivered to a linear ion chain cryogenic quantum register. The ions are individually addressed using focused laser beams oriented perpendicular to the crystal axis, which are created by imaging each output of a multi-core photonic-crystal fibre waveguide array onto a single ion. The measured nearest-neighbor native crosstalk intensity of this device for ions spaced by 5 $\mu$m is found to be $\sim 10^{-2}$. We show that we can suppress this intensity crosstalk from waveguide channel coupling and optical diffraction effects by a factor $&gt;10^3$ using cancellation light supplied to neighboring channels which destructively interferes with the crosstalk. We measure a rotation error per gate on the order of $\epsilon_{x} \sim 10^{-5}$ on spectator qubits, demonstrating a suppression of crosstalk error by a factor of $&gt; 10^2$. We compare the performance to composite pulse methods for crosstalk cancellation, and describe the appropriate calibration methods and procedures to mitigate phase drifts between these different optical paths, including accounting for problems arising due to pulsing of optical modulators.</description>

      <title>Coherent Three-Photon Excitation of the Strontium Clock Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We recently demonstrated a steady-state Bose-Einstein condensate of strontium atoms. We could turn this into a perpetual atom laser if an efficient outcoupling mechanism is found. Here we show a coherent three-photon excitation of the clock transition in a strontium BEC with contrast of over 50\%. We follow it up with a demonstration of three-photon STIRAP-like transfer. In the future, we could use this process to coherently outcouple the atoms from a trap operating at tune-out wavelength.</description>

      <title>Noisy Qudit vs Multiple Qubits : Conditions on Gate Efficiency for enchancing Fidelity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.04543v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Today, multiple new platforms are implementing qudits, $d$-level quantum bases of information, for Quantum Information Processing (QIP). It is therefore crucial to study their efficiencies for QIP compared to more traditional qubit platforms. We present a comparative study of the infidelity scalings of a qudit and $n$-qubit systems, both with identical Hilbert space dimensions and noisy environments. The first-order response of the Average Gate Infidelity (AGI) to the noise in the Lindblad formalism, which was found to be gate-independent, was calculated analytically in the two systems being compared. This yielded a critical curve $O(d^2/\log_2(d))$ of the ratio of their respective gate times in units of decoherence time. This quantity indicates how time-efficient operations on these systems are. The curve delineates regions where each system has a higher rate of increase of the AGI than the other. This condition on gate efficiency was applied to different existing platforms. It was found that specific qudit platforms possess gate efficiencies competitive with state-of-the-art qubit platforms. Numerical simulations complemented this work and allowed for discussion of the applicability and limits of the linear response formalism.</description>

      <title>Cubic* criticality emerging from a quantum loop model on triangular lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.05715v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum loop and dimer models are archetypal examples of correlated systems with local constraints. Obtaining generic solutions for these models is difficult due to the lack of controlled methods to solve them in the thermodynamic limit. Nevertheless, these solutions are of immediate relevance to both statistical and quantum field theories, as well as the rapidly growing experiments in Rydberg atom arrays and quantum moir\'e materials, where the interplay between correlation and local constraints gives rise to a plethora of novel phenomena. In a recent work [X. Ran, Z. Yan, Y.-C. Wang, et al, arXiv:2205.04472 (2022)], it was found through sweeping cluster quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations and field theory analysis that the triangular lattice quantum loop model (QLM) hosts a rich ground state phase diagram with lattice nematic, vison plaquette (VP) crystals, and the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ quantum spin liquid (QSL) close to the Rokhsar-Kivelson point. Here, we focus on the continuous quantum critical point separating the VP and QSL phases and demonstrate via both static and dynamic probes in QMC simulations that this transition is of the (2+1)D cubic* universality. In this transition, the fractionalized visons in QSL condense to give rise to the crystalline VP phase, while leaving their trace in the anomalously large anomalous dimension exponent and pronounced continua in the dimer and vison spectra compared with those at the conventional cubic or O(3) quantum critical points.</description>
