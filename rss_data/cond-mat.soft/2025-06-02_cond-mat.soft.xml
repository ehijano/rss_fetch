      <title>Motility-dependent selective transport of active matter in trap arrays: Separation methods based on trapping-detrapping and deterministic lateral displacement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Selecting active matter based on its motility represents a challenging task, as it requires different approaches than common separation techniques intended for separation based on, e.g., size, shape, density, and flexibility. This motility-based selection is important for, e.g., selecting biological species, such as bacteria or highly motile sperm cells for medically assisted reproduction. Common separation techniques are not applicable for separating species based on motility as such species can have indistinguishable physical properties, i.e., size, shape, density, and differ only by their ability to execute self-propelled motion as, e.g., motile, and immotile sperm cells. Therefore, selecting active species based on motility requires completely different approaches. Some of these have been developed including sperm cell selection techniques, e.g., swim-up techniques, passive selection methods based on the ability of highly motile sperm cells to swim across streamlines, as well as more sophisticated techniques. Here we theoretically demonstrate via numerical simulations various efficient methods of selection and separation based on the motility of active species using arrays of traps. Two approaches are proposed: one allowed the selective escape of motile species from traps, and the other one relying on a deterministic lateral displacement (DLD)-type method. As a model system, we consider self-propelled Janus particles whose motility can be tuned. The resulted separation methods are applicable for separation of biological motile species, such as bacteria or sperm cells, as well as for Janus micro- and nanoparticles.</description>

      <title>The understanding of the penetration and clusterization of 1-alkanol in bilayer membrane: An open outlook based on atomistic molecular dynamics simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 1-alkanols are well known to have anesthetic and penetration properties, though the mode of operation remains enigmatic. We perform extensive atomistic molecular dynamics simulation to study the penetration of 1-alkanols of different chain lengths in the dioleoyl-phosphatidylcholine (DOPC) bilayer model membrane. Our simulations show that the depth of penetration of 1-alkanol increases with chain length, n, and the deuterium order of the DOPC tail increases with the chain length of the acyl-chain of the 1-alkanol. We find a cut-off value for the length of the acyl-chain of 1-alkanol, n = 12, where 1-alkanol with a chain length greater than the cut-off value takes longer to penetrate the membrane. Our simulation study also demonstrates that the membrane exhibits clusters of 1-alkanols with acyl chains longer than the cut-off value, whereas 1-alkanols with acyl-chain shorter than the cut-off value are distributed homogeneously in the membrane and penetrate the membrane in a shorter time than longer-acyl-chain 1-alkanols. These findings add to our understanding of the anomalies in anesthetic molecule partitioning in the cell membrane and may have implications for general anesthesia.</description>

      <title>Nematic ordering in active fluids driven by substrate deformations: Mechanisms and patterning regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay between active matter and its environment is central to understanding emergent behavior in biological and synthetic systems. Here, we show that coupling active nematic flows to small-amplitude deformations of a compliant substrate can fundamentally reorganize the system's dynamics. Using a model that combines active nematohydrodynamics with substrate mechanics, we find that contractile active nematics-normally disordered in flat geometries-undergo a sharp transition to long-range orientational order when the environment is deformable. This environmentally induced ordering is robust and enables distinct patterning regimes, with wrinkle morphologies reflecting the nature of the active stresses. Our results reveal a generic mechanism by which mechanical feedback from soft environments can lead to ordering in active systems.</description>

      <title>Emergent Dynamics of Active Systems on Curved Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Curvature plays a central role in the proper function of many biological processes. With active matter being a standard framework for understanding many aspects of the physics of life, it is natural to ask what effect curvature has on the collective behaviour of active matter. In this paper, we use the classical theory of surfaces to explore the active motion of self-propelled agents confined to move on a smooth curved two-dimensional surface embedded in Euclidean space. Even without interactions and alignment, the motion is non-trivially affected by the presence of curvature, leading to effects akin, e.g.\ to gravitational lensing and tidal forces. Such effects can lead to intermittent trapping of particles and profoundly affect their flocking behaviour.</description>

      <title>Unifying same- and different-material particle charging through stochastic scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Triboelectric charging of insulating particles through contact is critical in diverse physical and engineering processes, from dust storms and volcanic eruptions to industrial powder handling. However, repeated experiments revealed counterintuitive charge patterns, including variable impact charge under identical conditions, charge sign reversal with repeated impacts, and bipolar charging of differently sized particles. Existing computational models cannot predict these patterns; they either rely on oversimplified heuristics or require inaccessible detailed surface properties. We present a physics-based stochastic particle charging (SPC) model integrating experimentally characterized charging statistics into multiphase simulations. The model unifies same-material (particle-particle) and different-material (particle-wall) charging in a single framework, grounded in a stochastic closure by the mean, variance, skewness, and minimum impact charge of a single reference experiment. Implemented in a Lagrangian-Eulerian CFD solver, the SPC model takes less than 0.01% of the CPU time when simulating 300 000 insulating particles, charging during millions of same- and different-material contacts, transported by turbulent wall-bounded flows. By scaling the statistical parameters of the reference impact to each collision, the new model reproduces the complex charging patterns observed in experiments without requiring surface-level first-principles inputs. The SPC model offers a physically grounded route to massive-scale simulations of electrostatic effects across many fields of particle-laden flows.</description>

      <title>Modelling bulk mechanical effects in a planar cellular monolayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use a three-dimensional formulation of the cell vertex model to describe the mechanical properties of a confluent planar monolayer of prismatic cells. Treating cell height as a degree of freedom, we reduce the model to a two-dimensional form. We show how bulk effects, associated with cell volume and total surface area, lead to coupling between energy variations arising from changes in cell apical area and apical perimeter, a feature missing from standard implementations of the two-dimensional vertex model. The model identifies four independent mechanisms by which cells can lose in-plane rigidity, relating to variations in total cell surface area, the strength of lateral adhesion, and constrictive forces at the apical cortex. The model distinguishes bulk from in-plane stresses, and identifies two primary measures of cell shear stress. In the rigid regime, the model shows how lateral crowding in a disordered isolated monolayer can lead to cell elongation towards the monolayer centre. We examine loss of in-plane rigidity in a disordered monolayer and connect isolated patches of stiffness that persist during the rigidity transition to the spectrum of a Laplacian matrix. This approach enables bulk mechanical effects in an epithelium to be captured within a two-dimensional framework.</description>

      <title>The 'Brazil-nut effect' in bidisperse particle laden flow on an incline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study bidisperse suspensions -- suspensions where there are two particle species of the same density but different sizes -- of a viscous fluid on an incline. We use a lubrication theory/thin film model to form a hyperbolic system of three conservation laws for the height and particle volume fractions. The model predicts, over a range of parameters, that the larger particles rise to the top of the layer, consistent with the well-known `Brazil-nut effect' for granular media. The model predicts well-separated fronts of the two species of particles, behind a clear fluid front, at lower inclination angles and volume fractions. This corresponds to a triple shock structure in the system of conservations. At higher inclination angles and volume fractions the particles congregate at a high concentration at the leading front corresponding to a singular shock in the model. We find excellent agreement between theory and experiments in terms of the overall dynamic structures as the parameters vary.</description>

      <title>Active Gaussian Network Model: a non-equilibrium description of protein fluctuations and allosteric behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the link between structure and function in proteins is fundamental in molecular biology and proteomics. A central question in this context is whether allostery - where the binding of a molecule at one site affects the activity of a distant site - emerges as a further manifestation of the intricate interplay between structure, function, and intrinsic dynamics. This study explores how allosteric regulation is modified when intrinsic protein dynamics operate under out-of-equilibrium conditions. To this purpose, we introduce a simple nonequilibrium model of protein dynamics, inspired by active matter systems, by generalizing the widely employed Gaussian Network Model (GNM) to incorporate non-thermal effects. Our approach underscores the advantage of framing allostery as a causal process by using, as a benchmark system, the second PDZ domain of the human phosphatase hPT1E that mediates protein-protein interactions. We employ causal indicators, such as response functions and transfer entropy, to identify the network of PDZ2 residues through which the allosteric signal propagates across the protein structure. These indicators reveal specific regions that align well with experimental observations. Furthermore, our results suggest that deviations from purely thermal fluctuations can significantly influence allosteric communication by introducing distinct timescales and memory effects. This influence is particularly relevant when the allosteric response unfolds on timescales incompatible with relaxation to equilibrium. Accordingly, non-thermal fluctuations may become essential for accurately describing protein responses to ligand binding and developing a comprehensive understanding of allosteric regulation.</description>

      <title>Trypanosoma brucei moving in microchannels and through constrictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17673v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Trypanosoma brucei (T. brucei), a single-celled parasite and natural microswimmer, is responsible for fatal sleeping sickness in infected mammals, including humans. Understanding how T. brucei interacts with fluid environments and navigates through confining spaces is crucial not only for medical and clinical applications but also for a fundamental understanding of how life organizes in a confined microscopic world. Using a hybrid multi-particle collision dynamics (MPCD)--molecular dynamics (MD) approach, we present our investigations on the locomotion of an in silico T. brucei in three types of fluid environments: bulk fluid, straight cylindrical microchannels, and microchannels with constrictions. We observe that the helical swimming trajectory of the in silico T. brucei becomes rectified in straight cylindrical channels compared to bulk fluid. The swimming speed for different channel widths is governed by the diameter of the helical trajectory. The speed first slightly increases as the channel narrows and then decreases when the helix diameter is compressed. An optimal swimming speed is achieved, when the channel width is approximately twice the bulk helix diameter. It results from an interplay of the trypanosome's hydrodynamic interactions with the cylindrical channel walls and the high deformability of the parasite. In microchannels with constrictions, the motions of the anterior and posterior ends, the end-to-end distance, and the log-rolling motion of the cell body are characterized and show salient differences compared to the straight-channel case. Depending on the constriction length and width, we observe characteristic slip, stuck, and stuck-slip motions of the model T. brucei within the constriction. Our findings may provide some mechanical insights into how T. brucei moves through blood vessels and tissues, and across the blood-brain barrier.</description>

      <title>Stretching Response of a Polymer Chain with Deformable Bonds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08602v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The stretching response of polymer chains fundamentally determines the mechanical properties of polymer networks. In this Letter, we develop a statistical mechanics model that incorporates both bond stretching and bond angle deformation, enabling accurate predictions of chain behavior up to large forces. We further propose a semianalytical deformable freely rotating chain (dFRC) model, which represents the chain as a freely rotating chain with effective bond stretch and bond angle that depend on the chain stretch. Using physical parameters without fitting, both the statistical and dFRC models achieve excellent agreement with experimental data for carbon chains across all force regimes. Additionally, the dFRC model provides a direct estimate of the bond force, which is important to predict chain scission. By capturing key bond deformations while remaining computationally efficient, our work lays the foundation for future modeling of polymer network elasticity and failure.</description>

      <title>Modeling and computation of the effective elastic behavior of parallelogram origami metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08894v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Origami metamaterials made of repeating unit cells of parallelogram panels joined at folds dramatically change their shape through a collective motion of their cells. Here we develop an effective elastic model and numerical method to study the large deformation response of these metamaterials under a broad class of loads. The model builds on an effective plate theory derived in our prior work [64]. The theory captures the overall shape change of all slightly stressed parallelogram origami deformations through nonlinear geometric compatibility constraints that couple the origami's (cell averaged) effective deformation to an auxiliary angle field quantifying its cell-by-cell actuation. It also assigns to each such origami deformation a plate energy associated to these effective fields. Seeking a constitutive model that is faithful to the theory but also practical to simulate, we relax the geometric constraints via corresponding elastic energy penalties; we also simplify the plate energy density to embrace its essential character as a regularization to the geometric penalties. The resulting model for parallelogram origami is a generalized elastic continuum that is nonlinear in the effective deformation gradient and angle field and regularized by high-order gradients thereof. We provide a finite element formulation of this model using the $C^0$ interior penalty method to handle second gradients of deformation, and implement it using the open source computing platform Firedrake. We end by using the model and numerical method to study two canonical parallelogram origami patterns, in Miura and Eggbox origami, under a variety of loading conditions.</description>
