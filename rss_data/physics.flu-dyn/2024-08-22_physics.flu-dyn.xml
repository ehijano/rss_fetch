      <title>DrivAerML: High-Fidelity Computational Fluid Dynamics Dataset for Road-Car External Aerodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) has the potential to revolutionise the field of automotive aerodynamics, enabling split-second flow predictions early in the design process. However, the lack of open-source training data for realistic road cars, using high-fidelity CFD methods, represents a barrier to their development. To address this, a high-fidelity open-source (CC-BY-SA) public dataset for automotive aerodynamics has been generated, based on 500 parametrically morphed variants of the widely-used DrivAer notchback generic vehicle. Mesh generation and scale-resolving CFD was executed using consistent and validated automatic workflows representative of the industrial state-of-the-art. Geometries and rich aerodynamic data are published in open-source formats. To our knowledge, this is the first large, public-domain dataset for complex automotive configurations generated using high-fidelity CFD.</description>

      <title>Waves beneath a drop levitating over a moving wall</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent experiments, Sawaguchi et al. directly probed the lubrication layer of air beneath a droplet levitating inside a rotating cylindrical drum. For small rotation rates of the drum, the lubrication film beneath the drop adopted a steady shape, while at higher rotation rates, travelling waves propagated along the drop's lower surface with roughly half the wall velocity. We here rationalize the physical origin of these waves. We begin with a simplified model of the lubrication flow beneath the droplet, and examine the linear stability of this base state to perturbations of the Tollmien--Schlichting type. Our developments lead to the Orr-Sommerfeld equation (OSE), whose eigenvalues give the growth rates and phase speeds of the perturbations. By considering wavelengths long relative to the lubrication film thickness, we solve the OSE perturbatively and so deduce the wavelength and phase velocity of the most unstable mode. We find satisfactory agreement between experiment and theory over the parameter regime considered in the laboratory.</description>

      <title>Water flow model on vegetated hillslopes with erosion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The water circulation in the Soil-Plant-Atmosphere continuum and particularly the soil erosion induced by water are problems of main concern in the new era of climate change. The present paper aims to provide a mathematical tool to investigate the water-soil and water-plant interactions involved in the complex process of water flow on plant-covered soil surfaces. Basically, the mathematical model consists of an extended Saint-Venant system of equations for water flow coupled with Hairsine-Rose equations for soil erosion. The classical Saint-Venant model is thus modified in order to take into account the presence of plants on the soil surface. On the premise that the model adequately reflects the essence of the reality, a series of numerical experiments are performed to analyze the plant induced effects on water dynamics and soil erosion intensity.
  Given that both, the mathematical model and the accompanying software are flexible enough to reflect the variability of the environmental variables such as soil structure, soil surface roughness, or plant cover structure, each numerical experiment is constructed as an image of a target hydrological context. The dam break problem, flash floods, water-induced soil erosion in a catchment basin are all subjects of numerical analysis. It is shown that the presence of the plant cover drastically modifies the water dynamics and the distribution of the soil eroded particles and one can quantitatively evaluate such effects. The methods described in the paper can also help one to manage the environmental resources in order to avoid the water induced disasters.</description>

      <title>Basset history and inertia are relevant for unsteady particle settling dynamics and flow structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine a sphere falling under gravity in Stokesian conditions, revealing significant early-time history effects. Our experiments quantitatively validate the solution to the Basset-Boussinesq-Oseen equation, showing an algebraic rather than exponential relaxation rate. Both experiment and theory unexpectedly reveal an unsteady vortex ring forming around the sphere, which drifts away as the sphere settles. As the particle Reynolds number nears unity, the vortex ring lags behind the particle-a behavior not predicted by Stokesian theory, though the particle's trajectory remains accurately predicted. These findings are critical for understanding particle interactions in fluid flows in natural phenomena and practical applications.</description>

      <title>The vertical velocity skewness in the atmospheric boundary layer without buoyancy and Coriolis effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the main statistical features of near-neutral atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) turbulence is the positive vertical velocity skewness $Sk_w$ above the roughness sublayer or the buffer region in smooth-walls. The $Sk_w$ variations are receiving renewed interest in many climate-related parameterizations of the ABL given their significance to cloud formation and to testing sub-grid schemes for Large Eddy Simulations (LES). The vertical variations of $Sk_w$ are explored here using high Reynolds number wind tunnel and flume experiments collected above smooth, rough, and permeable-walls in the absence of buoyancy and Coriolis effects. These laboratory experiments form a necessary starting point to probe the canonical structure of $Sk_w$ as they deal with a key limiting case (i.e. near-neutral conditions) that has received much less attention compared to its convective counterpart in atmospheric turbulence studies. Diagnostic models based on cumulant expansions, realizability constraints, and the now-popular constant mass flux approach routinely employed in the convective boundary layer as well as prognostic models based on third-order budgets are used to explain variations in $Sk_w$ for the idealized laboratory conditions. The failure of flux-gradient relations to model $Sk_w$ from the gradients of the vertical velocity variance $\sigma_w^2$ are explained and corrections based on models of energy transport offered. Novel links between the diagnostic and prognostic models are also featured, especially for the inertial term in the third order budget of the vertical velocity fluctuation. The co-spectral properties of $w'/\sigma_w$ versus $w'^2/\sigma_w^2$ are also presented for the first time to assess the dominant scales governing $Sk_w$ in the inner and outer layers, where $w'$ is the fluctuating vertical velocity and $\sigma_w$ is the vertical velocity standard deviation.</description>

      <title>Effect of Frequency-Dependent Viscosity on Molecular Friction in Liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The relation between the frequency-dependent friction of a molecule in a liquid and the hydrodynamic properties of the liquid is fundamental for molecular dynamics. We investigate this connection for a water molecule moving in liquid water using all-atomistic molecular dynamics simulations and linear hydrodynamic theory. We analytically calculate the frequency-dependent friction of a sphere with finite surface slip moving in a viscoelastic compressible fluid by solving the linear transient Stokes equation, including frequency-dependent shear and volume viscosities, both determined from MD simulations of bulk liquid water. We also determine the frequency-dependent friction of a single water molecule moving in liquid water, as defined by the generalized Langevin equation from MD simulation trajectories. By fitting the effective sphere radius and the slip length, the frequency-dependent friction and velocity autocorrelation function from the transient Stokes equation and simulations quantitatively agree. This shows that the transient Stokes equation accurately describes the important features of the frequency-dependent friction of a single water molecule in liquid water and thus applies down to molecular length and time scales, provided accurate frequency-dependent viscosities are used. The frequency dependence of the shear viscosity of liquid water requires careful consideration of hydrodynamic finite-size effects to observe the asymptotic hydrodynamic power-law tail. In contrast, for a methane molecule moving in water, the frequency-dependent friction cannot be predicted based on a homogeneous model, which suggests, supported by the extraction of a frequency-dependent surface-slip profile, that a methane molecule is surrounded by a finite-thickness hydration layer with viscoelastic properties that are significantly different from bulk water.</description>

      <title>A new temperature evolution equation that enforces thermodynamic vapour-liquid equilibrium in multiphase flows -- application to CO2 modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09164v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work presents a novel framework for numerically simulating the depressurization of tanks and pipelines containing carbon dioxide (CO2). The framework focuses on efficient solution strategies for the coupled system of fluid flow equations and thermodynamic constraints. A key contribution lies in proposing a new set of equations for phase equilibrium calculations which simplifies the traditional vapor-liquid equilibrium (VLE) calculations for two-phase CO2 mixtures. The first major novelty resides in the reduction of the conventional four-equation VLE system to a single equation, enabling efficient solution using a non-linear solver. This significantly reduces computational cost compared to traditional methods. Furthermore, a second novelty is introduced by deriving an ordinary differential equation (ODE) directly from the UV-Flash equation. This ODE can be integrated alongside the governing fluid flow equations, offering a computationally efficient approach for simulating depressurization processes.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous symmetry breaking in two dimensions under nonequilibrium laminar flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.06390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.06390v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the long-range order in two dimensions where an order parameter is advected by laminar flows such as rotational, shear, and elongational flows. Under these flows, we analyze an ordered state of the $O(N)$ scalar model in the large-$N$ limit. We show that the stability of the ordered state depends on the flow pattern; shear and elongational flows stabilize the long-range order but rotational flow does not. We discuss the physical mechanism underlying our results by connecting static correlations of fluctuations and their dynamics based on the interaction representation used in quantum mechanics. We find that advective transport induces superdiffusion under shear and elongational flows, thereby stabilizing the long-range order.</description>

      <title>Rectifying bedload flux variability from channel geometry and grain shape effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07689v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bedload transport occurs when a bed composed of sedimentary grains becomes mobile in response to the shearing by a flow of liquid. It shapes the landscapes of Earth and other planetary bodies by promoting the formation and growth of various multiscale geological features. Estimating the rate at which such processes take place requires accurate bedload flux predictions. However, even for highly idealized conditions in the laboratory, study-to-study variability of reported bedload flux measurements borders an order of magnitude. This uncertainty stems from physically poorly supported, typically empirical methods to account for channel geometry effects in the determination of the transport-driving bed shear stress and from study-to-study grain shape variations. Here, we derive and validate a universal method of bed shear stress determination and apply it to a number of independent grain-shape-controlled data sets from experiments and CFD-DEM simulations for a very diverse range of transport conditions. An existing physical bedload flux model, here generalized to account for grain shape variability, predicts almost all these data within a factor of 1.3, whereas a recently proposed grain shape correction of the bed shear stress (Deal et al., Nature 613, 298-302, 2023) substantially increases the bedload flux scatter across weak and intense transport conditions.</description>

      <title>Decomposing causality into its synergistic, unique, and redundant components</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12411v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Causality lies at the heart of scientific inquiry, serving as the fundamental basis for understanding interactions among variables in physical systems. Despite its central role, current methods for causal inference face significant challenges due to nonlinear dependencies, stochastic interactions, self-causation, collider effects, and influences from exogenous factors, among others. While existing methods can effectively address some of these challenges, no single approach has successfully integrated all these aspects. Here, we address these challenges with SURD: Synergistic-Unique-Redundant Decomposition of causality. SURD quantifies causality as the increments of redundant, unique, and synergistic information gained about future events from past observations. The formulation is non-intrusive and applicable to both computational and experimental investigations, even when samples are scarce. We benchmark SURD in scenarios that pose significant challenges for causal inference and demonstrate that it offers a more reliable quantification of causality compared to previous methods.</description>
