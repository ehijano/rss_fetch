      <title>A Non-diffracting Resonant Angular Filter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conceptualise and numerically simulate a resonant metamaterial interface incorporating non-local, or beyond nearest neighbour, coupling that acts as a discrete angular filter. It can be designed to yield perfect transmission at customizable angles of incidence, without diffraction, allowing for tailored transmission in arbitrarily narrow wavenumber windows. The theory is developed in the setting of discrete, infinitely periodic quantum graphs and we realise it numerically as an acoustic meta-grating. The theory is then applied to continuous acoustic waveguides, first for the medium surrounding the interface and then for the interface itself, showing the efficacy of quantum graph theory in interface design.</description>

      <title>New geometric receipts for design of photonic crystals and metamaterials: optimal toric packings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Design of photonic crystals having large bandgaps above a prescribed band is a well-known physical problem with many applications. A connection to an interesting mathematical construction was pointed out some time ago: it had been conjectured that optimal structures for gaps between bands n and n+1 correspond, in case of transverse magnetic polarisation, to rods located at the generators of centroidal Voronoi tessellation (CVT), and in case of transverse electric polarisation to the walls of this tessellation. We discover another mathematical receipt which produces even better solutions: optimal packing of discs in square and triangular tori. It provides solutions qualitatively different from CVT, sometimes increasing the resulting bandgap size in several times. We therefore introduce two new classes of periodic structures with remarkable properties which may find applications in many other areas of modern solid state physics: arrays of particles located at the centers of optimally packed discs on tori, and nets corresponding to the walls of their Voronoi tessellations.</description>

      <title>An Internal Digital Image Correlation Technique for High-Strain Rate Dynamic Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Full-field, quantitative visualization techniques, such as digital image correlation (DIC), have unlocked vast opportunities for experimental mechanics. However, DIC has traditionally been a surface measurement technique, and has not been extended to perform measurements on the interior of specimens for dynamic, full-scale laboratory experiments. This restricts the use of DIC measurements, especially in the context of heterogeneous materials. Objective: The focus of this study is to develop a method for performing internal DIC measurements in dynamic experiments. The aim is to demonstrate its feasibility and accuracy across a range of stresses (up to 650MPa), strain rates ($10^3$-$10^6$ s$^{-1}$), and high-strain rate loading conditions (e.g., ramped and shock wave loading). Methods: Internal DIC is developed based on the concept of applying a speckle pattern at an inner-plane of a transparent specimen. The high-speed imaging configuration is then focused on the internal speckle pattern. During the dynamic experiment, in-plane, two-dimensional deformations are measured via correlation of the internal speckle pattern. Results: The internal DIC experimental technique is successfully demonstrated in both the SHPB and plate impact experiments. In the SHPB setting, the accuracy of the technique is excellent throughout the deformation regime, with measurement noise of approximately 0.2% strain. For plate impact experiments, the technique performs well, with error and measurement noise of 1% strain. Conclusion: The internal DIC technique has been developed and demonstrated to work well for full-scale dynamic high-strain rate and shock laboratory experiments, and the accuracy is quantified. The technique can aid in investigating the physics and mechanics of the dynamic behavior of materials, including local deformation fields around dynamically loaded material heterogeneities.</description>

      <title>A Constrained Mechanical Metamaterial Towards Wave Polarization and Steering Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise control of the polarization and propagation direction of elastic waves is a fundamental challenge in elastodynamics. Achieving efficient mode conversion along arbitrary paths with conventional techniques has proven difficult. In this letter, we propose an innovative harmonimode mechanical metamaterial by integrating classical lattice architecture with a constrained mechanism. The constrained discrete mass-spring model is formulated and homogenized to reveal the unique harmonimode behavior, which supports single-mode polarized propagation and perfect impedance matching with the reference medium. Leveraging multi-scale simulations and the discrete transformation method, the metamaterial is designed to exhibit degenerated wave polarization and broadband mode conversion along various paths by simply adjusting constraint orientations. Finally, hinge joints are proposed for the physical realization of the metamaterial with sub-wavelength microstructures. Numerical simulations confirm its exceptional wave control performance over a broad frequency range. This work presents a comprehensive framework for designing harmonimode metamaterials capable of arbitrary polarization control.</description>

      <title>Deterministic formation of carbon-functionalized quantum emitters in hexagonal boron nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Forming single-photon emitters (SPEs) in insulating hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has sparked wide interests in the quantum photonics. Despite significant progress, it remains challenging to deterministically create SPEs at precise locations with a specific type of element for creating defects. In this study, we present a straightforward approach to generate site-deterministic carbon-functionalized quantum emitters in hBN by harnessing ultrasonic nanoindentation. The obtained SPEs are high-quality and can be scaled up to large arrays in a single fabrication step. Comprehensive experimental analyses reveal that the insertion of carbon atoms into the hBN lattice is the source of the robust quantum emission. Complementary theoretical studies suggest possible candidates for the structural origin of the defects based on our experimental results. This rapid and scalable nanoindentation method provides a new way to create SPE arrays with specific types of atoms, enabling the comprehensive investigation of the origins and mechanics of SPE formations in two-dimensional (2D) materials and beyond.</description>

      <title>Improving Electrical Contact Quality and Extraordinary Magnetoresistance in High Mobility III-V Semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetometers based on the extraordinary magnetoresistance (EMR) effect are promising for applications which demand high sensitivity combined with room temperature operation but their application for magnetic field sensing requires further optimization. A key challenge is to obtain Ohmic metal/semiconductor contacts with low contact resistances in EMR devices comprising semiconductors with low carrier densities and high electron mobilities, yet, this topic remains scarcely investigated experimentally. By annealing high-mobility InSb in argon with systematically increasing temperatures, we experimentally demonstrate how the contact resistance to InSb films can be improved by two orders of magnitude by annealing to the micro-Ohm cm2 range without degrading the high mobility. We further show that lowering the contact resistance monotonously increases the room temperature magnetoresistance at 2 T from 700% to 65,000%. Lastly, we explore the origin of intrinsic magnetoresistance in high-mobility InSb thin films and suggest that it can best be explained by multiple band conduction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) is nowadays one of the most interesting applications of SERS, in particular for single molecule studies. In fact, it enables the study of real-time processes at the molecular level. This review summarizes the latest developments in dynamic SERS techniques and their applications, focusing on new instrumentation, data analysis methods, temporal resolution and sensitivity improvements, and novel substrates. We highlight the progress and applications of single-molecule dynamic SERS in monitoring chemical reactions, catalysis, biomolecular interactions, conformational dynamics, and real-time sensing and detection. We aim to provide a comprehensive review on its advancements, applications as well as its current challenges and development frontiers.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Effective Permittivity Model for Metasurfaces Embedded in Layered Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dielectric layers surrounding a metasurface have a large impact on its frequency and angular response. The notion of effective permittivity captures this dependence by suggesting that a layered dielectric environment will perturb metasurface resonances in the same manner as an infinite environment of that effective permittivity. A model for effective permittivity is presented in this work. In contrast to previous empirically derived models, this multi-term model is a robust approximation based on the modal expansion of fields at the metasurface. A simple dipole metasurface array is simulated to demonstrate the accuracy of the model, which is shown to be improved over other models. Finally, we show that it is possible for dielectric layers to produce an effective permeability different than unity, which must be considered in conjunction with higher-order equivalent circuit modeling to effectively predict metasurface impedance variation.</description>

      <title>Design of the tertiary optical system for the Large Latin American Millimeter Array radio telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many modern radio telescopes employ an observational strategy that involves maximizing the use of their available spaces (cabins), outfitting them with various receivers at different frequencies to detect incoming signals from the sky simultaneously or individually. The Large Latin American Millimeter Array (LLAMA), is a joint venture between Argentina and Brazil consisting of the installation and operation of a 12-meter aperture Cassegrain telescope. It features three available cabins for instrumentation and plans to install six single-pixel heterodyne receivers, covering different bandwidths in the 30 to 950 GHz window of the electromagnetic spectrum, in its two lateral Nasmyth cabins at different phases of the project. Therefore, it is crucial not only to design a tertiary optical system that couples the antenna beam to those receivers, but also to do it in a scalable way. The primary goal for the design is to simultaneously maximize the antenna efficiency while minimizing optical aberrations for all receivers, both fundamental aspects for the optimal functioning of cutting-edge astronomical instruments. In this paper, we present the entire design process, starting from the quasi-optical approach based on the propagation of a fundamental Gaussian beam mode, continuing with the validation of the design based on physical optics simulations, and ending with a tolerance analysis of the system. As a result of this process, a frequency independent tertiary optical system has been achieved for almost all the receivers, which is expected to provide high optical performance for the radio telescope.</description>

      <title>Enhanced biochemical sensing with high-Q transmission resonances in free-standing membrane metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17456v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical metasurfaces provide novel solutions to label-free biochemical sensing by localizing light resonantly beyond the diffraction limit, thereby selectively enhancing light-matter interactions for improved analytical performance. However, high-Q resonances in metasurfaces are usually achieved in the reflection mode, which impedes metasurface integration into compact imaging systems. Here, we demonstrate a novel metasurface platform for advanced biochemical sensing based on the physics of the bound states in the continuum (BIC) and electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) modes, which arise when two interfering resonances from a periodic pattern of tilted elliptic holes overlap both spectrally and spatially, creating a narrow transparency window in the mid-infrared spectrum. We experimentally measure these resonant peaks observed in transmission mode (Q~734 at ~8.8 um) in free-standing silicon membranes and confirm their tunability through geometric scaling. We also demonstrate the strong coupling of the BIC-EIT modes with a thinly coated PMMA film on the metasurface, characterized by a large Rabi splitting (32 cm-1) and biosensing of protein monolayers in transmission mode. Our new photonic platform can facilitate the integration of metasurface biochemical sensors into compact and monolithic optical systems while being compatible with scalable manufacturing, thereby clearing the way for on-site biochemical sensing in everyday applications.</description>

      <title>Transverse thermoelectric conversion in the mixed-dimensional semimetal WSi$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17687v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Materials with axis-dependent conduction polarity are known as $p\times n$-type or goniopolar conductors that can be used for transverse thermoelectric devices, allowing the longitudinal thermal current to be converted into the transverse electrical current. Here, we performed experimental and computational studies on the transport properties of WSi$_2$ single crystals, in which such axis-dependent conduction polarity of the thermopower and the Hall coefficient have recently been reported, and demonstrated the transverse thermoelectric effect by applying the temperature gradient in a 45$^{\circ}$ rotated direction from the crystallographic axis. We have observed strongly sample-dependent transport properties, which have also been observed in previous studies, and together with first-principles calculations we show that such sample-dependent transport properties originate from the band-dependent scattering rates of carriers. The calculated band-resolved Peltier conductivity shows that the mixed-dimensional electronic structure consisting of a quasi-one-dimensional electron Fermi surface and a quasi-two-dimensional hole surface is a key property for the axis-dependent conduction polarity. The directly obtained transverse thermoelectric figure of merit is comparable to that of the anomalous Nernst materials, implying that the present material is a potential candidate for transverse thermoelectric conversion.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Modeling and Vibration Analysis of Large Deployable Mesh Reflectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large deployable mesh reflectors are essential for space applications, providing precise reflecting surfaces for high-gain antennas used in satellite communications, Earth observation, and deep-space missions. During on-orbit missions, active shape adjustment and attitude control are crucial for maintaining surface accuracy and proper orientation for these reflectors, ensuring optimal performance. Preventing resonance through thorough dynamic modeling and vibration analysis is vital to avoid structural damage and ensure stability and reliability. Existing dynamic modeling approaches, such as wave and finite element methods, often fail to accurately predict dynamic responses due to the limited capability of handling three-dimensional reflectors or the oversimplification of cable members of a reflector. This paper proposes the Cartesian spatial discretization method for dynamic modeling and vibration analysis of cable-network structures in large deployable mesh reflectors. This method defines cable member positions as a summation of internal and boundary-induced terms within a global Cartesian coordinate system. Numerical simulation on a two-dimensional cable-network structure and a center-feed mesh reflector demonstrates the superiority of the proposed method over traditional approaches, highlighting its accuracy and versatility, and establishing it as a robust tool for analyzing three-dimensional complex reflector configurations.</description>

      <title>Optical Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative models cover various application areas, including image, video and music synthesis, natural language processing, and molecular design, among many others. As digital generative models become larger, scalable inference in a fast and energy-efficient manner becomes a challenge. Here, we present optical generative models inspired by diffusion models, where a shallow and fast digital encoder first maps random noise into phase patterns that serve as optical generative seeds for a desired data distribution; a jointly-trained free-space-based reconfigurable decoder all-optically processes these generative seeds to create novel images (never seen before) following the target data distribution. Except for the illumination power and the random seed generation through a shallow encoder, these optical generative models do not consume computing power during the synthesis of novel images. We report the optical generation of monochrome and multi-color novel images of handwritten digits, fashion products, butterflies, and human faces, following the data distributions of MNIST, Fashion MNIST, Butterflies-100, and Celeb-A datasets, respectively, achieving an overall performance comparable to digital neural network-based generative models. To experimentally demonstrate optical generative models, we used visible light to generate, in a snapshot, novel images of handwritten digits and fashion products. These optical generative models might pave the way for energy-efficient, scalable and rapid inference tasks, further exploiting the potentials of optics and photonics for artificial intelligence-generated content.</description>

Abstract: An analytical method to characterise the farfield radiation pattern of a patch antenna embedded with a hybrid ground plane is presented using the Cavity Model. The hybrid ground plane is a two-layered structure with a Perfect Magnetic Conductor (PMC) stacked on top of a Perfect Electric Conductor (PEC) separated by a small distance. The model predicts an increase in the antenna's directivity, which is validated through a full-wave simulation model by realising the PMC surface through an Artificial Magnetic Conductor (AMC) which is embedded into the patch antenna's substrate.</description>

Abstract: Optical lattices serve as fundamental building blocks for atomic quantum technology. However, the scale and resolution of these lattices are diffraction-limited to the light wavelength. In conventional lattices, achieving tight confinement of single sites requires high laser intensity, which unfortunately leads to reduced coherence due to increased scattering. This article presents a novel approach for creating an atomic optical lattice with a sub-wavelength spatial structure. The potential is generated by leveraging the nonlinear optical response of three-level Rydberg-dressed atoms, which allows us to overcome the diffraction limit of the driving fields. The resulting lattice comprises a three-dimensional array of ultra-narrow Lorentzian wells over nanometer scales. These unprecedented scales can now be accessed through a hybrid scheme that combines the dipolar interaction and optical twist of atomic eigenstates. The interaction-induced two-body resonance that forms the trapping potential, only occurs at a peculiar laser intensity, localizing the trap sites to ultra-narrow regions over the standing-wave driving field. The feasibility study shows that single-atom confinement in Lorentzian sites with 3nm width, and 37MHz depth are realizable with available lasers. The development of these ultra-narrow trapping techniques holds great promise for applications such as Rydberg-Fermi gates, atomtronics, quantum walks, Hubbard models, and neutral-atom quantum simulation.</description>

      <title>Trapping light in air with membrane metasurfaces for vibrational strong coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17901v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optical metasurfaces can manipulate electromagnetic waves in unprecedented ways at ultra-thin engineered interfaces. Specifically, in the mid-infrared (mid-IR) region, metasurfaces have enabled numerous biochemical sensing, spectroscopy, and vibrational strong coupling (VSC) applications via enhanced light-matter interactions in resonant cavities. However, mid-IR metasurfaces are usually fabricated on solid supporting substrates, which degrade resonance quality factors (Q) and hinder efficient sample access to the near-field electromagnetic hotspots. Besides, typical IR-transparent substrate materials with low refractive indices, such as CaF2, NaCl, KBr, and ZnSe, are usually either water-soluble, expensive, or not compatible with low-cost mass manufacturing processes. Here, we present novel free-standing Si-membrane mid-IR metasurfaces with strong light-trapping capabilities in accessible air voids. We employ the Brillouin zone folding technique to excite tunable, high-Q quasi-bound states in the continuum (q-BIC) resonances with our highest measured Q-factor of 722. Leveraging the strong field localizations in accessible air cavities, we demonstrate VSC with multiple quantities of PMMA molecules and the q-BIC modes at various detuning frequencies. Our new approach of fabricating mid-IR metasurfaces into semiconductor membranes enables scalable manufacturing of mid-IR photonic devices and provides exciting opportunities for quantum-coherent light-matter interactions, biochemical sensing, and polaritonic chemistry.</description>

      <title>Magnetic metamaterials by ion-implantation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10433v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a method for the additive fabrication of planar magnetic nanoarrays with minimal surface roughness. Synthesis is accomplished by combining electron-beam lithography, used to generate nanometric patterned masks, with ion implantation in thin films. By implanting $^{56}$Fe$^{+}$ ions, we are able to introduce magnetic functionality in a controlled manner into continuous Pd thin films, achieving 3D spatial resolution down to a few tens of nanometers. Our results demonstrate the application of this technique in fabricating square artificial spin ice lattices, which exhibit well-defined magnetization textures and interactions among the patterned magnetic elements.</description>

      <title>Analytic model of stable shock-like structures in laser interaction with underdense plasma for identifying of phase and polarization dependent regime of laser wakefield accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06532v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an analytical model describing a stable shock-like structure that is formed when an ultra-intense laser propagates through an underdense plasma. It is shown that such structures exist in a wide range of laser-plasma parameters, with a unique sub-luminal shock front velocity for each parameter. Numerical methods to accurately describe such shock-front is developed. The formalism is applied to describe the parameter space in which the Carrier-Envelope-Phase (CEP) effect under which phase and polarization dependent super-ponderomotive effects becomes significant. The developed formalism will enable quick identification of regimes in which CEP effects become significant, expediting designing of Laser Wakefield Accelerators operating in the superponderomotive regime.</description>
