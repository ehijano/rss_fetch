      <title>Agentic Digital Twins: A Taxonomy of Capabilities for Understanding Possible Futures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As digital twins (DTs) evolve to become more agentic through the integration of artificial intelligence (AI), they acquire capabilities that extend beyond dynamic representation of their target systems. This paper presents a taxonomy of agentic DTs organised around three fundamental dimensions: the locus of agency (external, internal, distributed), the tightness of coupling (loose, tight, constitutive), and model evolution (static, adaptive, reconstructive). From the resulting 27-configuration space, we identify nine illustrative configurations grouped into three clusters: "The Present" (existing tools and emerging steering systems), "The Threshold" (where emergent properties appear and coupling becomes constitutive), and "The Frontier" (where systems gain reconstructive capabilities).
  Our analysis explores how agentic DTs exercise performative power--not merely representing physical systems but actively participating in constituting them. Using traffic navigation systems as examples, we show how even passive tools can exhibit emergent performativity, while advanced configurations risk performative lock-in. Drawing on performative prediction theory, we trace a progression from passive tools through active steering to ontological reconstruction, examining how constitutive coupling enables systems to create self-validating realities. Understanding these configurations is essential for navigating the transformation from DTs as mirror worlds to DTs as architects of new ontologies.</description>

      <title>AI-Powered Augmented Reality as a Threat Vector for Human Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Augmented Reality (AR) is a powerful perceptual technology that can alter what users see, hear, feel, and experience throughout their daily lives. When combined with the speed and flexibility of context-aware generative AI, the power is greatly expanded, allowing individual users to be targeted with custom-generated AR experiences that are instantly tailored to who they are, where they are, and what they are doing. This can transform the physical world into a magical place, but only if the augmentation of a user's environment is enacted for their personal benefit and best interests. Instead, if AI-powered AR systems are controlled by unregulated third parties, such as large corporations or state actors, individually adaptive AR experiences could be deployed as a dangerous form of targeted influence. In fact, if the industry adopts an advertising business model for AI-powered AR devices, context-aware generative influence could become a widely used manipulative path for promotion of products and services in the physical world. Worse, similar techniques could be used for political influence, propaganda, and disinformation. This chapter reviews the power and flexibility of AI-generated augmented reality, explores the risks that emerge when used for persuasion, manipulation, or influence, and proposes policy directions to mitigate these risks.</description>

      <title>Who's in Charge? Disempowerment Patterns in Real-World LLM Usage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although AI assistants are now deeply embedded in society, there has been limited empirical study of how their usage affects human empowerment. We present the first large-scale empirical analysis of disempowerment patterns in real-world AI assistant interactions, analyzing 1.5 million consumer Claude$.$ai conversations using a privacy-preserving approach. We focus on situational disempowerment potential, which occurs when AI assistant interactions risk leading users to form distorted perceptions of reality, make inauthentic value judgments, or act in ways misaligned with their values. Quantitatively, we find that severe forms of disempowerment potential occur in fewer than one in a thousand conversations, though rates are substantially higher in personal domains like relationships and lifestyle. Qualitatively, we uncover several concerning patterns, such as validation of persecution narratives and grandiose identities with emphatic sycophantic language, definitive moral judgments about third parties, and complete scripting of value-laden personal communications that users appear to implement verbatim. Analysis of historical trends reveals an increase in the prevalence of disempowerment potential over time. We also find that interactions with greater disempowerment potential receive higher user approval ratings, possibly suggesting a tension between short-term user preferences and long-term human empowerment. Our findings highlight the need for AI systems designed to robustly support human autonomy and flourishing.</description>

      <title>Modeling Behavioral Signals in Job Scams: A Human-Centered Security Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Job scams have emerged as a rapidly growing form of cybercrime that manipulates human decision-making processes. Existing countermeasures primarily focus on scam typologies or post-loss indicators, offering limited support for early-stage intervention. In this study, we examine how behavioral decision signals can be operationalized as computational features for identifying vulnerability-associated signals in job fraud. Using anonymous survey data collected from a university population, we analyze two dominant job scam pathways: payment-based scams that require upfront fees and task-based scams that begin with small rewards before escalating to financial demands. Drawing on behavioral economics, we operationalize sunk cost influence, urgency/time-pressure cues, and social proof as measurable behavioral signals, and analyze their association with payment behavior using exact inference under sparsity and uncertainty-aware estimation, with social proof treated as a context-dependent legitimacy cue rather than a standalone predictor. Our results show that urgency/time-pressure cues are significantly associated with payment behavior, consistent with their role as proximal compliance triggers during escalation. In contrast, opportunity-loss/FOMO cues were not reliably identifiable under the current operationalization in our encounter subset, highlighting the importance of measurement fidelity and cue-definition consistency. We further observe that emotional tone in victim narratives and selective non-response to sensitive questions vary systematically with financial loss and reporting behavior, suggesting that missingness may reflect a combination of survey fatigue and selective non-disclosure for sensitive items rather than purely random noise.</description>

      <title>XR Design Framework for Early Childhood Education</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extended Reality in early childhood education presents high-risk challenges due to children's rapid developmental changes. While augmented and virtual reality offer immersive pedagogical benefits, they often impose excessive cognitive load or sensory conflict. We introduce the Augmented Human Development (AHD) framework to model these interactions through cognitive, sensory, environmental, and developmental parameters. To ground this framework, we conducted a Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) of 111 peer-reviewed studies involving children aged 3 - 8. Our findings, interpreted through the AHD lens, reveal a critical "risk vs. attention gap," where high-impact safety and security risks remain under-researched compared to short-term pedagogical gains.</description>

      <title>Teaching Machine Learning Fundamentals with LEGO Robotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19376v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the web-based platform Machine Learning with Bricks and an accompanying two-day course designed to teach machine learning concepts to students aged 12 to 17 through programming-free robotics activities. Machine Learning with Bricks is an open source platform and combines interactive visualizations with LEGO robotics to teach three core algorithms: KNN, linear regression, and Q-learning. Students learn by collecting data, training models, and interacting with robots via a web-based interface. Pre- and post-surveys with 14 students demonstrate significant improvements in conceptual understanding of machine learning algorithms, positive shifts in AI perception, high platform usability, and increased motivation for continued learning. This work demonstrates that tangible, visualization-based approaches can make machine learning concepts accessible and engaging for young learners while maintaining technical depth. The platform is freely available at https://learning-and-dynamics.github.io/ml-with-bricks/, with video tutorials guiding students through the experiments at https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLx1grFu4zAcwfKKJZ1Ux4LwRqaePCOA2J.</description>

      <title>Reimagining Peer Review Process Through Multi-Agent Mechanism Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The software engineering research community faces a systemic crisis: peer review is failing under growing submissions, misaligned incentives, and reviewer fatigue. Community surveys reveal that researchers perceive the process as "broken." This position paper argues that these dysfunctions are mechanism design failures amenable to computational solutions. We propose modeling the research community as a stochastic multi-agent system and applying multi-agent reinforcement learning to design incentive-compatible protocols. We outline three interventions: a credit-based submission economy, MARL-optimized reviewer assignment, and hybrid verification of review consistency. We present threat models, equity considerations, and phased pilot metrics. This vision charts a research agenda toward sustainable peer review.</description>

      <title>Abundance and Economic diversity as a descriptor of cities' economic complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intricate interactions among firms, institutions, and spatial structures shape urban economic systems. In this study, we propose a framework based on three structural dimensions -- abundance, diversity, and longevity (ADL) of economic units -- as proxies of urban economic complexity and resilience. Using a decade of georeferenced firm-level data from Mexico City, we analyze the relationships among ADL variables using regression, spatial correlation, and time-series clustering. Our results reveal nonlinear dynamics across urban space, with powerlaw behavior in central zones and logarithmic saturation in peripheral areas, suggesting differentiated growth regimes. Notably, firm longevity modulates the relationship between abundance and diversity, particularly in periurban transition zones. These spatial patterns point to an emerging polycentric restructuring within a traditionally monocentric metropolis. By integrating economic complexity theory with spatial analysis, our approach provides a scalable method to assess the adaptive capacity of urban economies. This has implications for understanding informality, designing inclusive urban policies, and navigating structural transitions in rapidly urbanizing regions.</description>

      <title>Self-Sovereign Identity and eIDAS 2.0: An Analysis of Control, Privacy, and Legal Implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: European digital identity initiatives are grounded in regulatory frameworks designed to ensure interoperability and robust, harmonized security standards. The evolution of these frameworks culminates in eIDAS 2.0, whose origins trace back to the Electronic Signatures Directive 1999/93/EC, the first EU-wide legal foundation for the use of electronic signatures in cross-border electronic transactions. As technological capabilities advanced, the initial eIDAS 1.0 framework was increasingly criticized for its limitations and lack of comprehensiveness. Emerging decentralized approaches further exposed these shortcomings and introduced the possibility of integrating innovative identity paradigms, such as Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) models.
  In this article, we analyse key provisions of the eIDAS 2.0 Regulation and its accompanying recitals, drawing on existing literature to identify legislative gaps and implementation challenges. Furthermore, we examine the European Digital Identity Architecture and Reference Framework (ARF), assessing its proposed guidelines and evaluating the extent to which its emerging implementations align with SSI principles.</description>

      <title>AI Cap-and-Trade: Efficiency Incentives for Accessibility and Sustainability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The race for artificial intelligence (AI) dominance often prioritizes scale over efficiency. Hyper-scaling is the common industry approach: larger models, more data, and as many computational resources as possible. Using more resources is a simpler path to improved AI performance. Thus, efficiency has been de-emphasized. Consequently, the need for costly computational resources has marginalized academics and smaller companies. Simultaneously, increased energy expenditure, due to growing AI use, has led to mounting environmental costs. In response to accessibility and sustainability concerns, we argue for research into, and implementation of, market-based methods that incentivize AI efficiency. We believe that incentivizing efficient operations and approaches will reduce emissions while opening new opportunities for academics and smaller companies. As a call to action, we propose a cap-and-trade system for AI. Our system provably reduces computations for AI deployment, thereby lowering emissions and monetizing efficiency to the benefit of of academics and smaller companies.</description>

      <title>"Not in My Backyard": LLMs Uncover Online and Offline Social Biases Against Homelessnes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13187v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Homelessness is a persistent social challenge, impacting millions worldwide. Over 876,000 people experienced homelessness (PEH) in the U.S. in 2025. Social bias is a significant barrier to alleviation, shaping public perception and influencing policymaking. Given that online textual media and offline city council discourse reflect and influence part of public opinion, it provides valuable insights to identify and track social biases against PEH. We present a new, manually-annotated multi-domain dataset compiled from Reddit, X (formerly Twitter), news articles, and city council meeting minutes across ten U.S. cities. Our 16-category multi-label taxonomy creates a challenging long-tail classification problem: some categories appear in less than 1% of samples, while others exceed 70%. We find that small human-annotated datasets (1,702 samples) are insufficient for training effective classifiers, whether used to fine-tune encoder models or as few-shot examples for LLMs. To address this, we use GPT-4.1 to generate pseudo-labels on a larger unlabeled corpus. Training on this expanded dataset enables even small encoder models (ModernBERT, 150M parameters) to achieve 35.23 macro-F1, approaching GPT-4.1's 41.57. This demonstrates that \textbf{data quantity matters more than model size}, enabling low-cost, privacy-preserving deployment without relying on commercial APIs. Our results reveal that negative bias against PEH is prevalent both offline and online (especially on Reddit), with "not in my backyard" narratives showing the highest engagement. These findings uncover a type of ostracism that directly impacts poverty-reduction policymaking and provide actionable insights for practitioners addressing homelessness.</description>

      <title>Frontier AI Auditing: Toward Rigorous Third-Party Assessment of Safety and Security Practices at Leading AI Companies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11699v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Frontier AI is becoming critical societal infrastructure, but outsiders lack reliable ways to judge whether leading developers' safety and security claims are accurate and whether their practices meet relevant standards. Compared to other social and technological systems we rely on daily such as consumer products, corporate financial statements, and food supply chains, AI is subject to less rigorous third-party scrutiny along several dimensions. Ambiguity about whether AI systems are trustworthy can discourage deployment in some contexts where the technology could be beneficial, and make it more likely when it's dangerous. Public transparency alone cannot close this gap: many safety- and security-relevant details are legitimately confidential and require expert interpretation. We define frontier AI auditing as rigorous third-party verification of frontier AI developers' safety and security claims, and evaluation of their systems and practices against relevant standards, based on deep, secure access to non-public information. To make rigor legible and comparable, we introduce AI Assurance Levels (AAL-1 to AAL-4), ranging from time-bounded system audits to continuous, deception-resilient verification.</description>

      <title>AI-generated data contamination erodes pathological variability and diagnostic reliability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12946v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly populating medical records with synthetic content, creating a feedback loop where future models are increasingly at risk of training on uncurated AI-generated data. However, the clinical consequences of this AI-generated data contamination remain unexplored. Here, we show that in the absence of mandatory human verification, this self-referential cycle drives a rapid erosion of pathological variability and diagnostic reliability. By analysing more than 800,000 synthetic data points across clinical text generation, vision-language reporting, and medical image synthesis, we find that models progressively converge toward generic phenotypes regardless of the model architecture. Specifically, rare but critical findings, including pneumothorax and effusions, vanish from the synthetic content generated by AI models, while demographic representations skew heavily toward middle-aged male phenotypes. Crucially, this degradation is masked by false diagnostic confidence; models continue to issue reassuring reports while failing to detect life-threatening pathology, with false reassurance rates tripling to 40%. Blinded physician evaluation confirms that this decoupling of confidence and accuracy renders AI-generated documentation clinically useless after just two generations. We systematically evaluate three mitigation strategies, finding that while synthetic volume scaling fails to prevent collapse, mixing real data with quality-aware filtering effectively preserves diversity. Ultimately, our results suggest that without policy-mandated human oversight, the deployment of generative AI threatens to degrade the very healthcare data ecosystems it relies upon.</description>

Abstract: Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a disruptive innovation in medicine, yet its adoption within gastroenterology remains limited and poorly characterized. We aimed to examine knowledge, practical applications, perceived barriers, and expectations regarding AI among gastroenterology specialists in Spain. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional observational study using a structured online survey distributed by the Spanish Society of Digestive Pathology (SEPD) in 2025. The questionnaire collected sociodemographic data, patterns of AI use, perceptions, and educational needs. Descriptive statistics and multivariable models were applied. Results: Among 283 respondents (mean age 44.6 +/- 9.7 years), 87.5% acknowledged AI as a transformative tool, but only 60.2% (95% CI: 54.3-66.1%) reported using it, mostly outside institutional frameworks. Notably, 80.2% of users initiated AI use within the past year. Independent predictors of frequent use included previous training (OR=2.44), employment in university hospitals (OR=2.14), and younger age (OR=1.36 per 5-year decrease). Main barriers were lack of training (61%), absence of institutional strategies (46%), and ethical concerns (50%). While 93.8% agreed that AI training programmes are necessary, only 18.4% had received formal training. Conclusions: A substantial gap exists between the favorable perception of AI and its actual integration into clinical practice within Spanish gastroenterology. The rapid adoption outside institutional frameworks underscores the urgent need for accredited training programmes and governance standards led by scientific societies.</description>

      <title>Meaning Is Not A Metric: Using LLMs to make cultural context legible at scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23785v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This position paper argues that large language models (LLMs) can make cultural context, and therefore human meaning, legible at an unprecedented scale in AI-based sociotechnical systems. We argue that such systems have previously been unable to represent human meaning because they rely on thin descriptions (numerical representations that enforce standardization and therefore strip human activity of the cultural context which gives it meaning). By contrast, scholars in the humanities and qualitative social sciences have developed frameworks for representing meaning through thick description (verbal representations that accommodate heterogeneity and retain contextual information needed to represent human meaning). The verbal capabilities of LLMs now provide a means of at least partially automating the generation and processing of thick descriptions, offering new ways to deploy them at scale. We argue that the problem of rendering human meaning legible is not just about selecting better metrics but about developing new representational formats based on thick description. We frame this as a crucial direction for the application of generative AI and identify five key challenges: preserving context, maintaining interpretive pluralism, integrating perspectives based on lived experience and critical distance, distinguishing qualitative content from quantitative magnitude, and acknowledging meaning as dynamic rather than static.</description>

      <title>Assessing metadata privacy in neuroimaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15278v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ethical and legal imperative to share research data without causing harm requires careful attention to privacy risks. While mounting evidence demonstrates that data sharing benefits science, legitimate concerns persist regarding the potential leakage of personal information that could lead to reidentification and subsequent harm. We reviewed metadata accompanying neuroimaging datasets from heterogeneous studies openly available on OpenNeuro, involving participants across the lifespan, from children to older adults, with and without clinical diagnoses, and including associated clinical score data. Using metaprivBIDS (https://github.com/CPernet/metaprivBIDS), a software application for BIDS compliant tsv/json files that computes and reports different privacy metrics (k-anonymity, k-global, l-diversity, SUDA, PIF), we found that privacy is generally well maintained, with serious vulnerabilities being rare. Nonetheless, issues were identified in nearly all datasets and warrant mitigation. Notably, clinical score data (e.g., neuropsychological results) posed minimal reidentification risk, whereas demographic variables: age, sex assigned at birth, sexual orientations, race, income, and geolocation, represented the principal privacy vulnerabilities. We outline practical measures to address these risks, enabling safer data sharing practices.</description>

      <title>DSSmoothing: Toward Certified Dataset Ownership Verification for Pre-trained Language Models via Dual-Space Smoothing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15303v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large web-scale datasets have driven the rapid advancement of pre-trained language models (PLMs), but unauthorized data usage has raised serious copyright concerns. Existing dataset ownership verification (DOV) methods typically assume that watermarks remain stable during inference; however, this assumption often fails under natural noise and adversary-crafted perturbations. We propose the first certified dataset ownership verification method for PLMs under a gray-box setting (i.e., the defender can only query the suspicious model but is aware of its input representation module), based on dual-space smoothing (i.e., DSSmoothing). To address the challenges of text discreteness and semantic sensitivity, DSSmoothing introduces continuous perturbations in the embedding space to capture semantic robustness and applies controlled token reordering in the permutation space to capture sequential robustness. DSSmoothing consists of two stages: in the first stage, triggers are collaboratively embedded in both spaces to generate norm-constrained and robust watermarked datasets; in the second stage, randomized smoothing is applied in both spaces during verification to compute the watermark robustness (WR) of suspicious models and statistically compare it with the principal probability (PP) values of a set of benign models. Theoretically, DSSmoothing provides provable robustness guarantees for dataset ownership verification by ensuring that WR consistently exceeds PP under bounded dual-space perturbations. Extensive experiments on multiple representative web datasets demonstrate that DSSmoothing achieves stable and reliable verification performance and exhibits robustness against potential adaptive attacks. Our code is available at https://github.com/NcepuQiaoTing/DSSmoothing.</description>

      <title>Prompt-Counterfactual Explanations for Generative AI System Behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03156v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As generative AI systems become integrated into real-world applications, organizations increasingly need to be able to understand and interpret their behavior. In particular, decision-makers need to understand what causes generative AI systems to exhibit specific output characteristics. Within this general topic, this paper examines a key question: what is it about the input -- the prompt -- that causes an LLM-based generative AI system to produce output that exhibits specific characteristics, such as toxicity, negative sentiment, or political bias. To examine this question, we adapt a common technique from the Explainable AI literature: counterfactual explanations. We explain why traditional counterfactual explanations cannot be applied directly to generative AI systems, due to several differences in how generative AI systems function. We then propose a flexible framework that adapts counterfactual explanations to non-deterministic, generative AI systems in scenarios where downstream classifiers can reveal key characteristics of their outputs. Based on this framework, we introduce an algorithm for generating prompt-counterfactual explanations (PCEs). Finally, we demonstrate the production of counterfactual explanations for generative AI systems with three case studies, examining different output characteristics (viz., political leaning, toxicity, and sentiment). The case studies further show that PCEs can streamline prompt engineering to suppress undesirable output characteristics and can enhance red-teaming efforts to uncover additional prompts that elicit undesirable outputs. Ultimately, this work lays a foundation for prompt-focused interpretability in generative AI: a capability that will become indispensable as these models are entrusted with higher-stakes tasks and subject to emerging regulatory requirements for transparency and accountability.</description>

      <title>Do LLMs Give Good Romantic Relationship Advice? A Study on User Satisfaction and Attitude Change</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11527v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being used to provide support and advice in personal domains such as romantic relationships, yet little is known about user perceptions of this type of advice. This study investigated how people evaluate advice on LLM-generated romantic relationships. Participants rated advice satisfaction, model reliability, and helpfulness, and completed pre- and post-measures of their general attitudes toward LLMs. Overall, the results showed participants' high satisfaction with LLM-generated advice. Greater satisfaction was, in turn, strongly and positively associated with their perceptions of the models' reliability and helpfulness. Importantly, participants' attitudes toward LLMs improved significantly after exposure to the advice, suggesting that supportive and contextually relevant advice can enhance users' trust and openness toward these AI systems.</description>
