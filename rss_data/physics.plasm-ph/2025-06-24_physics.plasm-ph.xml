      <title>Modeling helium compression and enrichment in DIII-D edge plasmas using the SOLPS-ITER code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient removal of helium ash is a critical requirement for the operation of fusion power plants, as its accumulation can dilute the core fuel and degrade plasma performance. While past studies suggested that helium exhaust in burning plasmas could be managed effectively through divertor optimization and conventional cryopumping, a detailed understanding of helium behavior in the edge and divertor plasma remains limited, as helium transport through the edge plasma is complex and fundamentally different from other impurity species. With the emergence of more sophisticated numerical modeling tools and renewed focus on D-T burning plasmas, revisiting helium transport in current magnetic confinement devices is necessary for planning and designing fusion pilot plants. This study uses SOLPS-ITER to model a helium-seeded discharge from the DIII-D tokamak, analyzing the transport, recycling, and enrichment of helium in the divertor. In addition to characterizing helium dynamics, the results are interpreted in terms of the Tritium Burn Efficiency (TBE), a recently proposed metric linking helium exhaust fraction to tritium fuel utilization in steady-state burning plasmas. By assessing the compatibility of TBE assumptions with detailed edge plasma simulations, this work provides insight into the practical viability of TBE as a reactor design and performance metric.</description>

      <title>A class of high-beta, large-aspect-ratio quasiaxisymmetric Palumbo-like configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The space of high-beta, approximately quasiaxisymmetric, large-aspect-ratio stellarator configurations is explored using an inverse coordinate approach and a quadratic polynomial ansatz for the flux function, following the method of Palumbo, extended by Hernandes and Clemente. This approach yields a system of nonlinear ODEs that, when solved, give equilibria exhibiting positive or negative triangularity, cusps, and (in an extreme limit) current singularities. It is shown that a cubic ansatz may also be used, but that polynomials of degree four or higher will lead to overdetermination.</description>

      <title>Particle-in-cell simulations of plasma wakefield formation in microwave waveguides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The acceleration of charged particles is fundamental not only for experimental studies in particle physics but also for applications in fields such as semiconductor manufacturing and medical therapies. However, conventional accelerators face limitations due to their large size, driven by low acceleration gradients. Plasma-based accelerators have emerged as a promising alternative, offering ultrahigh acceleration gradients, though their implementation is often limited by the need for high-intensity, femtosecond laser systems and sophisticated diagnostics. As a more accessible alternative, the use of microwave pulses to excite plasma wakefields in waveguides filled with low-density plasma has gained attention. In this study, we perform three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations to investigate the formation and structure of electrostatic wakefields driven by short microwave pulses in rectangular plasma waveguides. The results establish a theoretical basis for evaluating the feasibility and potential applications of microwave-driven plasma acceleration schemes.</description>

      <title>Observation of laser plasma accelerated electrons with transverse momentum spread below the thermal level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving high-quality electron beams from laser-plasma accelerators critically relies on density tailoring to control electron dynamics during injection, acceleration, and extraction. We report on the experimental observation of electron beam acceleration and 3D shaping, in transverse momentum and longitudinal phase space, controlled by plasma density tailoring in a gas cell. It leads to relativistic electron beams with a transverse momentum spread of 0.2 mec, below the thermal level imprinted by the process of ionization injection in a laser-driven wakefield accelerator. These beams have a charge of 40 pC at an energy of 190 MeV with 1.9% energy spread and an rms divergence of 0.54 mrad, resulting in single-peak spectra with a brightness of up to 8 pC/MeV/mrad. Using numerical simulations, we show that the decrease in transverse momentum spread starts in the downramp and continues in a 10 mm long plasma tail at the exit of the gas cell, where it is accompanied by energy dechirping.</description>

      <title>Spatial, Spectral and Temporal Response of High Intensity Laser Plasma Mirrors- Direct Observation of the Ponderomotive Push</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18425v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plasma-based optics have emerged as a powerful platform for manipulating and amplifying ultra-intense laser pulses. However, the inherently nonlinear and dynamic nature of plasma leads to significant spatial, spectral, and temporal modulations when driven at relativistic intensities. These modifications can dramatically alter the structure of the reflected laser pulses, posing challenges for their use in applications such as vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) and X-ray generation, as well as relativistic particle acceleration. Comprehensive, multidimensional diagnostics are essential to accurately characterize these so-called `plasma mirrors' (PMs). We present a direct, \textit{in situ} measurement of the three-dimensional plasma surface evolution during femtosecond laser irradiation, achieved through simultaneous analysis of the wavefront, spectrum, and temporal profile of the reflected light. Our measurements reveal surface deformations on the order of a few hundred nanometers at relativistic intensities, in agreement with three-dimensional particle-in-cell (3D-PIC) simulations. Additionally, the PM induces substantial modifications to the pulse spectrum and temporal profile, introducing spatio-temporal couplings.</description>

      <title>Polarization ratios of turbulent Langmuir/$\mathcal{Z}$-mode waves generated by electron beams in magnetized solar wind plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The polarization ratios $F=|E_\perp|^2/|E|^2$ of beam-generated turbulent Langmuir/$\mathcal{Z}$-mode ($\mathcal{LZ}$) waves and electromagnetic emissions radiated at plasma frequency $\omega_p$ by such sources are studied in weakly magnetized and randomly inhomogeneous plasmas owing to large-scale and long-term 2D/3V Particle-In-Cell simulations with parameters relevant to type III solar radio bursts. Statistical studies using waveforms recorded by virtual satellites are performed to determine the distributions of polarization ratios as a function of beam and plasma parameters. This efficient method, which mimics waveform recording by spacecraft in the solar wind, leads to results consistent with observations. Moreover, plasma random density fluctuations $\delta n$ turn out to be the key factor responsible for the increase in polarization ratios up to $F\simeq 1$. Indeed, it is demonstrated that linear mode conversion at constant frequency of $\mathcal{LZ}$ waves scattering on $\delta n$ is the most efficient and fast process to produce large polarization ratios in randomly inhomogeneous plasmas, due to electromagnetic slow extraordinary $\mathcal Z$-mode wave emission by $\mathcal{LZ}$ wave turbulence. Results provide guidance to theoretical studies and useful support to estimate the average level of density fluctuations $\Delta N$ in solar wind plasmas.</description>

      <title>Simulating ultrarelativistic beam-plasma instabilities with a quasistatic particle-in-cell code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasistatic particle-in-cell (PIC) codes are increasingly employed to study laser or plasma wakefield accelerators. By decoupling the slow dynamics of the driver (a laser or ultrarelativistic particle beam) from the fast plasma response, these codes can reduce the computational time by several orders of magnitude compared to conventional PIC codes. In this work, we demonstrate that quasistatic PIC codes can also be utilized to investigate relativistic beam-plasma instabilities, with a focus on the oblique two-stream instability (OTSI). For this purpose, we have developed a 2D quasistatic PIC code, QuaSSis, based on a new numerical scheme that can handle transversely periodic boundary conditions, a capability absent in previous quasistatic codes. The accuracy of QuaSSis is benchmarked first against standard PIC simulations performed with the CALDER code, and then against an analytical spatiotemporal model of the OTSI. Physically, this instability grows exponentially from initial fluctuations in the particle charge or current densities. Since the numerical noise inherent to PIC simulations can mimic these fluctuations to some extent, its control is crucial to seed the beam-plasma instability at the desired amplitude. Common methods for tuning this noise involve modifying the resolution or adding filters, but these can be computationally costly when aiming at very low noise levels. Here, we show that this noise can be finely controlled by properly initializing the positions and weights of the macroparticles.</description>

      <title>External charged debris in a flowing plasma : charge fluctuation induced complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the response of a flowing e-i plasma to embedded external charged debris, focusing on the periodic debris charge fluctuations that can trigger complex phenomena such as chaos and nonlinear Landau damping. We employ both kinetic and fluid simulations to analyse the plasma response to the time-dependent debris charge. Our findings indicate that the nature of the nonlinear response can be considerably different for fluctuating positively charged external debris from negatively charged debris. The simulations show that the debris charge fluctuation causes damping of the ion-acoustic wave as the debris velocity nears the ion-acoustic speed through nonlinear Landau damping and wave-wave interactions. We also present a theoretical framework to support the simulation findings. Our findings provide critical insights into debris-plasma interactions, which may be useful in applications involving space debris management.</description>

      <title>Flux-driven turbulent transport using penalisation in the Hasegawa-Wakatani system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: First numerical results from the newly-developed pseudo-spectral code P-FLARE (Penalised FLux-driven Algorithm for REduced models) are presented. This flux-driven turbulence/transport code uses a pseudo-spectral formulation with the penalisation method in order to impose radial boundary conditions. Its concise, flexible structure allows implementing various two dimensional reduced fluid models in flux-driven formulation. Here, results from simulations of the modified Hasegawa-Wakatani system are discussed, where particle transport and zonal flow formation, together with profile relaxation, are studied. It is shown that coupled spreading/profile relaxation that one obtains for this system is consistent with a simple one dimensional model of coupled spreading/transport equations. Then, the effect of a source of density is investigated, which results in the observation of sandpile-like critical behaviour. The model displays profile stiffness for certain parameters, with very different input fluxes resulting in very similar mean density gradients. This is due to different zonal flow levels around the critical value for the control parameter (i.e. the ratio of the adiabaticity parameter to the mean gradient) and the existence for this system of a hysteresis loop for the transition from 2D turbulence to a zonal flow dominated state.</description>

      <title>Structure and dynamics of finite three-dimensional Yukawa clusters in complex plasmas : Newtonian versus Langevin Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The structure and dynamics of a harmonically confined three dimensional finite dust cluster are investigated via both Langevin Dynamics (LD) and frictionless Molecular Dynamics (fMD) simulation. The static structure of the system is analyzed through the Radial Distribution Function, Center-two-particle correlation function(C2P) and angular correlation function. The intra-shell angular correlation, Radial Distribution Function and C2P remains largely unaffected by the dynamics employed. However, the inter-shell angular correlation exhibits sharp peaks at irregular angular intervals in fMD which are not seen in LD indicating strongly correlated motion of the two spherical shells in the cluster in fMD. The single particle dynamics of the cluster is characterized by the Van - Hove self autocorrelation function and Mean Squared Displacement (MSD). Notably, the Van - Hove autocorrelation function in fMD simulations exhibits narrower width and higher peak height as compared to the LD simulations, suggesting greater particle mobility in LD. Trajectory analysis reveals a rotational motion of the particles about a common axis in fMD which disappears with progressively increasing friction coefficient. We show that the disappearance of rotational motion with the introduction of neutral friction in the dynamics is due to the much faster relaxation of the interparticle distance as well as interparticle angular separation in LD as compared to fMD.</description>

      <title>Wave Topology in Hall MHD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hall Magnetohydrodynamics (HMHD) extends ideal MHD by incorporating the Hall effect via the induction equation, making it more accurate for describing plasma behavior at length scales below the ion skin depth. Despite its importance, a comprehensive description of the eigenmodes in HMHD has been lacking. In this work, we derive the complete spectrum and eigenvectors of HMHD waves and identify their underlying topological structure. We prove that the HMHD wave spectrum is homotopic to that of ideal MHD, consisting of three distinct branches: the slow magnetosonic-Hall waves, the shear Alfv\'en-Hall waves, and the fast magnetosonic-Hall waves, which continuously reduce to their ideal MHD counterparts in the limit of vanishing Hall parameter. Contrary to a recent claim, we find that HMHD does not admit any additional wave branches beyond those in ideal MHD. The key qualitative difference lies in the topological nature of the HMHD wave structure: it exhibits nontrivial topology characterized by a Weyl point-an isolated eigenmode degeneracy point-and associated nonzero Chern numbers of the eigenmode bundles over a 2-sphere in k-space surrounding the Weyl point.</description>

      <title>Two Types of $1/f$ Range in Solar Wind Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $1/f$ noise is a ubiquitous phenomenon in natural systems. Since the advent of space exploration, the $1/f$ range has been consistently observed in \textit{in situ} solar wind measurements throughout the heliosphere, sparking decades of debate regarding its origin. Recent Parker Solar Probe (PSP) observations near the Alfv\'en surface have revealed a systematic absence of the $1/f$ range in pristine solar wind, providing a unique opportunity to investigate its origin in solar wind turbulence. Despite numerous observations of the $1/f$ range at varying frequencies, no study has systematically examined its properties across different solar wind conditions. Here, we identify two distinct types of $1/f$ ranges in solar wind turbulence: the fast/Alfv\'enic wind type and the slow/mixed wind type. The fast/Alfv\'enic type appears to be an intrinsic feature of Alfv\'enic turbulence, while the slow/mixed type resembles classical flicker noise. For the fast/Alfv\'enic type, we find a near-perfect WKB evolution of the frequency-averaged fluctuation amplitude and an intriguing migration pattern in frequency space. For the slow/mixed type, we examine the solar cycle dependence of the $1/f$ noise using the OMNI-LRO dataset spanning solar cycles 22 to 25. We also analyze the autocorrelation function of the magnetic field vectors and identify a clear relationship between the $1/f$ range and the decline in correlation, as well as unexpected resonance peaks in the autocorrelation function.</description>

      <title>The effect of plasma-$\beta$ on the heating mechanisms during magnetic reconnection in partially ionized low solar atmosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We performed numerical simulations of magnetic reconnection with different strength of magnetic fields from the solar photosphere to the upper chromosphere. The main emphasis is to identify dominant mechanisms for heating plasmas in the reconnection region under different plasma-$\beta$ conditions in the partially ionized low solar atmosphere. The numerical results show that more plasmoids are generated in a lower $\beta$ reconnection event. The frequent coalescence of these plasmoids leads to a significant enhancement of turbulence and compression heating, which becomes the dominant mechanism for heating plasma in a lower plasma-$\beta$ reconnection process. The average power density of the compression heating (Q$_{comp}$) decreases with increasing initial plasma-$\beta$ as a power function: Q$_{comp} \sim \beta_{0}^{-a}$, where the value $a$ is $1.9$ in the photosphere and decreases to about 1.29 in the upper chromosphere. In the photosphere and lower chromosphere, the joule heating contributed by electron-neutral collisions Q$_{en}=\eta_{en} J^2$ eventually dominates over the compression heating when the initial plasma-$\beta$ is larger than the critical value $\beta_{0-critical} = 8$. In the upper chromosphere, the ambipolar diffusion heating and the viscous heating will become equally important as the compression heating when the initial plasma-$\beta$ is larger than the critical value $\beta_{0-critical} = 0.5$. These results indicate that the compression heating caused by turbulent reconnection mediated with plasmoids is likely the major heating mechanism for the small-scale reconnection events with stronger magnetic fields such as active region EBs and UV bursts. However, the heating caused by the partial ionization effects can not be ignored for those reconnection events with weaker magnetic fields such as quiet Sun EBs and cold surges.</description>

      <title>SF6 streamer breakdown induced by floating linear metal particles: Following streamers and side streamers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05307v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The electrical breakdown of SF6 in the presence of floating metal particles is facilitated by two key factors: the role of floating metal particles and the nonlinear breakdown behavior of high-pressure SF6. However, the microscopic transient processes remain unclear, motivating this paper. Using 2D fluid models, we investigate SF6 streamer breakdown induced by a floating linear metal particle under negative applied voltage. First, We identify a characteristic double-end streamer inception in the combined gap. Then, we propose the following streamer (FS) mechanism to explain the metal particle's role. Two following streamers, FS1 and FS2, arise from the interaction between space charge and metal particle. FS1 facilitates breakdown via the negative space charge field generated by its head. FS2 facilitates breakdown by merging with FS1, accelerating its propagation and enhancing the electric field at the primary streamer head. Finally, we propose the side streamer (SS) mechanism to explain the nonlinear breakdown behavior of high-pressure SF6. The SS is identified as a new forward ionization wave that develops along the sides of the primary streamer, due to photoionization-driven negative ion accumulation. SS facilitates breakdown by merging with the primary streamer, increasing negative space charge and leading to three distinct propagation modes. Higher pressure increases the production rate of negative ions along the streamer sides, making SS more likely to form. Under overvoltage, the facilitating effect of SS diminishes as the background field (E/N)b strengthens, disappearing when (E/N)b exceeds 245 Td. This study provides new insights into the SF6 streamer breakdown mechanisms induced by floating metal particles and offers theoretical references for further investigation on the quantitative characterization.</description>

      <title>Excitation of whistler and slow-X waves by runaway electrons in a collisional plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09233v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Runaway electrons are known to provide robust ideal or collisionless
  kinetic drive for plasma wave instabilities in both the whistler and
  slow-X branches, via the anomalous Doppler-shifted cyclotron
  resonances. In a cold and dense post-thermal-quench plasma,
  collisional damping of the plasma waves can be competitive with the
  collisionless drive. Previous studies have found that for its higher
  wavelength and frequency, slow-X waves suffer stronger collisional
  damping than the whistlers, while the ideal growth rate of slow-X
  modes is higher. Here we study runaway avalanche distributions that maintain the same eigen distribution and increase only in magnitude over time. The distributions are computed from the
  relativistic Fokker-Planck-Boltzmann solver, upon which a linear
  dispersion analysis is performed to search for the most unstable or
  least damped slow-X and whistler modes. Taking into account the
  effect of plasma density, plasma temperature, and effective charge
  number, we find that the slow-X modes tend to be excited before the
  whistlers in a runaway current ramp-up. Furthermore, even when the
  runaway current density is sufficiently high that both branches are
  excited, the most unstable slow-X mode has much higher growth rate
  than the most unstable whistler mode. The qualitative and
  quantitative trends uncovered in current study indicate that even
  though past experiments and modeling efforts have concentrated on whistler modes, there's a compelling case that slow-X modes should also be a key area of focus.</description>

      <title>Surfaces with Klein bottle topology occur in fusion reactor fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11883v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic confinement fusion devices, such as tokamaks and stellarators, are designed such that magnetic field lines lie in magnetic surfaces that form a foliation of nested genus-1 tori. The Poincar\'e-Hopf index theorem implies that only surfaces with genus 1 allow for vector fields that lie tangent to the surface and are smooth and nowhere-vanishing. It is often implicitly assumed that magnetic surfaces are always toroidal. This paper we show that surfaces with the topology of an immersed Klein bottle (the only other genus-1 compact surface) can also occur in fusion reactor fields.
  These surfaces occur around fixed points of the Poincar\'e map that are reflection-hyperbolic, and are spanned by the field lines that asymptotically approach and depart from this closed line. Configurations in which this occurs appear in the stellarator database QUASR, and have been described in literature in the context of abnormal satwooth crashes.</description>

      <title>Zones of Tayler Instability in Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08492v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Tayler instability (TI) of toroidal magnetic fields is a candidate mechanism for driving turbulence, angular momentum (AM) transport, and dynamo action in stellar radiative zones. Recently \cite{Skoutnev_2024} revisited the linear stability analysis of a toroidal magnetic field in a rotating and stably stratified fluid. In this paper, we extend the analysis to include both thermal and compositional stratification, allowing for general application to stars. We formulate an analytical instability criterion for use as a ``toggle switch" in stellar evolution codes. It determines when and where in a star the TI develops with a canonical growth rate as assumed in existing prescriptions for AM transport based on Tayler-Spruit dynamo. We implement such a ``toggle switch" in the MESA stellar evolution code and map out the stability of each mode of the TI on a grid of stellar evolution models. In evolved lower mass stars, the TI becomes suppressed in the compositionally stratified layer around the hydrogen burning shell. In higher mass stars, the TI can be active throughout their radiative zones, but at different wavenumbers than previously expected.</description>
