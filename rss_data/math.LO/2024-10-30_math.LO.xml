      <title>Effective weak convergence and tightness of measures in computable Polish spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prokhorov's Theorem in probability theory states that a family $\Gamma$ of probability measures on a Polish space is tight if and only if every sequence in $\Gamma$ has a weakly convergent subsequence. Due to the highly non-constructive nature of (relative) sequential compactness, however, the effective content of this theorem has not been studied. To this end, we generalize the effective notions of weak convergence of measures on the real line due to McNicholl and Rojas to computable Polish spaces. Then, we introduce an effective notion of tightness for families of measures on computable Polish spaces. Finally, we prove an effective version of Prokhorov's Theorem for computable sequences of probability measures.</description>

      <title>On equivalence relations induced by locally compact TSI Polish groups admitting open identity component</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a Polish group $G$, let $E(G)$ be the right coset equivalence relation $G^\omega/c(G)$, where $c(G)$ is the group of all convergent sequences in $G$.
  We prove a Rigid theorem on locally compact TSI Polish groups admitting open identity component, as follows: Let $G$ be a locally compact TSI Polish group such that $G_0$ is open in $G$, and let $H$ be a nontrivial pro-Lie TSI Polish group. Then $E(G)\leq_BE(H)$ iff there exists a continuous homomorphism $\phi:G_0\to H_0$ satisfying the following conditions: (i) $\ker(\phi)$ is non-archimedean; (ii) $\phi{\rm Inn}_G(G_0)\subseteq\overline{{\rm Inn}_H(H_0)\phi}$ under pointwise convergence topology.
  An application of the Rigid theorem yields a negative answer to Question 7.5 of [2].</description>

      <title>Hausdorff dimension and countable Borel equivalence relations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that if $E$ is a countable Borel equivalence relation on $\mathbb{R}^n$, then there is a closed subset $A \subset [0,1]^n$ of Hausdorff dimension $n$ so that $E \restriction A$ is smooth. More generally, if $\leq_Q$ is a locally countable Borel quasi-order on $2^{\omega}$ and $g$ is any gauge function of lower order than the identity, then there is a closed set $A$ so that $A$ is an antichain in $\leq_Q$ and $H^g(A) &gt; 0$.</description>

      <title>Reverse mathematics of regular countable second countable spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the reverse mathematics of characterization theorems of regular countable second countable spaces (or $CSCS$ for short). We prove that arithmetic comprehension is equivalent over $\textbf{RCA}_0$ to every $T_3$ $CSCS$ being metrizable, and we characterize the $T_3$ spaces which are metrizable over $\textbf{RCA}_0$. We show that Lynn's theorem for $CSCS$ can be carried out in $\textbf{ACA}_0$, namely that every zero dimensional separable space is homeomorphic to the order topology of a linear order. We also show that arithmetic comprehension is equivalent to every $T_2$ compact $CSCS$ being well-orderable. From general topology, we know that the locally compact $T_2$ $CSCS$ are the well-orderable $CSCS$, and that the $T_3$ scattered $CSCS$ are the completely metrizable $CSCS$. We show that these characterizations and a few others are equivalent to arithmetic transfinite recursion over $\textbf{RCA}_0$. We also find a few statments that are equivalent to $\Pi^1_1$ comprehension. In particular we show that every $T_3$ $CSCS$ has a Cantor Bendixson rank and that every $T_3$ $CSCS$ is the disjoint union of a scattered space and dense in itself space are equivalent to $\Pi^1_1$ comprehension over $\textbf{RCA}_0$.</description>

      <title>Minimal operations over permutation groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We classify the possible types of minimal operations above an arbitrary permutation group. Above the trivial group, a theorem of Rosenberg yields that there are five types of minimal operations. We show that above any non-trivial permutation group there are at most four such types. Indeed, except above Boolean groups acting freely on a set, there are only three. In particular, this is the case for oligomorphic permutation groups, for which we improve a result of Bodirsky and Chen by showing one of the types in their classification does not exist. Building on these results, we answer three questions of Bodirsky that were previously open.</description>

      <title>A Testable and Progressive Axiom Set for 2-Dimensional Euclidean Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.11333v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper shows that the 4 axioms in the original Euclidean axiom set can be modernized as 6 axioms. The new axiom set introduces each axiom progressively, with no new concept in any of the axioms so that each axiom is testable. One of the new axiom states that Euclidean, spherical, and hyperbolic spaces are all strictly monotonic, which seems to be implied in all existing axiom sets for Euclidean geometry.
  A new implicit measure called local right ratio is introduced to replace parallel postulate, Riemann curvature tensor, or Gaussian curvature, to determine if the surface is locally flat, smooth, and curved at each point. Euclidean is shown to be the only surface to have constant right ratios.</description>

      <title>Towards a generic absoluteness theorem for Chang models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.07623v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma^\infty$ be the set of all universally Baire sets of reals. Inspired by recent work of the second author and Nam Trang, we introduce a new technique for establishing generic absoluteness results for models containing $\Gamma^\infty$.
  Our main technical tool is an iteration that realizes $\Gamma^\infty$ as the sets of reals in a derived model of some iterate of $V$. We show, from a supercompact cardinal $\kappa$ and a proper class of Woodin cardinals, that whenever $g \subseteq Col(\omega, 2^{2^\kappa})$ is $V$-generic and $h$ is $V[g]$-generic for some poset $\mathbb{P}\in V[g]$, there is an elementary embedding $j: V\rightarrow M$ such that $j(\kappa)=\omega_1^{V[g*h]}$ and $L(\Gamma^\infty, \mathbb{R})$ as computed in $V[g*h]$ is a derived model of $M$ at $j(\kappa)$.
  As a corollary we obtain that $\mathsf{Sealing}$ holds in $V[g]$, which was previously demonstrated by Woodin using the stationary tower forcing. Also, using a theorem of Woodin, we conclude that the derived model of $V$ at $\kappa$ satisfies $\mathsf{AD}_{\mathbb{R}}+``\Theta$ is a regular cardinal".
  Inspired by core model induction, we introduce the definable powerset $\mathcal{A}^\infty$ of $\Gamma^\infty$ and use our derived model representation mentioned above to show that the theory of $L(\mathcal{A}^\infty)$ cannot be changed by forcing. Working in a different direction, we also show that the theory of $L(\Gamma^\infty, \mathbb{R})[\mathcal{C}]$, where $\mathcal{C}$ is the club filter on $\wp_{\omega_1}(\Gamma^\infty)$, cannot be changed by forcing. Proving the two aforementioned results is the first step towards showing that the theory of $L(Ord^\omega, \Gamma^\infty, \mathbb{R})([\mu_\alpha: \alpha\in Ord])$, where $\mu_\alpha$ is the club filter on $\wp_{\omega_1}(\alpha)$, cannot be changed by forcing.</description>

      <title>The CSP Dichotomy, the Axiom of Choice, and Cyclic Polymorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.00514v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs) in an infinite context. We show that the dichotomy between easy and hard problems -- established already in the finite case -- presents itself as the strength of the corresponding De Bruijin-Erd\H{o}s-type compactness theorem over ZF. More precisely, if $\mathcal{D}$ is a structure, let $K_\mathcal{D}$ stand for the following statement: for every structure $\mathcal{X}$ if every finite substructure of $\mathcal{X}$ admits a solution to $\mathcal{D}$, then so does $\mathcal{X}$. We prove that if $\mathcal{D}$ admits no cyclic polymorphism, and thus it is NP-complete by the CSP Dichotomy Theorem, then $K_\mathcal{D}$ is equivalent to the Boolean Prime Ideal Theorem (BPI) over ZF. Conversely, we also show that if $\mathcal{D}$ admits a cyclic polymorphism, and thus it is in P, then $K_\mathcal{D}$ is strictly weaker than BPI.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13617v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We exhaustively classify varieties of BL-algebras with the amalgamation property, showing that there are only countably many of them and solving an open problem of Montagna. As a consequence of this classification, we obtain a complete description of which axiomatic extensions of H\'{a}jek's basic fuzzy logic BL have the deductive interpolation property. Along the way, we provide similar classifications of varieties of basic hoops with the amalgamation property and axiomatic extensions of the negation-free fragment of BL with the deductive interpolation property.</description>

      <title>Cut elimination for propositional cyclic proof systems with fixed-point operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12792v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Infinitary and cyclic proof systems are proof systems for logical formulas with fixed-point operators or inductive definitions. A cyclic proof system is a restriction of the corresponding infinitary proof system. Hence, these proof systems are generally not the same, as in the cyclic system may be weaker than the infinitary system. For several logics, the infinitary proof systems are shown to be cut-free complete. However, cyclic proof systems are characterized with many unknown problems on the (cut-free) completeness or the cut-elimination property. In this study, we show that the provability of infinitary and cyclic proof systems are the same for some propositional logics with fixed-point operators or inductive definitions and that the cyclic proof systems are cut-free complete.</description>
