      <title>Cosmic-Ray Cooling in Active Galactic Nuclei as a New Probe of Inelastic Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel way to probe inelastic dark matter using cosmic-ray (CR) cooling in active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Dark matter (DM) in the vicinity of supermassive black holes may scatter off CRs, resulting in the rapid cooling of CRs for sufficiently large cross sections. This in turn can alter the high-energy neutrino and gamma-ray fluxes detected from these sources. We show that AGN cooling bounds obtained through the multimessenger data of NGC 1068 and TXS 0506+056 allow to reach unprecedently large mass splittings for inelastic DM ($\gtrsim$ TeV), orders of magnitude larger than those probed by direct detection experiments and DM capture in neutron stars. Furthermore, we demonstrate that cooling bounds from AGNs can probe thermal light DM with small mass splittings. This provides novel and complementary constraints in parts of a parameter space accessible solely by colliders and beam dump experiments.</description>

      <title>Accidental Suppression of Wilson Coefficients in Higgs Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Higgs couplings are essential probes for physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM) since they can be modified by new physics, such as through the Higgs portal interaction $|H|^2\mathcal{O}$. These modifications influence Higgs interactions via dimension-6 operators of the form $ \left(\partial |H|^2\right)^2$ and $|H|^6$, which are generally expected to be of comparable size. This paper discusses a phenomenon of accidental suppression, where the $|H|^6$ coupling is significantly smaller than $\left(\partial |H|^2\right)^2$. This suppression, arising from the truncation of the tree-level effective potential, lacks a clear symmetry explanation but persists in portal models. This paper aims to inspire further studies on additional instances of accidental suppression without symmetry explanations or a general framework to characterize such suppression. We also discuss constraints, at the HL-LHC and future colliders, on the Wilson coefficients of the two dimension-6 operators for various benchmark scenarios of the concrete model.</description>

      <title>From WIMPs to FIMPs: Impact of Early Matter Domination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of non-standard cosmologies, an early matter-dominated (EMD) era can significantly alter the conventional dark matter (DM) genesis. In this work, we reexamine the impact of an EMD on the weakly- and feebly-interacting massive particle (WIMP and FIMP) paradigms. EMD eras significantly modify the genesis of DM because of the change in the Hubble expansion rate and the injection of entropy. The WIMP paradigm can be realized with couplings much smaller than in the standard cosmological scenario, whereas much larger couplings are required in the FIMP case. Using the singlet-scalar DM model as a case study, we show that these results can lead to a continuous transition between the WIMP and FIMP scenarios, with results that are also applicable to other DM models. This broadens the parameter space consistent with observed DM levels and suggests that even elusive FIMP scenarios may be within the reach of future experimental searches.</description>

      <title>Double pole structures of $X_1(2900)$ as the $P$-wave $\bar{D}^*K^*$ resonances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We reveal the double pole structures of the manifestly exotic tetraquark state $X_1(2900)$ in the scenario of $P$-wave $\bar{D}^*K^*$ dimeson resonance. We find that the observed enhancement signal associated with $X_1(2900)$ in $B^+ \to D^+D^-K^+$ by LHCb contains two $P$-wave poles denoted as $T_{cs1-}(2900)$ and $T^{\prime}_{cs1-}(2900)$, respectively. After considering the channel couplings among the $\bar{D}K$, $\bar{D}^*K$, $\bar{D}K^*$ and $\bar{D}^*K^*$ and the width of the $K^*$ meson, the masses and widths of the $S$-wave pole $T_{cs0+}(2900)$ and two $P$-wave poles $T_{cs1-}(2900)$ and $T^{\prime}_{cs1-}(2900)$ coincide with those of the $X_0(2900)$ and $X_1(2900)$ remarkably, which provides strong support for identifying $X_0(2900)$ and $X_1(2900)$ as $\bar{D}^{(*)}K^{(*)}$ dimeson states. Furthermore, we extensively calculate all $S$-wave and $P$-wave $\bar{D}^{(*)}K^{(*)}$ systems up to $J=3$ and predict four new isoscalar charmed-strange dimeson-type tetraquark states: an $S$-wave state $T_{cs1+}(2900)$ with quantum number $J^P=1^+$, three $P$-wave states $T_{cs1-}(2760)$ with $J^P=1^-$, $T_{cs0-}(2760)$ with $J^P=0^-$ and $T_{cs2-}(2900)$ with $J^P=2^-$. These near-threshold poles can be searched for at LHCb, Belle II and BESIII.</description>

      <title>Polarization effects in the elastic $e \vec p \to \vec e p$ and $\vec e \vec p \to e p$ processes in the case of parallel spins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the one-photon exchange approximation, we analyze polarization effects in the elastic $\vec e \vec p \to e p$ and $ e \vec p \to \vec e p$ processes in the case when the spin quantization axes of a target proton at rest and an incident or scattered electron are parallel.
  To do this, in the kinematics of the SANE Collaboration experiment using the J.~Kelly and I.~Qattan parametrizations for the Sachs form factor ratio $R\equiv \mu_p G_E/G_M$, a numerical analysis was carried out of the dependence of the longitudinal polarization degree transferred to the scattered electron in the $e \vec p \to \vec e p$ process and double spin asymmetry in the $\vec e \vec p \to e p$ process on the square of the momentum transferred to the proton as well as on the scattering angle of the electron.
  It is established that the difference in the longitudinal polarization degree of the scattered electron in the $ e \vec p \to \vec e p$ process in the case of conservation and violation of the scaling of the Sachs form factors can reach 70 $\%$. This fact can be used to set up polarization experiments of a new type to measure the ratio $R$.
  For double spin asymmetry in the $\vec e \vec p \to e p$ process, the corresponding difference of the $R$ ratio does not exceed 2.32 $\%$. This fact means that it is not sensitive to the effects of the Sachs form factor scaling violation and could be used as a test for the $R\approx 1$ equality.</description>

      <title>Status and Developments in Polarised Parton Distribution Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The need for accurate and precise polarised parton distribution functions (PDFs) is becoming increasingly crucial in view of the Electron-Ion Collider experimental program foreseen in the coming years. Two global PDF determinations at next-to-next-to-leading order accuracy have been recently presented, MAPPDFpol1.0 and BDSSV24. I review the former and I provide a comparative discussion of other PDF sets accurate to next-to-leading order. I show that differences between these PDF sets, due to the choice of experimental and methodological input, exceed differences due to perturbative accuracy.</description>

      <title>Effective range expansion with the left-hand cut</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The validity range of the time-honored effective range expansion can be very limited due to the presence of a left-hand cut close to the two-particle threshold. Such a left-hand cut arises in the two-particle interaction involving a light particle exchange with a mass small or slightly heavier than the mass difference of the two particles, a scenario encountered in a wide range of systems. This can hinder a precise extraction of low-energy scattering observables and resonance poles. To address this issue, we propose a new parameterization for the low-energy scattering amplitude that accounts for the left-hand cut. The parameterization is like a Pad\'e approximation but with nonanalytic terms from the left-hand cut and can be regarded as an extension of the effective range expansion. It is ready to be applied to a broad class of scatterings and, in particular, should be invaluable in understanding various near-threshold hadron resonances. As byproducts, we also show that the parameterization can be used to extract the couplings of the exchanged particle to the scattering particles, and derive expressions for amplitude zeros caused by the interplay between the short- and long-range interactions.</description>

      <title>Transition signatures for electron-positron pair creation in space-time inhomogeneous electric field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The process of electron-positron pair creation through multi-photon absorption in a space-time dependent electric field is analyzed using computational quantum field theory. Our findings reveal two distinct pair creation channels: the symmetric and asymmetric transition channels. We propose that the asymmetric transition channel arises from the inherent spatial inhomogeneity of intense laser pulses. By mapping the field-theoretical model of laser-assisted multi-photon pair creation onto a quantum-mechanical time-dependent framework, a semi-analytical solution that captures the asymmetric transition signatures of vacuum decay is derived. Additionally, it is demonstrated that neglecting spatial inhomogeneity leads to erroneous transition amplitudes and incorrect identification of pair creation channels, even when the dipole approximation holds.</description>

      <title>Forward $\eta_Q$ production impact factor at NLO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The High-Energy Factorisation (HEF) coefficient function or impact factor for the hadroproduction of the state ${}^1S_0^{[1]}$ of a heavy quark-antiquark pair ($Q\bar{Q}$) at forward rapidities is computed at NLO in $\alpha_s$. This impact factor is an integral part of the resummation procedure for higher-order QCD corrections to the hadro-production cross sections of $\eta_c$ or $\eta_b$ mesons at forward rapidities in collinear factorisation (CF), enhanced by logarithms of partonic center of mass energy. The NLO computation, results of which are presented in this contribution, is an important step towards an extension of aforementioned resummation beyond the Leading Logarithmic Approximation(LLA).</description>

      <title>Chiral Symmetry and Large Magnetic Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large magnetic fields exist in magnetars and are produced in off-central heavy-ion collisions. For the latter, field strengths are estimated to be comparable to strong interaction scales. This fact has motivated many studies of QCD physics in large magnetic fields, ranging from various model studies to lattice QCD computations. We provide a selective overview of results stemming from chiral perturbation theory. These results are based solely on the pattern of spontaneous and explicit symmetry breaking of QCD in a magnetic field; accordingly, they constitute low-energy theorems that must be satisfied in any approach. A few discrepancies with models and tension with lattice data are highlighted.</description>

      <title>Dissecting a strongly coupled scalar nucleon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We continue our investigation of the stress within a strongly coupled scalar nucleon, and now dissect the gravitational form factors into contributions from its constituents, the (mock) nucleon and the (mock) pion. The computation is based on a non-perturbative solution of the scalar Yukawa model in the light-front Hamiltonian formalism with a Fock sector expansion including up to one nucleon and two pions. By employing the ``good currents" $T^{++}_i$, $T^{+-}_i$ and $T^{12}_i$, we extract the full set of gravitational form factors $A_i$, $D_i$, $\bar c_i$ without the contamination of the spurious form factors, and free of uncanceled UV divergences. With these results, we decompose the mass of the system into its constituents and compute the matter and mechanical radii, gaining insights into the strongly coupled system.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity of WIMP bounds on the velocity distribution in the limit of a massless mediator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the sensitivity of the bounds on the spin-independent (SI) and spin-dependent (SD) WIMP-proton and WIMP-neutron interaction couplings $\alpha_{SI, SD}^{p,n}$ on the WIMP velocity distribution for a massless mediator in the propagator by combining direct detection and the neutrino signal from WIMP annihilation in the Sun (fixing the annihilation channel to $b\bar{b}$). We update the bounds in the Standard Halo Model (SHM) and using the halo-independent single-stream method. In the case of a massless mediator the SHM capture rate in the Sun diverges and is regularized by removing the contribution of WIMPs locked into orbits that extend beyond the Sun-Jupiter distance. We discuss the dependence of the SHM bounds on the Jupiter cut showing that it can be sizeable for $\alpha_{\rm SD}^p$ and a WIMP mass $m_\chi$ exceeding 1 TeV. Our updated SHM bounds show an improvement between about two and three orders of magnitude compared to the previous ones in the literature. Our halo-independent analysis shows that, with the exception of $\alpha_{\rm SD}^p$ at large $m_\chi$, the relaxation of the bounds compared to the SHM is of the same order of that for contact interactions, i.e. relatively moderate in the low and high WIMP mass regimes and as large as a few $\times\sim 10^2$ for $m_\chi\simeq$ 30 GeV. On the other hand, the exact determination of the relaxation of the bound becomes not reliable for $\alpha_{\rm SD}^p$ and $m_\chi\gtrsim$ 1 TeV due to the sensitivity of the SHM capture rate in the Sun to the details of the Maxwellian velocity distribution at low incoming WIMP speeds. The halo-independent bounds do not depend on the Jupiter cut needed to regularize the calculation of the capture rate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the electroweak phase transition dynamics with a three-dimensional standard model effective field theory under a gauge-invariant approach. We observe that, at the two-loop level, the phase transition parameters obtained with the gauge invariant approach can at most deviate from that of the dimensional reduction method around the percent level. We further found that the predicted gravitational wave signals at the new physics scale $\Lambda\gtrsim 590$ GeV are unreachable by the space-based interferometers, such as: LISA, TianQin, and Taiji.</description>

      <title>Gravitational form factor $D$ of charmonium from shear stress</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on our recent analysis of the hadronic matrix element of the stress-energy tensor in covariant light front dynamics, we extract the charmonium gravitational form factor $D(Q^2)$ from shear stress $T^{12}$. This is in contrast to our recent work using the (light-front) energy density $T^{+-}$. Indeed, by comparing these two currents, we identify terms that are responsible for the violation of the current conservation. Numerical results based on basis light-front quantization show that the violation effects are small and the $D$-term extracted from the two currents are close to each other, hence validating our previous work using $T^{+-}$.</description>

      <title>Gluon tomography through diffractive processes in a saturation framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss a series of results aimed at bringing saturation physics and gluon tomography into an era of precision. In particular, the NLO treatment of diffractive: 1) exclusive dijet, 2) exclusive longitudinally polarized light vector meson and 3) semi-inclusive single or double hadron photo- or electroproduction with large $p_T$, on a nucleon or a nuclei. Finally, we discuss the more complicated 4) exclusive transversely polarized light vector meson production, which starts at the next-to-leading power and therefore requires a beyond leading twist treatment. This new class of processes provides an access to precision physics of gluon saturation dynamics, with very promising future phenomenological studies at the EIC, or, at the LHC in $p A$ and $A A$ scattering, using Ultra Peripheral Collisions (UPC).</description>

      <title>Transport coefficients of the heavy quark in the domain of the non-perturbative and non-eikonal gluon radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Drag and diffusion coefficients of the Heavy Quarks (HQs), such as charm and bottom, are one of the prime tools for discerning the properties of the deconfined QCD medium created in the Heavy Ion Collisions experiments. The innate non-perturbative nature of the QCD medium renders it imperative to estimate the transport coefficients in that domain. The present work evaluates the drag and diffusion coefficients of the moving HQ interacting with the medium particles via two-body collisional and three-body radiative processes to the first order in opacity by employing Gribov mechanism for the non-perturbative regime. We proffer the latest results of the HQ transport coefficients computed for the non-perturbative and non-eikonal gluon radiation off the HQ. The calculations show significant increment of the transport coefficients with the increasing non-eikonality by juxtaposing the results with those of the pertubative and eikonal regions. We hope to shed fresh light towards explaining the experimental data on the nuclear modification facor, $R_{AA}$, the elliptic flow, $v_2$ of the HQ by advocating the importance of the non-eikonality of the gluon radiation off the HQ.</description>

      <title>Collisional corrections to spin polarization from quantum kinetic theory using Chapman-Enskog expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have investigated the collisional corrections to the spin polarization pseudo-vector, $\delta\mathcal{P}^{\mu}$, using quantum kinetic theory in Chapman-Enskog expansion. We derive the spin Boltzmann equation incorporating M{\o}ller scattering process. We further consider two distinct scenarios using hard thermal loop approximations for simplification. In scenario (I), the vector charge distribution function is treated as off-equilibrium under the validity domain of gradient expansion. Remarkably, the polarization induced by gradients of thermal chemical potential and shear viscous tensors are modified, but $\delta\mathcal{P}_{\textrm{ }}^{\mu}$ in this scenario does not depend on the coupling constant. In scenario (II), the vector charge distribution function is assumed to be in local thermal equilibrium. Then collisional corrections $\delta\mathcal{P}_{\textrm{ }}^{\mu}$ in this scenario are at $\mathcal{O}(\hbar^{2}\partial^{2})$. Additionally, we evaluate the $\delta\mathcal{P}^{\mu}$ using relaxation time approach for comparative analysis. Our results establish the theoretical framework necessary for the future numerical investigations on the interaction corrections to spin polarization.</description>

      <title>Quark Flavor Balancing in Nuclear Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The notion of charge balance function, originally designed to study the evolution of charge production in heavy-ion collisions, is extended to consider quark flavor balancing. This extension is considered based on simulations performed with the PYTHIA 8 event generator in the context of pp collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13.6$ TeV but can be trivially applied to any other scenario and implemented in measurements of correlated particle production in pp, pA, and AA collisions at colliders. Correlation of selected flavor balancing pairs are examined as function of the produced charged particle multiplicity. One finds that the amplitude of the correlations increases monotonically with the number of balanced flavors and the actual flavor content of correlated particles.</description>

      <title>Electron-nucleus cross sections from transfer learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transfer learning (TL) allows a deep neural network (DNN) trained on one type of data to be adapted for new problems with limited information. We propose to use the TL technique in physics. The DNN learns the physics of one process, and after fine-tuning, it makes predictions for related processes. We consider the DNNs, trained on inclusive electron-carbon scattering data, and show that after fine-tuning, they accurately predict cross sections for electron interactions with nuclear targets ranging from lithium to iron. The method works even when the DNN is fine-tuned on a small dataset.</description>

      <title>Chiral-odd gluon generalized parton distributions in the proton: A light-front quantization approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the basis light-front quantization (BLFQ) framework, we evaluate the gluon chiral-odd generalized parton distributions (GPDs) inside the proton at zero skewness. We employ the light-front wave functions of the proton obtained from a light-front quantized Hamiltonian with quantum chromodynamics input using BLFQ. Our investigation encompasses both the valence Fock sector with three constituent quarks and an additional sector containing three quarks and a dynamical gluon. We analyze the gluon GPDs in the momentum space as well as in the transverse position space. We further present the gluon's generalized form factors derived from the Mellin moments of its chiral-odd GPDs. Using the proton transverse spin sum rule, we also present the $x$-dependence of the angular momentum carried by the polarized gluon and determine the relative contributions of quarks and the gluon to the transversity asymmetry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present various recent updates related to the MSHT20 PDF sets, and particularly to the MSHT20 approximate N$^3$LO (aN$^3$LO) PDFs. These include an investigation of including either inclusive jet data or dijet data, the detailed treatment of $Z\,p_T$ data, and the impact on the gluon PDF in particular. We also very briefly summarize the determination of the strong coupling via an aN$^3$LO global PDF fit, finding $\alpha_S(M_Z^2)=0.1170\pm 0.0016$, and of including QED corrections in the aN$^3$LO analysis. Finally we consider the preliminary finding associated with the effect of improved knowledge of the N$^3$LO splitting functions on the aN$^3$LO PDFs. In particular we note a moderate impact on the gluon distribution, i.e. within the uncertainty, and a more limited impact on the gluon-gluon luminosity unless strong rapidity cuts are imposed. Hence, we conclude that while details of our aN$^3$LO PDFs will change with more precise splitting functions, only relatively minor effects on predictions are likely to result.</description>

      <title>Investment of the scalar unparticle and polarization at muon colliders through the leptonic and hadronic decays of W boson in the RS model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, by using Feynman diagram techniques we have evaluated the influence of the scalar unparticle and polarization at the muon colliders through the leptonic and hadronic decays of W boson in the RS model. The results show that with fixed collision energies, the total cross-sections for leptonic and hadronic productions in final states depend strongly on the parameters of the unparticle physics and muon beam polarization. The total cross-sections achieve the maximum value when both of muon beams polarize left or right and the minimum value when the $\mu^{-}$ beam polarizes left, the $\mu^{+}$ beam polarizes right and vice versa. In case of the different polarization, the cross-section increases as the collision energy increases and it changes insignificantly in case of the unpolarized muon beams. In particular, the cross-section for leptonic productions in final states is much larger than that of hadronic productions under same conditions. With the benchmark background $(\Lambda_{U}, d_{U})$ $= (1 $TeV$, 1.9)$, the cross-sections reach the maximum value. The integrated luminosity value is shown to correspond to a significance larger than $5\sigma$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel simulation of a strongly interacting dark sector also known as the Hidden Valley scenarios using angular ordered showers and the cluster hadronisation model in Herwig 7. We discuss the basics of this implementation and the scale hierarchies underpinning the simulation. With the help of a few benchmarks, we show the effect of variation of dark sector parameters on thrust and angularities within the dark sector, and study correlation functions, which can be helpful for understanding the angular structure of these events. Finally we comment on the uncertainties introduced due to lack of knowledge of hadronisation parameters within the dark sectors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14027v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Uncertainty estimation is a key issue when considering the application of deep neural network methods in science and engineering. In this work, we introduce a novel algorithm that quantifies epistemic uncertainty via Monte Carlo sampling from a tempered posterior distribution. It combines the well established Metropolis Adjusted Langevin Algorithm (MALA) with momentum-based optimization using Adam and leverages a prolate proposal distribution, to efficiently draw from the posterior. We prove that the constructed chain admits the Gibbs posterior as an invariant distribution and converges to this Gibbs posterior in total variation distance. Furthermore, we demonstrate the efficiency of the resulting algorithm and the merit of the proposed changes on a state-of-the-art classifier from high-energy particle physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interplay between cosmology and strongly coupled dynamics can yield transient spectral features that vanish at late times, but which may leave behind phenomenological signatures in the spectrum of primordial fluctuations. Of particular interest are strongly coupled extensions of the standard model featuring approximate conformal invariance. In flat space, the spectral density for a scalar operator in a conformal field theory is characterized by a continuum with scaling law governed by the dimension of the operator, and is otherwise featureless. AdS/CFT arguments suggest that for large $N$, in an inflationary background with Hubble rate $H$, this continuum is gapped. We demonstrate that there can be additional peak structures that become sharp and particle-like at phenomenologically interesting regions in parameter space, and we estimate their contribution to cosmological observables. We find phenomena that are potentially observable in future experiments that are unique to these models, including displaced oscillatory features in the squeezed limit of the bi-spectrum. These particles can be either fundamental, and localized to a UV brane, or composite at the Hubble scale, $H$, and bound to a horizon in the bulk of the 5D geometry. We comment on how stabilization of conformal symmetry breaking vacua can be correlated with these spectral features and their phenomenology.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Dark Energy from Lattice Quantum Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the behavior of the vacuum in Euclidean dynamical triangulations (EDT). Algorithmic improvements and better lattice spacing determinations allow us to test the properties of the emergent de Sitter geometries of our simulations to higher precision than previously possible. Although the agreement with de Sitter is good, the improved precision reveals deviations that can be interpreted as non-trivial vacuum dynamics, well-described by a cosmological constant that runs with scale. The simulations show that the dominant running is quadratic and that the scale can be identified with the Hubble rate. Several key cross-checks support this picture, including consistent results across multiple lattice spacings and the fact that covariant energy conservation is maintained. The parameters of the running are fully determined by simulations, enabling predictions when extrapolated to the scales relevant for our universe. This leads to a model for dark energy that is compatible with current observations, but which predicts deviations from $\Lambda$CDM at the ${\cal O}(10^{-3})$ level in cosmological observables that could be tested with future improvements in precision measurements.</description>

      <title>Investigating the mixing between two black hole populations in LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA GWTC-3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a population model to analyze the mixing between hypothesised power-law and $\sim 35 M_\odot$ Gaussian bump black hole populations in the latest gravitational wave catalog, GWTC-3, estimating their co-location and separation. We find a relatively low level of mixing, $3.1^{+5.0}_{-3.1}\%$, between the power-law and Gaussian populations, compared to the percentage of mergers containing two Gaussian bump black holes, $5.0^{+3.2}_{-1.7}\%$. Our analysis indicates that black holes within the Gaussian bump are generally separate from the power-law population, with only a minor fraction engaging in mixing and contributing to the $\mathcal{M} \sim 14 M_\odot$ peak in the chirp mass. This leads us to identify a distinct population of Binary Gaussian Black Holes (BGBHs) that arise from mergers within the Gaussian bump. We suggest that current theories for the formation of the massive $35 M_\odot$ Gaussian bump population may need to reevaluate the underlying mechanisms that drive the preference for BGBHs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The analysis of Pb+Pb data for net-charge fluctuations at LHC energies within the HYDJET++ model is presented. The strongly intensive quantities $D$ and $\Sigma$ are used to get rid of the effects related to volume fluctuations of the system. We employ two versions of the HYDJET++ for the analysis. The first one is the standard or default version, whereas the second one represents its further modification, which takes into account explicit event-by-event conservation of the electric net-charge of produced particles. Inclusion of the canonical net-charge conservation in the model allows one for better description of the experimental data obtained by the ALICE and the CMS Collaborations. Comparison with calculations of other models is also presented.</description>

      <title>The Search for the Cosmological Axion -- A New Refined Narrow Mass Window and Detection Scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Based upon a previous axion mass proposal and detection scheme, as well as considering the axion mass ranges suggested by cogent simulations in recent years, we present a revised axion/ALP Search strategy and our calculations, concentrating on a narrow axion Compton frequency window in this report. The window comprises the spectral region of 18.99 to 19.01GHz (that falls within the Ku microwave band), with a center frequency of 19.00GHz (+0.1GHz), with equivalence to a corresponding axion mass range of 78.6 to 79.6 micro-eV, with the center mass at the value of 78.582 (+5.0) micro-eV, our suggested most likely value for an axionic/ALP field mass, if these fields exist in nature. Our search strategy, as summarized herewith, is based upon the assumption that the dark matter that exists in the current epoch of our physical universe is dominated by axions and thus the local observable axion density is the density of the invisible light cold dark matter, permeating our local neighborhood (mainly in the Milky Way galactic halo). Some ideas and the design of an experiment, built around a Josephson Parametric Amplifier and Resonant Tunneling Diode in a resonant RF cavity, are also introduced in this report.</description>

      <title>AXPs/SGRs: strange stars with crusts?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emission of Anomalous X-ray Pulsars (AXPs) and Soft Gamma-Ray Repeaters (SGRs) is believed to be powered by the dissipation of their strong magnetic fields, which coined the name `magnetar'. By combining timing and energy observational results, the magnetar model can be easily appreciated. From a timing perspective, the magnetic field strengths of AXPs and SGRs, calculated assuming dipole radiation, are extremely strong. From an energy perspective, the X-ray/soft gamma-ray luminosities of AXPs and SGRs are larger than their rotational energy loss rates (i.e., $ L_{\rm X}&gt;\dot E_{\rm rot}$). It is thus reasonable to assume that the high-energy radiation comes from magnetic energy decay, and the magnetar model has been extensively discussed (or accepted). However, we argue that: (1) calculating magnetic fields by assuming that rotational energy loss is dominated by dipole radiation (i.e., $\dot{E}_{\rm rot}\simeq\dot{E}_{\mu}$)) may be controversial, and we suggest that the energies carried by outflowing particles should also be considered; and (2) the fact that X-ray luminosity is greater than the rotational energy loss rate does not necessarily mean that the emission energy comes from the magnetic field decaying, which requires further observational testing. Furthermore, some observational facts conflict with the `magnetar' model, such as observations of anti-magnetars, high magnetic field pulsars, and radio and X-ray observations of AXPs/SGRs. Therefore, we propose a crusted strange star model as an alternative, which can explain many more observational facts of AXPs/SGRs.</description>

      <title>Non-perturbative phase boundaries in the Gross-Neveu model from a stability analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two out of three phase boundaries of the 1+1 dimensional Gross-Neveu model in the chiral limit can be obtained from a standard, perturbative stability analysis of the homogeneous phases. The third one separating the massive homogeneous phase from the kink crystal is non-perturbative and could so far only be inferred from the full solution of the model. We show that this phase boundary can also be obtained via a modified stability analysis, based on the thermodynamic potential of a single kink or baryon. The same method works for the massive Gross-Neveu model, so that all phase boundaries of the Gross-Neveu model could have been predicted quantitatively without prior knowledge of the full crystal solution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $\delta N$ formalism is a powerful approach to compute non-linearly the large-scale evolution of the comoving curvature perturbation $\zeta$. It assumes a set of FLRW patches that evolve independently, but in doing so, all the gradient terms are discarded, which are not negligibly small in models beyond slow-roll. In this paper, we extend the formalism to capture these gradient corrections by encoding them in a homogeneous-spatial-curvature contribution assigned to each FLRW patch. For a concrete example, we apply this formalism to the ultra-slow-roll inflation, and find that it can correctly describe the large-scale evolution of the comoving curvature perturbation from the horizon exit. We also briefly discuss non-Gaussianities in this context.</description>

Abstract: We explore the prospects of measurements of spectral moments of inclusive charm decays with BESIII. The rich and uniquely clean data set of charm mesons and baryons at BESIII offers a unique laboratory to study the evolution of Heavy Quark Expansion (HQE) parameters across different charm hadron species and to shed light on the interplay between heavy quark dynamics and light quark effects. The HQE in terms of inverse powers of the heavy meson mass is well-established in beauty decays, however due to the lighter charm mass its applicability to charm remains an open question. To date no determination of the HQE parameters, the kinetic energy, chromomagnetic moment and Darwin terms, has been attempted. A particular important role here is given to the Darwin and weak annihilation operators, whose values are important to predict lifetimes of heavy hadrons. Using a fast simulation for the BESIII detector response and predictions for spectral moments, we investigate the sensitivity to HQE parameters with today's and possible future data sets. In addition, we discuss the theory challenges for the HQE in charm and the experimental limitations. We further investigate the sensitivity of determining the CKM matrix element $|V_{cs}|$ with inclusive semileptonic charm decays.</description>

Abstract: We study low-energy nuclear physics
  at the future Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) at Brookhaven. By comparing the standard theory of electron-nucleus scattering with the equivalent photon method applied to Ultraperipheral Collisions (UPC) at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, we extract valuable insights into both processes. In the limit of extremely high beam energies and small energy transfers, very transparent equations emerge. We apply these equations to analyze nuclear fragmentation in UPCs at the LHC and eA scattering at the EIC, demonstrating that the EIC could facilitate unique photonuclear physics studies.</description>

      <title>The NANOGrav 15 yr Data Set: Running of the Spectral Index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The NANOGrav 15-year data provides compelling evidence for a stochastic gravitational-wave (GW) background at nanohertz frequencies. The simplest model-independent approach to characterizing the frequency spectrum of this signal consists in a simple power-law fit involving two parameters: an amplitude A and a spectral index \gamma. In this paper, we consider the next logical step beyond this minimal spectral model, allowing for a running (i.e., logarithmic frequency dependence) of the spectral index, \gamma_run(f) = \gamma + \beta \ln(f/f_ref). We fit this running-power-law (RPL) model to the NANOGrav 15-year data and perform a Bayesian model comparison with the minimal constant-power-law (CPL) model, which results in a 95% credible interval for the parameter \beta consistent with no running, \beta \in [-0.80,2.96], and an inconclusive Bayes factor, B(RPL vs. CPL) = 0.69 +- 0.01. We thus conclude that, at present, the minimal CPL model still suffices to adequately describe the NANOGrav signal; however, future data sets may well lead to a measurement of nonzero \beta. Finally, we interpret the RPL model as a description of primordial GWs generated during cosmic inflation, which allows us to combine our results with upper limits from big-bang nucleosynthesis, the cosmic microwave background, and LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA.</description>

      <title>Electric conductivity of hot and dense nuclear matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transport coefficients play an important role in characterising hot and dense nuclear matter, such as that created in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions (URHIC). In the present work we calculate the electric conductivity of hot and dense hadronic matter by extracting it from the electromagnetic spectral function, through its zero energy limit at vanishing 3-momentum. We utilise the vector dominance model (VDM), in which the photon couples to hadronic currents predominantly through the $\rho$ meson. Therefore, we use hadronic many-body theory to calculate the $\rho$-meson's self-energy in hot and dense hadronic matter, by dressing its pion cloud with $\pi$-$\rho$, $\pi$-$\sigma$, $\pi$-$K$, N-hole, and $\Delta$-hole loops. We then introduce vertex corrections to maintain gauge invariance. Finally, we analyze the low-energy transport peak as a function of temperature and baryon chemical potential, and extract the conductivity along a proposed phase transition line.</description>

Abstract: Exploring the mysterious dark matter is a key quest in modern physics. Currently, detecting axions, a hypothetical particle proposed as a primary component of dark matter, remains a significant challenge due to their weakly interacting nature. Here we show at quantum level that in a cavity permeated by a magnetic field, the single axion-photon conversion rate is enhanced by the cavity quality factor and is quantitatively larger than the classical result by $\pi/2$. The axion cavity can be considered a quantum device emitting single photons with temporal separations. This differs from the classical picture and reveals a possibility for the axion cavity experiment to handle the signal sensitivity at the quantum level, e.g., a dual path quantum interferometry with cross-power and second-order correlation measurements. This scheme would greatly reduce the signal scanning time and improve the sensitivity of the axion-photon coupling, potentially leading to the direct observation of axions.</description>

      <title>Is infrared-collinear safe information all you need for jet classification?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.08979v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning-based jet classifiers are able to achieve impressive tagging performance in a variety of applications in high-energy and nuclear physics. However, it remains unclear in many cases which aspects of jets give rise to this discriminating power, and whether jet observables that are tractable in perturbative QCD such as those obeying infrared-collinear (IRC) safety serve as sufficient inputs. In this article, we introduce a new classifier, Jet Flow Networks (JFNs), in an effort to address the question of whether IRC unsafe information provides additional discriminating power in jet classification. JFNs are permutation-invariant neural networks (deep sets) that take as input the kinematic information of reconstructed subjets. The subjet radius and a cut on the subjet's transverse momenta serve as tunable hyperparameters enabling a controllable sensitivity to soft emissions and nonperturbative effects. We demonstrate the performance of JFNs for quark vs. gluon and Z vs. QCD jet tagging. For small subjet radii and transverse momentum cuts, the performance of JFNs is equivalent to the IRC-unsafe Particle Flow Networks (PFNs), demonstrating that infrared-collinear unsafe information is not necessary to achieve strong discrimination for both cases. As the subjet radius is increased, the performance of the JFNs remains essentially unchanged until physical thresholds that we identify are crossed. For relatively large subjet radii, we show that the JFNs may offer an increased model independence with a modest tradeoff in performance compared to classifiers that use the full particle information of the jet. These results shed new light on how machines learn patterns in high-energy physics data</description>

      <title>Baryonium Dark Matter: Events with Circle Configurations in the Atmosphere and on the Surface of Earth</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.14933v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This research supposes the parallel study of the manifestations of Baryonium Dark Matter (BDM) in astroparticle collisions in the atmosphere and among the footprints of the massive extraterrestrial objects that fall on the surface of Earth. These objects differ from stony asteroids and are seen as lightning and fulminating bolides. Since BDM is a QCD state, the characteristics of BDM disintegration events can be analyzed with the same model as hadroproproduction data on colliders. It was concluded that the HE event, which was detected in the stratosphere in 1975, differs from the collision of the nucleus. The signatures of such events are 1) the circle distribution of heavy secondary hadrons with almost nothing inside the ring and 2) the presence of heavy secondary particles with a mass out of range of known hadrons. The circle will also be the signature for heavy BDM conglomerates that disintegrate in the atmosphere for a few lower-mass BDMs. The same signatures should be seen in super-heavy BDM collapses on the Earth. The traces of such events are seen as circles of pits or shafts in the ground rock, which are organized in the circles. There are at least two pieces of evidence of such holes: cenotes on the Yucatan peninsula (Mexico) and pits in Durrington Walls (England). The vertical pits (or the wells), because sometimes they are filled with water, had been laid out in circles and have a depth of 5 - 50 meters. These super-heavy BDM collapses differ from the meteorite crash, because they do not form the craters. The existence of these places around the globe indicates the rare likelihood of meeting the super-massive BDM in proximity to Earth. The Tunguska meteorite could also be a BDM collapse. Finally, some suggestions are made about the emission of Baryonium Dark Matter with the jets from giant active Supermassive Black Holes (SMBH).</description>

Abstract: We take the Dyson-Schwinger Equation approach of QCD for the quark propagator at complex chemical potential to study the QCD phase transition. The phase transition line of the $(2+1)$-flavor QCD matter in the imaginary chemical potential region is computed via a simplified truncation scheme, whose curvature is found to be consistent with the one at real chemical potential. Moreover, the computation in the complex chemical potential plane allows us to determine the location of the Lee-Yang edge singularities. We show explicitly that the critical end point coincides with the Lee-Yang edge singularities on the real $\mu_{B}^{}$ axis. We also investigate the scaling behavior of the singularities and discuss the possibility of extrapolating the CEP from a certain range of chemical potential.</description>

Abstract: A first order electroweak phase transition probes physics beyond the Standard Model on multiple frontiers and therefore is of immense interest for theoretical exploration. We conduct a model-independent study of the effects of relevant dimension 6 and dimension 8 operators, of the Standard Model effective field theory, on electroweak phase transition. We use a thermally corrected and renormalization group improved potential and study its impact on nucleation temperature. We then outline bubble dynamics that lead to ultrarelativistic bubble wall velocities which are mainly motivated from the viewpoint of gravitational wave detection. We highlight the ranges of the Wilson coefficients that give rise to such bubble wall velocities and predict gravitational wave spectra generated by such transitions which can be tested in future experiments.</description>

      <title>Dark Branes for Dark Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06276v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a setup for the origin of dark matter based on spacetime with a warped extra dimension and three branes: the Planck brane, the TeV brane, at a (few) TeV scale $\rho_T$, and a dark brane, at a (sub)-GeV scale $\rho_1\lesssim 100$ GeV $\ll\rho_T$. The Standard Model is localized in the TeV brane, thus solving the Higgs hierarchy problem, while the dark matter $\chi$, a Dirac fermion with mass $m_\chi&lt;\rho_1$, is localized in the dark brane. The radion, with mass $m_r&lt;m_\chi$, interacts strongly ($\sim m_\chi/\rho_1\sim\mathcal O(1)$) with dark matter and very weakly ($\sim m_{f}\rho_1/\rho_T^2\ll 1$) with the Standard Model matter $f$. The generic conflict between the bounds on its detection signatures and its proper relic abundance is avoided as dark matter annihilation is $p$-wave suppressed. The former is determined by its very weak interactions with the SM and the latter by its much stronger annihilation into radions. Therefore, there is a vast range in the Dark Matter's parameter space where the correct relic abundance is achieved consistently with the existing bounds. Moreover, for the dark brane with $\rho_1\lesssim 3$ GeV, a confinement/deconfinement first order phase transition, where the radion condensates, produces a stochastic gravitational waves background at the nanoHz frequencies, which can be identified with the signal detected by the Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) experiments. In the PTA window, for $0.15 \textrm{ GeV}\lesssim m_\chi\lesssim 2$ GeV the relic abundance is reproduced and all constraints are satisfied.</description>

Abstract: The similar densities of dark matter and baryons in the universe imply that they might arise from the same ultraviolet model. The B-Mesogenesis, which assumes dark matter is charged under the baryon number, attempts to simultaneously explain the origin of baryon asymmetry and dark matter in the universe. In particular, the B-Mesogenesis might induce bottom-baryon decays into invisible or semi-invisible final states, which provide a distinctive signal for probing this scenario. In this work, we systematically study the invisible decays of bottom baryons into dark matters, and semi-invisible decays of bottom baryons into a meson or a photon together with a dark matter particle. In particular, the fully invisible decay can explore the stable particles in B-Mesogenesis. Some QCD-based frameworks are used to calculate the hadronic matrix elements under the B-Mesogenesis model. We estimate the constraints on the Wilson coefficients or the product of some new physics couplings with the Wilson coefficients by the semi-invisible and invisible decays of bottom baryons at future colliders.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the gravitational form factors of charmonium. Our method is based on a Hamiltonian formalism on the light front known as basis light-front quantization. The charmonium mass spectrum and light-front wave functions were obtained from diagonalizing an effective Hamiltonian that incorporates confinement from holographic QCD and one-gluon exchange interaction from light-front QCD. We proposed a quantum many-body approach to construct the hadronic matrix elements of the energy momentum tensor $T^{++}$ and $T^{+-}$, which are used to extract the gravitational form factors $A(Q^2)$ and $D(Q^2)$. The obtained form factors satisfy the known constraints, e.g. von Laue condition. From these quantities, we also extract the energy, pressure and light-front energy distributions of the system. We find that hadrons are multi-layer systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12316v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we discuss the neutrino mass dependent nuclear matrix element (NME) of the neutrinoless double beta decay process and derive the limit on the parameter space of the minimal Type-I seesaw model from the current available experimental data as well as the future sensitivities from the next-generation experiments. Both the explicit many-body calculations and naive extrapolations of the mass dependent NME are employed in the current work. The uncertainties of the theoretical nuclear structure models are taken into account. By combining the latest experimental data from $^{76}$Ge-based experiments, GERDA and MAJORANA, the $^{130}$Te-based experiment, CUORE and the $^{136}$Xe-based experiments, KamLAND-Zen and EXO-200, the bounds on the parameter space of the minimal Type-I seesaw model are obtained and compared with the limits from other experimental probes. Sensitivities for future experiments utilizing $^{76}$Ge-based (LEGEND-1000), $^{82}$Se-based (SuperNEMO), $^{130}$Te based (SNO+II) and $^{136}$Xe-based (nEXO), with a ten-year exposure, are also derived.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric self-interacting dark matter with a canonical seesaw model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14912v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the possibility of generating dark matter (DM) and baryon asymmetry of the Universe (BAU) simultaneously in an asymmetric DM framework, which also alleviates the small-scale structure issues of cold DM. While the thermal relic of such self-interacting DM remains under-abundant due to efficient annihilation into light mediators, a nonzero asymmetry in the dark sector can lead to the survival of the required DM in the Universe. The existence of a light mediator leads to the required self-interactions of DM at small scales while keeping DM properties similar to cold DM at large scales. It also ensures that the symmetric DM component annihilates away, leaving the asymmetric part in the spirit of cogenesis. The particle physics implementation is done in canonical seesaw models of light neutrino mass, connecting it to the origin of DM and BAU. In particular, we consider type-I and type-III seesaw origin of neutrino mass for simplicity and minimality of the field content. We show that the desired self-interactions and relic of DM together with BAU while satisfying relevant constraints lead to strict limits on DM mass $\mathcal{O}({\rm GeV}) \lesssim M_{\rm DM} \lesssim460 $ GeV. In spite of being a high-scale seesaw, the models remain verifiable in different experiments, including direct and indirect DM searches as well as colliders.</description>

      <title>Supernova limits on 'QCD axion-like particles'</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00153v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the phenomenology of massive Axion-Like Particles (ALPs) coupled to quarks and gluons, dubbed 'QCD ALPs', with an emphasis on the associated low-energy observables. ALPs coupled to gluons and quarks not only induce nuclear interactions at scales below the QCD-scale, relevant for ALP production in supernovae (SNe), but naturally also couple to photons similarly to the QCD-axion. We discuss the link between the high-energy formulation of ALP theories and their effective couplings with nucleons and photons. The induced photon coupling allows ALPs with masses $m_a\gtrsim1$ MeV to efficiently decay into photons, and astrophysical observables severely constrain the ALP parameter space. We show that a combination of arguments related to SN events rule out ALP-nucleon couplings down to $g_{aN}\gtrsim 10^{-11}- 10^{-10}$ for $m_a\gtrsim1$ MeV - a region of the parameter space that was hitherto unconstrained.</description>

      <title>Refined determination of the weak mixing angle at low energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09416v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The weak mixing angle is a fundamental parameter of the electroweak theory of the standard model whose measurement in the low-energy regime is still not precisely determined. Different probes are sensitive to its value, among which atomic parity violation, coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering and parity-violating electron scattering on different nuclei. In this work, we attempt for the first time to combine all these various determinations by performing a global fit that also keeps into account the unavoidable dependence on the experimentally poorly known neutron distribution radius of the nuclei employed, for which a new measurement using proton-cesium elastic scattering became available. By using all present direct determinations of the neutron distribution radius of cesium we find $\sin^2\!\vartheta_{W} =0.2396^{+0.0020}_{-0.0019}$, which should supersede the previous value determined from atomic parity violation on cesium. When including electroweak only, but also indirect, determinations of the neutron distribution radius of cesium the uncertainty reduces to 0.0017 maintaining the same central value, showing an excellent agreement independently of the method used.</description>

      <title>Decays $Z\to e_ae_b$ in a 3-3-1 model with neutral leptons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11040v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the 3-3-1 model with neutral leptons (called the 331$NL$ for short) and by that, we will point out that this model can simultaneously explain the lepton flavor violating (LFV) decays of the $Z$ boson $Z \to e_a e_b$, Standard model-like Higgs boson decay $h\to e_be_a$, and the charged leptons $e_b\to e_a \gamma$ consistent with the recent experimental data. In addition, the numerical results show strict relations among these decay rates of $Z$ and $h$ which are predicted by this model. As a result, the decay channels can be determined theoretically if one of them is detected by experiments.</description>

      <title>Leptogenesis assisted by scalar decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13468v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a pragmatic approach to lower down the mass scale of right-handed neutrinos in leptogenesis by introducing a scalar decaying to right-handed neutrinos. The key point of our proposal is that the out-of-equilibrium decays of the scalar provide an additional source for right-handed neutrinos and hence the lepton asymmetry. This mechanism works well at low temperatures when the washout of the generated lepton asymmetry is suppressed. Thus, the lepton asymmetry can be effectively produced despite the washout effect is strong or not. Through a comprehensive analysis, we demonstrate that such a scalar-assisted leptogenesis can typically decrease the viable right-handed neutrino mass scale by two to four orders of magnitude.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14676v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We obtain the value of the magnetic dipole moment of the $\rho$ meson, using data from the BaBar Collaboration for the $e^{+} e^{-} \to \pi^+ \pi^- 2 \pi^0$ process. The considered center of mass energy range is from 0.9 to 1.8 GeV. We describe the $\gamma^* \to 4\pi$ vertex using a vector meson dominance model, including the intermediate resonant contributions relevant at these energies. We find $\mu_\rho = 2.7 \pm 0.3 $ in $e/2 m_\rho$ units. We improve on the previous extracted value, where preliminary data from the same collaboration was used, by considering definite data, better grounded values of the parameters involved and explicit gauge invariant description of the process.</description>

      <title>Towards UV Models of Kinetic Mixing and Portal Matter: A More Complex Dark Matter Sector?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01296v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Portal Matter, with both SM and dark charges, induces KM between the $U(1)_D$ dark photon and the SM gauge fields offering an attractive mechanism by which light thermal DM can obtain its observed relic density. If DM is fermionic, the CMB informs us that it must be Majorana/pseudo-Dirac in nature to avoid temperature-independent $s$-wave annihilation to SM states. How does this fit into a more complete picture with the SM? A first step along this path may not lie far away in energy due to the RGE running of the dark gauge coupling which can becomes non-perturbative before the $\sim 10$'s of TeV range. This implies that $U(1)_D$ must become embedded in a non-Abelian group, $G_D$, before this occurs. The breaking of this group then produces the PM masses and the heavy gauge fields associated with $G_D$ lead to new interactions between the SM and the dark sector. In the past we have examined a set of distinctive phenomenological features associated with this setup, based upon a number of simplifying assumptions. It behooves us to explore the impact of these assumptions on the predictions for possible experimental tests of these models. In past analyses we assumed that DM is a VL, complex singlet under $G_D$. If this assumption is relaxed, the dark sector must be augmented by additional fermion(s) and the scalar fields needed to break the symmetries while generating the needed Majorana-like mass terms for the DM. Here we analyze the simplest extension of this kind wherein the DM lies in a VL doublet of $G_D$, which we take to have the structure $SU(2)_I\times U(1)_{Y_I}$, leading to new phenomenology. We find that given the current LHC search constraints on the masses of heavy gauge bosons, the production of these new dark states with large rates is unlikely at colliders unless they are produced singly in $gg$-fusion or are resonantly enhanced.</description>

      <title>Confinement and Deconfinement in Gauge Theories: A Quantum Field Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.16918v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: After a brief recount of small and large gauge transformations and the nature of observables, we discuss superselection sectors in gauge theories. There are an infinity of them, classified by large gauge transformations. Gauge theory sectors are labelled by the eigenvalues of a complete commuting set (CCS) of these transformations.
  In QED, the standard chemical potential is one such operator generating global U(1). There are many more given by the moments of the electric field on the sphere at infinity. In QCD, the CCS are constructed from the two commuting generators spanning a Cartan subalgebra.
  Large gauge transformations commute with the Hamiltonian and preserve the equations of motion. They form an infinite number of `classical symmetries'. But most of them are anamolous changing the superselection sectors.
  We show that any element of a large gauge transformation can be added to the standard Hamiltonian as a generalised chemical potential without changing field equations and that in QCD, they lead to confined and deconfined phases . A speculation about the physical meaning of these chemical potentials is also made.</description>

      <title>Systematic Improvement of $x$-dependent Unpolarized Nucleon Generalized Parton Distribution in Lattice-QCD Calculation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10829v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a first study of the effects of renormalization-group resummation (RGR) and leading-renormalon resummation (LRR) on the systematic errors of the unpolarized isovector nucleon generalized parton distribution in the framework of large-momentum effective theory (LaMET). This work is done using lattice gauge ensembles generated by the MILC collaboration, consisting of 2+1+1 flavors of highly improved staggered quarks with a physical pion mass at lattice spacing $a\approx 0.09$ fm and a box width $L\approx 5.76$ fm. We present results for the nucleon $H$ and $E$ GPDs with average boost momentum $P_z\approx 2$ GeV at momentum transfers $Q^2=[0, 0.97]$ GeV$^2$ at skewness $\xi=0$ as well as $Q^2\in 0.23$ GeV$^2$ at $\xi=0.1$, renormalized in the $\overline{\rm MS}$ scheme at scale $\mu=2.0$ GeV, with two- and one-loop matching, respectively. We demonstrate that the simultaneous application of RGR and LRR significantly reduces the systematic errors in renormalized matrix elements and distributions for both the zero and nonzero skewness GPDs, and that it is necessary to include both RGR and LRR at higher orders in the matching and renormalization processes.</description>

      <title>CosmoFlow: Python Package for Cosmological Correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03693v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cosmological correlators hold the key to high-energy physics as they probe the earliest moments of our Universe, and conceal hidden mathematical structures. However, even at tree-level, perturbative calculations are limited by technical difficulties absent in flatspace Feynman diagrammatics. In this paper, we introduce CosmoFlow: a new accurate open source Python code that computes tree-level cosmological correlators by tracing their time flow. This code is specifically designed to offer a simple, intuitive and flexible coding environment to theorists, primordial and late-time cosmologists. It can typically serve to complement analytical computations, to provide physical intuition when studying various inflationary theories, and to obtain exact results in regimes that are analytically out of reach. This paper presents the basic structure of CosmoFlow, leads the reader through an in-depth user-guide, and illustrates how it can be used with a series of worked examples. Our hope is that this first building block sets the stage for a bank of theoretical data, which can be nurtured and enhanced collaboratively by the community. CosmoFlow is publicly available on GitHub.</description>

      <title>Color-flavor locked strange stars admixed with mirror dark matter and the observations of compact stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14262v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the structure and the tidal deformability of the color-flavor locked strange stars admixed with mirror dark matter. Assuming the stars in the GW170817 event have a mirror-dark-matter core or a mirror-dark-matter halo, the observations of the central compact object within the supernova remnant HESS J1731-347 and the compact objects in the GW190814 and GW170817 events could be explained simultaneously with a pairing gap much smaller than 200 MeV. In contrast, a pairing gap larger than about 200 MeV must be employed without the consideration of a mirror-dark-matter core (halo). More importantly, we find that for the case of the quartic coefficient $a_{4}&lt; 0.589$, if the mass fraction of the mirror mdark matter ($f_{D}$) of the compact stars in GW170817 is in a certain range (eg., $22.8\% &lt; f_{D} &lt; 77.2\%$ for $a_{4}= 0.55$), the minimum allowed value of the pairing gap could be less than 46.5 MeV (i.e., one half of the value of the strange quark mass which is taken as 93 MeV in this paper), which leads to the result that all astrophysical observations mentioned above could be satisfied without violating the conformal bound or the recently proposed positive trace anomally bound.</description>

      <title>Do high redshift QSOs and GRBs corroborate JWST?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19953v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is reporting unexpectedly massive high redshift galaxies that appear challenging from the $\Lambda$CDM perspective. Interpreted as a problem of cosmological origin, this necessitates Planck underestimating either matter density $\Omega_m$ or physical matter density $\Omega_m h^2$ at higher redshifts. Through standard frequentist profile likelihoods, we identify corroborating quasar (QSO) and gamma-ray burst (GRB) data sets where $\Omega_m$ increases with effective redshift $z_{\textrm{eff}}$, with $\Omega_m$ remaining anomalously large at higher redshifts. While the variation of $\Omega_m$ with $z_{\textrm{eff}}$ is at odds with the $\Lambda$CDM model, demarcating frequentist confidence intervals through differences in $\chi^2$ in profile likelihoods, the prevailing technique in the literature, points to $3.9 \sigma$ and $7.9 \sigma$ tensions between GRBs and QSOs, respectively, and Planck-$\Lambda$CDM. We explain the approximations inherent in the existing profile likelihood literature, and highlight fresh methodology that generalises the prescription. We show that alternative methods, including Bayesian approaches, lead to similar tensions. Finally, in the large sample limit, we show that Feldman-Cousins prescription for frequentist confidence intervals in the presence of a boundary (prior) leads to confidence intervals that are bounded above by Wilks' theorem.</description>

      <title>Obviating PBH overproduction for SIGWs generated by Pulsar Timing Arrays in loop corrected EFT of bounce</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18976v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In order to unravel the present situation of the PBH overproduction problem, our study emphasizes the critical role played by the equation of state (EoS) parameter $w$ within the framework of effective field theory (EFT) of non-singular bounce. Our analysis focuses on a wide range of EoS parameter values that are still optimal for explaining the latest data from the pulsar timing array (PTA). As a result of our study, the most advantageous window, $0.31 \leq w \leq 1/3$, is identified as the location of a substantial PBH abundance, $f_{\rm PBH} \in (10^{-3},1)$ with large mass PBHs, $M_{\rm PBH}\sim {\cal O}(10^{-7}-10^{-3})M_{\odot}$, in the SIGW interpretation of the PTA signal. When confronted with PTA, we find that the overproduction avoiding circumstances are between $1\sigma-2\sigma$, while the EoS parameter lies inside the narrow window, $0.31&lt;w\leq 1/3$. We propose a regularized-renormalized-resummed (RRR) scalar power spectrum that is large enough to produce EoS dependent scalar generated gravitational waves compatible with PTA evidence, while satisfying the perturbativity, causality, and unitarity criteria, within the range of $0.88 \leq c_{s} \leq 1$.</description>

      <title>Krylov complexity of thermal state in early universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03293v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In our work, we perform a detailed study of the Krylov complexity of the thermal state across the entire early universe, encompassing the inflation, radiation-dominated period, and matter-dominated period, which is for the single field inflation. We utilize both the closed system's method and open system's method to achieve this goal. To accurately calculate the Krylov complexity, we purified the thermal state, resulting in a pure state with two modes. Our analysis with both methods indicates that the Krylov complexity will increase during inflation, but will saturate at constant values during the radiation-dominated and matter-dominated periods, where the generation of particles via preheating leads to this evolution. Furthermore, our findings reveal that inflation behaves as a strong dissipative system, while the radiation-dominated and matter-dominated periods act as weak dissipative systems. The chaotic feature during these periods follows a similar trend to the Krylov complexity. This research has the potential to provide new insights into the exploration of Krylov complexity in cosmology.</description>

      <title>Field mixing in a thermal medium: A quantum master equation approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08460v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We studied the nonequilibrium dynamics of the indirect mixing of two (pseudo-)scalar fields induced by their couplings to common decay channels in a medium. The effective non-Markovian quantum master equation (QME) for the two fields' reduced density matrix is derived to leading order in the couplings of the two fields with the medium, but to all orders of the couplings among degrees of freedom in the medium. The self-energy and noise-kernel in the QME satisfy a fluctuation-dissipation relation. The solutions show that an initial expectation value (condensate) of one field induces a condensate of the other field through the indirect mixing and that the populations and coherence of the two fields thermalize and approach to non-vanishing values asymptotically. The nearly-degenerate field masses and coupling strengths resonantly enhance the quantum beats and asymptotic coherence, and induce a prominent dynamics of the vacuum after the switch-on of the couplings. We argue that a time-dependent definitions of particles due to the changing vacuum must be introduced so as to obtain results consistent with the calculations of equilibrium states in the asymptotic limit. A coupling strength hierarchy breaks down the resonant enhancement in the nearly-degenerate case but leads to different power countings of the coupling strengths in the magnitudes of the observables and time-scales in the evolution, suggesting the possibility of detecting extremely long-lived particles using prepared short-lived particles within a practical experimental period.</description>
