      <title>Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Process for Horse Race Betting: A Micro-Macro Analysis of Herding and Informed Bettors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We model the time evolution of single win odds in Japanese horse racing as a stochastic process, deriving an Ornstein--Uhlenbeck process by analyzing the probability dynamics of vote shares and the empirical time series of odds movements. Our framework incorporates two types of bettors: herders, who adjust their bets based on current odds, and fundamentalists, who wager based on a horse's true winning probability. Using data from 3450 Japan Racing Association races in 2008, we identify a microscopic probability rule governing individual bets and a mean-reverting macroscopic pattern in odds convergence. This structure parallels financial markets, where traders' decisions are influenced by market fluctuations, and the interplay between herding and fundamentalist strategies shapes price dynamics. These results highlight the broader applicability of our approach to non-equilibrium financial and betting markets, where mean-reverting dynamics emerge from simple behavioral interactions.</description>

      <title>Haderach Principle: symbiosis of scientific formalism and informal perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current research funding systems are subject to structural imbalances, where formal criteria such as the H-index and the number of publications dominate over the potential and actual scientific prospects of researchers. This leads to the suppression of potential breakthrough research directions and limited access to grants for stochastic (innovative) researchers. In this paper, we propose a dynamic agent-based model of research grant redistribution that takes into account the adaptive mechanism of funding redistribution on the basis of the quality of stochastic research.
  The simulation was conducted on a sample of 21,534 Kazakhstani researchers with 30 iterations, during which the growth of the formal features of stochastic scientists was analyzed under different grant distribution scenarios. A grant redistribution parameter {\lambda} was introduced, which controls adaptive funding. The results showed that at {\lambda}=0.15, stochastic scientists begin to catch up with formal scientists in terms of productivity without destabilizing the scientific system.
  On the basis of the data obtained, a principle called the Haderach principle was proposed. It consists of a dynamic balance between formal (stable) and stochastic (informal) science. The developed approach can be used to optimize grant systems, allowing the elimination of barriers to new scientific directions and potential achievements without losing the stability of traditional schools.
  New concepts and terms of scientific vocabulary are introduced: the Haderach principle, excluded science, supplemented science, grant monopoly, and so on.

      <title>Expected vibroacoustic behaviour of Greek Doric-style temples and its relation with geometrical physics design as part of the intangible cultural heritage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study proposes a new approach to the interpretation of Greek Doric-style temples, based on the integration of its tangible and intangible dimensions as a cultural heritage asset. Rooted on the Greek concept of techne, the work considers a unifying design principle, integrating both structural and functional aspects within the architectural style. A multidisciplinary perspective was adopted, combining archaeological, documentary, and metrological analysis of 41 Doric temples from the 6th to the 4th century BC, located in Greece and Magna Graecia. Starting from the evidence of a statistical correlation among key geometric parameters, these quantitative data are re-interpreted through a geometrical physics vibroacoustic model. The results demonstrate that structural elements act as acoustic attenuators, minimizing environmental forces (particularly wind) on the temple cell's walls. The study also suggests that slight deviations from the classic East-West orientation were adopted to reduce the acoustic coupling with prevailing local winds. The Archaeological Park of Paestum (Salerno, Italy) provides significant evidence for this hypothesis, as its temples, despite their different construction periods, share a consistent orientation, distinct from the city's street grid. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of Greek know-how, being a part of the intangible dimension of cultural heritage and traditional ecological knowledge related to the architectural design in relation to the environmental factors.</description>

      <title>The impact of artificial intelligence: from cognitive costs to global inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine the wide-ranging impact of artificial intelligence on society, focusing on its potential to both help and harm global equity, cognitive abilities, and economic stability. We argue that while artificial intelligence offers significant opportunities for progress in areas like healthcare, education, and scientific research, its rapid growth -- mainly driven by private companies -- may worsen global inequalities, increase dependence on automated systems for cognitive tasks, and disrupt established economic paradigms. We emphasize the critical need for strong governance and ethical guidelines to tackle these issues, urging the academic community to actively participate in creating policies that ensure the benefits of artificial intelligence are shared fairly and its risks are managed effectively.</description>

      <title>Fine structure of phase diagram for social impact theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the social impact theory introduced by Latan\'e is reconsidered. A fully differentiated society is considered; that is, initially every actor has their own opinion. The equivalent of Muller's ratchet guards that -- even for the non-deterministic case (with a positive social temperature) -- any opinion once removed from the opinion space does not appear again. With computer simulation, we construct the phase diagram for Latan\'e model based on the number of surviving opinions after various evolution times. The phase diagram is constructed on the two-dimensional plane of model control parameters responsible for the effective range of interaction among actors and the social temperature. Introducing the Muller's ratchet-like mechanism gives a non-zero chance for any opinion to be removed from the system. We believe that in such a case, for any positive temperature, ultimately a consensus is reached. However, even for a moderate system size, the time to reach consensus is very long. In contrast, for the deterministic case (without social temperature), the system may be frozen with clusters of actors having several different opinions, or even reach the cycle limit (with blinking structures).</description>

      <title>Higher-order dissimilarity measures for hypergraph comparison</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, networks with higher-order interactions have emerged as a powerful tool to model complex systems. Comparing these higher-order systems remains however a challenge. Traditional similarity measures designed for pairwise networks fail indeed to capture salient features of hypergraphs, hence potentially neglecting important information. To address this issue, here we introduce two novel measures, Hyper NetSimile and Hyperedge Portrait Divergence, specifically designed for comparing hypergraphs. These measures take explicitly into account the properties of multi-node interactions, using complementary approaches. They are defined for any arbitrary pair of hypergraphs, of potentially different sizes, thus being widely applicable. We illustrate the effectiveness of these metrics through clustering experiments on synthetic and empirical higher-order networks, showing their ability to correctly group hypergraphs generated by different models and to distinguish real-world systems coming from different contexts. Our results highlight the advantages of using higher-order dissimilarity measures over traditional pairwise representations in capturing the full structural complexity of the systems considered.</description>

      <title>How fast is my model? APS: A framework to systematically assess the computational speed of pedestrian models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A pedestrian model's computation speed impacts the model applicability. However, little attention has been given to this model property in the field of pedestrian dynamics modelling. As such, no framework exists to guide the systematic analysis of a pedestrian models' computational speed. This contribution presents the APS framework (Assess Pedestrian model Speed framework), a framework to determine the speed of (pedestrian) dynamics models. APS features three methods to assess the computational speed of an algorithm, each tailored specifically to the use case of pedestrian models. It also provides guidance in choosing the proper method or methods depending on the goal and requirements of the analysis. APS also includes a new procedure to produce test cases. By using multiple test cases, the framework ensures that the dependency of a model's computational speed on the simulated scenario is assessed systematically.</description>

      <title>Uncovering cooling center usage as an adaptation strategy for hurricane-blackout-heat compound hazards during Hurricane Beryl (2024)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extreme heat and hurricane-induced blackouts could occur simultaneously in the summer, posing great challenges to community health and well-being. Cooling centers serve as a key adaptation strategy to alleviate heat stress, especially among heat-vulnerable populations. This study leverages mobility data to examine how affected communities utilize cooling centers in response to hurricane-blackout-heat compound hazards. Additionally, it examines disparities in cooling center usage, focusing on individuals with access and functional needs (AFNs) who are usually overlooked in emergency management practices. These populations include but are limited to older adults, individuals with limited English proficiency, people with disabilities, those without vehicle access, and lower-income households. Using the empirical case of Hurricane Beryl (2024) in Harris County, Texas, we find no statistically significant difference in visiting formal (established by the government) and informal cooling centers (operated by volunteer organizations). Census block groups closer to the nearest cooling center and those with lower income are more likely to seek shelter from extreme heat at cooling centers in the aftermath of Hurricane Beryl. Lower-income block groups also tend to be situated closer to cooling centers, suggesting that Harris County may have strategically placed them in areas with greater social vulnerability. Furthermore, we investigate visiting hotels as an alternative but more expensive adaptation strategy during Hurricane Beryl. Between these two adaptation options, shorter distances to cooling centers, lower income, and elder age are statistically significantly associated with a higher probability of visiting cooling centers rather than hotels, while limited English proficiency significantly decreases such probability.</description>

      <title>Opinion inertia and coarsening in the Persistent Voter model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02483v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the Persistent Voter model (PVM), a variant of the Voter model (VM) that includes transient, dynamically-induced zealots. Due to peer reinforcement, the internal confidence $\eta_i$ of a normal voter increases by steps of size $\Delta\eta$ and once it gets above a given threshold, it becomes a zealot. Then, its opinion remains frozen until enough interactions with the opposite opinion occur and its confidence is reset. No longer a zealot, the regular voter may change opinion once again. This opinion inertia mechanism, albeit simplified, is responsible for an effective surface tension and the PVM has a crossover from a fluctuation-driven dynamics, as in the VM, to a curvature-driven one, as in the Ising Model at low temperature (IM0). The average time $\tau$ to attain consensus is non-monotonic on $\Delta\eta$ and has a minimum at $\Delta\eta_{\min}$. In this paper we clarify the mechanisms that accelerate the system towards consensus close to $\Delta\eta_{\min}$. Close to the crossover at $\Delta\eta_{\min}$, the intermediate region around the domains where the regular voters accumulate (the active region, AR) is large and the surface tension, albeit small, is still enough to keep the shape and reduce the fragmentation of the domains. The large size of the AR in the region of $\Delta\eta_{\min}$ has two important effects that accelerates the dynamics. First, it dislodges the zealots in the bulk of the domains and second, it maximally suppresses the slowly-evolving stripes that normally form in Ising-like models. This suggests the importance of understanding the role of the AR, where the change of opinion is facilitated, and the interplay between regular voters and zealots when attempting to disrupt polarized states.</description>

      <title>Scaling of connectivity metrics in river networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17033v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rivers exhibit fractal-like properties that are associated with scaling laws linking geometry and size. The optimal channel network (OCN) model, which is a mathematically tractable representation of river networks often used in theoretical studies, is based on the fractal properties of rivers and consequently reproduces geometric scaling laws. However, purely geometric relationships may not fully capture the interaction between river structure and species' movement strategies that is most relevant to many large-scale ecological processes. In contrast, connectivity, which is a concept that blends habitat geometry and individual movement, has been shown both theoretically and empirically to influence relevant large-scale ecological outcomes across a broad array of ecosystems. Here, we analyze networks from more than 1000 major rivers around the world, including the Amazon, Mississippi, and Nile, to investigate how river network connectivity metrics scale with system size. Specifically, we found clear power-law scaling of both the harmonic centrality and betweenness centrality network connectivity metrics. To assess the extent to which OCNs can capture these empirical connectivity patterns, we generated synthetic river networks by fitting an OCN model to each real river. We found excellent agreement between empirical and OCN-based scaling laws, supporting the notion that OCNs can accurately represent rivers in network-based models and analyses. Finally, we examined the robustness of the connectivity scaling laws to species movement strategies ranging from ideal shortest-path navigation to suboptimal random-path navigation. Surprisingly, we found that random navigation breaks the power-law scaling relationship for harmonic centrality, but not for betweenness centrality.</description>
