      <title>Music2P: A Multi-Modal AI-Driven Tool for Simplifying Album Cover Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In today's music industry, album cover design is as crucial as the music itself, reflecting the artist's vision and brand. However, many AI-driven album cover services require subscriptions or technical expertise, limiting accessibility. To address these challenges, we developed Music2P, an open-source, multi-modal AI-driven tool that streamlines album cover creation, making it efficient, accessible, and cost-effective through Ngrok. Music2P automates the design process using techniques such as Bootstrapping Language Image Pre-training (BLIP), music-to-text conversion (LP-music-caps), image segmentation (LoRA), and album cover and QR code generation (ControlNet). This paper demonstrates the Music2P interface, details our application of these technologies, and outlines future improvements. Our ultimate goal is to provide a tool that empowers musicians and producers, especially those with limited resources or expertise, to create compelling album covers.</description>

      <title>Contextual Cross-Modal Attention for Audio-Visual Deepfake Detection and Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01532v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the digital age, the emergence of deepfakes and synthetic media presents a significant threat to societal and political integrity. Deepfakes based on multi-modal manipulation, such as audio-visual, are more realistic and pose a greater threat. Current multi-modal deepfake detectors are often based on the attention-based fusion of heterogeneous data streams from multiple modalities. However, the heterogeneous nature of the data (such as audio and visual signals) creates a distributional modality gap and poses a significant challenge in effective fusion and hence multi-modal deepfake detection. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-modal attention framework based on recurrent neural networks (RNNs) that leverages contextual information for audio-visual deepfake detection. The proposed approach applies attention to multi-modal multi-sequence representations and learns the contributing features among them for deepfake detection and localization. Thorough experimental validations on audio-visual deepfake datasets, namely FakeAVCeleb, AV-Deepfake1M, TVIL, and LAV-DF datasets, demonstrate the efficacy of our approach. Cross-comparison with the published studies demonstrates superior performance of our approach with an improved accuracy and precision by 3.47% and 2.05% in deepfake detection and localization, respectively. Thus, obtaining state-of-the-art performance. To facilitate reproducibility, the code and the datasets information is available at https://github.com/vcbsl/audiovisual-deepfake/.</description>

      <title>Multiple Contexts and Frequencies Aggregation Network forDeepfake Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deepfake detection faces increasing challenges since the fast growth of generative models in developing massive and diverse Deepfake technologies. Recent advances rely on introducing heuristic features from spatial or frequency domains rather than modeling general forgery features within backbones. To address this issue, we turn to the backbone design with two intuitive priors from spatial and frequency detectors, \textit{i.e.,} learning robust spatial attributes and frequency distributions that are discriminative for real and fake samples. To this end, we propose an efficient network for face forgery detection named MkfaNet, which consists of two core modules. For spatial contexts, we design a Multi-Kernel Aggregator that adaptively selects organ features extracted by multiple convolutions for modeling subtle facial differences between real and fake faces. For the frequency components, we propose a Multi-Frequency Aggregator to process different bands of frequency components by adaptively reweighing high-frequency and low-frequency features. Comprehensive experiments on seven popular deepfake detection benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed MkfaNet variants achieve superior performances in both within-domain and across-domain evaluations with impressive efficiency of parameter usage.</description>

      <title>SynopGround: A Large-Scale Dataset for Multi-Paragraph Video Grounding from TV Dramas and Synopses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Video grounding is a fundamental problem in multimodal content understanding, aiming to localize specific natural language queries in an untrimmed video. However, current video grounding datasets merely focus on simple events and are either limited to shorter videos or brief sentences, which hinders the model from evolving toward stronger multimodal understanding capabilities. To address these limitations, we present a large-scale video grounding dataset named SynopGround, in which more than 2800 hours of videos are sourced from popular TV dramas and are paired with accurately localized human-written synopses. Each paragraph in the synopsis serves as a language query and is manually annotated with precise temporal boundaries in the long video. These paragraph queries are tightly correlated to each other and contain a wealth of abstract expressions summarizing video storylines and specific descriptions portraying event details, which enables the model to learn multimodal perception on more intricate concepts over longer context dependencies. Based on the dataset, we further introduce a more complex setting of video grounding dubbed Multi-Paragraph Video Grounding (MPVG), which takes as input multiple paragraphs and a long video for grounding each paragraph query to its temporal interval. In addition, we propose a novel Local-Global Multimodal Reasoner (LGMR) to explicitly model the local-global structures of long-term multimodal inputs for MPVG. Our method provides an effective baseline solution to the multi-paragraph video grounding problem. Extensive experiments verify the proposed model's effectiveness as well as its superiority in long-term multi-paragraph video grounding over prior state-of-the-arts. Dataset and code are publicly available. Project page: https://synopground.github.io/.</description>

      <title>MMPKUBase: A Comprehensive and High-quality Chinese Multi-modal Knowledge Graph</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-modal knowledge graphs have emerged as a powerful approach for information representation, combining data from different modalities such as text, images, and videos. While several such graphs have been constructed and have played important roles in applications like visual question answering and recommendation systems, challenges persist in their development. These include the scarcity of high-quality Chinese knowledge graphs and limited domain coverage in existing multi-modal knowledge graphs. This paper introduces MMPKUBase, a robust and extensive Chinese multi-modal knowledge graph that covers diverse domains, including birds, mammals, ferns, and more, comprising over 50,000 entities and over 1 million filtered images. To ensure data quality, we employ Prototypical Contrastive Learning and the Isolation Forest algorithm to refine the image data. Additionally, we have developed a user-friendly platform to facilitate image attribute exploration.</description>

      <title>IDNet: A Novel Dataset for Identity Document Analysis and Fraud Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effective fraud detection and analysis of government-issued identity documents, such as passports, driver's licenses, and identity cards, are essential in thwarting identity theft and bolstering security on online platforms. The training of accurate fraud detection and analysis tools depends on the availability of extensive identity document datasets. However, current publicly available benchmark datasets for identity document analysis, including MIDV-500, MIDV-2020, and FMIDV, fall short in several respects: they offer a limited number of samples, cover insufficient varieties of fraud patterns, and seldom include alterations in critical personal identifying fields like portrait images, limiting their utility in training models capable of detecting realistic frauds while preserving privacy.
  In response to these shortcomings, our research introduces a new benchmark dataset, IDNet, designed to advance privacy-preserving fraud detection efforts. The IDNet dataset comprises 837,060 images of synthetically generated identity documents, totaling approximately 490 gigabytes, categorized into 20 types from $10$ U.S. states and 10 European countries. We evaluate the utility and present use cases of the dataset, illustrating how it can aid in training privacy-preserving fraud detection methods, facilitating the generation of camera and video capturing of identity documents, and testing schema unification and other identity document management functionalities.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Human Action Recognition and Violence Detection Through Deep Learning Audiovisual Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a hybrid fusion-based deep learning approach based on two different modalities, audio and video, to improve human activity recognition and violence detection in public places. To take advantage of audiovisual fusion, late fusion, intermediate fusion, and hybrid fusion-based deep learning (HFBDL) are used and compared. Since the objective is to detect and recognize human violence in public places, Real-life violence situation (RLVS) dataset is expanded and used. Simulating results of HFBDL show 96.67\% accuracy on validation data, which is more accurate than the other state-of-the-art methods on this dataset. To showcase our model's ability in real-world scenarios, another dataset of 54 sounded videos of both violent and non-violent situations was recorded. The model could successfully detect 52 out of 54 videos correctly. The proposed method shows a promising performance on real scenarios. Thus, it can be used for human action recognition and violence detection in public places for security purposes.</description>

      <title>Case-based reasoning approach for diagnostic screening of children with developmental delays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: According to the World Health Organization, the population of children with developmental delays constitutes approximately 6% to 9% of the total population. Based on the number of newborns in Huaibei, Anhui Province, China, in 2023 (94,420), it is estimated that there are about 7,500 cases (suspected cases of developmental delays) of suspicious cases annually. Early identification and appropriate early intervention for these children can significantly reduce the wastage of medical resources and societal costs. International research indicates that the optimal period for intervention in children with developmental delays is before the age of six, with the golden treatment period being before three and a half years of age. Studies have shown that children with developmental delays who receive early intervention exhibit significant improvement in symptoms; some may even fully recover. This research adopts a hybrid model combining a CNN-Transformer model with Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) to enhance the screening efficiency for children with developmental delays. The CNN-Transformer model is an excellent model for image feature extraction and recognition, effectively identifying features in bone age images to determine bone age. CBR is a technique for solving problems based on similar cases; it solves current problems based on past experiences, similar to how humans solve problems through learning from experience. Given CBR's memory capability to judge and compare new cases based on previously stored old cases, it is suitable for application in support systems with latent and variable characteristics. Therefore, this study utilizes the CNN-Transformer-CBR to establish a screening system for children with developmental delays, aiming to improve screening efficiency.</description>

      <title>Dise\~no de sonido para producciones audiovisuales e historias sonoras en el aula. Hacia una docencia creativa mediante el uso de herramientas inteligentes</title>

Abstract: This study aims to share a teaching experience teaching sound design for audiovisual productions and compares different projects tackled by students. It is not intended to be a comparative analysis of different types of teaching but rather an analysis of different problems observed in different profiles of students of the subject who study it in different grades. The world of audio can be very interesting for a large part of the students, both those with creative and technical inclinations. Musical creation and production, synchronization with images, dubbing, etc. They are disciplines that are generally interesting but can have a very high barrier to entry due to their great technical complexity. Sometimes it can take weeks or even months for the uninitiated to begin to use audio editing programs with the necessary ease, which are not always particularly intuitive for students. Learning through the use of PBL methodologies generates, in our experience, results much superior to those that can be observed through the use of other teaching methods such as master classes. Students acquire technical skills while developing creative projects in which they get personally involved. Despite everything mentioned above, most interactions between teachers and students focus on aspects of technical correction. From different parameters in reverbs (such as pre-delay, decay, modulation...) to how to correctly adjust compressors, noise gates, etc.; The number of tools with which to work with audio is incredibly extensive, as well as many of its features that can present serious differences depending on their manufacturers.</description>

      <title>COM Kitchens: An Unedited Overhead-view Video Dataset as a Vision-Language Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Procedural video understanding is gaining attention in the vision and language community. Deep learning-based video analysis requires extensive data. Consequently, existing works often use web videos as training resources, making it challenging to query instructional contents from raw video observations. To address this issue, we propose a new dataset, COM Kitchens. The dataset consists of unedited overhead-view videos captured by smartphones, in which participants performed food preparation based on given recipes. Fixed-viewpoint video datasets often lack environmental diversity due to high camera setup costs. We used modern wide-angle smartphone lenses to cover cooking counters from sink to cooktop in an overhead view, capturing activity without in-person assistance. With this setup, we collected a diverse dataset by distributing smartphones to participants. With this dataset, we propose the novel video-to-text retrieval task Online Recipe Retrieval (OnRR) and new video captioning domain Dense Video Captioning on unedited Overhead-View videos (DVC-OV). Our experiments verified the capabilities and limitations of current web-video-based SOTA methods in handling these tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.10709v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present Emu Video, a text-to-video generation model that factorizes the generation into two steps: first generating an image conditioned on the text, and then generating a video conditioned on the text and the generated image. We identify critical design decisions--adjusted noise schedules for diffusion, and multi-stage training that enable us to directly generate high quality and high resolution videos, without requiring a deep cascade of models as in prior work. In human evaluations, our generated videos are strongly preferred in quality compared to all prior work--81% vs. Google's Imagen Video, 90% vs. Nvidia's PYOCO, and 96% vs. Meta's Make-A-Video. Our model outperforms commercial solutions such as RunwayML's Gen2 and Pika Labs. Finally, our factorizing approach naturally lends itself to animating images based on a user's text prompt, where our generations are preferred 96% over prior work.</description>

      <title>Where Do We Go from Here? Multi-scale Allocentric Relational Inference from Natural Spatial Descriptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16364v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When communicating routes in natural language, the concept of acquired spatial knowledge is crucial for geographic information retrieval (GIR) and in spatial cognitive research. However, NLP navigation studies often overlook the impact of such acquired knowledge on textual descriptions. Current navigation studies concentrate on egocentric local descriptions (e.g., `it will be on your right') that require reasoning over the agent's local perception. These instructions are typically given as a sequence of steps, with each action-step explicitly mentioning and being followed by a landmark that the agent can use to verify they are on the right path (e.g., `turn right and then you will see...'). In contrast, descriptions based on knowledge acquired through a map provide a complete view of the environment and capture its overall structure. These instructions (e.g., `it is south of Central Park and a block north of a police station') are typically non-sequential, contain allocentric relations, with multiple spatial relations and implicit actions, without any explicit verification. This paper introduces the Rendezvous (RVS) task and dataset, which includes 10,404 examples of English geospatial instructions for reaching a target location using map-knowledge. Our analysis reveals that RVS exhibits a richer use of spatial allocentric relations, and requires resolving more spatial relations simultaneously compared to previous text-based navigation benchmarks.</description>

      <title>HPC: Hierarchical Progressive Coding Framework for Volumetric Video</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09026v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Volumetric video based on Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) holds vast potential for various 3D applications, but its substantial data volume poses significant challenges for compression and transmission. Current NeRF compression lacks the flexibility to adjust video quality and bitrate within a single model for various network and device capacities. To address these issues, we propose HPC, a novel hierarchical progressive volumetric video coding framework achieving variable bitrate using a single model. Specifically, HPC introduces a hierarchical representation with a multi-resolution residual radiance field to reduce temporal redundancy in long-duration sequences while simultaneously generating various levels of detail. Then, we propose an end-to-end progressive learning approach with a multi-rate-distortion loss function to jointly optimize both hierarchical representation and compression. Our HPC trained only once can realize multiple compression levels, while the current methods need to train multiple fixed-bitrate models for different rate-distortion (RD) tradeoffs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HPC achieves flexible quality levels with variable bitrate by a single model and exhibits competitive RD performance, even outperforming fixed-bitrate models across various datasets.</description>

      <title>Exposure Completing for Temporally Consistent Neural High Dynamic Range Video Rendering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13309v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High dynamic range (HDR) video rendering from low dynamic range (LDR) videos where frames are of alternate exposure encounters significant challenges, due to the exposure change and absence at each time stamp. The exposure change and absence make existing methods generate flickering HDR results. In this paper, we propose a novel paradigm to render HDR frames via completing the absent exposure information, hence the exposure information is complete and consistent. Our approach involves interpolating neighbor LDR frames in the time dimension to reconstruct LDR frames for the absent exposures. Combining the interpolated and given LDR frames, the complete set of exposure information is available at each time stamp. This benefits the fusing process for HDR results, reducing noise and ghosting artifacts therefore improving temporal consistency. Extensive experimental evaluations on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, highlighting the importance of absent exposure completing in HDR video rendering. The code is available at https://github.com/cuijiahao666/NECHDR.</description>

Abstract: With the rapid expansion of e-commerce, more consumers have become accustomed to making purchases via livestreaming. Accurately identifying the products being sold by salespeople, i.e., livestreaming product retrieval (LPR), poses a fundamental and daunting challenge. The LPR task encompasses three primary dilemmas in real-world scenarios: 1) the recognition of intended products from distractor products present in the background; 2) the video-image heterogeneity that the appearance of products showcased in live streams often deviates substantially from standardized product images in stores; 3) there are numerous confusing products with subtle visual nuances in the shop. To tackle these challenges, we propose the Spatiotemporal Graphing Multi-modal Network (SGMN). First, we employ a text-guided attention mechanism that leverages the spoken content of salespeople to guide the model to focus toward intended products, emphasizing their salience over cluttered background products. Second, a long-range spatiotemporal graph network is further designed to achieve both instance-level interaction and frame-level matching, solving the misalignment caused by video-image heterogeneity. Third, we propose a multi-modal hard example mining, assisting the model in distinguishing highly similar products with fine-grained features across the video-image-text domain. Through extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments, we demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed SGMN model, surpassing the state-of-the-art methods by a substantial margin.

      <title>Hallu-PI: Evaluating Hallucination in Multi-modal Large Language Models within Perturbed Inputs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01355</link>

Abstract: Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on various visual-language understanding and generation tasks. However, MLLMs occasionally generate content inconsistent with the given images, which is known as "hallucination". Prior works primarily center on evaluating hallucination using standard, unperturbed benchmarks, which overlook the prevalent occurrence of perturbed inputs in real-world scenarios-such as image cropping or blurring-that are critical for a comprehensive assessment of MLLMs' hallucination. In this paper, to bridge this gap, we propose Hallu-PI, the first benchmark designed to evaluate Hallucination in MLLMs within Perturbed Inputs. Specifically, Hallu-PI consists of seven perturbed scenarios, containing 1,260 perturbed images from 11 object types. Each image is accompanied by detailed annotations, which include fine-grained hallucination types, such as existence, attribute, and relation. We equip these annotations with a rich set of questions, making Hallu-PI suitable for both discriminative and generative tasks. Extensive experiments on 12 mainstream MLLMs, such as GPT-4V and Gemini-Pro Vision, demonstrate that these models exhibit significant hallucinations on Hallu-PI, which is not observed in unperturbed scenarios. Furthermore, our research reveals a severe bias in MLLMs' ability to handle different types of hallucinations. We also design two baselines specifically for perturbed scenarios, namely Perturbed-Reminder and Perturbed-ICL. We hope that our study will bring researchers' attention to the limitations of MLLMs when dealing with perturbed inputs, and spur further investigations to address this issue. Our code and datasets are publicly available at https://github.com/NJUNLP/Hallu-PI.</description>
