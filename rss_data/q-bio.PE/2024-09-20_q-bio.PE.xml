      <title>Integrating systematic surveys with historical data to model the distribution of Ornithodoros turicata americanus, a vector of epidemiological concern in North America</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Globally, vector-borne diseases are increasing in distribution and frequency, affecting humans, domestic animals and livestock, and wildlife. Science-based management and prevention of these diseases requires a sound understanding of the distribution and environmental requirements of the vectors and hosts involved in disease transmission. Integrated Species Distribution Models (ISDM) account for diverse data types through hierarchical modeling and represent a significant advancement in species distribution modeling that have not yet been leveraged in disease ecology. We used this approach, as implemented in the recently developed R package RISDM, to assess the distribution of the soft tick subspecies Ornithodoros turicata americanus. We created an ISDM for O. t. americanus, using systematically collected field data and historical records of this tick species in the southeastern US, to predict its distribution and assess potential correlations with environmental variables. Given the novelty of this method, we compared the results to a conventional Maxent SDM and validated the results through data partitioning using true skills statistics (TSS), sensitivity, and area under the ROC curve (AUC) metrics. We found that a combination of climatic variables describing seasonality and temperature extremes, along with the amount of sand in the soil, determined the predicted intensity of occurrence of this tick species. When projected in geographic space, this distribution model predicted 62% of Florida as suitable habitat for this tick species. The ISDM presented a higher TSS and AUC than the Maxent conventional model, while sensitivity was similar between both models. Our case example shows the utility of ISDMs in disease ecology studies and highlights the broad range of geographic suitability for this important disease vector.</description>

      <title>Anomalous behavior of Replicator dynamics for the Prisoner's Dilemma on diluted lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In diluted lattices, cooperation is often enhanced at specific densities, particularly near the percolation threshold for stochastic updating rules. However, the Replicator rule, despite being probabilistic, does not follow this trend. We find that this anomalous behavior is caused by structures formed by holes and defectors, which prevent some agents from experiencing fluctuations, thereby restricting the free flow of information across the network. As a result, the system becomes trapped in a frozen state, though this can be disrupted by introducing perturbations. Finally, we provide a more quantitative analysis of the relationship between the percolation threshold and cooperation, tracking its development within clusters of varying sizes and demonstrating how the percolation threshold shapes the fundamental structures of the lattice.</description>

      <title>Generalised correlations in disordered dynamical systems: Insights from the many-species Lotka-Volterra model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the study of disordered systems, one often chooses a matrix of independent identically distributed interaction coefficients to represent the quenched random couplings between components, perhaps with some symmetry constraint or correlations between diagonally opposite pairs of elements. However, a more general set of couplings, which still preserves the statistical interchangeability of the components, could involve correlations between interaction coefficients sharing only a single row or column index. These correlations have been shown to arise naturally in systems such as the generalised Lotka-Volterra equations (gLVEs). In this work, we perform a dynamic mean-field analysis to understand how single-index correlations affect the dynamics and stability of disordered systems, taking the gLVEs as our example. We show that in-row correlations raise the level of noise in the mean field process, even when the overall variance of the interaction coefficients is held constant. We also see that correlations between transpose pairs of rows and columns can either enhance or suppress feedback effects, depending on the sign of the correlation coefficient. In the context of the gLVEs, in-row and transpose row/column correlations thus affect both the species survival rate and the stability of ecological equilibria.</description>

      <title>How to study the evolution of parametrized games?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11748v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I consider a family of games with corresponding payoff matrices, parametrized by the parameter The informal question of interest is: what game is the best? Instead of attempting to suggest a more or less arbitrary definition of the best game, I allow natural selection to find it through honest competition between games. Specifically, I consider a model of a community composed of populations with different payoff matrices and study the natural selection between the populations. The outcome of the community evolution determines the best game. I develop here a mathematical toolbox, that allows the study of evolution of parametrized games. The developed approach is applied to three examples of parametrized games from the literature: local replicator dynamics, pairwise competition and the game of alleles in diploid genomes.</description>

      <title>Opponent Shaping for Antibody Development</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10588v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Anti-viral therapies are typically designed or evolved towards the current strains of a virus. In learning terms, this corresponds to a myopic best response, i.e., not considering the possible adaptive moves of the opponent. However, therapy-induced selective pressures act on viral antigens to drive the emergence of mutated strains, against which initial therapies have reduced efficacy. To motivate our work, we consider antibody designs that target not only the current viral strains but also the wide range of possible future variants that the virus might evolve into under the evolutionary pressure exerted by said antibodies. Building on a computational model of binding between antibodies and viral antigens (the Absolut! framework), we design and implement a genetic simulation of the viral evolutionary escape. Crucially, this allows our antibody optimisation algorithm to consider and influence the entire escape curve of the virus, i.e. to guide (or ''shape'') the viral evolution. This is inspired by opponent shaping which, in general-sum learning, accounts for the adaptation of the co-player rather than playing a myopic best response. Hence we call the optimised antibodies shapers. Within our simulations, we demonstrate that our shapers target both current and simulated future viral variants, outperforming the antibodies chosen in a myopic way. Furthermore, we show that shapers exert specific evolutionary pressure on the virus compared to myopic antibodies. Altogether, shapers modify the evolutionary trajectories of viral strains and minimise the viral escape compared to their myopic counterparts. While this is a simple model, we hope that our proposed paradigm will enable the discovery of better long-lived vaccines and antibody therapies in the future, enabled by rapid advancements in the capabilities of simulation tools.</description>
