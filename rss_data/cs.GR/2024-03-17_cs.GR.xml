      <title>Open-Universe Indoor Scene Generation using LLM Program Synthesis and Uncurated Object Databases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a system for generating indoor scenes in response to text prompts. The prompts are not limited to a fixed vocabulary of scene descriptions, and the objects in generated scenes are not restricted to a fixed set of object categories -- we call this setting indoor scene generation. Unlike most prior work on indoor scene generation, our system does not require a large training dataset of existing 3D scenes. Instead, it leverages the world knowledge encoded in pre-trained large language models (LLMs) to synthesize programs in a domain-specific layout language that describe objects and spatial relations between them. Executing such a program produces a specification of a constraint satisfaction problem, which the system solves using a gradient-based optimization scheme to produce object positions and orientations. To produce object geometry, the system retrieves 3D meshes from a database. Unlike prior work which uses databases of category-annotated, mutually-aligned meshes, we develop a pipeline using vision-language models (VLMs) to retrieve meshes from massive databases of un-annotated, inconsistently-aligned meshes. Experimental evaluations show that our system outperforms generative models trained on 3D data for traditional, closed-universe scene generation tasks; it also outperforms a recent LLM-based layout generation method on open-universe scene generation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I humbly introduce a concept I call "Fregean flows," a graph theoretic representation of classical logic, to show how higher-dimensional graph characteristics might be useful to prove or perhaps at best show the provability of simple deductive statements typically represented as one-dimensional strings of characters. I apply these to a very simple proof, namely proving the equivalence of two definitions for an Abelian group G, an if-and-only-if statement, using a re-representation of statements as vertices and both conjunctions and implications as differently coloured edges. This re-representation of an if-and-only-if is simple but shows unexpected geometry, and I discuss its possible utility in terms of provability through ideas of graph topology, similarities of graph contraction to deductive elimination, and recursion.</description>

      <title>A survey of synthetic data augmentation methods in computer vision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The standard approach to tackling computer vision problems is to train deep convolutional neural network (CNN) models using large-scale image datasets which are representative of the target task. However, in many scenarios, it is often challenging to obtain sufficient image data for the target task. Data augmentation is a way to mitigate this challenge. A common practice is to explicitly transform existing images in desired ways so as to create the required volume and variability of training data necessary to achieve good generalization performance. In situations where data for the target domain is not accessible, a viable workaround is to synthesize training data from scratch--i.e., synthetic data augmentation. This paper presents an extensive review of synthetic data augmentation techniques. It covers data synthesis approaches based on realistic 3D graphics modeling, neural style transfer (NST), differential neural rendering, and generative artificial intelligence (AI) techniques such as generative adversarial networks (GANs) and variational autoencoders (VAEs). For each of these classes of methods, we focus on the important data generation and augmentation techniques, general scope of application and specific use-cases, as well as existing limitations and possible workarounds. Additionally, we provide a summary of common synthetic datasets for training computer vision models, highlighting the main features, application domains and supported tasks. Finally, we discuss the effectiveness of synthetic data augmentation methods. Since this is the first paper to explore synthetic data augmentation methods in great detail, we are hoping to equip readers with the necessary background information and in-depth knowledge of existing methods and their attendant issues.</description>

      <title>ANIM: Accurate Neural Implicit Model for Human Reconstruction from a single RGB-D image</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent progress in human shape learning, shows that neural implicit models are effective in generating 3D human surfaces from limited number of views, and even from a single RGB image. However, existing monocular approaches still struggle to recover fine geometric details such as face, hands or cloth wrinkles. They are also easily prone to depth ambiguities that result in distorted geometries along the camera optical axis. In this paper, we explore the benefits of incorporating depth observations in the reconstruction process by introducing ANIM, a novel method that reconstructs arbitrary 3D human shapes from single-view RGB-D images with an unprecedented level of accuracy. Our model learns geometric details from both multi-resolution pixel-aligned and voxel-aligned features to leverage depth information and enable spatial relationships, mitigating depth ambiguities. We further enhance the quality of the reconstructed shape by introducing a depth-supervision strategy, which improves the accuracy of the signed distance field estimation of points that lie on the reconstructed surface. Experiments demonstrate that ANIM outperforms state-of-the-art works that use RGB, surface normals, point cloud or RGB-D data as input. In addition, we introduce ANIM-Real, a new multi-modal dataset comprising high-quality scans paired with consumer-grade RGB-D camera, and our protocol to fine-tune ANIM, enabling high-quality reconstruction from real-world human capture.</description>

      <title>Lodge: A Coarse to Fine Diffusion Network for Long Dance Generation Guided by the Characteristic Dance Primitives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose Lodge, a network capable of generating extremely long dance sequences conditioned on given music. We design Lodge as a two-stage coarse to fine diffusion architecture, and propose the characteristic dance primitives that possess significant expressiveness as intermediate representations between two diffusion models. The first stage is global diffusion, which focuses on comprehending the coarse-level music-dance correlation and production characteristic dance primitives. In contrast, the second-stage is the local diffusion, which parallelly generates detailed motion sequences under the guidance of the dance primitives and choreographic rules. In addition, we propose a Foot Refine Block to optimize the contact between the feet and the ground, enhancing the physical realism of the motion. Our approach can parallelly generate dance sequences of extremely long length, striking a balance between global choreographic patterns and local motion quality and expressiveness. Extensive experiments validate the efficacy of our method.</description>

      <title>Inverse Garment and Pattern Modeling with a Differentiable Simulator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06841v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The capability to generate simulation-ready garment models from 3D shapes of clothed humans will significantly enhance the interpretability of captured geometry of real garments, as well as their faithful reproduction in the virtual world. This will have notable impact on fields like shape capture in social VR, and virtual try-on in the fashion industry. To align with the garment modeling process standardized by the fashion industry as well as cloth simulation softwares, it is required to recover 2D patterns. This involves an inverse garment design problem, which is the focus of our work here: Starting with an arbitrary target garment geometry, our system estimates an animatable garment model by automatically adjusting its corresponding 2D template pattern, along with the material parameters of the physics-based simulation (PBS). Built upon a differentiable cloth simulator, the optimization process is directed towards minimizing the deviation of the simulated garment shape from the target geometry. Moreover, our produced patterns meet manufacturing requirements such as left-to-right-symmetry, making them suited for reverse garment fabrication. We validate our approach on examples of different garment types, and show that our method faithfully reproduces both the draped garment shape and the sewing pattern.</description>

      <title>DyST: Towards Dynamic Neural Scene Representations on Real-World Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.06020v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Visual understanding of the world goes beyond the semantics and flat structure of individual images. In this work, we aim to capture both the 3D structure and dynamics of real-world scenes from monocular real-world videos. Our Dynamic Scene Transformer (DyST) model leverages recent work in neural scene representation to learn a latent decomposition of monocular real-world videos into scene content, per-view scene dynamics, and camera pose. This separation is achieved through a novel co-training scheme on monocular videos and our new synthetic dataset DySO. DyST learns tangible latent representations for dynamic scenes that enable view generation with separate control over the camera and the content of the scene.</description>

      <title>Animatable Gaussians: Learning Pose-dependent Gaussian Maps for High-fidelity Human Avatar Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16096v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modeling animatable human avatars from RGB videos is a long-standing and challenging problem. Recent works usually adopt MLP-based neural radiance fields (NeRF) to represent 3D humans, but it remains difficult for pure MLPs to regress pose-dependent garment details. To this end, we introduce Animatable Gaussians, a new avatar representation that leverages powerful 2D CNNs and 3D Gaussian splatting to create high-fidelity avatars. To associate 3D Gaussians with the animatable avatar, we learn a parametric template from the input videos, and then parameterize the template on two front \&amp; back canonical Gaussian maps where each pixel represents a 3D Gaussian. The learned template is adaptive to the wearing garments for modeling looser clothes like dresses. Such template-guided 2D parameterization enables us to employ a powerful StyleGAN-based CNN to learn the pose-dependent Gaussian maps for modeling detailed dynamic appearances. Furthermore, we introduce a pose projection strategy for better generalization given novel poses. Overall, our method can create lifelike avatars with dynamic, realistic and generalized appearances. Experiments show that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches. Code: https://github.com/lizhe00/AnimatableGaussians</description>

      <title>GAPS: Geometry-Aware, Physics-Based, Self-Supervised Neural Garment Draping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.01490v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent neural, physics-based modeling of garment deformations allows faster and visually aesthetic results as opposed to the existing methods. Material-specific parameters are used by the formulation to control the garment inextensibility. This delivers unrealistic results with physically implausible stretching. Oftentimes, the draped garment is pushed inside the body which is either corrected by an expensive post-processing, thus adding to further inconsistent stretching; or by deploying a separate training regime for each body type, restricting its scalability. Additionally, the flawed skinning process deployed by existing methods produces incorrect results on loose garments. In this paper, we introduce a geometrical constraint to the existing formulation that is collision-aware and imposes garment inextensibility wherever possible. Thus, we obtain realistic results where draped clothes stretch only while covering bigger body regions. Furthermore, we propose a geometry-aware garment skinning method by defining a body-garment closeness measure which works for all garment types, especially the loose ones.</description>

      <title>EMDM: Efficient Motion Diffusion Model for Fast and High-Quality Motion Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02256v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce Efficient Motion Diffusion Model (EMDM) for fast and high-quality human motion generation. Current state-of-the-art generative diffusion models have produced impressive results but struggle to achieve fast generation without sacrificing quality. On the one hand, previous works, like motion latent diffusion, conduct diffusion within a latent space for efficiency, but learning such a latent space can be a non-trivial effort. On the other hand, accelerating generation by naively increasing the sampling step size, e.g., DDIM, often leads to quality degradation as it fails to approximate the complex denoising distribution. To address these issues, we propose EMDM, which captures the complex distribution during multiple sampling steps in the diffusion model, allowing for much fewer sampling steps and significant acceleration in generation. This is achieved by a conditional denoising diffusion GAN to capture multimodal data distributions among arbitrary (and potentially larger) step sizes conditioned on control signals, enabling fewer-step motion sampling with high fidelity and diversity. To minimize undesired motion artifacts, geometric losses are imposed during network learning. As a result, EMDM achieves real-time motion generation and significantly improves the efficiency of motion diffusion models compared to existing methods while achieving high-quality motion generation. Our code will be publicly available upon publication.</description>
