      <title>Towards Code Generation for Octree-Based Multigrid Solvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel method designed to generate multigrid solvers optimized for octree-based software frameworks. Our approach focuses on accurately capturing local features within a domain while leveraging the efficiency inherent in multigrid techniques. We outline the essential steps involved in generating specialized kernels for local refinement and communication routines, integrating on-the-fly interpolations to seamlessly transfer information between refinement levels. For this purpose, we established a software coupling via an automatic fusion of generated multigrid solvers and communication kernels with manual implementations of complex octree data structures and algorithms often found in established software frameworks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through numerical experiments with different interpolation orders. Large-scale benchmarks conducted on the SuperMUC-NG CPU cluster underscore the advantages of our approach, offering a comparison against a reference implementation to highlight the benefits of our method and code generation in general.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the Efficiency and Cost-effectiveness of RPB-based CO2 Capture: A Comprehensive Approach to Simultaneous Design and Operating Condition Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite ongoing global initiatives to reduce CO2 emissions, implementing large-scale CO2 capture using amine solvents is fraught with economic uncertainties and technical hurdles. The Rotating Packed Bed (RPB) presents a promising alternative to traditional packed towers, offering compact design and adaptability. Nonetheless, scaling RPB processes to an industrial level is challenging due to the nascent nature of its application. The complexity of designing RPB units, setting operating conditions, and evaluating process performance adds layers of difficulty to the adoption of RPB-based systems in industries. This study introduces an optimization-driven design and evaluation for CO2 capture processes utilizing RPB columns. By employing detailed process simulation, we aim to concurrently optimize unit design and operating parameters, underscoring its advantage over conventional sequential approaches. Our process design method integrates heuristic design recommendations as constraints, resulting in 9.4% to 12.7% cost savings compared to conventional sequential design methods. Furthermore, our comprehensive process-level analysis reveals that using concentrated MEA solvent can yield total cost savings of 13.4% to 25.0% compared to the standard 30wt% MEA solvent. Additionally, the RPB unit can deliver an 8.5 to 23.6 times reduction in packing volume. While the commercial-scale feasibility of RPB technology has been established, the advancement of this field hinges on acquiring a broader and more robust dataset from commercial-scale implementations. Employing strategic methods like modularization could significantly reduce the entry barriers for CO2 capture projects, facilitating their broader adoption and implementation.</description>

      <title>GPU-accelerated Linear Algebra for Coupled Solvers in Industrial CFD Applications with OpenFOAM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The present work describes the development of heterogeneous GPGPU implicit CFD coupled solvers, encompassing both density- and pressure- based approaches. In this setup, the assembled linear matrix is offloaded onto multiple GPUs using specialized external libraries to solve the linear problem efficiently. These coupled solvers are applied to two industrial test cases representing common scenarios: the NASA CRM in a transonic regime and the external aerodynamics study of the DriveAER car. Significant performance enhancements are evident when compared to their CPU counterparts. Specifically, the NASA CRM case achieves an overall speedup of more than 4x, while the DriveAER test case demonstrates improved stability and reduced computational time compared to segregated solvers. All calculations were carried out utilizing the GPU-based partition of the davinci-1 supercomputer at the Leonardo Labs, featuring 82 GPU-accelerated nodes.</description>

      <title>Public Sector Sustainable Energy Scheduler -- A Blockchain and IoT Integrated System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In response to the European Commission's aim of cutting carbon emissions by 2050, there is a growing need for cutting-edge solutions to promote low-carbon energy consumption in public infrastructures. This paper introduces a Proof of Concept (PoC) that integrates the transparency and immutability of blockchain and the Internet of Things (IoT) to enhance energy efficiency in tangible government-held public assets, focusing on curbing carbon emissions. Our system design utilizes a forecasting and optimization framework, inscribing the scheduled operations of heat pumps on a public sector blockchain. Registering usage metrics on the blockchain facilitates the verification of energy conservation, allows transparency in public energy consumption, and augments public awareness of energy usage patterns. The system fine-tunes the operations of electric heat pumps, prioritizing their use during low-carbon emission periods in power systems occurring during high renewable energy generations. Adaptive temperature configuration and schedules enable energy management in public venues, but blockchains' processing power and latency may represent bottlenecks setting scalability limits. However, the proof-of-concept weakness and other barriers are surpassed by the public sector blockchain advantages, leading to future research and tech innovations to fully exploit the synergies of blockchain and IoT in harnessing sustainable, low-carbon energy in the public domain.</description>

      <title>Multifidelity linear regression for scientific machine learning from scarce data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) methods, which fit to data the parameters of a given parameterized model class, have garnered significant interest as potential methods for learning surrogate models for complex engineering systems for which traditional simulation is expensive. However, in many scientific and engineering settings, generating high-fidelity data on which to train ML models is expensive, and the available budget for generating training data is limited. ML models trained on the resulting scarce high-fidelity data have high variance and are sensitive to vagaries of the training data set. We propose a new multifidelity training approach for scientific machine learning that exploits the scientific context where data of varying fidelities and costs are available; for example high-fidelity data may be generated by an expensive fully resolved physics simulation whereas lower-fidelity data may arise from a cheaper model based on simplifying assumptions. We use the multifidelity data to define new multifidelity Monte Carlo estimators for the unknown parameters of linear regression models, and provide theoretical analyses that guarantee the approach's accuracy and improved robustness to small training budgets. Numerical results verify the theoretical analysis and demonstrate that multifidelity learned models trained on scarce high-fidelity data and additional low-fidelity data achieve order-of-magnitude lower model variance than standard models trained on only high-fidelity data of comparable cost. This illustrates that in the scarce data regime, our multifidelity training strategy yields models with lower expected error than standard training approaches.</description>

      <title>AI-powered Fraud Detection in Decentralized Finance: A Project Life Cycle Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.15992v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, blockchain technology has introduced decentralized finance (DeFi) as an alternative to traditional financial systems. DeFi aims to create a transparent and efficient financial ecosystem using smart contracts and emerging decentralized applications. However, the growing popularity of DeFi has made it a target for fraudulent activities, resulting in losses of billions of dollars due to various types of frauds. To address these issues, researchers have explored the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) approaches to detect such fraudulent activities. Yet, there is a lack of a systematic survey to organize and summarize those existing works and to identify the future research opportunities. In this survey, we provide a systematic taxonomy of various frauds in the DeFi ecosystem, categorized by the different stages of a DeFi project's life cycle: project development, introduction, growth, maturity, and decline. This taxonomy is based on our finding: many frauds have strong correlations in the stage of the DeFi project. According to the taxonomy, we review existing AI-powered detection methods, including statistical modeling, natural language processing and other machine learning techniques, etc. We find that fraud detection in different stages employs distinct types of methods and observe the commendable performance of tree-based and graph-related models in tackling fraud detection tasks. By analyzing the challenges and trends, we present the findings to provide proactive suggestion and guide future research in DeFi fraud detection. We believe that this survey is able to support researchers, practitioners, and regulators in establishing a secure and trustworthy DeFi ecosystem.</description>

      <title>Deep learning modelling of manufacturing and build variations on multi-stage axial compressors aerodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.04264v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Application of deep learning methods to physical simulations such as CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) for turbomachinery applications, have been so far of limited industrial relevance. This paper demonstrates the development and application of a deep learning framework for real-time predictions of the impact of manufacturing and build variations, such as tip clearance and surface roughness, on the flow field and aerodynamic performance of multi-stage axial compressors in gas turbines. The associated scatter in compressor efficiency is known to have a significant impact on the corresponding overall performance and emissions of the gas turbine, therefore posing a challenge of great industrial and environmental relevance. The proposed architecture is proven to achieve an accuracy comparable to that of the CFD benchmark, in real-time, for an industrially relevant application. The deployed model, is readily integrated within the manufacturing and build process of gas turbines, thus providing the opportunity to analytically assess the impact on performance and potentially reduce requirements for expensive physical tests.</description>

      <title>A dataset of over one thousand computed tomography scans of battery cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02527v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Battery technology is increasingly important for global electrification efforts. However, batteries are highly sensitive to small manufacturing variations that can induce reliability or safety issues. An important technology for battery quality control is computed tomography (CT) scanning, which is widely used for non-destructive 3D inspection across a variety of clinical and industrial applications. Historically, however, the utility of CT scanning for high-volume manufacturing has been limited by its low throughput as well as the difficulty of handling its large file sizes. In this work, we present a dataset of over one thousand CT scans of as-produced commercially available batteries. The dataset spans various chemistries (lithium-ion and sodium-ion) as well as various battery form factors (cylindrical, pouch, and prismatic). We evaluate seven different battery types in total. The manufacturing variability and the presence of battery defects can be observed via this dataset. This dataset may be of interest to scientists and engineers working on battery technology, computer vision, or both.</description>
