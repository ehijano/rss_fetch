      <title>Utilizing Generative Adversarial Networks for Image Data Augmentation and Classification of Semiconductor Wafer Dicing Induced Defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In semiconductor manufacturing, the wafer dicing process is central yet vulnerable to defects that significantly impair yield - the proportion of defect-free chips. Deep neural networks are the current state of the art in (semi-)automated visual inspection. However, they are notoriously known to require a particularly large amount of data for model training. To address these challenges, we explore the application of generative adversarial networks (GAN) for image data augmentation and classification of semiconductor wafer dicing induced defects to enhance the variety and balance of training data for visual inspection systems. With this approach, synthetic yet realistic images are generated that mimic real-world dicing defects. We employ three different GAN variants for high-resolution image synthesis: Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN), CycleGAN, and StyleGAN3. Our work-in-progress results demonstrate that improved classification accuracies can be obtained, showing an average improvement of up to 23.1 % from 65.1 % (baseline experiment) to 88.2 % (DCGAN experiment) in balanced accuracy, which may enable yield optimization in production.</description>

      <title>Sun Off, Lights On: Photorealistic Monocular Nighttime Simulation for Robust Semantic Perception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nighttime scenes are hard to semantically perceive with learned models and annotate for humans. Thus, realistic synthetic nighttime data become all the more important for learning robust semantic perception at night, thanks to their accurate and cheap semantic annotations. However, existing data-driven or hand-crafted techniques for generating nighttime images from daytime counterparts suffer from poor realism. The reason is the complex interaction of highly spatially varying nighttime illumination, which differs drastically from its daytime counterpart, with objects of spatially varying materials in the scene, happening in 3D and being very hard to capture with such 2D approaches. The above 3D interaction and illumination shift have proven equally hard to model in the literature, as opposed to other conditions such as fog or rain. Our method, named Sun Off, Lights On (SOLO), is the first to perform nighttime simulation on single images in a photorealistic fashion by operating in 3D. It first explicitly estimates the 3D geometry, the materials and the locations of light sources of the scene from the input daytime image and relights the scene by probabilistically instantiating light sources in a way that accounts for their semantics and then running standard ray tracing. Not only is the visual quality and photorealism of our nighttime images superior to competing approaches including diffusion models, but the former images are also proven more beneficial for semantic nighttime segmentation in day-to-night adaptation. Code and data will be made publicly available.</description>

      <title>Contrasting Deepfakes Diffusion via Contrastive Learning and Global-Local Similarities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discerning between authentic content and that generated by advanced AI methods has become increasingly challenging. While previous research primarily addresses the detection of fake faces, the identification of generated natural images has only recently surfaced. This prompted the recent exploration of solutions that employ foundation vision-and-language models, like CLIP. However, the CLIP embedding space is optimized for global image-to-text alignment and is not inherently designed for deepfake detection, neglecting the potential benefits of tailored training and local image features. In this study, we propose CoDE (Contrastive Deepfake Embeddings), a novel embedding space specifically designed for deepfake detection. CoDE is trained via contrastive learning by additionally enforcing global-local similarities. To sustain the training of our model, we generate a comprehensive dataset that focuses on images generated by diffusion models and encompasses a collection of 9.2 million images produced by using four different generators. Experimental results demonstrate that CoDE achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on the newly collected dataset, while also showing excellent generalization capabilities to unseen image generators. Our source code, trained models, and collected dataset are publicly available at: https://github.com/aimagelab/CoDE.</description>

      <title>BRIDGE: Bridging Gaps in Image Captioning Evaluation with Stronger Visual Cues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effectively aligning with human judgment when evaluating machine-generated image captions represents a complex yet intriguing challenge. Existing evaluation metrics like CIDEr or CLIP-Score fall short in this regard as they do not take into account the corresponding image or lack the capability of encoding fine-grained details and penalizing hallucinations. To overcome these issues, in this paper, we propose BRIDGE, a new learnable and reference-free image captioning metric that employs a novel module to map visual features into dense vectors and integrates them into multi-modal pseudo-captions which are built during the evaluation process. This approach results in a multimodal metric that properly incorporates information from the input image without relying on reference captions, bridging the gap between human judgment and machine-generated image captions. Experiments spanning several datasets demonstrate that our proposal achieves state-of-the-art results compared to existing reference-free evaluation scores. Our source code and trained models are publicly available at: https://github.com/aimagelab/bridge-score.</description>

      <title>A Model Generalization Study in Localizing Indoor Cows with COw LOcalization (COLO) dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precision livestock farming (PLF) increasingly relies on advanced object localization techniques to monitor livestock health and optimize resource management. This study investigates the generalization capabilities of YOLOv8 and YOLOv9 models for cow detection in indoor free-stall barn settings, focusing on varying training data characteristics such as view angles and lighting, and model complexities. Leveraging the newly released public dataset, COws LOcalization (COLO) dataset, we explore three key hypotheses: (1) Model generalization is equally influenced by changes in lighting conditions and camera angles; (2) Higher model complexity guarantees better generalization performance; (3) Fine-tuning with custom initial weights trained on relevant tasks always brings advantages to detection tasks. Our findings reveal considerable challenges in detecting cows in images taken from side views and underscore the importance of including diverse camera angles in building a detection model. Furthermore, our results emphasize that higher model complexity does not necessarily lead to better performance. The optimal model configuration heavily depends on the specific task and dataset. Lastly, while fine-tuning with custom initial weights trained on relevant tasks offers advantages to detection tasks, simpler models do not benefit similarly from this approach. It is more efficient to train a simple model with pre-trained weights without relying on prior relevant information, which can require intensive labor efforts. Future work should focus on adaptive methods and advanced data augmentation to improve generalization and robustness. This study provides practical guidelines for PLF researchers on deploying computer vision models from existing studies, highlights generalization issues, and contributes the COLO dataset containing 1254 images and 11818 cow instances for further research.</description>

      <title>Alignment Scores: Robust Metrics for Multiview Pose Accuracy Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose three novel metrics for evaluating the accuracy of a set of estimated camera poses given the ground truth: Translation Alignment Score (TAS), Rotation Alignment Score (RAS), and Pose Alignment Score (PAS). The TAS evaluates the translation accuracy independently of the rotations, and the RAS evaluates the rotation accuracy independently of the translations. The PAS is the average of the two scores, evaluating the combined accuracy of both translations and rotations. The TAS is computed in four steps: (1) Find the upper quartile of the closest-pair-distances, $d$. (2) Align the estimated trajectory to the ground truth using a robust registration method. (3) Collect all distance errors and obtain the cumulative frequencies for multiple thresholds ranging from $0.01d$ to $d$ with a resolution $0.01d$. (4) Add up these cumulative frequencies and normalize them such that the theoretical maximum is 1. The TAS has practical advantages over the existing metrics in that (1) it is robust to outliers and collinear motion, and (2) there is no need to adjust parameters on different datasets. The RAS is computed in a similar manner to the TAS and is also shown to be more robust against outliers than the existing rotation metrics. We verify our claims through extensive simulations and provide in-depth discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed metrics.</description>

      <title>Dense Self-Supervised Learning for Medical Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning has revolutionized medical image segmentation, but it relies heavily on high-quality annotations. The time, cost and expertise required to label images at the pixel-level for each new task has slowed down widespread adoption of the paradigm. We propose Pix2Rep, a self-supervised learning (SSL) approach for few-shot segmentation, that reduces the manual annotation burden by learning powerful pixel-level representations directly from unlabeled images. Pix2Rep is a novel pixel-level loss and pre-training paradigm for contrastive SSL on whole images. It is applied to generic encoder-decoder deep learning backbones (e.g., U-Net). Whereas most SSL methods enforce invariance of the learned image-level representations under intensity and spatial image augmentations, Pix2Rep enforces equivariance of the pixel-level representations. We demonstrate the framework on a task of cardiac MRI segmentation. Results show improved performance compared to existing semi- and self-supervised approaches; and a 5-fold reduction in the annotation burden for equivalent performance versus a fully supervised U-Net baseline. This includes a 30% (resp. 31%) DICE improvement for one-shot segmentation under linear-probing (resp. fine-tuning). Finally, we also integrate the novel Pix2Rep concept with the Barlow Twins non-contrastive SSL, which leads to even better segmentation performance.</description>

      <title>Mean Opinion Score as a New Metric for User-Evaluation of XAI Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the use of Mean Opinion Score (MOS), a common image quality metric, as a user-centric evaluation metric for XAI post-hoc explainers. To measure the MOS, a user experiment is proposed, which has been conducted with explanation maps of intentionally distorted images. Three methods from the family of feature attribution methods - Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM), Multi-Layered Feature Explanation Method (MLFEM), and Feature Explanation Method (FEM) - are compared with this metric. Additionally, the correlation of this new user-centric metric with automatic metrics is studied via Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. MOS of MLFEM shows the highest correlation with automatic metrics of Insertion Area Under Curve (IAUC) and Deletion Area Under Curve (DAUC). However, the overall correlations are limited, which highlights the lack of consensus between automatic and user-centric metrics.</description>

      <title>BaseBoostDepth: Exploiting Larger Baselines For Self-supervised Monocular Depth Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the domain of multi-baseline stereo, the conventional understanding is that, in general, increasing baseline separation substantially enhances the accuracy of depth estimation. However, prevailing self-supervised depth estimation architectures primarily use minimal frame separation and a constrained stereo baseline. Larger frame separations can be employed; however, we show this to result in diminished depth quality due to various factors, including significant changes in brightness, and increased areas of occlusion. In response to these challenges, our proposed method, BaseBoostDepth, incorporates a curriculum learning-inspired optimization strategy to effectively leverage larger frame separations. However, we show that our curriculum learning-inspired strategy alone does not suffice, as larger baselines still cause pose estimation drifts. Therefore, we introduce incremental pose estimation to enhance the accuracy of pose estimations, resulting in significant improvements across all depth metrics. Additionally, to improve the robustness of the model, we introduce error-induced reconstructions, which optimize reconstructions with added error to the pose estimations. Ultimately, our final depth network achieves state-of-the-art performance on KITTI and SYNS-patches datasets across image-based, edge-based, and point cloud-based metrics without increasing computational complexity at test time.

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this data article, we introduce the Multi-Modal Event-based Vehicle Detection and Tracking (MEVDT) dataset. This dataset provides a synchronized stream of event data and grayscale images of traffic scenes, captured using the Dynamic and Active-Pixel Vision Sensor (DAVIS) 240c hybrid event-based camera. MEVDT comprises 63 multi-modal sequences with approximately 13k images, 5M events, 10k object labels, and 85 unique object tracking trajectories. Additionally, MEVDT includes manually annotated ground truth labels $\unicode{x2014}$ consisting of object classifications, pixel-precise bounding boxes, and unique object IDs $\unicode{x2014}$ which are provided at a labeling frequency of 24 Hz. Designed to advance the research in the domain of event-based vision, MEVDT aims to address the critical need for high-quality, real-world annotated datasets that enable the development and evaluation of object detection and tracking algorithms in automotive environments.</description>

      <title>Learning Feature-Preserving Portrait Editing from Generated Pairs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Portrait editing is challenging for existing techniques due to difficulties in preserving subject features like identity. In this paper, we propose a training-based method leveraging auto-generated paired data to learn desired editing while ensuring the preservation of unchanged subject features. Specifically, we design a data generation process to create reasonably good training pairs for desired editing at low cost. Based on these pairs, we introduce a Multi-Conditioned Diffusion Model to effectively learn the editing direction and preserve subject features. During inference, our model produces accurate editing mask that can guide the inference process to further preserve detailed subject features. Experiments on costume editing and cartoon expression editing show that our method achieves state-of-the-art quality, quantitatively and qualitatively.</description>

      <title>Weakly Supervised Intracranial Hemorrhage Segmentation with YOLO and an Uncertainty Rectified Segment Anything Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20461v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) is a life-threatening condition that requires rapid and accurate diagnosis to improve treatment outcomes and patient survival rates. Recent advancements in supervised deep learning have greatly improved the analysis of medical images, but often rely on extensive datasets with high-quality annotations, which are costly, time-consuming, and require medical expertise to prepare. To mitigate the need for large amounts of expert-prepared segmentation data, we have developed a novel weakly supervised ICH segmentation method that utilizes the YOLO object detection model and an uncertainty-rectified Segment Anything Model (SAM). In addition, we have proposed a novel point prompt generator for this model to further improve segmentation results with YOLO-predicted bounding box prompts. Our approach achieved a high accuracy of 0.933 and an AUC of 0.796 in ICH detection, along with a mean Dice score of 0.629 for ICH segmentation, outperforming existing weakly supervised and popular supervised (UNet and Swin-UNETR) approaches. Overall, the proposed method provides a robust and accurate alternative to the more commonly used supervised techniques for ICH quantification without requiring refined segmentation ground truths during model training.</description>

      <title>Restoring Real-World Degraded Events Improves Deblurring Quality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to its high speed and low latency, DVS is frequently employed in motion deblurring. Ideally, high-quality events would adeptly capture intricate motion information. However, real-world events are generally degraded, thereby introducing significant artifacts into the deblurred results. In response to this challenge, we model the degradation of events and propose RDNet to improve the quality of image deblurring. Specifically, we first analyze the mechanisms underlying degradation and simulate paired events based on that. These paired events are then fed into the first stage of the RDNet for training the restoration model. The events restored in this stage serve as a guide for the second-stage deblurring process. To better assess the deblurring performance of different methods on real-world degraded events, we present a new real-world dataset named DavisMCR. This dataset incorporates events with diverse degradation levels, collected by manipulating environmental brightness and target object contrast. Our experiments are conducted on synthetic datasets (GOPRO), real-world datasets (REBlur), and the proposed dataset (DavisMCR). The results demonstrate that RDNet outperforms classical event denoising methods in event restoration. Furthermore, RDNet exhibits better performance in deblurring tasks compared to state-of-the-art methods. DavisMCR are available at https://github.com/Yeeesir/DVS_RDNet.</description>

      <title>Interpreting and Mitigating Hallucination in MLLMs through Multi-agent Debate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: MLLMs often generate outputs that are inconsistent with the visual content, a challenge known as hallucination. Previous methods focus on determining whether a generated output is hallucinated, without identifying which image region leads to the hallucination or interpreting why such hallucinations occur. In this paper, we argue that hallucination in MLLMs is partially due to a lack of slow-thinking and divergent-thinking in these models. To address this, we propose adopting a self-reflection scheme to promote slow-thinking. Furthermore, we consider eliminating hallucination as a complex reasoning task and propose a multi-agent debate approach to encourage divergent-thinking. Consequently, our approach can not only mitigate hallucinations but also interpret why they occur and detail the specifics of hallucination. In addition, we propose to distinguish creativity from hallucination in the context of MLLMs, and illustrate how to evaluate MLLMs' creativity capability. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate that our approach exhibits generalized hallucinations-mitigating performance across several MLLMs.</description>

      <title>Markers Identification for Relative Pose Estimation of an Uncooperative Target</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel method using chaser spacecraft image processing and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to detect structural markers on the European Space Agency's (ESA) Environmental Satellite (ENVISAT) for safe de-orbiting. Advanced image pre-processing techniques, including noise addition and blurring, are employed to improve marker detection accuracy and robustness. Initial results show promising potential for autonomous space debris removal, supporting proactive strategies for space sustainability. The effectiveness of our approach suggests that our estimation method could significantly enhance the safety and efficiency of debris removal operations by implementing more robust and autonomous systems in actual space missions.</description>

Abstract: The extraction of keypoint positions from input hand frames, known as 3D hand pose estimation, is crucial for various human-computer interaction applications. However, current approaches often struggle with the dynamic nature of self-occlusion of hands and intra-occlusion with interacting objects. To address this challenge, this paper proposes the Denoising Adaptive Graph Transformer, HandDAGT, for hand pose estimation. The proposed HandDAGT leverages a transformer structure to thoroughly explore effective geometric features from input patches. Additionally, it incorporates a novel attention mechanism to adaptively weigh the contribution of kinematic correspondence and local geometric features for the estimation of specific keypoints. This attribute enables the model to adaptively employ kinematic and local information based on the occlusion situation, enhancing its robustness and accuracy. Furthermore, we introduce a novel denoising training strategy aimed at improving the model's robust performance in the face of occlusion challenges. Experimental results show that the proposed model significantly outperforms the existing methods on four challenging hand pose benchmark datasets.

      <title>StackFLOW: Monocular Human-Object Reconstruction by Stacked Normalizing Flow with Offset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling and capturing the 3D spatial arrangement of the human and the object is the key to perceiving 3D human-object interaction from monocular images. In this work, we propose to use the Human-Object Offset between anchors which are densely sampled from the surface of human mesh and object mesh to represent human-object spatial relation. Compared with previous works which use contact map or implicit distance filed to encode 3D human-object spatial relations, our method is a simple and efficient way to encode the highly detailed spatial correlation between the human and object. Based on this representation, we propose Stacked Normalizing Flow (StackFLOW) to infer the posterior distribution of human-object spatial relations from the image. During the optimization stage, we finetune the human body pose and object 6D pose by maximizing the likelihood of samples based on this posterior distribution and minimizing the 2D-3D corresponding reprojection loss. Extensive experimental results show that our method achieves impressive results on two challenging benchmarks, BEHAVE and InterCap datasets.</description>

      <title>Pyramid Coder: Hierarchical Code Generator for Compositional Visual Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visual question answering (VQA) is the task of providing accurate answers to natural language questions based on visual input. Programmatic VQA (PVQA) models have been gaining attention recently. These use large language models (LLMs) to formulate executable programs that address questions requiring complex visual reasoning. However, there are challenges in enabling LLMs to comprehend the usage of image processing modules and generate relevant code. To overcome these challenges, this paper introduces PyramidCoder, a novel prompting framework for PVQA models. PyramidCoder consists of three hierarchical levels, each serving a distinct purpose: query rephrasing, code generation, and answer aggregation. Notably, PyramidCoder utilizes a single frozen LLM and pre-defined prompts at each level, eliminating the need for additional training and ensuring flexibility across various LLM architectures. Compared to the state-of-the-art PVQA model, our approach improves accuracy by at least 0.5% on the GQA dataset, 1.4% on the VQAv2 dataset, and 2.9% on the NLVR2 dataset.</description>

      <title>Monocular Human-Object Reconstruction in the Wild</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20566v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning the prior knowledge of the 3D human-object spatial relation is crucial for reconstructing human-object interaction from images and understanding how humans interact with objects in 3D space. Previous works learn this prior from datasets collected in controlled environments, but due to the diversity of domains, they struggle to generalize to real-world scenarios. To overcome this limitation, we present a 2D-supervised method that learns the 3D human-object spatial relation prior purely from 2D images in the wild. Our method utilizes a flow-based neural network to learn the prior distribution of the 2D human-object keypoint layout and viewports for each image in the dataset. The effectiveness of the prior learned from 2D images is demonstrated on the human-object reconstruction task by applying the prior to tune the relative pose between the human and the object during the post-optimization stage. To validate and benchmark our method on in-the-wild images, we collect the WildHOI dataset from the YouTube website, which consists of various interactions with 8 objects in real-world scenarios. We conduct the experiments on the indoor BEHAVE dataset and the outdoor WildHOI dataset. The results show that our method achieves almost comparable performance with fully 3D supervised methods on the BEHAVE dataset, even if we have only utilized the 2D layout information, and outperforms previous methods in terms of generality and interaction diversity on in-the-wild images.</description>

      <title>Image-based Detection of Segment Misalignment in Multi-mirror Satellites using Transfer Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a system based on transfer learning for detecting segment misalignment in multimirror satellites, such as future CubeSat designs and the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), using image-based methods. When a mirror segment becomes misaligned due to various environmental factors, such as space debris, the images can become distorted with a shifted copy of itself called a "ghost image". To detect whether segments are misaligned, we use pre-trained, large-scale image models trained on the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) of patches of satellite images in grayscale. Multi-mirror designs can use any arbitrary number of mirrors. For our purposes, the tests were performed on simulated CubeSats with 4, 6, and 8 segments. For system design, we took this into account when we want to know when a satellite has a misaligned segment and how many segments are misaligned. The intensity of the ghost image is directly proportional to the number of segments misaligned. Models trained for intensity classification attempted to classify N-1 segments. Across eight classes, binary models were able to achieve a classification accuracy of 98.75%, and models for intensity classification were able to achieve an accuracy of 98.05%.</description>

      <title>EgoSonics: Generating Synchronized Audio for Silent Egocentric Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce EgoSonics, a method to generate semantically meaningful and synchronized audio tracks conditioned on silent egocentric videos. Generating audio for silent egocentric videos could open new applications in virtual reality, assistive technologies, or for augmenting existing datasets. Existing work has been limited to domains like speech, music, or impact sounds and cannot easily capture the broad range of audio frequencies found in egocentric videos. EgoSonics addresses these limitations by building on the strength of latent diffusion models for conditioned audio synthesis. We first encode and process audio and video data into a form that is suitable for generation. The encoded data is used to train our model to generate audio tracks that capture the semantics of the input video. Our proposed SyncroNet builds on top of ControlNet to provide control signals that enables temporal synchronization to the synthesized audio. Extensive evaluations show that our model outperforms existing work in audio quality, and in our newly proposed synchronization evaluation method. Furthermore, we demonstrate downstream applications of our model in improving video summarization.</description>

      <title>Knowledge Fused Recognition: Fusing Hierarchical Knowledge for Image Recognition through Quantitative Relativity Modeling and Deep Metric Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image recognition is an essential baseline for deep metric learning. Hierarchical knowledge about image classes depicts inter-class similarities or dissimilarities. Effective fusion of hierarchical knowledge about image classes to enhance image recognition remains a challenging topic to advance. In this paper, we propose a novel deep metric learning based method to effectively fuse hierarchical prior knowledge about image classes and enhance image recognition performances in an end-to-end supervised regression manner. Existing deep metric learning incorporated image classification mainly exploits qualitative relativity between image classes, i.e., whether sampled images are from the same class. A new triplet loss function term that exploits quantitative relativity and aligns distances in model latent space with those in knowledge space is also proposed and incorporated in the proposed dual-modality fusion method. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method enhanced image recognition performances and outperformed baseline and existing methods on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Mini-ImageNet, and ImageNet-1K datasets.</description>

      <title>SharkTrack: an accurate, generalisable software for streamlining shark and ray underwater video analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Elasmobranchs (sharks and rays) can be important components of marine ecosystems but are experiencing global population declines. Effective monitoring of these populations is essential to their protection. Baited Remote Underwater Video Stations (BRUVS) have been a key tool for monitoring, but require time-consuming manual analysis. To address these challenges, we developed SharkTrack, an AI-enhanced BRUVS analysis software. SharkTrack uses Convolutional Neural Networks and Multi-Object Tracking to detect and track elasmobranchs and provides an annotation pipeline to manually classify elasmobranch species and compute MaxN, the standard metric of relative abundance. We tested SharkTrack on BRUVS footage from locations unseen by the model during training. SharkTrack computed MaxN with 89% accuracy over 207 hours of footage. The semi-automatic SharkTrack pipeline required two minutes of manual classification per hour of video, a 97% reduction of manual BRUVS analysis time compared to traditional methods, estimated conservatively at one hour per hour of video. Furthermore, we demonstrate SharkTrack application across diverse marine ecosystems and elasmobranch species, an advancement compared to previous models, which were limited to specific species or locations. SharkTrack applications extend beyond BRUVS analysis, facilitating rapid annotation of unlabeled videos, aiding the development of further models to classify elasmobranch species. We provide public access to the software and an unprecedentedly diverse dataset, facilitating future research in an important area of marine conservation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Event camera-based driver monitoring is emerging as a pivotal area of research, driven by its significant advantages such as rapid response, low latency, power efficiency, enhanced privacy, and prevention of undersampling. Effective detection of driver distraction is crucial in driver monitoring systems to enhance road safety and reduce accident rates. The integration of an optimized sensor such as Event Camera with an optimized network is essential for maximizing these benefits. This paper introduces the innovative concept of sensing without seeing to detect driver distraction, leveraging computationally efficient spiking neural networks (SNN). To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to utilize event camera data with spiking neural networks for driver distraction. The proposed Spiking-DD network not only achieve state of the art performance but also exhibit fewer parameters and provides greater accuracy than current event-based methodologies.</description>

      <title>Effectively Leveraging CLIP for Generating Situational Summaries of Images and Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Situation recognition refers to the ability of an agent to identify and understand various situations or contexts based on available information and sensory inputs. It involves the cognitive process of interpreting data from the environment to determine what is happening, what factors are involved, and what actions caused those situations. This interpretation of situations is formulated as a semantic role labeling problem in computer vision-based situation recognition. Situations depicted in images and videos hold pivotal information, essential for various applications like image and video captioning, multimedia retrieval, autonomous systems and event monitoring. However, existing methods often struggle with ambiguity and lack of context in generating meaningful and accurate predictions. Leveraging multimodal models such as CLIP, we propose ClipSitu, which sidesteps the need for full fine-tuning and achieves state-of-the-art results in situation recognition and localization tasks. ClipSitu harnesses CLIP-based image, verb, and role embeddings to predict nouns fulfilling all the roles associated with a verb, providing a comprehensive understanding of depicted scenarios. Through a cross-attention Transformer, ClipSitu XTF enhances the connection between semantic role queries and visual token representations, leading to superior performance in situation recognition. We also propose a verb-wise role prediction model with near-perfect accuracy to create an end-to-end framework for producing situational summaries for out-of-domain images. We show that situational summaries empower our ClipSitu models to produce structured descriptions with reduced ambiguity compared to generic captions. Finally, we extend ClipSitu to video situation recognition to showcase its versatility and produce comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Generalizing AI-driven Assessment of Immunohistochemistry across Immunostains and Cancer Types: A Universal Immunohistochemistry Analyzer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite advancements in methodologies, immunohistochemistry (IHC) remains the most utilized ancillary test for histopathologic and companion diagnostics in targeted therapies. However, objective IHC assessment poses challenges. Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a potential solution, yet its development requires extensive training for each cancer and IHC type, limiting versatility. We developed a Universal IHC (UIHC) analyzer, an AI model for interpreting IHC images regardless of tumor or IHC types, using training datasets from various cancers stained for PD-L1 and/or HER2. This multi-cohort trained model outperforms conventional single-cohort models in interpreting unseen IHCs (Kappa score 0.578 vs. up to 0.509) and consistently shows superior performance across different positive staining cutoff values. Qualitative analysis reveals that UIHC effectively clusters patches based on expression levels. The UIHC model also quantitatively assesses c-MET expression with MET mutations, representing a significant advancement in AI application in the era of personalized medicine and accumulating novel biomarkers.</description>

      <title>Image Re-Identification: Where Self-supervision Meets Vision-Language Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, large-scale vision-language pre-trained models like CLIP have shown impressive performance in image re-identification (ReID). In this work, we explore whether self-supervision can aid in the use of CLIP for image ReID tasks. Specifically, we propose SVLL-ReID, the first attempt to integrate self-supervision and pre-trained CLIP via two training stages to facilitate the image ReID. We observe that: 1) incorporating language self-supervision in the first training stage can make the learnable text prompts more distinguishable, and 2) incorporating vision self-supervision in the second training stage can make the image features learned by the image encoder more discriminative. These observations imply that: 1) the text prompt learning in the first stage can benefit from the language self-supervision, and 2) the image feature learning in the second stage can benefit from the vision self-supervision. These benefits jointly facilitate the performance gain of the proposed SVLL-ReID. By conducting experiments on six image ReID benchmark datasets without any concrete text labels, we find that the proposed SVLL-ReID achieves the overall best performances compared with state-of-the-arts. Codes will be publicly available at https://github.com/BinWangGzhu/SVLL-ReID.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep neural networks are known to be vulnerable to security risks due to the inherent transferable nature of adversarial examples. Despite the success of recent generative model-based attacks demonstrating strong transferability, it still remains a challenge to design an efficient attack strategy in a real-world strict black-box setting, where both the target domain and model architectures are unknown. In this paper, we seek to explore a feature contrastive approach in the frequency domain to generate adversarial examples that are robust in both cross-domain and cross-model settings. With that goal in mind, we propose two modules that are only employed during the training phase: a Frequency-Aware Domain Randomization (FADR) module to randomize domain-variant low- and high-range frequency components and a Frequency-Augmented Contrastive Learning (FACL) module to effectively separate domain-invariant mid-frequency features of clean and perturbed image. We demonstrate strong transferability of our generated adversarial perturbations through extensive cross-domain and cross-model experiments, while keeping the inference time complexity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent vision-language foundation models, such as CLIP, have demonstrated superior capabilities in learning representations that can be transferable across diverse range of downstream tasks and domains. With the emergence of such powerful models, it has become crucial to effectively leverage their capabilities in tackling challenging vision tasks. On the other hand, only a few works have focused on devising adversarial examples that transfer well to both unknown domains and model architectures. In this paper, we propose a novel transfer attack method called PDCL-Attack, which leverages the CLIP model to enhance the transferability of adversarial perturbations generated by a generative model-based attack framework. Specifically, we formulate an effective prompt-driven feature guidance by harnessing the semantic representation power of text, particularly from the ground-truth class labels of input images. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to introduce prompt learning to enhance the transferable generative attacks. Extensive experiments conducted across various cross-domain and cross-model settings empirically validate our approach, demonstrating its superiority over state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatial omics has transformed our understanding of tissue architecture by preserving spatial context of gene expression patterns. Simultaneously, advances in imaging AI have enabled extraction of morphological features describing the tissue. The intersection of spatial omics and imaging AI presents opportunities for a more holistic understanding. In this review we introduce a framework for categorizing spatial omics-morphology combination methods, focusing on how morphological features can be translated or integrated into spatial omics analyses. By translation we mean finding morphological features that spatially correlate with gene expression patterns with the purpose of predicting gene expression. Such features can be used to generate super-resolution gene expression maps or infer genetic information from clinical H&amp;E-stained samples. By integration we mean finding morphological features that spatially complement gene expression patterns with the purpose of enriching information. Such features can be used to define spatial domains, especially where gene expression has preceded morphological changes and where morphology remains after gene expression. We discuss learning strategies and directions for further development of the field.</description>

      <title>DocXPand-25k: a large and diverse benchmark dataset for identity documents analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identity document (ID) image analysis has become essential for many online services, like bank account opening or insurance subscription. In recent years, much research has been conducted on subjects like document localization, text recognition and fraud detection, to achieve a level of accuracy reliable enough to automatize identity verification. However, there are only a few available datasets to benchmark ID analysis methods, mainly because of privacy restrictions, security requirements and legal reasons.
  In this paper, we present the DocXPand-25k dataset, which consists of 24,994 richly labeled IDs images, generated using custom-made vectorial templates representing nine fictitious ID designs, including four identity cards, two residence permits and three passports designs.

      <title>3D-GRES: Generalized 3D Referring Expression Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20664v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D Referring Expression Segmentation (3D-RES) is dedicated to segmenting a specific instance within a 3D space based on a natural language description. However, current approaches are limited to segmenting a single target, restricting the versatility of the task. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Generalized 3D Referring Expression Segmentation (3D-GRES), which extends the capability to segment any number of instances based on natural language instructions. In addressing this broader task, we propose the Multi-Query Decoupled Interaction Network (MDIN), designed to break down multi-object segmentation tasks into simpler, individual segmentations. MDIN comprises two fundamental components: Text-driven Sparse Queries (TSQ) and Multi-object Decoupling Optimization (MDO). TSQ generates sparse point cloud features distributed over key targets as the initialization for queries. Meanwhile, MDO is tasked with assigning each target in multi-object scenarios to different queries while maintaining their semantic consistency. To adapt to this new task, we build a new dataset, namely Multi3DRes. Our comprehensive evaluations on this dataset demonstrate substantial enhancements over existing models, thus charting a new path for intricate multi-object 3D scene comprehension. The benchmark and code are available at https://github.com/sosppxo/MDIN.</description>

      <title>Boosting Audio Visual Question Answering via Key Semantic-Aware Cues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Audio Visual Question Answering (AVQA) task aims to answer questions related to various visual objects, sounds, and their interactions in videos. Such naturally multimodal videos contain rich and complex dynamic audio-visual components, with only a portion of them closely related to the given questions. Hence, effectively perceiving audio-visual cues relevant to the given questions is crucial for correctly answering them. In this paper, we propose a Temporal-Spatial Perception Model (TSPM), which aims to empower the model to perceive key visual and auditory cues related to the questions. Specifically, considering the challenge of aligning non-declarative questions and visual representations into the same semantic space using visual-language pretrained models, we construct declarative sentence prompts derived from the question template, to assist the temporal perception module in better identifying critical segments relevant to the questions. Subsequently, a spatial perception module is designed to merge visual tokens from selected segments to highlight key latent targets, followed by cross-modal interaction with audio to perceive potential sound-aware areas. Finally, the significant temporal-spatial cues from these modules are integrated to answer the question. Extensive experiments on multiple AVQA benchmarks demonstrate that our framework excels not only in understanding audio-visual scenes but also in answering complex questions effectively. Code is available at https://github.com/GeWu-Lab/TSPM.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing high-quality indoor 3D scenes is important in many practical applications, such as room planning or game development. Conventionally, this has been a time-consuming process which requires both artistic skill and familiarity with professional software, making it hardly accessible for layman users. However, recent advances in generative AI have established solid foundation for democratizing 3D design. In this paper, we propose a pioneering approach for text-based 3D room design. Given a prompt in natural language describing the object placement in the room, our method produces a high-quality 3D scene corresponding to it. With an additional text prompt the users can change the appearance of the entire scene or of individual objects in it. Built using in-context learning, CAD model retrieval and 3D-Gaussian-Splatting-based stylization, our turnkey pipeline produces state-of-the-art 3D scenes, while being easy to use even for novices.

      <title>Neural Fields for Continuous Periodic Motion Estimation in 4D Cardiovascular Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-resolved three-dimensional flow MRI (4D flow MRI) provides a unique non-invasive solution to visualize and quantify hemodynamics in blood vessels such as the aortic arch. However, most current analysis methods for arterial 4D flow MRI use static artery walls because of the difficulty in obtaining a full cycle segmentation. To overcome this limitation, we propose a neural fields-based method that directly estimates continuous periodic wall deformations throughout the cardiac cycle. For a 3D + time imaging dataset, we optimize an implicit neural representation (INR) that represents a time-dependent velocity vector field (VVF). An ODE solver is used to integrate the VVF into a deformation vector field (DVF), that can deform images, segmentation masks, or meshes over time, thereby visualizing and quantifying local wall motion patterns. To properly reflect the periodic nature of 3D + time cardiovascular data, we impose periodicity in two ways. First, by periodically encoding the time input to the INR, and hence VVF. Second, by regularizing the DVF. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on synthetic data with different periodic patterns, ECG-gated CT, and 4D flow MRI data. The obtained method could be used to improve 4D flow MRI analysis.</description>

      <title>Autogenic Language Embedding for Coherent Point Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Point tracking is a challenging task in computer vision, aiming to establish point-wise correspondence across long video sequences. Recent advancements have primarily focused on temporal modeling techniques to improve local feature similarity, often overlooking the valuable semantic consistency inherent in tracked points. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach leveraging language embeddings to enhance the coherence of frame-wise visual features related to the same object. Our proposed method, termed autogenic language embedding for visual feature enhancement, strengthens point correspondence in long-term sequences. Unlike existing visual-language schemes, our approach learns text embeddings from visual features through a dedicated mapping network, enabling seamless adaptation to various tracking tasks without explicit text annotations. Additionally, we introduce a consistency decoder that efficiently integrates text tokens into visual features with minimal computational overhead. Through enhanced visual consistency, our approach significantly improves tracking trajectories in lengthy videos with substantial appearance variations. Extensive experiments on widely-used tracking benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance of our method, showcasing notable enhancements compared to trackers relying solely on visual cues.</description>

      <title>Scene-Specific Trajectory Sets: Maximizing Representation in Motion Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Representing diverse and plausible future trajectories of actors is crucial for motion forecasting in autonomous driving. However, efficiently capturing the true trajectory distribution with a compact set is challenging. In this work, we propose a novel approach for generating scene-specific trajectory sets that better represent the diversity and admissibility of future actor behavior. Our method constructs multiple trajectory sets tailored to different scene contexts, such as intersections and non-intersections, by leveraging map information and actor dynamics. We introduce a deterministic goal sampling algorithm that identifies relevant map regions and generates trajectories conditioned on the scene layout. Furthermore, we empirically investigate various sampling strategies and set sizes to optimize the trade-off between coverage and diversity. Experiments on the Argoverse 2 dataset demonstrate that our scene-specific sets achieve higher plausibility while maintaining diversity compared to traditional single-set approaches. The proposed Recursive In-Distribution Subsampling (RIDS) method effectively condenses the representation space and outperforms metric-driven sampling in terms of trajectory admissibility. Our work highlights the benefits of scene-aware trajectory set generation for capturing the complex and heterogeneous nature of actor behavior in real-world driving scenarios.</description>

Abstract: Two crucial performance criteria for the deployment of visual localization are speed and accuracy. Current research on visual localization with neural networks is limited to examining methods for enhancing the accuracy of networks across various datasets. How to expedite the re-localization process within deep neural network architectures still needs further investigation. In this paper, we present a novel approach for accelerating visual re-localization in practice. A tree-like search strategy, built on the keyframes extracted by a visual clustering algorithm, is designed for matching acceleration. Our method has been validated on two tasks across three public datasets, allowing for 50 up to 90 percent time saving over the baseline while not reducing location accuracy.</description>

      <title>SynthVLM: High-Efficiency and High-Quality Synthetic Data for Vision Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, with the rise of web images, managing and understanding large-scale image datasets has become increasingly important. Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs) have recently emerged due to their robust vision-understanding capabilities. However, training these models requires vast amounts of data, posing challenges to efficiency, effectiveness, data quality, and privacy. In this paper, we introduce SynthVLM, a novel data synthesis pipeline for VLLMs. Unlike existing methods that generate captions from images, SynthVLM employs advanced diffusion models and high-quality captions to automatically generate and select high-resolution images from captions, creating precisely aligned image-text pairs. Leveraging these pairs, we achieve state-of-the-art (SoTA) performance on various vision question answering tasks, maintaining high alignment quality and preserving advanced language abilities. Moreover, SynthVLM surpasses traditional GPT-4 Vision-based caption generation methods in performance while significantly reducing computational overhead. Crucially, our method's reliance on purely generated data ensures the preservation of privacy, achieving SoTA performance with just 100k data points (only 18% of the official dataset size).</description>

      <title>Inverse Problems with Diffusion Models: A MAP Estimation Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inverse problems have many applications in science and engineering. In Computer vision, several image restoration tasks such as inpainting, deblurring, and super-resolution can be formally modeled as inverse problems. Recently, methods have been developed for solving inverse problems that only leverage a pre-trained unconditional diffusion model and do not require additional task-specific training. In such methods, however, the inherent intractability of determining the conditional score function during the reverse diffusion process poses a real challenge, leaving the methods to settle with an approximation instead, which affects their performance in practice. Here, we propose a MAP estimation framework to model the reverse conditional generation process of a continuous time diffusion model as an optimization process of the underlying MAP objective, whose gradient term is tractable. In theory, the proposed framework can be applied to solve general inverse problems using gradient-based optimization methods. However, given the highly non-convex nature of the loss objective, finding a perfect gradient-based optimization algorithm can be quite challenging, nevertheless, our framework offers several potential research directions. We use our proposed formulation and develop empirically effective algorithms for solving noiseless and noisy image inpainting tasks. We validate our proposed algorithms with extensive experiments across diverse mask settings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to illumination manipulation in diffusion models, addressing the gap in conditional image generation with a focus on lighting conditions. We conceptualize the diffusion model as a black-box image render and strategically decompose its energy function in alignment with the image formation model. Our method effectively separates and controls illumination-related properties during the generative process. It generates images with realistic illumination effects, including cast shadow, soft shadow, and inter-reflections. Remarkably, it achieves this without the necessity for learning intrinsic decomposition, finding directions in latent space, or undergoing additional training with new datasets.</description>

      <title>SpotFormer: Multi-Scale Spatio-Temporal Transformer for Facial Expression Spotting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Facial expression spotting, identifying periods where facial expressions occur in a video, is a significant yet challenging task in facial expression analysis. The issues of irrelevant facial movements and the challenge of detecting subtle motions in micro-expressions remain unresolved, hindering accurate expression spotting. In this paper, we propose an efficient framework for facial expression spotting. First, we propose a Sliding Window-based Multi-Resolution Optical flow (SW-MRO) feature, which calculates multi-resolution optical flow of the input image sequence within compact sliding windows. The window length is tailored to perceive complete micro-expressions and distinguish between general macro- and micro-expressions. SW-MRO can effectively reveal subtle motions while avoiding severe head movement problems. Second, we propose SpotFormer, a multi-scale spatio-temporal Transformer that simultaneously encodes spatio-temporal relationships of the SW-MRO features for accurate frame-level probability estimation. In SpotFormer, our proposed Facial Local Graph Pooling (FLGP) and convolutional layers are applied for multi-scale spatio-temporal feature extraction. We show the validity of the architecture of SpotFormer by comparing it with several model variants. Third, we introduce supervised contrastive learning into SpotFormer to enhance the discriminability between different types of expressions. Extensive experiments on SAMM-LV and CAS(ME)^2 show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art models, particularly in micro-expression spotting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing roadside perception systems are limited by the absence of publicly available, large-scale, high-quality 3D datasets. Exploring the use of cost-effective, extensive synthetic datasets offers a viable solution to tackle this challenge and enhance the performance of roadside monocular 3D detection. In this study, we introduce the TUMTraf Synthetic Dataset, offering a diverse and substantial collection of high-quality 3D data to augment scarce real-world datasets. Besides, we present WARM-3D, a concise yet effective framework to aid the Sim2Real domain transfer for roadside monocular 3D detection. Our method leverages cheap synthetic datasets and 2D labels from an off-the-shelf 2D detector for weak supervision. We show that WARM-3D significantly enhances performance, achieving a +12.40% increase in mAP 3D over the baseline with only pseudo-2D supervision. With 2D GT as weak labels, WARM-3D even reaches performance close to the Oracle baseline. Moreover, WARM-3D improves the ability of 3D detectors to unseen sample recognition across various real-world environments, highlighting its potential for practical applications.</description>

      <title>Vulnerabilities in AI-generated Image Detection: The Challenge of Adversarial Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in image synthesis, particularly with the advent of GAN and Diffusion models, have amplified public concerns regarding the dissemination of disinformation. To address such concerns, numerous AI-generated Image (AIGI) Detectors have been proposed and achieved promising performance in identifying fake images. However, there still lacks a systematic understanding of the adversarial robustness of these AIGI detectors. In this paper, we examine the vulnerability of state-of-the-art AIGI detectors against adversarial attack under white-box and black-box settings, which has been rarely investigated so far. For the task of AIGI detection, we propose a new attack containing two main parts. First, inspired by the obvious difference between real images and fake images in the frequency domain, we add perturbations under the frequency domain to push the image away from its original frequency distribution. Second, we explore the full posterior distribution of the surrogate model to further narrow this gap between heterogeneous models, e.g. transferring adversarial examples across CNNs and ViTs. This is achieved by introducing a novel post-train Bayesian strategy that turns a single surrogate into a Bayesian one, capable of simulating diverse victim models using one pre-trained surrogate, without the need for re-training. We name our method as frequency-based post-train Bayesian attack, or FPBA. Through FPBA, we show that adversarial attack is truly a real threat to AIGI detectors, because FPBA can deliver successful black-box attacks across models, generators, defense methods, and even evade cross-generator detection, which is a crucial real-world detection scenario.</description>

      <title>DFE-IANet: A Method for Polyp Image Classification Based on Dual-domain Feature Extraction and Interaction Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is helpful in preventing colorectal cancer to detect and treat polyps in the gastrointestinal tract early. However, there have been few studies to date on designing polyp image classification networks that balance efficiency and accuracy. This challenge is mainly attributed to the fact that polyps are similar to other pathologies and have complex features influenced by texture, color, and morphology. In this paper, we propose a novel network DFE-IANet based on both spectral transformation and feature interaction. Firstly, to extract detailed features and multi-scale features, the features are transformed by the multi-scale frequency domain feature extraction (MSFD) block to extract texture details at the fine-grained level in the frequency domain. Secondly, the multi-scale interaction attention (MSIA) block is designed to enhance the network's capability of extracting critical features. This block introduces multi-scale features into self-attention, aiming to adaptively guide the network to concentrate on vital regions. Finally, with a compact parameter of only 4M, DFE-IANet outperforms the latest and classical networks in terms of efficiency. Furthermore, DFE-IANet achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on the challenging Kvasir dataset, demonstrating a remarkable Top-1 accuracy of 93.94%. This outstanding accuracy surpasses ViT by 8.94%, ResNet50 by 1.69%, and VMamba by 1.88%. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/PURSUETHESUN/DFE-IANet.</description>

      <title>Assessing Graphical Perception of Image Embedding Models using Channel Effectiveness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in vision models have greatly improved their ability to handle complex chart understanding tasks, like chart captioning and question answering. However, it remains challenging to assess how these models process charts. Existing benchmarks only roughly evaluate model performance without evaluating the underlying mechanisms, such as how models extract image embeddings. This limits our understanding of the model's ability to perceive fundamental graphical components. To address this, we introduce a novel evaluation framework to assess the graphical perception of image embedding models. For chart comprehension, we examine two main aspects of channel effectiveness: accuracy and discriminability of various visual channels. Channel accuracy is assessed through the linearity of embeddings, measuring how well the perceived magnitude aligns with the size of the stimulus. Discriminability is evaluated based on the distances between embeddings, indicating their distinctness. Our experiments with the CLIP model show that it perceives channel accuracy differently from humans and shows unique discriminability in channels like length, tilt, and curvature. We aim to develop this work into a broader benchmark for reliable visual encoders, enhancing models for precise chart comprehension and human-like perception in future applications.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, the paradigm of neural implicit representations has gained substantial attention in the field of Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM). However, a notable gap exists in the existing approaches when it comes to scene understanding. In this paper, we introduce NIS-SLAM, an efficient neural implicit semantic RGB-D SLAM system, that leverages a pre-trained 2D segmentation network to learn consistent semantic representations. Specifically, for high-fidelity surface reconstruction and spatial consistent scene understanding, we combine high-frequency multi-resolution tetrahedron-based features and low-frequency positional encoding as the implicit scene representations. Besides, to address the inconsistency of 2D segmentation results from multiple views, we propose a fusion strategy that integrates the semantic probabilities from previous non-keyframes into keyframes to achieve consistent semantic learning. Furthermore, we implement a confidence-based pixel sampling and progressive optimization weight function for robust camera tracking. Extensive experimental results on various datasets show the better or more competitive performance of our system when compared to other existing neural dense implicit RGB-D SLAM approaches. Finally, we also show that our approach can be used in augmented reality applications. Project page: \href{https://zju3dv.github.io/nis_slam}{https://zju3dv.github.io/nis\_slam}.</description>

      <title>DeTurb: Atmospheric Turbulence Mitigation with Deformable 3D Convolutions and 3D Swin Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atmospheric turbulence in long-range imaging significantly degrades the quality and fidelity of captured scenes due to random variations in both spatial and temporal dimensions. These distortions present a formidable challenge across various applications, from surveillance to astronomy, necessitating robust mitigation strategies. While model-based approaches achieve good results, they are very slow. Deep learning approaches show promise in image and video restoration but have struggled to address these spatiotemporal variant distortions effectively. This paper proposes a new framework that combines geometric restoration with an enhancement module. Random perturbations and geometric distortion are removed using a pyramid architecture with deformable 3D convolutions, resulting in aligned frames. These frames are then used to reconstruct a sharp, clear image via a multi-scale architecture of 3D Swin Transformers. The proposed framework demonstrates superior performance over the state of the art for both synthetic and real atmospheric turbulence effects, with reasonable speed and model size.</description>

      <title>Mean of Means: A 10-dollar Solution for Human Localization with Calibration-free and Unconstrained Camera Settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate human localization is crucial for various applications, especially in the Metaverse era. Existing high precision solutions rely on expensive, tag-dependent hardware, while vision-based methods offer a cheaper, tag-free alternative. However, current vision solutions based on stereo vision face limitations due to rigid perspective transformation principles and error propagation in multi-stage SVD solvers. These solutions also require multiple high-resolution cameras with strict setup constraints. To address these limitations, we propose a probabilistic approach that considers all points on the human body as observations generated by a distribution centered around the body's geometric center. This enables us to improve sampling significantly, increasing the number of samples for each point of interest from hundreds to billions. By modeling the relation between the means of the distributions of world coordinates and pixel coordinates, leveraging the Central Limit Theorem, we ensure normality and facilitate the learning process. Experimental results demonstrate human localization accuracy of 95% within a 0.3m range and nearly 100% accuracy within a 0.5m range, achieved at a low cost of only 10 USD using two web cameras with a resolution of 640x480 pixels.</description>

      <title>A Comparative Analysis of YOLOv5, YOLOv8, and YOLOv10 in Kitchen Safety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knife safety in the kitchen is essential for preventing accidents or injuries with an emphasis on proper handling, maintenance, and storage methods. This research presents a comparative analysis of three YOLO models, YOLOv5, YOLOv8, and YOLOv10, to detect the hazards involved in handling knife, concentrating mainly on ensuring fingers are curled while holding items to be cut and that hands should only be in contact with knife handle avoiding the blade. Precision, recall, F-score, and normalized confusion matrix are used to evaluate the performance of the models. The results indicate that YOLOv5 performed better than the other two models in identifying the hazard of ensuring hands only touch the blade, while YOLOv8 excelled in detecting the hazard of curled fingers while holding items. YOLOv5 and YOLOv8 performed almost identically in recognizing classes such as hand, knife, and vegetable, whereas YOLOv5, YOLOv8, and YOLOv10 accurately identified the cutting board. This paper provides insights into the advantages and shortcomings of these models in real-world settings. Moreover, by detailing the optimization of YOLO architectures for safe knife handling, this study promotes the development of increased accuracy and efficiency in safety surveillance systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Die studies are fundamental to quantifying ancient monetary production, providing insights into the relationship between coinage, politics, and history. The process requires tedious manual work, which limits the size of the corpora that can be studied. Few works have attempted to automate this task, and none have been properly released and evaluated from a computer vision perspective. We propose a fully automatic approach that introduces several innovations compared to previous methods. We rely on fast and robust local descriptors matching that is set automatically. Second, the core of our proposal is a clustering-based approach that uses an intrinsic metric (that does not need the ground truth labels) to determine its critical hyper-parameters. We validate the approach on two corpora of Greek coins, propose an automatic implementation and evaluation of previous baselines, and show that our approach significantly outperforms them.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Scene Understanding through Object-Centric Voxelization and Neural Rendering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning object-centric representations from unsupervised videos is challenging. Unlike most previous approaches that focus on decomposing 2D images, we present a 3D generative model named DynaVol-S for dynamic scenes that enables object-centric learning within a differentiable volume rendering framework. The key idea is to perform object-centric voxelization to capture the 3D nature of the scene, which infers per-object occupancy probabilities at individual spatial locations. These voxel features evolve through a canonical-space deformation function and are optimized in an inverse rendering pipeline with a compositional NeRF. Additionally, our approach integrates 2D semantic features to create 3D semantic grids, representing the scene through multiple disentangled voxel grids. DynaVol-S significantly outperforms existing models in both novel view synthesis and unsupervised decomposition tasks for dynamic scenes. By jointly considering geometric structures and semantic features, it effectively addresses challenging real-world scenarios involving complex object interactions. Furthermore, once trained, the explicitly meaningful voxel features enable additional capabilities that 2D scene decomposition methods cannot achieve, such as novel scene generation through editing geometric shapes or manipulating the motion trajectories of objects.</description>

      <title>SSPA: Split-and-Synthesize Prompting with Gated Alignments for Multi-Label Image Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-label image recognition is a fundamental task in computer vision. Recently, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have made notable advancements in this area. However, previous methods fail to effectively leverage the rich knowledge in language models and often incorporate label semantics into visual features unidirectionally. To overcome these problems, we propose a Split-and-Synthesize Prompting with Gated Alignments (SSPA) framework to amplify the potential of VLMs. Specifically, we develop an in-context learning approach to associate the inherent knowledge from LLMs. Then we propose a novel Split-and-Synthesize Prompting (SSP) strategy to first model the generic knowledge and downstream label semantics individually and then aggregate them carefully through the quaternion network. Moreover, we present Gated Dual-Modal Alignments (GDMA) to bidirectionally interact visual and linguistic modalities while eliminating redundant cross-modal information, enabling more efficient region-level alignments. Rather than making the final prediction by a sharp manner in previous works, we propose a soft aggregator to jointly consider results from all image regions. With the help of flexible prompting and gated alignments, SSPA is generalizable to specific domains. Extensive experiments on nine datasets from three domains (i.e., natural, pedestrian attributes and remote sensing) demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of SSPA. Further analyses verify the effectiveness of SSP and the interpretability of GDMA. The code will be made public.</description>

      <title>UniProcessor: A Text-induced Unified Low-level Image Processor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image processing, including image restoration, image enhancement, etc., involves generating a high-quality clean image from a degraded input. Deep learning-based methods have shown superior performance for various image processing tasks in terms of single-task conditions. However, they require to train separate models for different degradations and levels, which limits the generalization abilities of these models and restricts their applications in real-world. In this paper, we propose a text-induced unified image processor for low-level vision tasks, termed UniProcessor, which can effectively process various degradation types and levels, and support multimodal control. Specifically, our UniProcessor encodes degradation-specific information with the subject prompt and process degradations with the manipulation prompt. These context control features are injected into the UniProcessor backbone via cross-attention to control the processing procedure. For automatic subject-prompt generation, we further build a vision-language model for general-purpose low-level degradation perception via instruction tuning techniques. Our UniProcessor covers 30 degradation types, and extensive experiments demonstrate that our UniProcessor can well process these degradations without additional training or tuning and outperforms other competing methods. Moreover, with the help of degradation-aware context control, our UniProcessor first shows the ability to individually handle a single distortion in an image with multiple degradations.</description>

      <title>dopanim: A Dataset of Doppelganger Animals with Noisy Annotations from Multiple Humans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human annotators typically provide annotated data for training machine learning models, such as neural networks. Yet, human annotations are subject to noise, impairing generalization performances. Methodological research on approaches counteracting noisy annotations requires corresponding datasets for a meaningful empirical evaluation. Consequently, we introduce a novel benchmark dataset, dopanim, consisting of about 15,750 animal images of 15 classes with ground truth labels. For approximately 10,500 of these images, 20 humans provided over 52,000 annotations with an accuracy of circa 67%. Its key attributes include (1) the challenging task of classifying doppelganger animals, (2) human-estimated likelihoods as annotations, and (3) annotator metadata. We benchmark well-known multi-annotator learning approaches using seven variants of this dataset and outline further evaluation use cases such as learning beyond hard class labels and active learning. Our dataset and a comprehensive codebase are publicly available to emulate the data collection process and to reproduce all empirical results.</description>

      <title>Learning Ordinality in Semantic Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semantic segmentation consists of predicting a semantic label for each image pixel. Conventional deep learning models do not take advantage of ordinal relations that might exist in the domain at hand. For example, it is known that the pupil is inside the iris, and the lane markings are inside the road. Such domain knowledge can be employed as constraints to make the model more robust. The current literature on this topic has explored pixel-wise ordinal segmentation methods, which treat each pixel as an independent observation and promote ordinality in its representation. This paper proposes novel spatial ordinal segmentation methods, which take advantage of the structured image space by considering each pixel as an observation dependent on its neighborhood context to also promote ordinal spatial consistency. When evaluated with five biomedical datasets and multiple configurations of autonomous driving datasets, ordinal methods resulted in more ordinally-consistent models, with substantial improvements in ordinal metrics and some increase in the Dice coefficient. It was also shown that the incorporation of ordinal consistency results in models with better generalization abilities.</description>

      <title>MMTrail: A Multimodal Trailer Video Dataset with Language and Music Descriptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massive multi-modality datasets play a significant role in facilitating the success of large video-language models. However, current video-language datasets primarily provide text descriptions for visual frames, considering audio to be weakly related information. They usually overlook exploring the potential of inherent audio-visual correlation, leading to monotonous annotation within each modality instead of comprehensive and precise descriptions. Such ignorance results in the difficulty of multiple cross-modality studies. To fulfill this gap, we present MMTrail, a large-scale multi-modality video-language dataset incorporating more than 20M trailer clips with visual captions, and 2M high-quality clips with multimodal captions. Trailers preview full-length video works and integrate context, visual frames, and background music. In particular, the trailer has two main advantages: (1) the topics are diverse, and the content characters are of various types, e.g., film, news, and gaming. (2) the corresponding background music is custom-designed, making it more coherent with the visual context. Upon these insights, we propose a systemic captioning framework, achieving various modality annotations with more than 27.1k hours of trailer videos. Here, to ensure the caption retains music perspective while preserving the authority of visual context, we leverage the advanced LLM to merge all annotations adaptively. In this fashion, our MMtrail dataset potentially paves the path for fine-grained large multimodal-language model training. In experiments, we provide evaluation metrics and benchmark results on our dataset, demonstrating the high quality of our annotation and its effectiveness for model training.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Images are a powerful and immediate vehicle to carry misleading or outright false messages, yet identifying image-based misinformation at scale poses unique challenges. In this paper, we present PIXELMOD, a system that leverages perceptual hashes, vector databases, and optical character recognition (OCR) to efficiently identify images that are candidates to receive soft moderation labels on Twitter. We show that PIXELMOD outperforms existing image similarity approaches when applied to soft moderation, with negligible performance overhead. We then test PIXELMOD on a dataset of tweets surrounding the 2020 US Presidential Election, and find that it is able to identify visually misleading images that are candidates for soft moderation with 0.99% false detection and 2.06% false negatives.</description>

      <title>GABInsight: Exploring Gender-Activity Binding Bias in Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) are intensively used in many downstream tasks, including those requiring assessments of individuals appearing in the images. While VLMs perform well in simple single-person scenarios, in real-world applications, we often face complex situations in which there are persons of different genders doing different activities. We show that in such cases, VLMs are biased towards identifying the individual with the expected gender (according to ingrained gender stereotypes in the model or other forms of sample selection bias) as the performer of the activity. We refer to this bias in associating an activity with the gender of its actual performer in an image or text as the Gender-Activity Binding (GAB) bias and analyze how this bias is internalized in VLMs. To assess this bias, we have introduced the GAB dataset with approximately 5500 AI-generated images that represent a variety of activities, addressing the scarcity of real-world images for some scenarios. To have extensive quality control, the generated images are evaluated for their diversity, quality, and realism. We have tested 12 renowned pre-trained VLMs on this dataset in the context of text-to-image and image-to-text retrieval to measure the effect of this bias on their predictions. Additionally, we have carried out supplementary experiments to quantify the bias in VLMs' text encoders and to evaluate VLMs' capability to recognize activities. Our experiments indicate that VLMs experience an average performance decline of about 13.2% when confronted with gender-activity binding bias.</description>

      <title>XHand: Real-time Expressive Hand Avatar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hand avatars play a pivotal role in a wide array of digital interfaces, enhancing user immersion and facilitating natural interaction within virtual environments. While previous studies have focused on photo-realistic hand rendering, little attention has been paid to reconstruct the hand geometry with fine details, which is essential to rendering quality. In the realms of extended reality and gaming, on-the-fly rendering becomes imperative. To this end, we introduce an expressive hand avatar, named XHand, that is designed to comprehensively generate hand shape, appearance, and deformations in real-time. To obtain fine-grained hand meshes, we make use of three feature embedding modules to predict hand deformation displacements, albedo, and linear blending skinning weights, respectively. To achieve photo-realistic hand rendering on fine-grained meshes, our method employs a mesh-based neural renderer by leveraging mesh topological consistency and latent codes from embedding modules. During training, a part-aware Laplace smoothing strategy is proposed by incorporating the distinct levels of regularization to effectively maintain the necessary details and eliminate the undesired artifacts. The experimental evaluations on InterHand2.6M and DeepHandMesh datasets demonstrate the efficacy of XHand, which is able to recover high-fidelity geometry and texture for hand animations across diverse poses in real-time. To reproduce our results, we will make the full implementation publicly available at https://github.com/agnJason/XHand.</description>

      <title>CLEFT: Language-Image Contrastive Learning with Efficient Large Language Model and Prompt Fine-Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) have demonstrated notable success in self-supervised representation learning across various tasks. However, the existing CLIP-like approaches often demand extensive GPU resources and prolonged training times due to the considerable size of the model and dataset, making them poor for medical applications, in which large datasets are not always common. Meanwhile, the language model prompts are mainly manually derived from labels tied to images, potentially overlooking the richness of information within training samples. We introduce a novel language-image Contrastive Learning method with an Efficient large language model and prompt Fine-Tuning (CLEFT) that harnesses the strengths of the extensive pre-trained language and visual models. Furthermore, we present an efficient strategy for learning context-based prompts that mitigates the gap between informative clinical diagnostic data and simple class labels. Our method demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on multiple chest X-ray and mammography datasets compared with various baselines. The proposed parameter efficient framework can reduce the total trainable model size by 39% and reduce the trainable language model to only 4% compared with the current BERT encoder.</description>

      <title>Add-SD: Rational Generation without Manual Reference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models have exhibited remarkable prowess in visual generalization. Building on this success, we introduce an instruction-based object addition pipeline, named Add-SD, which automatically inserts objects into realistic scenes with rational sizes and positions. Different from layout-conditioned methods, Add-SD is solely conditioned on simple text prompts rather than any other human-costly references like bounding boxes. Our work contributes in three aspects: proposing a dataset containing numerous instructed image pairs; fine-tuning a diffusion model for rational generation; and generating synthetic data to boost downstream tasks. The first aspect involves creating a RemovalDataset consisting of original-edited image pairs with textual instructions, where an object has been removed from the original image while maintaining strong pixel consistency in the background. These data pairs are then used for fine-tuning the Stable Diffusion (SD) model. Subsequently, the pretrained Add-SD model allows for the insertion of expected objects into an image with good rationale. Additionally, we generate synthetic instances for downstream task datasets at scale, particularly for tail classes, to alleviate the long-tailed problem. Downstream tasks benefit from the enriched dataset with enhanced diversity and rationale. Experiments on LVIS val demonstrate that Add-SD yields an improvement of 4.3 mAP on rare classes over the baseline. Code and models are available at https://github.com/ylingfeng/Add-SD.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces an innovative approach for image matting that redefines the traditional regression-based task as a generative modeling challenge. Our method harnesses the capabilities of latent diffusion models, enriched with extensive pre-trained knowledge, to regularize the matting process. We present novel architectural innovations that empower our model to produce mattes with superior resolution and detail. The proposed method is versatile and can perform both guidance-free and guidance-based image matting, accommodating a variety of additional cues. Our comprehensive evaluation across three benchmark datasets demonstrates the superior performance of our approach, both quantitatively and qualitatively. The results not only reflect our method's robust effectiveness but also highlight its ability to generate visually compelling mattes that approach photorealistic quality.

      <title>Two-Phase Segmentation Approach for Accurate Left Ventricle Segmentation in Cardiac MRI using Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20387v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate segmentation of the Left Ventricle (LV) holds substantial importance due to its implications in disease detection, regional analysis, and the development of complex models for cardiac surgical planning. CMR is a golden standard for diagnosis of serveral cardiac diseases. LV in CMR comprises of three distinct sections: Basal, Mid-Ventricle, and Apical. This research focuses on the precise segmentation of the LV from Cardiac MRI (CMR) scans, joining with the capabilities of Machine Learning (ML). The central challenge in this research revolves around the absence of a set of parameters applicable to all three types of LV slices. Parameters optimized for basal slices often fall short when applied to mid-ventricular and apical slices, and vice versa. To handle this issue, a new method is proposed to enhance LV segmentation. The proposed method involves using distinct sets of parameters for each type of slice, resulting in a two-phase segmentation approach. The initial phase categorizes images into three groups based on the type of LV slice, while the second phase aims to segment CMR images using parameters derived from the preceding phase. A publicly available dataset (Automated Cardiac Diagnosis Challenge (ACDC)) is used. 10-Fold Cross Validation is used and it achieved a mean score of 0.9228. Comprehensive testing indicates that the best parameter set for a particular type of slice does not perform adequately for the other slice types. All results show that the proposed approach fills a critical void in parameter standardization through a two-phase segmentation model for the LV, aiming to not only improve the accuracy of cardiac image analysis but also contribute advancements to the field of LV segmentation.</description>

      <title>Analysis and Improvement of Rank-Ordered Mean Algorithm in Single-Photon LiDAR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Depth estimation using a single-photon LiDAR is often solved by a matched filter. It is, however, error-prone in the presence of background noise. A commonly used technique to reject background noise is the rank-ordered mean (ROM) filter previously reported by Shin \textit{et al.} (2015). ROM rejects noisy photon arrival timestamps by selecting only a small range of them around the median statistics within its local neighborhood. Despite the promising performance of ROM, its theoretical performance limit is unknown. In this paper, we theoretically characterize the ROM performance by showing that ROM fails when the reflectivity drops below a threshold predetermined by the depth and signal-to-background ratio, and its accuracy undergoes a phase transition at the cutoff. Based on our theory, we propose an improved signal extraction technique by selecting tight timestamp clusters. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm improves depth estimation performance over ROM by 3 orders of magnitude at the same signal intensities, and achieves high image fidelity at noise levels as high as 17 times that of signal.</description>

      <title>Event-based Optical Flow on Neuromorphic Processor: ANN vs. SNN Comparison based on Activation Sparsification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) for event-based optical flow are claimed to be computationally more efficient than their artificial neural networks (ANNs) counterparts, but a fair comparison is missing in the literature. In this work, we propose an event-based optical flow solution based on activation sparsification and a neuromorphic processor, SENECA. SENECA has an event-driven processing mechanism that can exploit the sparsity in ANN activations and SNN spikes to accelerate the inference of both types of neural networks. The ANN and the SNN for comparison have similar low activation/spike density (~5%) thanks to our novel sparsification-aware training. In the hardware-in-loop experiments designed to deduce the average time and energy consumption, the SNN consumes 44.9ms and 927.0 microjoules, which are 62.5% and 75.2% of the ANN's consumption, respectively. We find that SNN's higher efficiency attributes to its lower pixel-wise spike density (43.5% vs. 66.5%) that requires fewer memory access operations for neuron states.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Quantitative Image Synthesis through Pretraining and Resolution Scaling for Bone Mineral Density Estimation from a Plain X-ray Image</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20495v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While most vision tasks are essentially visual in nature (for recognition), some important tasks, especially in the medical field, also require quantitative analysis (for quantification) using quantitative images. Unlike in visual analysis, pixel values in quantitative images correspond to physical metrics measured by specific devices (e.g., a depth image). However, recent work has shown that it is sometimes possible to synthesize accurate quantitative values from visual ones (e.g., depth from visual cues or defocus). This research aims to improve quantitative image synthesis (QIS) by exploring pretraining and image resolution scaling. We propose a benchmark for evaluating pretraining performance using the task of QIS-based bone mineral density (BMD) estimation from plain X-ray images, where the synthesized quantitative image is used to derive BMD. Our results show that appropriate pretraining can improve QIS performance, significantly raising the correlation of BMD estimation from 0.820 to 0.898, while others do not help or even hinder it. Scaling-up the resolution can further boost the correlation up to 0.923, a significant enhancement over conventional methods. Future work will include exploring more pretraining strategies and validating them on other image synthesis tasks.</description>

      <title>High-Resolution Spatial Transcriptomics from Histology Images using HisToSGE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics (ST) is a groundbreaking genomic technology that enables spatial localization analysis of gene expression within tissue sections. However, it is significantly limited by high costs and sparse spatial resolution. An alternative, more cost-effective strategy is to use deep learning methods to predict high-density gene expression profiles from histological images. However, existing methods struggle to capture rich image features effectively or rely on low-dimensional positional coordinates, making it difficult to accurately predict high-resolution gene expression profiles. To address these limitations, we developed HisToSGE, a method that employs a Pathology Image Large Model (PILM) to extract rich image features from histological images and utilizes a feature learning module to robustly generate high-resolution gene expression profiles. We evaluated HisToSGE on four ST datasets, comparing its performance with five state-of-the-art baseline methods. The results demonstrate that HisToSGE excels in generating high-resolution gene expression profiles and performing downstream tasks such as spatial domain identification. All code and public datasets used in this paper are available at https://github.com/wenwenmin/HisToSGE and https://zenodo.org/records/12792163.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Histopathology Foundation Models for Ovarian Cancer Bevacizumab Treatment Response Prediction from Whole Slide Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bevacizumab is a widely studied targeted therapeutic drug used in conjunction with standard chemotherapy for the treatment of recurrent ovarian cancer. While its administration has shown to increase the progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with advanced stage ovarian cancer, the lack of identifiable biomarkers for predicting patient response has been a major roadblock in its effective adoption towards personalized medicine. In this work, we leverage the latest histopathology foundation models trained on large-scale whole slide image (WSI) datasets to extract ovarian tumor tissue features for predicting bevacizumab response from WSIs. Our extensive experiments across a combination of different histopathology foundation models and multiple instance learning (MIL) strategies demonstrate capability of these large models in predicting bevacizumab response in ovarian cancer patients with the best models achieving an AUC score of 0.86 and an accuracy score of 72.5%. Furthermore, our survival models are able to stratify high- and low-risk cases with statistical significance (p &lt; 0.05) even among the patients with the aggressive subtype of high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma. This work highlights the utility of histopathology foundation models for the task of ovarian bevacizumab response prediction from WSIs. The high-attention regions of the WSIs highlighted by these models not only aid the model explainability but also serve as promising imaging biomarkers for treatment prognosis.</description>

      <title>PIP: Prototypes-Injected Prompt for Federated Class Incremental Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated Class Incremental Learning (FCIL) is a new direction in continual learning (CL) for addressing catastrophic forgetting and non-IID data distribution simultaneously. Existing FCIL methods call for high communication costs and exemplars from previous classes. We propose a novel rehearsal-free method for FCIL named prototypes-injected prompt (PIP) that involves 3 main ideas: a) prototype injection on prompt learning, b) prototype augmentation, and c) weighted Gaussian aggregation on the server side. Our experiment result shows that the proposed method outperforms the current state of the arts (SOTAs) with a significant improvement (up to 33%) in CIFAR100, MiniImageNet and TinyImageNet datasets. Our extensive analysis demonstrates the robustness of PIP in different task sizes, and the advantage of requiring smaller participating local clients, and smaller global rounds. For further study, source codes of PIP, baseline, and experimental logs are shared publicly in https://github.com/anwarmaxsum/PIP.</description>

      <title>Highly Efficient No-reference 4K Video Quality Assessment with Full-Pixel Covering Sampling and Training Strategy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep Video Quality Assessment (VQA) methods have shown impressive high-performance capabilities. Notably, no-reference (NR) VQA methods play a vital role in situations where obtaining reference videos is restricted or not feasible. Nevertheless, as more streaming videos are being created in ultra-high definition (e.g., 4K) to enrich viewers' experiences, the current deep VQA methods face unacceptable computational costs. Furthermore, the resizing, cropping, and local sampling techniques employed in these methods can compromise the details and content of original 4K videos, thereby negatively impacting quality assessment. In this paper, we propose a highly efficient and novel NR 4K VQA technology. Specifically, first, a novel data sampling and training strategy is proposed to tackle the problem of excessive resolution. This strategy allows the VQA Swin Transformer-based model to effectively train and make inferences using the full data of 4K videos on standard consumer-grade GPUs without compromising content or details. Second, a weighting and scoring scheme is developed to mimic the human subjective perception mode, which is achieved by considering the distinct impact of each sub-region within a 4K frame on the overall perception. Third, we incorporate the frequency domain information of video frames to better capture the details that affect video quality, consequently further improving the model's generalizability. To our knowledge, this is the first technology for the NR 4K VQA task. Thorough empirical studies demonstrate it not only significantly outperforms existing methods on a specialized 4K VQA dataset but also achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple open-source NR video quality datasets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated learning has emerged as a paradigm for collaborative learning, enabling the development of robust models without the need to centralise sensitive data. However, conventional federated learning techniques have privacy and security vulnerabilities due to the exposure of models, parameters or updates, which can be exploited as an attack surface. This paper presents Federated Knowledge Recycling (FedKR), a cross-silo federated learning approach that uses locally generated synthetic data to facilitate collaboration between institutions. FedKR combines advanced data generation techniques with a dynamic aggregation process to provide greater security against privacy attacks than existing methods, significantly reducing the attack surface. Experimental results on generic and medical datasets show that FedKR achieves competitive performance, with an average improvement in accuracy of 4.24% compared to training models from local data, demonstrating particular effectiveness in data scarcity scenarios.</description>

Abstract: This comparative study evaluates various neural surface reconstruction methods, particularly focusing on their implications for scientific visualization through reconstructing 3D surfaces via multi-view rendering images. We categorize ten methods into neural radiance fields and neural implicit surfaces, uncovering the benefits of leveraging distance functions (i.e., SDFs and UDFs) to enhance the accuracy and smoothness of the reconstructed surfaces. Our findings highlight the efficiency and quality of NeuS2 for reconstructing closed surfaces and identify NeUDF as a promising candidate for reconstructing open surfaces despite some limitations. By sharing our benchmark dataset, we invite researchers to test the performance of their methods, contributing to the advancement of surface reconstruction solutions for scientific visualization.</description>

      <title>S3PET: Semi-supervised Standard-dose PET Image Reconstruction via Dose-aware Token Swap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To acquire high-quality positron emission tomography (PET) images while reducing the radiation tracer dose, numerous efforts have been devoted to reconstructing standard-dose PET (SPET) images from low-dose PET (LPET). However, the success of current fully-supervised approaches relies on abundant paired LPET and SPET images, which are often unavailable in clinic. Moreover, these methods often mix the dose-invariant content with dose level-related dose-specific details during reconstruction, resulting in distorted images. To alleviate these problems, in this paper, we propose a two-stage Semi-Supervised SPET reconstruction framework, namely S3PET, to accommodate the training of abundant unpaired and limited paired SPET and LPET images. Our S3PET involves an un-supervised pre-training stage (Stage I) to extract representations from unpaired images, and a supervised dose-aware reconstruction stage (Stage II) to achieve LPET-to-SPET reconstruction by transferring the dose-specific knowledge between paired images. Specifically, in stage I, two independent dose-specific masked autoencoders (DsMAEs) are adopted to comprehensively understand the unpaired SPET and LPET images. Then, in Stage II, the pre-trained DsMAEs are further finetuned using paired images. To prevent distortions in both content and details, we introduce two elaborate modules, i.e., a dose knowledge decouple module to disentangle the respective dose-specific and dose-invariant knowledge of LPET and SPET, and a dose-specific knowledge learning module to transfer the dose-specific information from SPET to LPET, thereby achieving high-quality SPET reconstruction from LPET images. Experiments on two datasets demonstrate that our S3PET achieves state-of-the-art performance quantitatively and qualitatively.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Low-Rank LeArning (Bella): A Practical Approach to Bayesian Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computational complexity of Bayesian learning is impeding its adoption in practical, large-scale tasks. Despite demonstrations of significant merits such as improved robustness and resilience to unseen or out-of-distribution inputs over their non- Bayesian counterparts, their practical use has faded to near insignificance. In this study, we introduce an innovative framework to mitigate the computational burden of Bayesian neural networks (BNNs). Our approach follows the principle of Bayesian techniques based on deep ensembles, but significantly reduces their cost via multiple low-rank perturbations of parameters arising from a pre-trained neural network. Both vanilla version of ensembles as well as more sophisticated schemes such as Bayesian learning with Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD), previously deemed impractical for large models, can be seamlessly implemented within the proposed framework, called Bayesian Low-Rank LeArning (Bella). In a nutshell, i) Bella achieves a dramatic reduction in the number of trainable parameters required to approximate a Bayesian posterior; and ii) it not only maintains, but in some instances, surpasses the performance of conventional Bayesian learning methods and non-Bayesian baselines. Our results with large-scale tasks such as ImageNet, CAMELYON17, DomainNet, VQA with CLIP, LLaVA demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of Bella in building highly scalable and practical Bayesian deep models for real-world applications.</description>

Abstract: The field of reinforcement learning offers a large variety of concepts and methods to tackle sequential decision-making problems. This variety has become so large that choosing an algorithm for a task at hand can be challenging. In this work, we streamline the process of choosing reinforcement-learning algorithms and action-distribution families. We provide a structured overview of existing methods and their properties, as well as guidelines for when to choose which methods. An interactive version of these guidelines is available online at https://rl-picker.github.io/.</description>

      <title>EAR: Edge-Aware Reconstruction of 3-D vertebrae structures from bi-planar X-ray images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: X-ray images ease the diagnosis and treatment process due to their rapid imaging speed and high resolution. However, due to the projection process of X-ray imaging, much spatial information has been lost. To accurately provide efficient spinal morphological and structural information, reconstructing the 3-D structures of the spine from the 2-D X-ray images is essential. It is challenging for current reconstruction methods to preserve the edge information and local shapes of the asymmetrical vertebrae structures. In this study, we propose a new Edge-Aware Reconstruction network (EAR) to focus on the performance improvement of the edge information and vertebrae shapes. In our network, by using the auto-encoder architecture as the backbone, the edge attention module and frequency enhancement module are proposed to strengthen the perception of the edge reconstruction. Meanwhile, we also combine four loss terms, including reconstruction loss, edge loss, frequency loss and projection loss. The proposed method is evaluated using three publicly accessible datasets and compared with four state-of-the-art models. The proposed method is superior to other methods and achieves 25.32%, 15.32%, 86.44%, 80.13%, 23.7612 and 0.3014 with regard to MSE, MAE, Dice, SSIM, PSNR and frequency distance. Due to the end-to-end and accurate reconstruction process, EAR can provide sufficient 3-D spatial information and precise preoperative surgical planning guidance.</description>

      <title>From Feature Importance to Natural Language Explanations Using LLMs with RAG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As machine learning becomes increasingly integral to autonomous decision-making processes involving human interaction, the necessity of comprehending the model's outputs through conversational means increases. Most recently, foundation models are being explored for their potential as post hoc explainers, providing a pathway to elucidate the decision-making mechanisms of predictive models. In this work, we introduce traceable question-answering, leveraging an external knowledge repository to inform the responses of Large Language Models (LLMs) to user queries within a scene understanding task. This knowledge repository comprises contextual details regarding the model's output, containing high-level features, feature importance, and alternative probabilities. We employ subtractive counterfactual reasoning to compute feature importance, a method that entails analysing output variations resulting from decomposing semantic features. Furthermore, to maintain a seamless conversational flow, we integrate four key characteristics - social, causal, selective, and contrastive - drawn from social science research on human explanations into a single-shot prompt, guiding the response generation process. Our evaluation demonstrates that explanations generated by the LLMs encompassed these elements, indicating its potential to bridge the gap between complex model outputs and natural language expressions.</description>

      <title>Evolver: Chain-of-Evolution Prompting to Boost Large Multimodal Models for Hateful Meme Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances show that two-stream approaches have achieved outstanding performance in hateful meme detection. However, hateful memes constantly evolve as new memes emerge by fusing progressive cultural ideas, making existing methods obsolete or ineffective. In this work, we explore the potential of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) for hateful meme detection. To this end, we propose Evolver, which incorporates LMMs via Chain-of-Evolution (CoE) Prompting, by integrating the evolution attribute and in-context information of memes. Specifically, Evolver simulates the evolving and expressing process of memes and reasons through LMMs in a step-by-step manner. First, an evolutionary pair mining module retrieves the top-k most similar memes in the external curated meme set with the input meme. Second, an evolutionary information extractor is designed to summarize the semantic regularities between the paired memes for prompting. Finally, a contextual relevance amplifier enhances the in-context hatefulness information to boost the search for evolutionary processes. Extensive experiments on public FHM, MAMI, and HarM datasets show that CoE prompting can be incorporated into existing LMMs to improve their performance. More encouragingly, it can serve as an interpretive tool to promote the understanding of the evolution of social memes.</description>

      <title>Look Around and Learn: Self-Training Object Detection by Exploration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.03566v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When an object detector is deployed in a novel setting it often experiences a drop in performance. This paper studies how an embodied agent can automatically fine-tune a pre-existing object detector while exploring and acquiring images in a new environment without relying on human intervention, i.e., a fully self-supervised approach. In our setting, an agent initially learns to explore the environment using a pre-trained off-the-shelf detector to locate objects and associate pseudo-labels. By assuming that pseudo-labels for the same object must be consistent across different views, we learn the exploration policy Look Around to mine hard samples, and we devise a novel mechanism called Disagreement Reconciliation for producing refined pseudo-labels from the consensus among observations. We implement a unified benchmark of the current state-of-the-art and compare our approach with pre-existing exploration policies and perception mechanisms. Our method is shown to outperform existing approaches, improving the object detector by 6.2% in a simulated scenario, a 3.59% advancement over other state-of-the-art methods, and by 9.97% in the real robotic test without relying on ground-truth. Code for the proposed approach and baselines are available at https://iit-pavis.github.io/Look_Around_And_Learn/.</description>

      <title>Learning Signed Hyper Surfaces for Oriented Point Cloud Normal Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.05873v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel method called SHS-Net for oriented normal estimation of point clouds by learning signed hyper surfaces, which can accurately predict normals with global consistent orientation from various point clouds. Almost all existing methods estimate oriented normals through a two-stage pipeline, i.e., unoriented normal estimation and normal orientation, and each step is implemented by a separate algorithm. However, previous methods are sensitive to parameter settings, resulting in poor results from point clouds with noise, density variations and complex geometries. In this work, we introduce signed hyper surfaces (SHS), which are parameterized by multi-layer perceptron (MLP) layers, to learn to estimate oriented normals from point clouds in an end-to-end manner. The signed hyper surfaces are implicitly learned in a high-dimensional feature space where the local and global information is aggregated. Specifically, we introduce a patch encoding module and a shape encoding module to encode a 3D point cloud into a local latent code and a global latent code, respectively. Then, an attention-weighted normal prediction module is proposed as a decoder, which takes the local and global latent codes as input to predict oriented normals. Experimental results show that our SHS-Net outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in both unoriented and oriented normal estimation on the widely used benchmarks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.15318v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Shadows in scanned documents pose significant challenges for document analysis and recognition tasks due to their negative impact on visual quality and readability. Current shadow removal techniques, including traditional methods and deep learning approaches, face limitations in handling varying shadow intensities and preserving document details. To address these issues, we propose DocDeshadower, a novel multi-frequency Transformer-based model built upon the Laplacian Pyramid. By decomposing the shadow image into multiple frequency bands and employing two critical modules: the Attention-Aggregation Network for low-frequency shadow removal and the Gated Multi-scale Fusion Transformer for global refinement. DocDeshadower effectively removes shadows at different scales while preserving document content. Extensive experiments demonstrate DocDeshadower's superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its potential to significantly improve document shadow removal techniques. The code is available at https://github.com/leiyingtie/DocDeshadower.</description>

      <title>Semantic Image Synthesis via Class-Adaptive Cross-Attention</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.16071v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In semantic image synthesis the state of the art is dominated by methods that use customized variants of the SPatially-Adaptive DE-normalization (SPADE) layers, which allow for good visual generation quality and editing versatility. By design, such layers learn pixel-wise modulation parameters to de-normalize the generator activations based on the semantic class each pixel belongs to. Thus, they tend to overlook global image statistics, ultimately leading to unconvincing local style editing and causing global inconsistencies such as color or illumination distribution shifts. Also, SPADE layers require the semantic segmentation mask for mapping styles in the generator, preventing shape manipulations without manual intervention. In response, we designed a novel architecture where cross-attention layers are used in place of SPADE for learning shape-style correlations and so conditioning the image generation process. Our model inherits the versatility of SPADE, at the same time obtaining state-of-the-art generation quality, as well as improved global and local style transfer.

      <title>STUPD: A Synthetic Dataset for Spatial and Temporal Relation Reasoning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.06680v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding relations between objects is crucial for understanding the semantics of a visual scene. It is also an essential step in order to bridge visual and language models. However, current state-of-the-art computer vision models still lack the ability to perform spatial reasoning well. Existing datasets mostly cover a relatively small number of spatial relations, all of which are static relations that do not intrinsically involve motion. In this paper, we propose the Spatial and Temporal Understanding of Prepositions Dataset (STUPD) -- a large-scale video dataset for understanding static and dynamic spatial relationships derived from prepositions of the English language. The dataset contains 150K visual depictions (videos and images), consisting of 30 distinct spatial prepositional senses, in the form of object interaction simulations generated synthetically using Unity3D. In addition to spatial relations, we also propose 50K visual depictions across 10 temporal relations, consisting of videos depicting event/time-point interactions. To our knowledge, no dataset exists that represents temporal relations through visual settings. In this dataset, we also provide 3D information about object interactions such as frame-wise coordinates, and descriptions of the objects used. The goal of this synthetic dataset is to help models perform better in visual relationship detection in real-world settings. We demonstrate an increase in the performance of various models over 2 real-world datasets (ImageNet-VidVRD and Spatial Senses) when pretrained on the STUPD dataset, in comparison to other pretraining datasets.</description>

      <title>Noise-Tolerant Few-Shot Unsupervised Adapter for Vision-Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.14928v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in large-scale vision-language models have achieved impressive performance in various zero-shot image classification tasks. While prior studies have demonstrated significant improvements by introducing few-shot labelled target samples, they still require labelling of target samples, which greatly degrades their scalability and generalizability while handling various visual recognition tasks. We design NtUA, a Noise-tolerant Unsupervised Adapter that allows the learning of effective target models with few unlabelled target samples. NtUA works as a key-value cache that formulates visual features and predicted pseudo-labels of the few unlabelled target samples as key-value pairs. It consists of two complementary designs. The first is adaptive cache formation that combats pseudo-label noises by weighting the key-value pairs according to their prediction confidence. The second is knowledge-guided cache refinement, which refines pair values (i.e., pseudo-labels) and cache weights by leveraging knowledge distillation from large-scale vision language models. Extensive experiments show that NtUA achieves superior performance consistently across multiple widely adopted benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Chain of Visual Perception: Harnessing Multimodal Large Language Models for Zero-shot Camouflaged Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.11273v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel multimodal camo-perceptive framework (MMCPF) aimed at handling zero-shot Camouflaged Object Detection (COD) by leveraging the powerful capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Recognizing the inherent limitations of current COD methodologies, which predominantly rely on supervised learning models demanding extensive and accurately annotated datasets, resulting in weak generalization, our research proposes a zero-shot MMCPF that circumvents these challenges. Although MLLMs hold significant potential for broad applications, their effectiveness in COD is hindered and they would make misinterpretations of camouflaged objects. To address this challenge, we further propose a strategic enhancement called the Chain of Visual Perception (CoVP), which significantly improves the perceptual capabilities of MLLMs in camouflaged scenes by leveraging both linguistic and visual cues more effectively. We validate the effectiveness of MMCPF on five widely used COD datasets, containing CAMO, COD10K, NC4K, MoCA-Mask and OVCamo. Experiments show that MMCPF can outperform all existing state-of-the-art zero-shot COD methods, and achieve competitive performance compared to weakly-supervised and fully-supervised methods, which demonstrates the potential of MMCPF.

      <description>arXiv:2311.11325v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While recent years have witnessed great progress on using diffusion models for video generation, most of them are simple extensions of image generation frameworks, which fail to explicitly consider one of the key differences between videos and images, i.e., motion. In this paper, we propose a novel motion-aware video generation (MoVideo) framework that takes motion into consideration from two aspects: video depth and optical flow. The former regulates motion by per-frame object distances and spatial layouts, while the later describes motion by cross-frame correspondences that help in preserving fine details and improving temporal consistency. More specifically, given a key frame that exists or generated from text prompts, we first design a diffusion model with spatio-temporal modules to generate the video depth and the corresponding optical flows. Then, the video is generated in the latent space by another spatio-temporal diffusion model under the guidance of depth, optical flow-based warped latent video and the calculated occlusion mask. Lastly, we use optical flows again to align and refine different frames for better video decoding from the latent space to the pixel space. In experiments, MoVideo achieves state-of-the-art results in both text-to-video and image-to-video generation, showing promising prompt consistency, frame consistency and visual quality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.12063v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Progress in 3D computer vision tasks demands a huge amount of data, yet annotating multi-view images with 3D-consistent annotations, or point clouds with part segmentation is both time-consuming and challenging. This paper introduces DatasetNeRF, a novel approach capable of generating infinite, high-quality 3D-consistent 2D annotations alongside 3D point cloud segmentations, while utilizing minimal 2D human-labeled annotations. Specifically, we leverage the strong semantic prior within a 3D generative model to train a semantic decoder, requiring only a handful of fine-grained labeled samples. Once trained, the decoder efficiently generalizes across the latent space, enabling the generation of infinite data. The generated data is applicable across various computer vision tasks, including video segmentation and 3D point cloud segmentation. Our approach not only surpasses baseline models in segmentation quality, achieving superior 3D consistency and segmentation precision on individual images, but also demonstrates versatility by being applicable to both articulated and non-articulated generative models. Furthermore, we explore applications stemming from our approach, such as 3D-aware semantic editing and 3D inversion.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Radiology Report Generation via Causal Inspired Counterfactual Augmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.13307v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Radiology Report Generation (RRG) draws attention as a vision-and-language interaction of biomedical fields. Previous works inherited the ideology of traditional language generation tasks, aiming to generate paragraphs with high readability as reports. Despite significant progress, the independence between diseases-a specific property of RRG-was neglected, yielding the models being confused by the co-occurrence of diseases brought on by the biased data distribution, thus generating inaccurate reports. In this paper, to rethink this issue, we first model the causal effects between the variables from a causal perspective, through which we prove that the co-occurrence relationships between diseases on the biased distribution function as confounders, confusing the accuracy through two backdoor paths, i.e. the Joint Vision Coupling and the Conditional Sequential Coupling. Then, we proposed a novel model-agnostic counterfactual augmentation method that contains two strategies, i.e. the Prototype-based Counterfactual Sample Synthesis (P-CSS) and the Magic-Cube-like Counterfactual Report Reconstruction (Cube), to intervene the backdoor paths, thus enhancing the accuracy and generalization of RRG models. Experimental results on the widely used MIMIC-CXR dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. Additionally, a generalization performance is evaluated on IU X-Ray dataset, which verifies our work can effectively reduce the impact of co-occurrences caused by different distributions on the results.</description>

      <title>The Sky's the Limit: Re-lightable Outdoor Scenes via a Sky-pixel Constrained Illumination Prior and Outside-In Visibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16937v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inverse rendering of outdoor scenes from unconstrained image collections is a challenging task, particularly illumination/albedo ambiguities and occlusion of the illumination environment (shadowing) caused by geometry. However, there are many cues in an image that can aid in the disentanglement of geometry, albedo and shadows. Whilst sky is frequently masked out in state-of-the-art methods, we exploit the fact that any sky pixel provides a direct observation of distant lighting in the corresponding direction and, via a neural illumination prior, a statistical cue to derive the remaining illumination environment. The incorporation of our illumination prior is enabled by a novel `outside-in' method for computing differentiable sky visibility based on a neural directional distance function. This is highly efficient and can be trained in parallel with the neural scene representation, allowing gradients from appearance loss to flow from shadows to influence the estimation of illumination and geometry. Our method estimates high-quality albedo, geometry, illumination and sky visibility, achieving state-of-the-art results on the NeRF-OSR relighting benchmark.

Existing text-to-3D methods typically optimize the 3D representation to ensure that the rendered image aligns well with the given text, as evaluated by the pretrained 2D diffusion model. Nevertheless, a substantial domain gap exists between 2D images and 3D assets, primarily attributed to variations in camera-related attributes and the exclusive presence of foreground objects. Consequently, employing 2D diffusion models directly for optimizing 3D representations may lead to suboptimal outcomes. To address this issue, we present X-Dreamer, a novel approach for high-quality text-to-3D content creation that effectively bridges the gap between text-to-2D and text-to-3D synthesis. The key components of X-Dreamer are two innovative designs: Camera-Guided Low-Rank Adaptation (CG-LoRA) and Attention-Mask Alignment (AMA) Loss. CG-LoRA dynamically incorporates camera information into the pretrained diffusion models by employing camera-dependent generation for trainable parameters. This integration enhances the alignment between the generated 3D assets and the camera's perspective. AMA loss guides the attention map of the pretrained diffusion model using the binary mask of the 3D object, prioritizing the creation of the foreground object. This module ensures that the model focuses on generating accurate and detailed foreground objects. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method compared to existing text-to-3D approaches.

      <title>AUGCAL: Improving Sim2Real Adaptation by Uncertainty Calibration on Augmented Synthetic Images</title>

Abstract: Synthetic data (SIM) drawn from simulators have emerged as a popular alternative for training models where acquiring annotated real-world images is difficult. However, transferring models trained on synthetic images to real-world applications can be challenging due to appearance disparities. A commonly employed solution to counter this SIM2REAL gap is unsupervised domain adaptation, where models are trained using labeled SIM data and unlabeled REAL data. Mispredictions made by such SIM2REAL adapted models are often associated with miscalibration - stemming from overconfident predictions on real data. In this paper, we introduce AUGCAL, a simple training-time patch for unsupervised adaptation that improves SIM2REAL adapted models by - (1) reducing overall miscalibration, (2) reducing overconfidence in incorrect predictions and (3) improving confidence score reliability by better guiding misclassification detection - all while retaining or improving SIM2REAL performance. Given a base SIM2REAL adaptation algorithm, at training time, AUGCAL involves replacing vanilla SIM images with strongly augmented views (AUG intervention) and additionally optimizing for a training time calibration loss on augmented SIM predictions (CAL intervention). We motivate AUGCAL using a brief analytical justification of how to reduce miscalibration on unlabeled REAL data. Through our experiments, we empirically show the efficacy of AUGCAL across multiple adaptation methods, backbones, tasks and shifts.</description>

Abstract: While neural rendering has led to impressive advances in scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis, it relies heavily on accurately pre-computed camera poses. To relax this constraint, multiple efforts have been made to train Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) without pre-processed camera poses. However, the implicit representations of NeRFs provide extra challenges to optimize the 3D structure and camera poses at the same time. On the other hand, the recently proposed 3D Gaussian Splatting provides new opportunities given its explicit point cloud representations. This paper leverages both the explicit geometric representation and the continuity of the input video stream to perform novel view synthesis without any SfM preprocessing. We process the input frames in a sequential manner and progressively grow the 3D Gaussians set by taking one input frame at a time, without the need to pre-compute the camera poses. Our method significantly improves over previous approaches in view synthesis and camera pose estimation under large motion changes.

      <title>Ponymation: Learning 3D Animal Motions from Unlabeled Online Videos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13604v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce Ponymation, a new method for learning a generative model of articulated 3D animal motions from raw, unlabeled online videos. Unlike existing approaches for motion synthesis, our model does not require any pose annotations or parametric shape models for training, and is learned purely from a collection of raw video clips obtained from the Internet. We build upon a recent work, MagicPony, which learns articulated 3D animal shapes purely from single image collections, and extend it on two fronts. First, instead of training on static images, we augment the framework with a video training pipeline that incorporates temporal regularizations, achieving more accurate and temporally consistent reconstructions. Second, we learn a generative model of the underlying articulated 3D motion sequences via a spatio-temporal transformer VAE, simply using 2D reconstruction losses without relying on any explicit pose annotations. At inference time, given a single 2D image of a new animal instance, our model reconstructs an articulated, textured 3D mesh, and generates plausible 3D animations by sampling from the learned motion latent space.</description>

      <title>WidthFormer: Toward Efficient Transformer-based BEV View Transformation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.03836v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present WidthFormer, a novel transformer-based module to compute Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) representations from multi-view cameras for real-time autonomous-driving applications. WidthFormer is computationally efficient, robust and does not require any special engineering effort to deploy. We first introduce a novel 3D positional encoding mechanism capable of accurately encapsulating 3D geometric information, which enables our model to compute high-quality BEV representations with only a single transformer decoder layer. This mechanism is also beneficial for existing sparse 3D object detectors. Inspired by the recently proposed works, we further improve our model's efficiency by vertically compressing the image features when serving as attention keys and values, and then we develop two modules to compensate for potential information loss due to feature compression. Experimental evaluation on the widely-used nuScenes 3D object detection benchmark demonstrates that our method outperforms previous approaches across different 3D detection architectures. More importantly, our model is highly efficient. For example, when using $256\times 704$ input images, it achieves 1.5 ms and 2.8 ms latency on NVIDIA 3090 GPU and Horizon Journey-5 computation solutions. Furthermore, WidthFormer also exhibits strong robustness to different degrees of camera perturbations. Our study offers valuable insights into the deployment of BEV transformation methods in real-world, complex road environments.

      <description>arXiv:2402.01393v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We seek to enable classic processing of continuous ultra-sparse spatiotemporal data generated by event-based sensors with dense machine learning models. We propose a novel hybrid pipeline composed of asynchronous sensing and synchronous processing that combines several ideas: (1) an embedding based on PointNet models -- the ALERT module -- that can continuously integrate new and dismiss old events thanks to a leakage mechanism, (2) a flexible readout of the embedded data that allows to feed any downstream model with always up-to-date features at any sampling rate, (3) exploiting the input sparsity in a patch-based approach inspired by Vision Transformer to optimize the efficiency of the method. These embeddings are then processed by a transformer model trained for object and gesture recognition. Using this approach, we achieve performances at the state-of-the-art with a lower latency than competitors. We also demonstrate that our asynchronous model can operate at any desired sampling rate.</description>

      <title>On the Exploitation of DCT-Traces in the Generative-AI Domain</title>

Abstract: Deepfakes represent one of the toughest challenges in the world of Cybersecurity and Digital Forensics, especially considering the high-quality results obtained with recent generative AI-based solutions. Almost all generative models leave unique traces in synthetic data that, if analyzed and identified in detail, can be exploited to improve the generalization limitations of existing deepfake detectors. In this paper we analyzed deepfake images in the frequency domain generated by both GAN and Diffusion Model engines, examining in detail the underlying statistical distribution of Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) coefficients. Recognizing that not all coefficients contribute equally to image detection, we hypothesize the existence of a unique ``discriminative fingerprint", embedded in specific combinations of coefficients. To identify them, Machine Learning classifiers were trained on various combinations of coefficients. In addition, the Explainable AI (XAI) LIME algorithm was used to search for intrinsic discriminative combinations of coefficients. Finally, we performed a robustness test to analyze the persistence of traces by applying JPEG compression. The experimental results reveal the existence of traces left by the generative models that are more discriminative and persistent at JPEG attacks.

      <title>GenNBV: Generalizable Next-Best-View Policy for Active 3D Reconstruction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16174v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While recent advances in neural radiance field enable realistic digitization for large-scale scenes, the image-capturing process is still time-consuming and labor-intensive. Previous works attempt to automate this process using the Next-Best-View (NBV) policy for active 3D reconstruction. However, the existing NBV policies heavily rely on hand-crafted criteria, limited action space, or per-scene optimized representations. These constraints limit their cross-dataset generalizability. To overcome them, we propose GenNBV, an end-to-end generalizable NBV policy. Our policy adopts a reinforcement learning (RL)-based framework and extends typical limited action space to 5D free space. It empowers our agent drone to scan from any viewpoint, and even interact with unseen geometries during training. To boost the cross-dataset generalizability, we also propose a novel multi-source state embedding, including geometric, semantic, and action representations. We establish a benchmark using the Isaac Gym simulator with the Houses3K and OmniObject3D datasets to evaluate this NBV policy. Experiments demonstrate that our policy achieves a 98.26% and 97.12% coverage ratio on unseen building-scale objects from these datasets, respectively, outperforming prior solutions.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Bounding Box Uncertainties via Two-Step Conformal Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07263v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantifying a model's predictive uncertainty is essential for safety-critical applications such as autonomous driving. We consider quantifying such uncertainty for multi-object detection. In particular, we leverage conformal prediction to obtain uncertainty intervals with guaranteed coverage for object bounding boxes. One challenge in doing so is that bounding box predictions are conditioned on the object's class label. Thus, we develop a novel two-step conformal approach that propagates uncertainty in predicted class labels into the uncertainty intervals of bounding boxes. This broadens the validity of our conformal coverage guarantees to include incorrectly classified objects, thus offering more actionable safety assurances. Moreover, we investigate novel ensemble and quantile regression formulations to ensure the bounding box intervals are adaptive to object size, leading to a more balanced coverage. Validating our two-step approach on real-world datasets for 2D bounding box localization, we find that desired coverage levels are satisfied with practically tight predictive uncertainty intervals.</description>

Abstract: Feature point detection and description is the backbone for various computer vision applications, such as Structure-from-Motion, visual SLAM, and visual place recognition. While learning-based methods have surpassed traditional handcrafted techniques, their training often relies on simplistic homography-based simulations of multi-view perspectives, limiting model generalisability. This paper presents a novel approach leveraging Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) to generate a diverse and realistic dataset consisting of indoor and outdoor scenes. Our proposed methodology adapts state-of-the-art feature detectors and descriptors for training on multi-view NeRF-synthesised data, with supervision achieved through perspective projective geometry. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed methodology achieves competitive or superior performance on standard benchmarks for relative pose estimation, point cloud registration, and homography estimation while requiring significantly less training data and time compared to existing approaches.</description>

      <title>AFGI: Towards Accurate and Fast-convergent Gradient Inversion Attack in Federated Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08383v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) empowers privacypreservation in model training by only exposing users' model gradients. Yet, FL users are susceptible to gradient inversion attacks (GIAs) which can reconstruct ground-truth training data such as images based on model gradients. However, reconstructing high-resolution images by existing GIAs faces two challenges: inferior accuracy and slow-convergence, especially when duplicating labels exist in the training batch. To address these challenges, we present an Accurate and Fast-convergent Gradient Inversion attack algorithm, called AFGI, with two components: Label Recovery Block (LRB) which can accurately restore duplicating labels of private images based on exposed gradients; VME Regularization Term, which includes the total variance of reconstructed images, the discrepancy between three-channel means and edges, between values from exposed gradients and reconstructed images, respectively. The AFGI can be regarded as a white-box attack strategy to reconstruct images by leveraging labels recovered by LRB. In particular, AFGI is efficient that accurately reconstruct ground-truth images when users' training batch size is up to 48. Our experimental results manifest that AFGI can diminish 85% time costs while achieving superb inversion quality in the ImageNet dataset. At last, our study unveils the shortcomings of FL in privacy-preservation, prompting the development of more advanced countermeasure strategies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11057v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motion prediction is among the most fundamental tasks in autonomous driving. Traditional methods of motion forecasting primarily encode vector information of maps and historical trajectory data of traffic participants, lacking a comprehensive understanding of overall traffic semantics, which in turn affects the performance of prediction tasks. In this paper, we utilized Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance the global traffic context understanding for motion prediction tasks. We first conducted systematic prompt engineering, visualizing complex traffic environments and historical trajectory information of traffic participants into image prompts -- Transportation Context Map (TC-Map), accompanied by corresponding text prompts. Through this approach, we obtained rich traffic context information from the LLM. By integrating this information into the motion prediction model, we demonstrate that such context can enhance the accuracy of motion predictions. Furthermore, considering the cost associated with LLMs, we propose a cost-effective deployment strategy: enhancing the accuracy of motion prediction tasks at scale with 0.7\% LLM-augmented datasets. Our research offers valuable insights into enhancing the understanding of traffic scenes of LLMs and the motion prediction performance of autonomous driving.

Abstract: Semantic Image Synthesis (SIS) is among the most popular and effective techniques in the field of face generation and editing, thanks to its good generation quality and the versatility is brings along. Recent works attempted to go beyond the standard GAN-based framework, and started to explore Diffusion Models (DMs) for this task as these stand out with respect to GANs in terms of both quality and diversity. On the other hand, DMs lack in fine-grained controllability and reproducibility. To address that, in this paper we propose a SIS framework based on a novel Latent Diffusion Model architecture for human face generation and editing that is both able to reproduce and manipulate a real reference image and generate diversity-driven results. The proposed system utilizes both SPADE normalization and cross-attention layers to merge shape and style information and, by doing so, allows for a precise control over each of the semantic parts of the human face. This was not possible with previous methods in the state of the art. Finally, we performed an extensive set of experiments to prove that our model surpasses current state of the art, both qualitatively and quantitatively.</description>

Abstract: 3D Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) captures stable and comprehensive motion states of surrounding obstacles, essential for robotic perception. However, current 3D trackers face issues with accuracy and latency consistency. In this paper, we propose Fast-Poly, a fast and effective filter-based method for 3D MOT. Building upon our previous work Poly-MOT, Fast-Poly addresses object rotational anisotropy in 3D space, enhances local computation densification, and leverages parallelization technique, improving inference speed and precision. Fast-Poly is extensively tested on two large-scale tracking benchmarks with Python implementation. On the nuScenes dataset, Fast-Poly achieves new state-of-the-art performance with 75.8% AMOTA among all methods and can run at 34.2 FPS on a personal CPU. On the Waymo dataset, Fast-Poly exhibits competitive accuracy with 63.6% MOTA and impressive inference speed (35.5 FPS). The source code is publicly available at https://github.com/lixiaoyu2000/FastPoly.</description>

Abstract: Estimating the pose of objects through vision is essential to make robotic platforms interact with the environment. Yet, it presents many challenges, often related to the lack of flexibility and generalizability of state-of-the-art solutions. Diffusion models are a cutting-edge neural architecture transforming 2D and 3D computer vision, outlining remarkable performances in zero-shot novel-view synthesis. Such a use case is particularly intriguing for reconstructing 3D objects. However, localizing objects in unstructured environments is rather unexplored. To this end, this work presents Zero123-6D, the first work to demonstrate the utility of Diffusion Model-based novel-view-synthesizers in enhancing RGB 6D pose estimation at category-level, by integrating them with feature extraction techniques. Novel View Synthesis allows to obtain a coarse pose that is refined through an online optimization method introduced in this work to deal with intra-category geometric differences. In such a way, the outlined method shows reduction in data requirements, removal of the necessity of depth information in zero-shot category-level 6D pose estimation task, and increased performance, quantitatively demonstrated through experiments on the CO3D dataset.</description>

Abstract: Due to its great application potential, large-scale scene generation has drawn extensive attention in academia and industry. Recent research employs powerful generative models to create desired scenes and achieves promising results. However, most of these methods represent the scene using 3D primitives (e.g. point cloud or radiance field) incompatible with the industrial pipeline, which leads to a substantial gap between academic research and industrial deployment. Procedural Controllable Generation (PCG) is an efficient technique for creating scalable and high-quality assets, but it is unfriendly for ordinary users as it demands profound domain expertise. To address these issues, we resort to using the large language model (LLM) to drive the procedural modeling. In this paper, we introduce a large-scale scene generation framework, SceneX, which can automatically produce high-quality procedural models according to designers' textual descriptions.Specifically, the proposed method comprises two components, PCGBench and PCGPlanner. The former encompasses an extensive collection of accessible procedural assets and thousands of hand-craft API documents. The latter aims to generate executable actions for Blender to produce controllable and precise 3D assets guided by the user's instructions. Our SceneX can generate a city spanning 2.5 km times 2.5 km with delicate layout and geometric structures, drastically reducing the time cost from several weeks for professional PCG engineers to just a few hours for an ordinary user. Extensive experiments demonstrated the capability of our method in controllable large-scale scene generation and editing, including asset placement and season translation.</description>

      <title>latentSplat: Autoencoding Variational Gaussians for Fast Generalizable 3D Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16292v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present latentSplat, a method to predict semantic Gaussians in a 3D latent space that can be splatted and decoded by a light-weight generative 2D architecture. Existing methods for generalizable 3D reconstruction either do not scale to large scenes and resolutions, or are limited to interpolation of close input views. latentSplat combines the strengths of regression-based and generative approaches while being trained purely on readily available real video data. The core of our method are variational 3D Gaussians, a representation that efficiently encodes varying uncertainty within a latent space consisting of 3D feature Gaussians. From these Gaussians, specific instances can be sampled and rendered via efficient splatting and a fast, generative decoder. We show that latentSplat outperforms previous works in reconstruction quality and generalization, while being fast and scalable to high-resolution data.</description>

      <title>Local-peak scale-invariant feature transform for fast and random image stitching</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08578v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Image stitching aims to construct a wide field of view with high spatial resolution, which cannot be achieved in a single exposure. Typically, conventional image stitching techniques, other than deep learning, require complex computation and thus computational pricy, especially for stitching large raw images. In this study, inspired by the multiscale feature of fluid turbulence, we developed a fast feature point detection algorithm named local-peak scale-invariant feature transform (LP-SIFT), based on the multiscale local peaks and scale-invariant feature transform method. By combining LP-SIFT and RANSAC in image stitching, the stitching speed can be improved by orders, compared with the original SIFT method. Nine large images (over 2600*1600 pixels), arranged randomly without prior knowledge, can be stitched within 158.94 s. The algorithm is highly practical for applications requiring a wide field of view in diverse application scenes, e.g., terrain mapping, biological analysis, and even criminal investigation.</description>

      <title>Harnessing the power of longitudinal medical imaging for eye disease prognosis using Transformer-based sequence modeling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08780v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep learning has enabled breakthroughs in automated diagnosis from medical imaging, with many successful applications in ophthalmology. However, standard medical image classification approaches only assess disease presence at the time of acquisition, neglecting the common clinical setting of longitudinal imaging. For slow, progressive eye diseases like age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG), patients undergo repeated imaging over time to track disease progression and forecasting the future risk of developing disease is critical to properly plan treatment. Our proposed Longitudinal Transformer for Survival Analysis (LTSA) enables dynamic disease prognosis from longitudinal medical imaging, modeling the time to disease from sequences of fundus photography images captured over long, irregular time periods. Using longitudinal imaging data from the Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) and Ocular Hypertension Treatment Study (OHTS), LTSA significantly outperformed a single-image baseline in 19/20 head-to-head comparisons on late AMD prognosis and 18/20 comparisons on POAG prognosis. A temporal attention analysis also suggested that, while the most recent image is typically the most influential, prior imaging still provides additional prognostic value.</description>

      <title>Eyes Wide Unshut: Unsupervised Mistake Detection in Egocentric Procedural Video by Detecting Unpredictable Gaze</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08379v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the challenge of unsupervised mistake detection in egocentric procedural video through the analysis of gaze signals. Traditional supervised mistake detection methods rely on manually labeled mistakes, and hence suffer from domain-dependence and scalability issues. We introduce an unsupervised method for detecting mistakes in videos of human activities, overcoming the challenges of domain-specific requirements and the need for annotated data. We postulate that, when a subject is making a mistake in the execution of a procedure, their attention patterns will deviate from normality. We hence propose to detect mistakes by comparing gaze trajectories predicted from input video with ground truth gaze signals collected through a gaze tracker. Since predicting gaze in video is characterized by high uncertainty, we propose a novel \textit{gaze completion task}, which aims to predict gaze from visual observations and partial gaze trajectories. We further contribute a \textit{gaze completion approach} based on a Gaze-Frame Correlation module to explicitly model the correlation between gaze information and each local visual token. Inconsistencies between the predicted and observed gaze trajectories act as an indicator for identifying mistakes. Experiments on the EPIC-Tent, HoloAssist and IndustReal datasets showcase the effectiveness of the proposed approach as compared to unsupervised and one-class techniques. Our method is ranked first on the HoloAssist Mistake Detection challenge.</description>

      <title>MMWorld: Towards Multi-discipline Multi-faceted World Model Evaluation in Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08407v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multimodal Language Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate the emerging abilities of "world models" -- interpreting and reasoning about complex real-world dynamics. To assess these abilities, we posit videos are the ideal medium, as they encapsulate rich representations of real-world dynamics and causalities. To this end, we introduce MMWorld, a new benchmark for multi-discipline, multi-faceted multimodal video understanding. MMWorld distinguishes itself from previous video understanding benchmarks with two unique advantages: (1) multi-discipline, covering various disciplines that often require domain expertise for comprehensive understanding; (2) multi-faceted reasoning, including explanation, counterfactual thinking, future prediction, etc. MMWorld consists of a human-annotated dataset to evaluate MLLMs with questions about the whole videos and a synthetic dataset to analyze MLLMs within a single modality of perception. Together, MMWorld encompasses 1,910 videos across seven broad disciplines and 69 subdisciplines, complete with 6,627 question-answer pairs and associated captions. The evaluation includes 2 proprietary and 10 open-source MLLMs, which struggle on MMWorld (e.g., GPT-4V performs the best with only 52.3\% accuracy), showing large room for improvement. Further ablation studies reveal other interesting findings such as models' different skill sets from humans. We hope MMWorld can serve as an essential step towards world model evaluation in videos.</description>

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have achieved impressive performance in 2D image understanding, however they are still struggling with spatial understanding which is the foundation of Embodied AI. In this paper, we propose SpatialBot for better spatial understanding by feeding both RGB and depth images. Additionally, we have constructed the SpatialQA dataset, which involves multi-level depth-related questions to train VLMs for depth understanding. Finally, we present SpatialBench to comprehensively evaluate VLMs' capabilities in spatial understanding at different levels. Extensive experiments on our spatial-understanding benchmark, general VLM benchmarks and Embodied AI tasks, demonstrate the remarkable improvements of SpatialBot trained on SpatialQA. The model, code and data are available at https://github.com/BAAI-DCAI/SpatialBot.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13844v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current research in breast cancer Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), especially with Artificial Intelligence (AI), faces challenges due to the lack of expert segmentations. To address this, we introduce the MAMA-MIA dataset, comprising 1506 multi-center dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI cases with expert segmentations of primary tumors and non-mass enhancement areas. These cases were sourced from four publicly available collections in The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA). Initially, we trained a deep learning model to automatically segment the cases, generating preliminary segmentations that significantly reduced expert segmentation time. Sixteen experts, averaging 9 years of experience in breast cancer, then corrected these segmentations, resulting in the final expert segmentations. Additionally, two radiologists conducted a visual inspection of the automatic segmentations to support future quality control studies. Alongside the expert segmentations, we provide 49 harmonized demographic and clinical variables and the pretrained weights of the well-known nnUNet architecture trained using the DCE-MRI full-images and expert segmentations. This dataset aims to accelerate the development and benchmarking of deep learning models and foster innovation in breast cancer diagnostics and treatment planning.</description>

      <title>Gaze-directed Vision GNN for Mitigating Shortcut Learning in Medical Image</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14050v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep neural networks have demonstrated remarkable performance in medical image analysis. However, its susceptibility to spurious correlations due to shortcut learning raises concerns about network interpretability and reliability. Furthermore, shortcut learning is exacerbated in medical contexts where disease indicators are often subtle and sparse. In this paper, we propose a novel gaze-directed Vision GNN (called GD-ViG) to leverage the visual patterns of radiologists from gaze as expert knowledge, directing the network toward disease-relevant regions, and thereby mitigating shortcut learning. GD-ViG consists of a gaze map generator (GMG) and a gaze-directed classifier (GDC). Combining the global modelling ability of GNNs with the locality of CNNs, GMG generates the gaze map based on radiologists' visual patterns. Notably, it eliminates the need for real gaze data during inference, enhancing the network's practical applicability. Utilizing gaze as the expert knowledge, the GDC directs the construction of graph structures by incorporating both feature distances and gaze distances, enabling the network to focus on disease-relevant foregrounds. Thereby avoiding shortcut learning and improving the network's interpretability. The experiments on two public medical image datasets demonstrate that GD-ViG outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, and effectively mitigates shortcut learning. Our code is available at https://github.com/SX-SS/GD-ViG.</description>

      <title>From Majority to Minority: A Diffusion-based Augmentation for Underrepresented Groups in Skin Lesion Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18375v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: AI-based diagnoses have demonstrated dermatologist-level performance in classifying skin cancer. However, such systems are prone to under-performing when tested on data from minority groups that lack sufficient representation in the training sets. Although data collection and annotation offer the best means for promoting minority groups, these processes are costly and time-consuming. Prior works have suggested that data from majority groups may serve as a valuable information source to supplement the training of diagnosis tools for minority groups. In this work, we propose an effective diffusion-based augmentation framework that maximizes the use of rich information from majority groups to benefit minority groups. Using groups with different skin types as a case study, our results show that the proposed framework can generate synthetic images that improve diagnostic results for the minority groups, even when there is little or no reference data from these target groups. The practical value of our work is evident in medical imaging analysis, where under-diagnosis persists as a problem for certain groups due to insufficient representation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.20055v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is a promising technique for 3D reconstruction, offering efficient training and rendering speeds, making it suitable for real-time applications.However, current methods require highly controlled environments (no moving people or wind-blown elements, and consistent lighting) to meet the inter-view consistency assumption of 3DGS. This makes reconstruction of real-world captures problematic. We present SpotLessSplats, an approach that leverages pre-trained and general-purpose features coupled with robust optimization to effectively ignore transient distractors. Our method achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality both visually and quantitatively, on casual captures. Additional results available at: https://spotlesssplats.github.io</description>

      <title>Improving Zero-shot Generalization of Learned Prompts via Unsupervised Knowledge Distillation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03056v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate remarkable zero-shot generalization to unseen tasks, but fall short of the performance of supervised methods in generalizing to downstream tasks with limited data. Prompt learning is emerging as a parameter-efficient method for adapting VLMs, but state-of-the-art approaches require annotated samples. In this paper we propose a novel approach to prompt learning based on unsupervised knowledge distillation from more powerful models. Our approach, which we call Knowledge Distillation Prompt Learning (KDPL), can be integrated into existing prompt learning techniques and eliminates the need for labeled examples during adaptation. Our experiments on more than ten standard benchmark datasets demonstrate that KDPL is very effective at improving generalization of learned prompts for zero-shot domain generalization, zero-shot cross-dataset generalization, and zero-shot base-to-novel class generalization problems. KDPL requires no ground-truth labels for adaptation, and moreover we show that even in the absence of any knowledge of training class names it can be used to effectively transfer knowledge. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/miccunifi/KDPL.</description>

Abstract: Visual anomaly detection is critical in industrial manufacturing, but traditional methods often rely on extensive normal datasets and custom models, limiting scalability. Recent advancements in large-scale visual-language models have significantly improved zero/few-shot anomaly detection. However, these approaches may not fully utilize hierarchical features, potentially missing nuanced details. We introduce a window self-attention mechanism based on the CLIP model, combined with learnable prompts to process multi-level features within a Soldier-Offier Window self-Attention (SOWA) framework. Our method has been tested on five benchmark datasets, demonstrating superior performance by leading in 18 out of 20 metrics compared to existing state-of-the-art techniques.</description>

      <title>Learning with Alignments: Tackling the Inter- and Intra-domain Shifts for Cross-multidomain Facial Expression Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05688v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Facial Expression Recognition (FER) holds significant importance in human-computer interactions. Existing cross-domain FER methods often transfer knowledge solely from a single labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain, neglecting the comprehensive information across multiple sources. Nevertheless, cross-multidomain FER (CMFER) is very challenging for (i) the inherent inter-domain shifts across multiple domains and (ii) the intra-domain shifts stemming from the ambiguous expressions and low inter-class distinctions. In this paper, we propose a novel Learning with Alignments CMFER framework, named LA-CMFER, to handle both inter- and intra-domain shifts. Specifically, LA-CMFER is constructed with a global branch and a local branch to extract features from the full images and local subtle expressions, respectively. Based on this, LA-CMFER presents a dual-level inter-domain alignment method to force the model to prioritize hard-to-align samples in knowledge transfer at a sample level while gradually generating a well-clustered feature space with the guidance of class attributes at a cluster level, thus narrowing the inter-domain shifts. To address the intra-domain shifts, LA-CMFER introduces a multi-view intra-domain alignment method with a multi-view clustering consistency constraint where a prediction similarity matrix is built to pursue consistency between the global and local views, thus refining pseudo labels and eliminating latent noise. Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets have validated the superiority of our LA-CMFER.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08260v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large-scale LiDAR mappings and localization leverage place recognition techniques to mitigate odometry drifts, ensuring accurate mapping. These techniques utilize scene representations from LiDAR point clouds to identify previously visited sites within a database. Local descriptors, assigned to each point within a point cloud, are aggregated to form a scene representation for the point cloud. These descriptors are also used to re-rank the retrieved point clouds based on geometric fitness scores. We propose SALSA, a novel, lightweight, and efficient framework for LiDAR place recognition. It consists of a Sphereformer backbone that uses radial window attention to enable information aggregation for sparse distant points, an adaptive self-attention layer to pool local descriptors into tokens, and a multi-layer-perceptron Mixer layer for aggregating the tokens to generate a scene descriptor. The proposed framework outperforms existing methods on various LiDAR place recognition datasets in terms of both retrieval and metric localization while operating in real-time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09230v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Acquiring surgical data for research and development is significantly hindered by high annotation costs and practical and ethical constraints. Utilizing synthetically generated images could offer a valuable alternative. In this work, we explore adapting text-to-image generative models for the surgical domain using the CholecT50 dataset, which provides surgical images annotated with action triplets (instrument, verb, target). We investigate several language models and find T5 to offer more distinct features for differentiating surgical actions on triplet-based textual inputs, and showcasing stronger alignment between long and triplet-based captions. To address challenges in training text-to-image models solely on triplet-based captions without additional inputs and supervisory signals, we discover that triplet text embeddings are instrument-centric in the latent space. Leveraging this insight, we design an instrument-based class balancing technique to counteract data imbalance and skewness, improving training convergence. Extending Imagen, a diffusion-based generative model, we develop Surgical Imagen to generate photorealistic and activity-aligned surgical images from triplet-based textual prompts. We assess the model on quality, alignment, reasoning, and knowledge, achieving FID and CLIP scores of 3.7 and 26.8% respectively. Human expert survey shows that participants were highly challenged by the realistic characteristics of the generated samples, demonstrating Surgical Imagen's effectiveness as a practical alternative to real data collection.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we propose the differentiable voxelization of 3D meshes via the winding number and solid angles. The proposed approach achieves fast, flexible, and accurate voxelization of 3D meshes, admitting the computation of gradients with respect to the input mesh and GPU acceleration. We further demonstrate the application of the proposed voxelization in mesh morphing, where the voxelized mesh is deformed by a neural network. The proposed method is evaluated on the ShapeNet dataset and achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Frequency Guidance Matters: Skeletal Action Recognition by Frequency-Aware Mixed Transformer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12322v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, transformers have demonstrated great potential for modeling long-term dependencies from skeleton sequences and thereby gained ever-increasing attention in skeleton action recognition. However, the existing transformer-based approaches heavily rely on the naive attention mechanism for capturing the spatiotemporal features, which falls short in learning discriminative representations that exhibit similar motion patterns. To address this challenge, we introduce the Frequency-aware Mixed Transformer (FreqMixFormer), specifically designed for recognizing similar skeletal actions with subtle discriminative motions. First, we introduce a frequency-aware attention module to unweave skeleton frequency representations by embedding joint features into frequency attention maps, aiming to distinguish the discriminative movements based on their frequency coefficients. Subsequently, we develop a mixed transformer architecture to incorporate spatial features with frequency features to model the comprehensive frequency-spatial patterns. Additionally, a temporal transformer is proposed to extract the global correlations across frames. Extensive experiments show that FreqMiXFormer outperforms SOTA on 3 popular skeleton action recognition datasets, including NTU RGB+D, NTU RGB+D 120, and NW-UCLA datasets.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Wrist Fracture Detection with YOLO</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12597v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diagnosing and treating abnormalities in the wrist, specifically distal radius, and ulna fractures, is a crucial concern among children, adolescents, and young adults, with a higher incidence rate during puberty. However, the scarcity of radiologists and the lack of specialized training among medical professionals pose a significant risk to patient care. This problem is further exacerbated by the rising number of imaging studies and limited access to specialist reporting in certain regions. This highlights the need for innovative solutions to improve the diagnosis and treatment of wrist abnormalities. Automated wrist fracture detection using object detection has shown potential, but current studies mainly use two-stage detection methods with limited evidence for single-stage effectiveness. This study employs state-of-the-art single-stage deep neural network-based detection models YOLOv5, YOLOv6, YOLOv7, and YOLOv8 to detect wrist abnormalities. Through extensive experimentation, we found that these YOLO models outperform the commonly used two-stage detection algorithm, Faster R-CNN, in fracture detection. Additionally, compound-scaled variants of each YOLO model were compared, with YOLOv8m demonstrating a highest fracture detection sensitivity of 0.92 and mean average precision (mAP) of 0.95. On the other hand, YOLOv6m achieved the highest sensitivity across all classes at 0.83. Meanwhile, YOLOv8x recorded the highest mAP of 0.77 for all classes on the GRAZPEDWRI-DX pediatric wrist dataset, highlighting the potential of single-stage models for enhancing pediatric wrist imaging.</description>

Abstract: Computer vision systems have been deployed in various applications involving biometrics like human faces. These systems can identify social media users, search for missing persons, and verify identity of individuals. While computer vision models are often evaluated for accuracy on available benchmarks, more annotated data is necessary to learn about their robustness and fairness against semantic distributional shifts in input data, especially in face data. Among annotated data, counterfactual examples grant strong explainability characteristics. Because collecting natural face data is prohibitively expensive, we put forth a generative AI-based framework to construct targeted, counterfactual, high-quality synthetic face data. Our synthetic data pipeline has many use cases, including face recognition systems sensitivity evaluations and image understanding system probes. The pipeline is validated with multiple user studies. We showcase the efficacy of our face generation pipeline on a leading commercial vision model. We identify facial attributes that cause vision systems to fail.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14352v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Power lines are dangerous for low-flying aircraft, especially in low-visibility conditions. Thus, a vision-based system able to analyze the aircraft's surroundings and to provide the pilots with a "second pair of eyes" can contribute to enhancing their safety. To this end, we have developed a deep learning approach to jointly detect power line cables and pylons from images captured at distances of several hundred meters by aircraft-mounted cameras. In doing so, we have combined a modern convolutional architecture with transfer learning and a loss function adapted to curvilinear structure delineation. We use a single network for both detection tasks and demonstrated its performance on two benchmarking datasets. We have integrated it within an onboard system and run it in flight, and have demonstrated with our experiments that it outperforms the prior distant cable detection method on both datasets, while also successfully detecting pylons, given their annotations are available for the data.</description>

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence has transformed the generation of synthetic data, providing innovative solutions to challenges like data scarcity and privacy, which are particularly critical in fields such as medicine. However, the effective use of this synthetic data to train high-performance models remains a significant challenge. This paper addresses this issue by introducing Knowledge Recycling (KR), a pipeline designed to optimise the generation and use of synthetic data for training downstream classifiers. At the heart of this pipeline is Generative Knowledge Distillation (GKD), the proposed technique that significantly improves the quality and usefulness of the information provided to classifiers through a synthetic dataset regeneration and soft labelling mechanism. The KR pipeline has been tested on a variety of datasets, with a focus on six highly heterogeneous medical image datasets, ranging from retinal images to organ scans. The results show a significant reduction in the performance gap between models trained on real and synthetic data, with models based on synthetic data outperforming those trained on real data in some cases. Furthermore, the resulting models show almost complete immunity to Membership Inference Attacks, manifesting privacy properties missing in models trained with conventional techniques.</description>

      <title>Multi-Modality Co-Learning for Efficient Skeleton-based Action Recognition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15706v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Skeleton-based action recognition has garnered significant attention due to the utilization of concise and resilient skeletons. Nevertheless, the absence of detailed body information in skeletons restricts performance, while other multimodal methods require substantial inference resources and are inefficient when using multimodal data during both training and inference stages. To address this and fully harness the complementary multimodal features, we propose a novel multi-modality co-learning (MMCL) framework by leveraging the multimodal large language models (LLMs) as auxiliary networks for efficient skeleton-based action recognition, which engages in multi-modality co-learning during the training stage and keeps efficiency by employing only concise skeletons in inference. Our MMCL framework primarily consists of two modules. First, the Feature Alignment Module (FAM) extracts rich RGB features from video frames and aligns them with global skeleton features via contrastive learning. Second, the Feature Refinement Module (FRM) uses RGB images with temporal information and text instruction to generate instructive features based on the powerful generalization of multimodal LLMs. These instructive text features will further refine the classification scores and the refined scores will enhance the model's robustness and generalization in a manner similar to soft labels. Extensive experiments on NTU RGB+D, NTU RGB+D 120 and Northwestern-UCLA benchmarks consistently verify the effectiveness of our MMCL, which outperforms the existing skeleton-based action recognition methods. Meanwhile, experiments on UTD-MHAD and SYSU-Action datasets demonstrate the commendable generalization of our MMCL in zero-shot and domain-adaptive action recognition. Our code is publicly available at: https://github.com/liujf69/MMCL-Action.</description>

      <title>DreamCar: Leveraging Car-specific Prior for in-the-wild 3D Car Reconstruction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16988v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Self-driving industries usually employ professional artists to build exquisite 3D cars. However, it is expensive to craft large-scale digital assets. Since there are already numerous datasets available that contain a vast number of images of cars, we focus on reconstructing high-quality 3D car models from these datasets. However, these datasets only contain one side of cars in the forward-moving scene. We try to use the existing generative models to provide more supervision information, but they struggle to generalize well in cars since they are trained on synthetic datasets not car-specific. In addition, The reconstructed 3D car texture misaligns due to a large error in camera pose estimation when dealing with in-the-wild images. These restrictions make it challenging for previous methods to reconstruct complete 3D cars. To address these problems, we propose a novel method, named DreamCar, which can reconstruct high-quality 3D cars given a few images even a single image. To generalize the generative model, we collect a car dataset, named Car360, with over 5,600 vehicles. With this dataset, we make the generative model more robust to cars. We use this generative prior specific to the car to guide its reconstruction via Score Distillation Sampling. To further complement the supervision information, we utilize the geometric and appearance symmetry of cars. Finally, we propose a pose optimization method that rectifies poses to tackle texture misalignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing methods in reconstructing high-quality 3D cars. \href{https://xiaobiaodu.github.io/dreamcar-project/}{Our code is available.}</description>

      <title>CRASAR-U-DROIDs: A Large Scale Benchmark Dataset for Building Alignment and Damage Assessment in Georectified sUAS Imagery</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17673v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This document presents the Center for Robot Assisted Search And Rescue - Uncrewed Aerial Systems - Disaster Response Overhead Inspection Dataset (CRASAR-U-DROIDs) for building damage assessment and spatial alignment collected from small uncrewed aerial systems (sUAS) geospatial imagery. This dataset is motivated by the increasing use of sUAS in disaster response and the lack of previous work in utilizing high-resolution geospatial sUAS imagery for machine learning and computer vision models, the lack of alignment with operational use cases, and with hopes of enabling further investigations between sUAS and satellite imagery. The CRASAR-U-DRIODs dataset consists of fifty-two (52) orthomosaics from ten (10) federally declared disasters (Hurricane Ian, Hurricane Ida, Hurricane Harvey, Hurricane Idalia, Hurricane Laura, Hurricane Michael, Musset Bayou Fire, Mayfield Tornado, Kilauea Eruption, and Champlain Towers Collapse) spanning 67.98 square kilometers (26.245 square miles), containing 21,716 building polygons and damage labels, and 7,880 adjustment annotations. The imagery was tiled and presented in conjunction with overlaid building polygons to a pool of 130 annotators who provided human judgments of damage according to the Joint Damage Scale. These annotations were then reviewed via a two-stage review process in which building polygon damage labels were first reviewed individually and then again by committee. Additionally, the building polygons have been aligned spatially to precisely overlap with the imagery to enable more performant machine learning models to be trained. It appears that CRASAR-U-DRIODs is the largest labeled dataset of sUAS orthomosaic imagery.</description>

      <title>Bridging the Gap: Studio-like Avatar Creation from a Monocular Phone Capture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19593v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Creating photorealistic avatars for individuals traditionally involves extensive capture sessions with complex and expensive studio devices like the LightStage system. While recent strides in neural representations have enabled the generation of photorealistic and animatable 3D avatars from quick phone scans, they have the capture-time lighting baked-in, lack facial details and have missing regions in areas such as the back of the ears. Thus, they lag in quality compared to studio-captured avatars. In this paper, we propose a method that bridges this gap by generating studio-like illuminated texture maps from short, monocular phone captures. We do this by parameterizing the phone texture maps using the $W^+$ space of a StyleGAN2, enabling near-perfect reconstruction. Then, we finetune a StyleGAN2 by sampling in the $W^+$ parameterized space using a very small set of studio-captured textures as an adversarial training signal. To further enhance the realism and accuracy of facial details, we super-resolve the output of the StyleGAN2 using carefully designed diffusion model that is guided by image gradients of the phone-captured texture map. Once trained, our method excels at producing studio-like facial texture maps from casual monocular smartphone videos. Demonstrating its capabilities, we showcase the generation of photorealistic, uniformly lit, complete avatars from monocular phone captures.

      <title>Advancing Prompt Learning through an External Layer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19674v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Prompt learning represents a promising method for adapting pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) to various downstream tasks by learning a set of text embeddings. One challenge inherent to these methods is the poor generalization performance due to the invalidity of the learned text embeddings for unseen tasks. A straightforward approach to bridge this gap is to freeze the text embeddings in prompts, which results in a lack of capacity to adapt VLMs for downstream tasks. To address this dilemma, we propose a paradigm called EnPrompt with a novel External Layer (EnLa). Specifically, we propose a textual external layer and learnable visual embeddings for adapting VLMs to downstream tasks. The learnable external layer is built upon valid embeddings of pre-trained CLIP. This design considers the balance of learning capabilities between the two branches. To align the textual and visual features, we propose a novel two-pronged approach: i) we introduce the optimal transport as the discrepancy metric to align the vision and text modalities, and ii) we introduce a novel strengthening feature to enhance the interaction between these two modalities. Four representative experiments (i.e., base-to-novel generalization, few-shot learning, cross-dataset generalization, domain shifts generalization) across 15 datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms the existing prompt learning method.</description>

      <title>Efficient Face Super-Resolution via Wavelet-based Feature Enhancement Network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19768v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Face super-resolution aims to reconstruct a high-resolution face image from a low-resolution face image. Previous methods typically employ an encoder-decoder structure to extract facial structural features, where the direct downsampling inevitably introduces distortions, especially to high-frequency features such as edges. To address this issue, we propose a wavelet-based feature enhancement network, which mitigates feature distortion by losslessly decomposing the input feature into high and low-frequency components using the wavelet transform and processing them separately. To improve the efficiency of facial feature extraction, a full domain Transformer is further proposed to enhance local, regional, and global facial features. Such designs allow our method to perform better without stacking many modules as previous methods did. Experiments show that our method effectively balances performance, model size, and speed.

      <description>arXiv:2407.19985v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The visual medium (images and videos) naturally contains a large amount of information redundancy, thereby providing a great opportunity for leveraging efficiency in processing. While Vision Transformer (ViT) based models scale effectively to large data regimes, they fail to capitalize on this inherent redundancy, leading to higher computational costs. Mixture of Experts (MoE) networks demonstrate scalability while maintaining same inference-time costs, but they come with a larger parameter footprint. We present Mixture of Nested Experts (MoNE), which utilizes a nested structure for experts, wherein individual experts fall on an increasing compute-accuracy curve. Given a compute budget, MoNE learns to dynamically choose tokens in a priority order, and thus redundant tokens are processed through cheaper nested experts. Using this framework, we achieve equivalent performance as the baseline models, while reducing inference time compute by over two-fold. We validate our approach on standard image and video datasets - ImageNet-21K, Kinetics400, and Something-Something-v2. We further highlight MoNE$'$s adaptability by showcasing its ability to maintain strong performance across different inference-time compute budgets on videos, using only a single trained model.</description>

We elaborate on the specific challenges encountered during system design, and how we tackled them; namely a small, very imbalanced dataset with a high number of classes and high visual similarity between classes. We then show how we employed triplet networks and the multiple input modalities of images, measurements, and genetic information to overcome these challenges and reach a performance comparable to that of a trained domain expert.</description>

      <title>Structure Unbiased Adversarial Model for Medical Image Segmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2205.12857v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative models have been widely proposed in image recognition to generate more images where the distribution is similar to that of the real ones. It often introduces a discriminator network to differentiate the real data from the generated ones. Such models utilise a discriminator network tasked with differentiating style transferred data from data contained in the target dataset. However in doing so the network focuses on discrepancies in the intensity distribution and may overlook structural differences between the datasets. In this paper we formulate a new image-to-image translation problem to ensure that the structure of the generated images is similar to that in the target dataset. We propose a simple, yet powerful Structure-Unbiased Adversarial (SUA) network which accounts for both intensity and structural differences between the training and test sets when performing image segmentation. It consists of a spatial transformation block followed by an intensity distribution rendering module. The spatial transformation block is proposed to reduce the structure gap between the two images, and also produce an inverse deformation field to warp the final segmented image back. The intensity distribution rendering module then renders the deformed structure to an image with the target intensity distribution. Experimental results show that the proposed SUA method has the capability to transfer both intensity distribution and structural content between multiple datasets.</description>

The existing screen datasets are focused either on structure and component-level understanding, or on a much higher-level composite task such as navigation and task completion. We attempt to bridge the gap between these two by annotating 86K question-answer pairs over the RICO dataset in hope to benchmark the screen reading comprehension capacity. This work is also the first to annotate answers for different application scenarios, including both full sentences and short forms, as well as supporting UI contents on screen and their bounding boxes. With the rich annotation, we discuss and define the evaluation metrics of the benchmark, show applications of the dataset, and provide a few baselines using closed and open source models.</description>

      <title>RDA-INR: Riemannian Diffeomorphic Autoencoding via Implicit Neural Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.12854v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffeomorphic registration frameworks such as Large Deformation Diffeomorphic Metric Mapping (LDDMM) are used in computer graphics and the medical domain for atlas building, statistical latent modeling, and pairwise and groupwise registration. In recent years, researchers have developed neural network-based approaches regarding diffeomorphic registration to improve the accuracy and computational efficiency of traditional methods. In this work, we focus on a limitation of neural network-based atlas building and statistical latent modeling methods, namely that they either are (i) resolution dependent or (ii) disregard any data- or problem-specific geometry needed for proper mean-variance analysis. In particular, we overcome this limitation by designing a novel encoder based on resolution-independent implicit neural representations. The encoder achieves resolution invariance for LDDMM-based statistical latent modeling. Additionally, the encoder adds LDDMM Riemannian geometry to resolution-independent deep learning models for statistical latent modeling. We investigate how the Riemannian geometry improves latent modeling and is required for a proper mean-variance analysis. To highlight the benefit of resolution independence for LDDMM-based data variability modeling, we show that our approach outperforms current neural network-based LDDMM latent code models. Our work paves the way for more research into how Riemannian geometry, shape respectively image analysis, and deep learning can be combined.</description>

      <title>Exploit the Leak: Understanding Risks in Biometric Matchers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.13717v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a biometric authentication or identification system, the matcher compares a stored and a fresh template to determine whether there is a match. This assessment is based on both a similarity score and a predefined threshold. For better compliance with privacy legislation, the matcher can be built upon a privacy-preserving distance. Beyond the binary output (`yes' or `no'), most schemes may perform more precise computations, e.g., the value of the distance. Such precise information is prone to leakage even when not returned by the system. This can occur due to a malware infection or the use of a weakly privacy-preserving distance, exemplified by side channel attacks or partially obfuscated designs. This paper provides an analysis of information leakage during distance evaluation. We provide a catalog of information leakage scenarios with their impacts on data privacy. Each scenario gives rise to unique attacks with impacts quantified in terms of computational costs, thereby providing a better understanding of the security level.</description>

      <title>vSHARP: variable Splitting Half-quadratic Admm algorithm for Reconstruction of inverse-Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.09954v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Medical Imaging (MI) tasks, such as accelerated parallel Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), often involve reconstructing an image from noisy or incomplete measurements. This amounts to solving ill-posed inverse problems, where a satisfactory closed-form analytical solution is not available. Traditional methods such as Compressed Sensing (CS) in MRI reconstruction can be time-consuming or prone to obtaining low-fidelity images. Recently, a plethora of Deep Learning (DL) approaches have demonstrated superior performance in inverse-problem solving, surpassing conventional methods. In this study, we propose vSHARP (variable Splitting Half-quadratic ADMM algorithm for Reconstruction of inverse Problems), a novel DL-based method for solving ill-posed inverse problems arising in MI. vSHARP utilizes the Half-Quadratic Variable Splitting method and employs the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) to unroll the optimization process. For data consistency, vSHARP unrolls a differentiable gradient descent process in the image domain, while a DL-based denoiser, such as a U-Net architecture, is applied to enhance image quality. vSHARP also employs a dilated-convolution DL-based model to predict the Lagrange multipliers for the ADMM initialization. We evaluate vSHARP on tasks of accelerated parallel MRI Reconstruction using two distinct datasets and on accelerated parallel dynamic MRI Reconstruction using another dataset. Our comparative analysis with state-of-the-art methods demonstrates the superior performance of vSHARP in these applications.</description>

Abstract: Accurately forecasting the motion of traffic actors is crucial for the deployment of autonomous vehicles at a large scale. Current trajectory forecasting approaches primarily concentrate on optimizing a loss function with a specific metric, which can result in predictions that do not adhere to physical laws or violate external constraints. Our objective is to incorporate explicit knowledge priors that allow a network to forecast future trajectories in compliance with both the kinematic constraints of a vehicle and the geometry of the driving environment. To achieve this, we introduce a non-parametric pruning layer and attention layers to integrate the defined knowledge priors. Our proposed method is designed to ensure reachability guarantees for traffic actors in both complex and dynamic situations. By conditioning the network to follow physical laws, we can obtain accurate and safe predictions, essential for maintaining autonomous vehicles' safety and efficiency in real-world settings.In summary, this paper presents concepts that prevent off-road predictions for safe and reliable motion forecasting by incorporating knowledge priors into the training process.</description>

      <title>JSSL: Joint Supervised and Self-supervised Learning for MRI Reconstruction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.15856v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Purpose: MRI represents an important diagnostic modality; however, its inherently slow acquisition process poses challenges in obtaining fully-sampled k-space data under motion. In the absence of fully-sampled acquisitions, serving as ground truths, training deep learning algorithms in a supervised manner to predict the underlying ground truth image becomes challenging. To address this limitation, self-supervised methods have emerged as a viable alternative, leveraging available subsampled k-space data to train deep neural networks for MRI reconstruction. Nevertheless, these approaches often fall short when compared to supervised methods.
  Methods: We propose Joint Supervised and Self-supervised Learning (JSSL), a novel training approach for deep learning-based MRI reconstruction algorithms aimed at enhancing reconstruction quality in cases where target datasets containing fully-sampled k-space measurements are unavailable. JSSL operates by simultaneously training a model in a self-supervised learning setting, using subsampled data from the target dataset(s), and in a supervised learning manner, utilizing datasets with fully-sampled k-space data, referred to as proxy datasets. We demonstrate JSSL's efficacy using subsampled prostate or cardiac MRI data as the target datasets, with fully-sampled brain and knee, or brain, knee and prostate k-space acquisitions, respectively, as proxy datasets.
  Results: Our results showcase substantial improvements over conventional self-supervised methods, validated using common image quality metrics. Furthermore, we provide theoretical motivations for JSSL and establish rule-of-thumb guidelines for training MRI reconstruction models.
  Conclusion: JSSL effectively enhances MRI reconstruction quality in scenarios where fully-sampled k-space data is not available, leveraging the strengths of supervised learning by incorporating proxy datasets.</description>

      <title>Dream2Real: Zero-Shot 3D Object Rearrangement with Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04533v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce Dream2Real, a robotics framework which integrates vision-language models (VLMs) trained on 2D data into a 3D object rearrangement pipeline. This is achieved by the robot autonomously constructing a 3D representation of the scene, where objects can be rearranged virtually and an image of the resulting arrangement rendered. These renders are evaluated by a VLM, so that the arrangement which best satisfies the user instruction is selected and recreated in the real world with pick-and-place. This enables language-conditioned rearrangement to be performed zero-shot, without needing to collect a training dataset of example arrangements. Results on a series of real-world tasks show that this framework is robust to distractors, controllable by language, capable of understanding complex multi-object relations, and readily applicable to both tabletop and 6-DoF rearrangement tasks.</description>

      <title>Infinite dSprites for Disentangled Continual Learning: Separating Memory Edits from Generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16731v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ability of machine learning systems to learn continually is hindered by catastrophic forgetting, the tendency of neural networks to overwrite previously acquired knowledge when learning a new task. Existing methods mitigate this problem through regularization, parameter isolation, or rehearsal, but they are typically evaluated on benchmarks comprising only a handful of tasks. In contrast, humans are able to learn over long time horizons in dynamic, open-world environments, effortlessly memorizing unfamiliar objects and reliably recognizing them under various transformations. To make progress towards closing this gap, we introduce Infinite dSprites, a parsimonious tool for creating continual classification and disentanglement benchmarks of arbitrary length and with full control over generative factors. We show that over a sufficiently long time horizon, the performance of all major types of continual learning methods deteriorates on this simple benchmark. This result highlights an important and previously overlooked aspect of continual learning: given a finite modelling capacity and an arbitrarily long learning horizon, efficient learning requires memorizing class-specific information and accumulating knowledge about general mechanisms. In a simple setting with direct supervision on the generative factors, we show how learning class-agnostic transformations offers a way to circumvent catastrophic forgetting and improve classification accuracy over time. Our approach sets the stage for continual learning over hundreds of tasks with explicit control over memorization and forgetting, emphasizing open-set classification and one-shot generalization.</description>

      <title>Can we Constrain Concept Bottleneck Models to Learn Semantically Meaningful Input Features?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00912v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) are regarded as inherently interpretable because they first predict a set of human-defined concepts which are used to predict a task label. For inherent interpretability to be fully realised, and ensure trust in a model's output, it's desirable for concept predictions to use semantically meaningful input features. For instance, in an image, pixels representing a broken bone should contribute to predicting a fracture. However, current literature suggests that concept predictions often rely on irrelevant input features. We hypothesise that this occurs when dataset labels include inaccurate concept annotations, or the relationship between input features and concepts is unclear. In general, the effect of dataset labelling on concept representations remains an understudied area. In this paper, we demonstrate that CBMs can learn to map concepts to semantically meaningful input features, by utilising datasets with a clear link between the input features and the desired concept predictions. This is achieved, for instance, by ensuring multiple concepts do not always co-occur and, therefore provide a clear training signal for the CBM to distinguish the relevant input features for each concept. We validate our hypothesis on both synthetic and real-world image datasets, and demonstrate under the correct conditions, CBMs can learn to attribute semantically meaningful input features to the correct concept predictions.</description>

      <title>SimPro: A Simple Probabilistic Framework Towards Realistic Long-Tailed Semi-Supervised Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13505v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in semi-supervised learning have focused on a more realistic yet challenging task: addressing imbalances in labeled data while the class distribution of unlabeled data remains both unknown and potentially mismatched. Current approaches in this sphere often presuppose rigid assumptions regarding the class distribution of unlabeled data, thereby limiting the adaptability of models to only certain distribution ranges. In this study, we propose a novel approach, introducing a highly adaptable framework, designated as SimPro, which does not rely on any predefined assumptions about the distribution of unlabeled data. Our framework, grounded in a probabilistic model, innovatively refines the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm by explicitly decoupling the modeling of conditional and marginal class distributions. This separation facilitates a closed-form solution for class distribution estimation during the maximization phase, leading to the formulation of a Bayes classifier. The Bayes classifier, in turn, enhances the quality of pseudo-labels in the expectation phase. Remarkably, the SimPro framework not only comes with theoretical guarantees but also is straightforward to implement. Moreover, we introduce two novel class distributions broadening the scope of the evaluation. Our method showcases consistent state-of-the-art performance across diverse benchmarks and data distribution scenarios. Our code is available at https://github.com/LeapLabTHU/SimPro.</description>

      <title>VANP: Learning Where to See for Navigation with Self-Supervised Vision-Action Pre-Training</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08109v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Humans excel at efficiently navigating through crowds without collision by focusing on specific visual regions relevant to navigation. However, most robotic visual navigation methods rely on deep learning models pre-trained on vision tasks, which prioritize salient objects -- not necessarily relevant to navigation and potentially misleading. Alternative approaches train specialized navigation models from scratch, requiring significant computation. On the other hand, self-supervised learning has revolutionized computer vision and natural language processing, but its application to robotic navigation remains underexplored due to the difficulty of defining effective self-supervision signals. Motivated by these observations, in this work, we propose a Self-Supervised Vision-Action Model for Visual Navigation Pre-Training (VANP). Instead of detecting salient objects that are beneficial for tasks such as classification or detection, VANP learns to focus only on specific visual regions that are relevant to the navigation task. To achieve this, VANP uses a history of visual observations, future actions, and a goal image for self-supervision, and embeds them using two small Transformer Encoders. Then, VANP maximizes the information between the embeddings by using a mutual information maximization objective function. We demonstrate that most VANP-extracted features match with human navigation intuition. VANP achieves comparable performance as models learned end-to-end with half the training time and models trained on a large-scale, fully supervised dataset, i.e., ImageNet, with only 0.08% data.</description>

      <title>A Symmetric Regressor for MRI-Based Assessment of Striatal Dopamine Transporter Uptake in Parkinson's Disease</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11929v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dopamine transporter (DAT) imaging is commonly used for monitoring Parkinson's disease (PD), where striatal DAT uptake amount is computed to assess PD severity. However, DAT imaging has a high cost and the risk of radiance exposure and is not available in general clinics. Recently, MRI patch of the nigral region has been proposed as a safer and easier alternative. This paper proposes a symmetric regressor for predicting the DAT uptake amount from the nigral MRI patch. Acknowledging the symmetry between the right and left nigrae, the proposed regressor incorporates a paired input-output model that simultaneously predicts the DAT uptake amounts for both the right and left striata. Moreover, it employs a symmetric loss that imposes a constraint on the difference between right-to-left predictions, resembling the high correlation in DAT uptake amounts in the two lateral sides. Additionally, we propose a symmetric Monte-Carlo (MC) dropout method for providing a fruitful uncertainty estimate of the DAT uptake prediction, which utilizes the above symmetry. We evaluated the proposed approach on 734 nigral patches, which demonstrated significantly improved performance of the symmetric regressor compared with the standard regressors while giving better explainability and feature representation. The symmetric MC dropout also gave precise uncertainty ranges with a high probability of including the true DAT uptake amounts within the range.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10787v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose Evidential Conformal Prediction (ECP) method for image classifiers to generate the conformal prediction sets. Our method is designed based on a non-conformity score function that has its roots in Evidential Deep Learning (EDL) as a method of quantifying model (epistemic) uncertainty in DNN classifiers. We use evidence that are derived from the logit values of target labels to compute the components of our non-conformity score function: the heuristic notion of uncertainty in CP, uncertainty surprisal, and expected utility. Our extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates that ECP outperforms three state-of-the-art methods for generating CP sets, in terms of their set sizes and adaptivity while maintaining the coverage of true labels.</description>

      <title>MagMax: Leveraging Model Merging for Seamless Continual Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06322v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a continual learning approach named MagMax, which utilizes model merging to enable large pre-trained models to continuously learn from new data without forgetting previously acquired knowledge. Distinct from traditional continual learning methods that aim to reduce forgetting during task training, MagMax combines sequential fine-tuning with a maximum magnitude weight selection for effective knowledge integration across tasks. Our initial contribution is an extensive examination of model merging techniques, revealing that simple approaches like weight averaging and random weight selection surprisingly hold up well in various continual learning contexts. More importantly, we present MagMax, a novel model-merging strategy that enables continual learning of large pre-trained models for successive tasks. Our thorough evaluation demonstrates the superiority of MagMax in various scenarios, including class- and domain-incremental learning settings. The code is available at this URL: https://github.com/danielm1405/magmax.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16684v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Radiologists are tasked with interpreting a large number of images in a daily base, with the responsibility of generating corresponding reports. This demanding workload elevates the risk of human error, potentially leading to treatment delays, increased healthcare costs, revenue loss, and operational inefficiencies. To address these challenges, we initiate a series of work on grounded Automatic Report Generation (AutoRG), starting from the brain MRI interpretation system, which supports the delineation of brain structures, the localization of anomalies, and the generation of well-organized findings. We make contributions from the following aspects, first, on dataset construction, we release a comprehensive dataset encompassing segmentation masks of anomaly regions and manually authored reports, termed as RadGenome-Brain MRI. This data resource is intended to catalyze ongoing research and development in the field of AI-assisted report generation systems. Second, on system design, we propose AutoRG-Brain, the first brain MRI report generation system with pixel-level grounded visual clues. Third, for evaluation, we conduct quantitative assessments and human evaluations of brain structure segmentation, anomaly localization, and report generation tasks to provide evidence of its reliability and accuracy. This system has been integrated into real clinical scenarios, where radiologists were instructed to write reports based on our generated findings and anomaly segmentation masks. The results demonstrate that our system enhances the report-writing skills of junior doctors, aligning their performance more closely with senior doctors, thereby boosting overall productivity.</description>

Abstract: Data-free quantization (DFQ) is a technique that creates a lightweight network from its full-precision counterpart without the original training data, often through a synthetic dataset. Although several DFQ methods have been proposed for vision transformer (ViT) architectures, they fail to achieve efficacy in low-bit settings. Examining the existing methods, we identify that their synthetic data produce misaligned attention maps, while those of the real samples are highly aligned. From the observation of aligned attention, we find that aligning attention maps of synthetic data helps to improve the overall performance of quantized ViTs. Motivated by this finding, we devise \aname, a novel DFQ method designed for ViTs that focuses on inter-head attention similarity. First, we generate synthetic data by aligning head-wise attention responses in relation to spatial query patches. Then, we apply head-wise structural attention distillation to align the attention maps of the quantized network to those of the full-precision teacher. The experimental results show that the proposed method significantly outperforms baselines, setting a new state-of-the-art performance for data-free ViT quantization.</description>

      <title>SpaER: Learning Spatio-temporal Equivariant Representations for Fetal Brain Motion Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20198</link>

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce SpaER, a pioneering method for fetal motion tracking that leverages equivariant filters and self-attention mechanisms to effectively learn spatio-temporal representations. Different from conventional approaches that statically estimate fetal brain motions from pairs of images, our method dynamically tracks the rigid movement patterns of the fetal head across temporal and spatial dimensions. Specifically, we first develop an equivariant neural network that efficiently learns rigid motion sequences through low-dimensional spatial representations of images. Subsequently, we learn spatio-temporal representations by incorporating time encoding and self-attention neural network layers. This approach allows for the capture of long-term dependencies of fetal brain motion and addresses alignment errors due to contrast changes and severe motion artifacts. Our model also provides a geometric deformation estimation that properly addresses image distortions among all time frames. To the best of our knowledge, our approach is the first to learn spatial-temporal representations via deep neural networks for fetal motion tracking without data augmentation. We validated our model using real fetal echo-planar images with simulated and real motions. Our method carries significant potential value in accurately measuring, tracking, and correcting fetal motion in fetal MRI sequences.</description>
