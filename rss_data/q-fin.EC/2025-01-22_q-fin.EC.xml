      <title>Building Short Value Chains for Animal Welfare-Friendly Products Adoption: Insights from a Restaurant-Based Study in Japan</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As global attention on sustainable and ethical food systems grows, animal welfare-friendly products (AWFP) are increasingly recognized as essential to addressing consumer and producer concerns. However, traditional research often neglects the interdependencies between production, retail, and consumption stages within the supply chain. This study examined how cross-stage interactions among producers, consumers, and retail intermediaries can promote AWFP adoption. By establishing a short value chain from production to consumption, we conducted a two-month choice experiment in the operational restaurant, employing a mixed-method approach to quantitatively and qualitatively assess stakeholder responses. The results revealed that providing information about AWFP practices significantly influenced consumer behavior, increasing both product selection and perceived value. Retailers recognized the potential for economic benefits and strengthened customer loyalty, while producers identified new revenue opportunities by re-fattening delivered cow. These coordinated changes - defined as synchronized actions and mutual reinforcement across production, retail, and consumption - generated positive feedback loops that motivated stakeholders to adopt AWFP practices. This research underscores the potential of strategically designed short value chain to foster cross-stage coordination and highlights their role as practical entry points for promoting sustainable and ethical food systems on a larger scale.</description>

      <title>The Missing Link: Identifying Digital Intermediaries in E-Government</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The digitalization of public administration has advanced significantly on a global scale. Many governments now view digital platforms as essential for improving the delivery of public services and fostering direct communication between citizens and public institutions. However, this view overlooks the role played by digital intermediaries significantly shape the provision of e-government services. Using Chile as a case study, we analyze these intermediaries through a national survey on digitalization, we find five types of intermediaries: family members, peers, political figures, bureaucrats, and community leaders. The first two classes comprise close intermediaries, while the latter three comprise hierarchical intermediaries. Our findings suggest that all these intermediaries are a critical but underexplored element in the digitalization of public administration.</description>

      <title>Sovereign Debt Default and Climate Risk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the interplay between sovereign debt default/renegotiation and environmental factors (e.g., pollution from land use, natural resource exploitation). Pollution contributes to the likelihood of natural disasters and influences economic growth rates. The country can default on its debt at any time while also deciding whether to invest in pollution abatement. The framework provides insights into the credit spreads of sovereign bonds and explains the observed relationship between bond spread and a country's climate vulnerability. Through calibration for developing and low-income countries, we demonstrate that there is limited incentive for these countries to address climate risk, and the sensitivity of bond spreads to climate vulnerability remains modest. Climate risk does not play a relevant role on the decision to default on sovereign debt. Financial support for climate abatement expenditures can effectively foster climate adaptation actions, instead renegotiation conditional upon pollution abatement does not produce any effect.</description>

      <title>Open Sourcing GPTs: Economics of Open Sourcing Advanced AI Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the economic underpinnings of open sourcing advanced large language models (LLMs) by for-profit companies. Empirical analysis reveals that: (1) LLMs are compatible with R&amp;D portfolios of numerous technologically differentiated firms; (2) open-sourcing likelihood decreases with an LLM's performance edge over rivals, but increases for models from large tech companies; and (3) open-sourcing an advanced LLM led to an increase in research-related activities. Motivated by these findings, a theoretical framework is developed to examine factors influencing a profit-maximizing firm's open-sourcing decision. The analysis frames this decision as a trade-off between accelerating technology growth and securing immediate financial returns. A key prediction from the theoretical analysis is an inverted-U-shaped relationship between the owner's size, measured by its share of LLM-compatible applications, and its propensity to open source the LLM. This finding suggests that moderate market concentration may be beneficial to the open source ecosystems of multi-purpose software technologies.</description>

      <title>An Empirical Approach toward the Interaction between Pension System and Demographic Dividend: Evidence of a Co-Integrated Socio-Economic Model of China</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present study attempts to investigate the demographic dividend phenomenon in China. For this goal, a socio-economic approach has been used to analyze the topic from 1995 to 2019. In contrast to common belief, the outcomes revealed that China is still benefiting from a demographic dividend. However, due to the accelerated population aging trend and the increasing share of government expenditure on the public pension system, the window opportunity has yet to close. Furthermore, concerning the absolute value of estimated coefficients, the employment rate of young people in the age bundle of [15, 24] has the highest impact on decreasing government expenditure.</description>

      <title>Dollarized Economies in Latin America. An Inflationary Analysis of Pre, During and Post Pandemic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given the hyperinflation that most of the Latin American countries suffered in the 90 and their decision towards adopting dollarization and in most cases keeping their own currency, this paper analyzes the effectiveness of dollarization as a protective mechanism against economic disruptions in Latin American countries. It assesses the context that led Latin American dollarized countries to dollarize and analyzes CPI, GDP, and the poverty rates pre, during, and postpandemic in Latin American countries, considering those that are dollarized and those that are not, and evaluating its relation to the US. Interviews were carried out with experts in the field. It assesses the advantages and disadvantages of dollarization regarding global crises. The data was compared and analyzed to check if there were patterns that support the paper objective which is that dollarization might serve as a protective mechanism against economic disruption. It was found that dollarization protects the economy against inflation, however, it does not fully protect the economy when considering economic performance and poverty. In conclusion, this research concludes that dollarization does not completely serve as a protective mechanism against economic disruptions nonetheless, it found that a bigger role is played by domestic policies and government action.</description>

      <title>Monetary Evolution: How Societies Shaped Money from Antiquity to Cryptocurrencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10443v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the growing popularity and rising value of cryptocurrencies, skepticism surrounding this groundbreaking innovation persists. Many financial and business experts argue that the value created in the cryptocurrency realm resembles the generation of currency from thin air. However, a historical analysis of the fundamental concepts that have shaped money reveals striking parallels with past transformations in human society. This study extends these historical insights to the present era, demonstrating how enduring monetary concepts are once again redefining our understanding of money and reshaping its form. Additionally, we offer novel interpretations of cryptocurrency by linking the intrinsic nature of money, the communities it fosters, and the cryptographic technologies that have provided the infrastructure for this transformative shift.</description>

      <title>Understanding the environmental impacts of virgin aggregates: critical literature review and primary comprehensive Life Cycle Assessments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the ever-growing massive consumption of aggregates, knowledge about their environmental footprint is limited. My literature review on virgin aggregate Life Cycle Assessments (LCA) highlighted many shortcomings, such as low-quality inputs and fragmented system boundaries, and estimated that gravel consumption is responsible for 0.17 to 1.8 percent of the global carbon footprint. I thus developed comprehensive LCAs, based on field data collected from quarries in Quebec producing annually 7 million tons of aggregates, representing different types of rocks, productions (mobile, fixed), and energies consumed, using ecoinvent 3.7 and TRACI characterization method. Results show that the often-forgotten blasting and machinery are major contributors to several impact categories, along with diesel consumption. The link between the nature of the rock and the environmental impacts of aggregates is demonstrated for the first time: the harder it is, the more exposive it requires, thus increasing the impacts. Moreover, the more abrasive the rock is, the faster it wears out machinery, generating higher maintenance that increases human and ecosystem toxicities. A pronounced sensitivity of the impacts to the electricity mix is also shown based on a scenario analysis carried on Europe, China, and different Canadian and American regions. Additionally, aggregate transportation to the consumer, modeled with tailored inventories, can more than double the impact of the aggregate at the gates of the quarry, with strong regional variability. In a near future, I call for considering consistent system boundaries in aggregate LCA, refining blasting, energy consumption, machinery manufacturing and maintenance, as well as customizing truck transportation models, for more reliable aggregate LCAs.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic Collusion in Auctions: Evidence from Controlled Laboratory Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.09437v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Algorithms are increasingly being used to automate participation in online markets. Banchio and Skrzypacz (2022) demonstrate how exploration under identical valuation in first-price auctions may lead to spontaneous coupling into sub-competitive bidding. However, it is an open question if these findings extend to affiliated values, optimal exploration, and specifically which algorithmic details play a role in facilitating algorithmic collusion. This paper contributes to the literature by generating robust stylized facts to cover these gaps. I conduct a set of fully randomized experiments in a controlled laboratory setup and apply double machine learning to estimate granular conditional treatment effects of auction design on seller revenues. I find that first-price auctions lead to lower seller revenues and higher seller regret under identical values, affiliated values, and under both Q-learning and Bandits. There is more possibility of such tacit collusion under fewer bidders, Boltzmann exploration, asynchronous updating, and longer episodes; while high reserve prices can offset this. This evidence suggests that programmatic auctions, e.g. the Google Ad Exchange, which depend on first-price auctions, might be susceptible to coordinated bid suppression and significant revenue losses.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Impact of Upstream Mergers with Downstream Complements and Substitutes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12575v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I examine the impact of upstream mergers on negotiated prices when suppliers bargain with a monopoly intermediary selling products to final consumers. Conventional wisdom holds that such transactions reduce negotiated prices when the products are complements for consumers and increase prices when they are substitutes. This is because downstream complementarities or substitutabilities transfer to upstream negotiations, where a merger of complements (substitutes) weakens (strengthens) the suppliers' bargaining leverage. I challenge this view, showing that this logic breaks down when the intermediary's portfolio includes products beyond those of the merging suppliers. In such cases, the merging suppliers' products may act as substitutes for the intermediary even if they are complements for consumers, or as complements for the intermediary even if they are substitutes for consumers. These findings reveal that upstream conglomerate mergers can increase prices without foreclosure or monopolization, and offer an explanation for buyer-specific price effects in upstream mergers.</description>

      <title>Dissertation Paths: Advisors and Students in the Economics Research Production Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01533v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Elite economics PhD programs aim to train graduate students for a lifetime of academic research. This paper asks how advising affects graduate students' post-PhD research productivity. Advising is highly concentrated: at the eight highly-selective schools in our study, a minority of advisors do most of the advising work. We quantify advisor attributes such as an advisor's own research output and aspects of the advising relationship like coauthoring and research field affinity that might contribute to student research success. Students advised by research-active, prolific advisors tend to publish more, while coauthoring has no effect. Student-advisor research affinity also predicts student success. But a school-level aggregate production function provides much weaker evidence of causal effects, suggesting that successful advisors attract students likely to succeed-without necessarily boosting their students' chances of success. Evidence for causal effects is strongest for a measure of advisors' own research output. Aggregate student research output appears to scale linearly with graduate student enrollment, with no evidence of negative class-size effects. An analysis of gender differences in research output shows male and female graduate students to be equally productive in the first few years post-PhD, but female productivity peaks sooner than male productivity.</description>

      <title>Achieving Semantic Consistency: Contextualized Word Representations for Political Text Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04505v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurately interpreting words is vital in political science text analysis; some tasks require assuming semantic stability, while others aim to trace semantic shifts. Traditional static embeddings, like Word2Vec effectively capture long-term semantic changes but often lack stability in short-term contexts due to embedding fluctuations caused by unbalanced training data. BERT, which features transformer-based architecture and contextual embeddings, offers greater semantic consistency, making it suitable for analyses in which stability is crucial. This study compares Word2Vec and BERT using 20 years of People's Daily articles to evaluate their performance in semantic representations across different timeframes. The results indicate that BERT outperforms Word2Vec in maintaining semantic stability and still recognizes subtle semantic variations. These findings support BERT's use in text analysis tasks that require stability, where semantic changes are not assumed, offering a more reliable foundation than static alternatives.</description>
