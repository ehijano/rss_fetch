      <title>Dynamics of threshold solutions for the energy-critical inhomogeneous NLS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we study the long-time dynamics of threshold solutions for the focusing energy-critical inhomogeneous Schr\"odinger equation and classify the corresponding threshold solutions in dimensions $d=3,4,5$. We first show the existence of special threshold solutions $W^\pm$ by constructing a sequence of approximate solutions in suitable Lorentz space, which exponentially approach the ground state $W$ in one of the time directions. We then prove that solutions with threshold energy either behave as in the subthreshold case or agree with $W, W^+$ or $W^-$ up to the symmetries of the equation. The proof relies on detailed spectral analysis of the linearized Schr\"odinger operator, the relevant modulation analysis, the global Virial analysis, and the concentration compactness argument in the Lorentz space.</description>

      <title>A dispersive effective equation for transverse propagation of planar shallow water waves over periodic bathymetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the behavior of shallow water waves propagating over bathymetry that varies periodically in one direction and is constant in the other. Plane waves traveling along the constant direction are known to evolve into solitary waves, due to an effective dispersion. We apply multiple-scale perturbation theory to derive an effective constant-coefficient system of Boussinesq-type equations that not only accurately describe these waves but also predict their full two-dimensional shape in some detail. Numerical experiments confirm the good agreement between the effective equations and the variable-bathymetry shallow water equations.</description>

      <title>Pointwise estimates for the fundamental solutions of higher order Schr\"{o}dinger equations in odd dimensions II: high dimensional case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, for any odd $n$ and any integer $m\geq1$ with $n&gt;4m$, we study the fundamental solution of the higher order Schr\"{o}dinger equation \begin{equation*} \mathrm{i}\partial_tu(x,t)=((-\Delta)^m+V(x))u(x,t),\quad t\in \mathbb{R},\,\,x\in \mathbb{R}^n, \end{equation*} where $V$ is a real-valued $C^{\frac{n+1}{2}-2m}$ potential with certain decay. Let $P_{ac}(H)$ denote the projection onto the absolutely continuous spectrum space of $H=(-\Delta)^m+V$, and assume that $H$ has no positive embedded eigenvalue. Our main result says that $e^{-\mathrm{i}tH}P_{ac}(H)$ has integral kernel $K(t,x,y)$ satisfying \begin{equation*} |K(t, x,y)|\le C(1+|t|)^{-(\frac{n}{2m}-\sigma)}(1+|t|^{-\frac{n}{2 m}})\left(1+|t|^{-\frac{1}{2 m}}|x-y|\right)^{-\frac{n(m-1)}{2 m-1}},\quad t\neq0,\,x,y\in\mathbb{R}^n, \end{equation*} where $\sigma=2$ if $0$ is an eigenvalue of $H$, and $\sigma=0$ otherwise. A similar result for smoothing operators $H^\frac{\alpha}{2m}e^{-\mathrm{i}tH}P_{ac}(H)$ is also given. The regularity condition $V\in C^{\frac{n+1}{2}-2m}$ is optimal in the second order case, and it also seems optimal when $m&gt;1$.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Solution for a New Class of Non-Archimedean Pseudo-Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study a new class of pseudo-differential equations on functions of two $p$-adic variables. It is proved that the correspondent Cauchy problem has a unique solution. Some properties of this solution are studied, in particular, the finite dependence property and an $L^1$-estimate.</description>

      <title>A strongly degenerate fully nonlinear mean field game with nonlocal diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There are few results on mean field game (MFG) systems where the PDEs are either fully nonlinear or have degenerate diffusions. This paper introduces a problem that combines both difficulties. We prove existence and uniqueness for a strongly degenerate, fully nonlinear MFG system by using the well-posedness theory for fully nonlinear MFGs established in our previous paper. It is the first such application in a degenerate setting. Our MFG involves a controlled pure jump (nonlocal) L\'evy diffusion of order less than one, and monotone, smoothing couplings. The key difficulty is obtaining uniqueness for the corresponding degenerate, non-smooth Fokker-Plank equation: since the regularity of the coefficient and the order of the diffusion are interdependent, it holds when the order is sufficiently low. Viscosity solutions and a non-standard doubling of variables argument are used along with a bootstrapping procedure.</description>

      <title>Boundary driven instabilities of Couette flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we prove that the threshold of instability of the classical Couette flow in $H^s$ for large $s$ is $\nu^{1/2}$. The instability is completely driven by the boundary. The dynamic of the flow creates a Prandtl type boundary layer of width $\nu^{1/2}$ which is itself linearly unstable. This leads to a secondary instability which in turn creates a sub-layer.</description>

      <title>The 3D kinetic Couette flow via the Boltzmann equation in the diffusive limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the paper we study the Boltzmann equation in the diffusive limit in a channel domain $\mathbb{T}^2\times (-1,1)$ for the 3D kinetic Couette flow. Our results demonstrate that the first-order approximation of the solutions is governed by the perturbed incompressible Navier-Stokes-Fourier system around the fluid Couette flow. Moverover, in the absence of external forces, the 3D kinetic Couette flow asymptotically converges over time to the 1D steady planar kinetic Couette flow. Our proof relies on (i) the Fourier transform on $\mathbb{T}^2$ to essentially reduce the 3D problem to a one-dimensional one, (ii) anisotropic Chemin-Lerner type function spaces, incorporating the Wiener algebra, to control nonlinear terms and address the singularity associated with a small Knudsen number in the diffusive limit, and (iii) Caflisch's decomposition, combined with the $L^2\cap L^\infty$ interplay technique, to manage the growth of large velocities.</description>

      <title>Singular semilinear elliptic equations in half-spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the monotonicity of positive solutions to the problem $-\Delta u = f(u)$ in $\mathbb{R}^N_+ := \{(x',x_N)\in\mathbb{R}^N \mid x_N&gt;0 \}$ under zero Dirichlet boundary condition with a possible singular nonlinearity $f$. In some situations, we can derive a precise estimate on the blow-up rate of $\frac{\partial u}{\partial\eta}$ as $x_N \to 0^+$, where $(\eta,e_N)&gt;0$, and obtain a classification result. The main tools we use are the method of moving planes and the sliding method.</description>

      <title>Bifurcation diagrams for semilinear elliptic equations with singular weights in two dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the bifurcation diagram of radial solutions for the Gelfand problem with a positive radially symmetric weight in the unit ball. We deal with the exponential nonlinearity and a power-type nonlinearity. When the weight is constant, it is well-known that the bifurcation curve exhibits three different types depending on the dimension and the exponent of power for higher dimensions, while the curve exhibits only one type in two dimensions.
  In this paper, we succeed in realizing in two dimensions a phenomenon such that the bifurcation curve exhibits all of the three types, by choosing the weight appropriately. In particular, to the best of the author's knowledge, it is the first result to establish in two dimensions the bifurcation curve having no turning points.</description>

      <title>Free boundary value problem for the radial symmetric compressible isentropic Navier-Stokes equations with density-dependent viscosity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the study of free-boundary-value problem of the compressible Naiver-Stokes system with density-dependent viscosities $\mu=const&gt;0,\lambda=\rho^\beta$ which was first introduced by Vaigant-Kazhikhov \cite{1995 Vaigant-Kazhikhov-SMJ} in 1995. By assuming the endpoint case $\beta=1$ in the radially spherical symmetric setting, we prove the (a priori) expanding rate of the free boundary is algebraic for multi-dimensional flow, and particularly establish the global existence of strong solution of the two-dimensional system for any large initial data. This also improves the previous work of Li-Zhang \cite{2016 Li-Zhang-JDE} where they proved the similar result for $\beta&gt;1$. The main ingredients of this article is making full use of the geometric advantange of domain as well as the critical space dimension two.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear two-dimensional water waves with arbitrary vorticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the two-dimensional water-wave problem with a general non-zero vorticity field in a fluid volume with a flat bed and a free surface. The nonlinear equations of motion for the chosen surface and volume variables are expressed with the aid of the Dirichlet-Neumann operator and the Green function of the Laplace operator in the fluid domain. Moreover, we provide new explicit expressions for both objects.
  The field of a point vortex and its interaction with the free surface is studied as an example. In the small-amplitude long-wave Boussinesq and KdV regimes, we obtain appropriate systems of coupled equations for the dynamics of the point vortex and the time evolution of the free surface variables.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness for a higher order water wave model on modulation spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Considered in this work is the initial value problem (IVP) associated to a higher order water wave model
  \begin{equation*}
  \begin{cases} \eta_t+\eta_x-\gamma_1 \eta_{xxt}+\gamma_2\eta_{xxx}+\delta_1 \eta_{xxxxt}+\delta_2\eta_{xxxxx}+\frac{3}{2}\eta \eta_x+\gamma (\eta^2)_{xxx}-\frac{7}{48}(\eta_x^2)_x-\frac{1}{8}(\eta^3)_x=0,\\ \eta(x,0) = \eta_0(x). \end{cases} \end{equation*} The main interest is in addressing the well-posedness issues of the IVP when the given initial data are considered in the modulation space $M_s^{2,p}(\mathbb{R})$ or the $L^p$-based Sobolev spaces $H^{s,p}(\mathbb{R})$, $1\leq p&lt;\infty$. We derive some multilinear estimates in these spaces and prove that the above IVP is locally well-posed for data in $M_s^{2,p}(\mathbb{R})$ whenever $s&gt;1$ and $p\geq 1$, and in $H^{s,p}(\mathbb{R})$ whenever $p\in [1,\infty)$ and $s\geq \max\left\{ \frac1{p}+\frac12, 1 \right\}$. We also use a combination of high-low frequency technique and an {\em a priori estimate}, and prove that the local solution with data in the modulation spaces $M_s^{2,p}(\mathbb{R})$ can be extended globally to the time interval $[0, T]$ for any given $T\gg1$ if $1\leq \frac32-\frac1p &lt;s&lt;2$ or if $(s,p)\in [2, \infty]\times [2, \infty]$.</description>

      <title>Singular Elliptic PDEs: an extensive overview</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this survey we provide an overview of nonlinear elliptic homogeneous boundary value problems featuring singular zero-order terms with respect to the unknown variable whose prototype equation is $$ -\Delta u = {u^{-\gamma}} \ \text{in}\ \Omega $$ where $\Omega$ is a bounded subset of $\mathbb{R}^N$ ($N\geq 2$), and $\gamma&gt;0$.
  We start by outlining the basic concepts and the mathematical framework needed for setting the problem. Both old and new key existence and uniqueness results are presented, alongside regularity issues depending on the regularity of the data. The presentation aims to be modern, self-contained and consistent. Some examples and open problems are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Blow-up solutions for the steady state of the Keller-Segel system on Riemann surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the following Neumann boundary problem related to the stationary solutions of the Keller-Segel system, a basic model of chemotaxis phenomena: \[ -\Delta_g u +\beta u =\lambda\left(\frac{Ve^u}{\int_{\Sigma} Ve^u d v_g}-\frac{1}{|\Sigma|_g}\right) \text { in } \mathring\Sigma \] with $\partial_{ \nu_g} u=0, \text { on } \partial \Sigma$, where $(\Sigma, g)$ is a compact Riemann surface with the interior $\mathring\Sigma$ and the smooth boundary $\partial \Sigma$. Here, $\lambda, \beta\geq 0$ are non-negative parameters, and $V$ is a smooth non-negative function with a finite zero set. For any given integers $m\geq k\geq 0$, we establish a sufficient condition on $V$ for the existence of a sequence of blow-up solutions as $\lambda$ approaches the critical values $4\pi(m+k)$. Moreover, the study expands to the corresponding singular problem.</description>

      <title>Existence and weak-strong uniqueness for damage systems in viscoelasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the existence of solutions and their weak-strong uniqueness property for a PDE system modelling damage in viscoelastic materials. In fact, we address two solution concepts, weak and strong solutions. For the former, we obtain a global-in-time existence result, but the highly nonlinear character of the system prevents us from proving their uniqueness. For the latter, we prove local-in-time existence. Then, we show that the strong solution, as long as it exists, is unique in the class of weak solutions. This weak-strong uniqueness statement is proved by means of a suitable relative energy inequality.</description>

Abstract: We study an optimal control problem with a quadratic cost functional for non-Newtonian fluids of differential type.
  More precisely, we consider the system governing the evolution of a second grade fluid filling a two-dimensional bounded domain, supplemented with a Navier slip boundary condition, and under certain assumptions on the size of the initial data and parameters of the model, we prove the second-order sufficient optimality conditions.
  Furthermore, we establish a global uniqueness result for the solutions of the first-order optimality system.</description>

      <title>Data Assimilation to the Primitive Equations in $H^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we prove that the solution to the primitive equations is predicted by the corresponding data assimilation(DA) equations in $H^2$. Although, the DA equation does not include the direct information about the base solution and its initial conditions, the solution to the DA equation exponentially convergence to the base(original) solution when the external forces are known even before they are observed. Additionally, when the external force is not completely known but its spatially dense observations are available, then the DA is stable, $i.e.$ the DA solution lies in a sufficiently small neighborhood of the base solution.</description>

      <title>On an Inverse Problem of the Generalized Bathtub Model of Network Trip Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the generalized bathtub model, a nonlocal transport equation for describing network trip flows served by privately operated vehicles inside a road network. First, we establish the well-posedness of the mathematical model for both classical and weak solutions. Then we consider an inverse source problem of the model with model parameters embodying particular traffic situations. We establish a conditional Lipschitz stability of the inverse problem under suitable a priori regularity assumption on the problem data, using a Volterra integral formulation of the problem. Inspired by the analysis, we develop an easy-to-implement numerical method for reconstructing the flow rates, and provide the error analysis of the method. Further we present several numerical experiments to complement the theoretical analysis.</description>

Abstract: This is an announcement of a series of upcoming works on boundary regularity for area minimizing currents, one of which is in collaboration with Reinaldo Resende. The setting we consider is that of an area minimizing current with a smooth boundary taken with arbitrary multiplicity. The main result is a generalization of Allard's boundary regularity theorem from which we derive important structural consequences.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a small spherical particle, we consider flow of a nematic liquid crystal in the corresponding exterior domain. Our focus is on precise far field asymptotic behavior of the flow in a parameter regime when the governing equations can be reduced to a system of linear partial differential equations. We are able to analytically characterize the velocity of the flow and compare it to the classical expression for the Stokes flow. The expression for velocity away from the particle can be computed either numerically or symbolically.</description>

      <title>Variational construction of singular characteristics and propagation of singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On a smooth closed manifold $M$, we introduce a novel theory of maximal slope curves for any pair $(\phi,H)$ with $\phi$ a semiconcave function and $H$ a Hamiltonian.
  By using the notion of maximal slope curve from gradient flow theory, the intrinsic singular characteristics constructed in [Cannarsa, P.; Cheng, W., \textit{Generalized characteristics and Lax-Oleinik operators: global theory}. Calc. Var. Partial Differential Equations 56 (2017), no. 5, 56:12], the smooth approximation method developed in [Cannarsa, P.; Yu, Y. \textit{Singular dynamics for semiconcave functions}. J. Eur. Math. Soc. 11 (2009), no. 5, 999--1024], and the broken characteristics studied in [Khanin, K.; Sobolevski, A., \textit{On dynamics of Lagrangian trajectories for Hamilton-Jacobi equations}. Arch. Ration. Mech. Anal. 219 (2016), no. 2, 861--885], we prove the existence and stability of such maximal slope curves and discuss certain new weak KAM features. We also prove that maximal slope curves for any pair $(\phi,H)$ are exactly broken characteristics which have right derivatives everywhere.
  Applying this theory, we establish a global variational construction of strict singular characteristics and broken characteristics. Moreover, we prove a result on the global propagation of cut points along generalized characteristics, as well as a result on the propagation of singular points along strict singular characteristics, for weak KAM solutions. We also obtain the continuity equation along strict singular characteristics which clarifies the mass transport nature in the problem of propagation of singularities.</description>

      <title>On De Giorgi's lemma for variational interpolants in metric and Banach spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00976v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variational interpolants are an indispensable tool for the construction of gradient-flow solutions via the Minimizing Movement Scheme. De Giorgi's lemma provides the associated discrete energy-dissipation inequality. It was originally developed for metric gradient systems. Drawing from this theory we study the case of generalized gradient systems in Banach spaces, where a refined theory allows us to extend the validity of the discrete energy-dissipation inequality and to establish it as an equality. For the latter we have to impose the condition of radial differentiability of the dissipation potential. Several examples are discussed to show how sharp the results are.</description>

      <title>Optimal regularity of subsonic steady-states solution of Euler-Poisson equations for semiconductors with sonic boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the optimal regularity of the stationary sonic-subsonic solution to the unipolar isothermal hydrodynamic model of semiconductors with sonic boundary. Applying the comparison principle and the energy estimate, we obtain the regularity of the sonic-subsonic solution as $C^{\frac{1}{2}}[0,1]\cap W^{1,p}(0,1)$ for any $p&lt;2$, which is then proved to be optimal by analyzing the property of solution around the singular point on the sonic line, i.e., $\rho\notin C^\nu[0,1]$ for any $\nu&gt;\frac{1}{2}$, and $\rho\notin W^{1,\kappa}(0,1)$ for any $\kappa\ge 2$. Furthermore, we explore the influence of the semiconductors effect on the singularity of solution at sonic points $x=1$ and $x=0$, that is, the solution always has strong singularity at sonic point $x=1$ for any relaxation time $\tau&gt;0$, but, once the relaxation time is sufficiently large $\tau\gg 1$, then the sonic-subsonic steady-states possess the strong singularity at both sonic boundaries $x=0$ and $x=1$. We also show that the pure subsonic solution $\rho$ belongs to $W^{2,\infty}(0,1)$, which can be embedded into $C^{1,1}[0,1]$, and it is much better than the regularity of sonic-subsonic solutions.</description>

      <title>On the well-posedness of the compressible Navier-Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Cauchy problem to the barotropic compressible Navier-Stokes equations. We obtain optimal local well-posedness in the sense of Hadamard in the critical Besov space $\mathbb{X}_p=\dot{B}_{p,1}^{\frac{d}{p}}\times \dot{B}_{p,1}^{-1+\frac{d}{p}}$ for $1\leq p&lt;2d$ with $d\geq2$. The main new result is the continuity of the solution maps from $\mathbb{X}_p$ to $C([0,T]: \mathbb{X}_p)$, which was not proved in previous works \cite{D2001, D2005, D2014}. To prove our results, we combine the method of frequency envelope (see \cite{Tao04}) but in the transport-parabolic setting and the Lagrangian approach for the compressible Navier-Stokes equations (see \cite{D2014}). As a by-product, the Lagrangian transform $(a,u)\to (\bar a, \bar u)=(a\circ X, u\circ X)$ used in \cite{D2014} is a continuous bijection and hence bridges the two methods using Eulerian and Lagrangian coordinates.</description>

Abstract: We consider a variational model of electrified liquid drops, involving competition between surface tension and charge repulsion. Since the natural model happens to be ill-posed, we show that by adding to the perimeter a Willmore-type energy, the problem turns back to be well-posed. We also prove that for small charge the droplets is spherical.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a conservation law on a network made of two incoming branches and a single outgoing one from a discrete traffic flow model. The continuous model is obtained from the discrete one by letting the number of vehicles tend to infinity and after scaling. In the discrete model, the vehicles solve a follow-the-leader model on each branch. The priority rule at the junction is given by a timeperiodic traffic light (with a period tending to infinity with the scaling for technical reasons). The conservation law at the limit is L 1 contractive and described in terms of a germ depending on the flux and on the average amount of time the traffic light is ''green'' on a branch.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a class of models for nonlinear acoustics, including the well-known Westervelt and Kuznetsov equations, as well as a model of Rasmussen that can be seen as a thermodynamically consistent modification of the latter. Using linearization, energy estimates, and fixed-point arguments, we establish the existence and uniqueness of solutions that, for sufficiently small data, are global in time and converge exponentially fast to equilibrium. In contrast to previous work, our analysis is based on a velocity-enthalpy formulation of the problem, whose weak form reveals the underlying port-Hamiltonian structure. Moreover, the weak form of the problem is particularly well-suited for a structure-preserving discretization. This is demonstrated in numerical tests, which also highlight typical characteristics of the models under consideration.</description>

Abstract: We study the Carleson measures on NTA and ADP domains in the Heisenberg groups $\mathbb{H}^n$ and provide two characterizations of such measures: (1) in terms of the level sets of subelliptic harmonic functions and (2) via the $1$-quasiconformal family of mappings on the Kor\'anyi--Reimann unit ball. Moreover, we establish the $L^2$-bounds for the square function $S_{\alpha}$ of a subelliptic harmonic function and the Carleson measure estimates for the BMO boundary data, both on NTA domains in $\mathbb{H}^n$. Finally, we prove a Fatou-type theorem on $(\epsilon, \delta)$-domains in $\mathbb{H}^n$.</description>

      <title>The Klein-Gordon equation on asymptotically Minkowski spacetimes: causal propagators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct the causal (forward/backward) propagators for the massive Klein-Gordon equation perturbed by a first order operator which decays in space but not necessarily in time. In particular, we obtain global estimates for forward/backward solutions to the inhomogeneous, perturbed Klein-Gordon equation, including in the presence of bound states of the limiting spatial Hamiltonians.
  To this end, we prove propagation of singularities estimates in all regions of infinity (spatial, null, and causal) and use the estimates to prove that the Klein-Gordon operator is an invertible mapping between adapted weighted Sobolev spaces. This builds off work of Vasy in which inverses of hyperbolic PDEs are obtained via construction of a Fredholm mapping problem using radial points propagation estimates. To deal with the presence of a perturbation which persists in time, we employ a class of pseudodifferential operators first explored in Vasy's many-body work.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear stability threshold for compressible Couette flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper concerns the Couette flow for 2-D compressible Navier-Stokes equations (N-S) in an infinitely long flat torus $\Torus\times\R$. Compared to the incompressible flow, the compressible Couette flow has a stronger lift-up effect and weaker dissipation. To the best of our knowledge, there has been no work on the nonlinear stability in the cases of high Reynolds number until now and only linear stability was known in \cite{ADM2021,ZZZ2022}.In this paper, we study the nonlinear stability of 2-D compressible Couette flow in Sobolev space at high Reynolds numbers. Moreover, we also show the enhanced dissipation phenomenon and stability threshold for the compressible Couette flow.
  First, We decompose the perturbation into zero and non-zero modes and obtain two systems for these components, respectively. Different from \cite{ADM2021,ZZZ2022}, we use the anti-derivative technique to study the zero-mode system. We introduce a kind of diffusion wave to remove the excessive mass of the zero-modes and construct coupled diffusion waves along characteristics to improve the resulting time decay rates of error terms and derive a new integrated system \cref{anti}. Secondly, we observe a cancellation with the new system \cref{anti} so that the lift-up effect is weakened. Thirdly, the large time behavior of the zero-modes is obtained by the weighted energy method and a weighted inequality on the heat kernel \cite{HLM2010}.In addition, with the help of the Fourier multipliers method, we can show the enhanced dissipation phenomenon for the non-zero modes by commutator estimates to avoid loss of derivatives. Finally, we complete the higher-order derivative estimates to close the a priori assumptions by the energy method and show the stability threshold.</description>

      <title>Overhanging solitary water waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide the first construction of overhanging gravity water waves having the approximate form of a disk joined to a strip by a thin neck. The waves are solitary with constant vorticity, and exist when an appropriate dimensionless gravitational constant $g&gt;0$ is sufficiently small. Our construction involves combining three explicit solutions to related problems: a disk of fluid in rigid rotation, a linear shear flow in a strip, and a rescaled version of an exceptional domain discovered by Hauswirth, H\'elein, and Pacard \cite{hauswirth-helein-pacard}. The method developed here is related to the construction of constant mean curvature surfaces through gluing.</description>

      <title>On the monotonicity of the Fisher information for the Boltzmann equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the Fisher information is monotone decreasing in time along solutions of the space-homogeneous Boltzmann equation for a large class of collision kernels covering all classical interactions derived from systems of particles. For general collision kernels, a sufficient condition for the monotonicity of the Fisher information along the flow is related to the best constant for an integro-differential inequality for functions on the sphere, which belongs in the family of the Log-Sobolev inequalities. As a consequence, we establish the existence of global smooth solutions to the space-homogeneous Boltzmann equation in the main situation of interest where this was not known, namely the regime of very soft potentials. This is opening the path to the completion of both the classical program of qualitative study of space-homogeneous Boltzmann equation, initiated by Carleman, and the program of using the Fisher information in the study of the Boltzmann equation, initiated by McKean. From the proofs and discussion emerges a strengthened picture of the links between kinetic theory, information theory and log-Sobolev inequalities.</description>

      <title>Charge transport systems with Fermi-Dirac statistics for memristors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An instationary drift-diffusion system for the electron, hole, and oxygen vacancy densities, coupled to the Poisson equation for the electric potential, is analyzed in a bounded domain with mixed Dirichlet-Neumann boundary conditions. The electron and hole densities are governed by Fermi-Dirac statistics, while the oxygen vacancy density is governed by Blakemore statistics. The equations model the charge carrier dynamics in memristive devices used in semiconductor technology. The global existence of weak solutions is proved in up to three space dimensions. The proof is based on the free energy inequality, an iteration argument to improve the integrability of the densities, and estimations of the Fermi-Dirac integral. Under a physically realistic elliptic regularity condition, it is proved that the densities are bounded.</description>

      <title>Thermo-elastodynamics of nonlinearly viscous solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the thermo-elastodynamics of nonlinearly viscous solids in the Kelvin-Voigt rheology where both the elastic and the viscous stress tensors comply with the frame-indifference principle. The system features a force balance including inertia in the frame of nonsimple materials and a heat-transfer equation which is governed by the Fourier law in the deformed configuration. Combining a staggered minimizing movement scheme for quasi-static thermoviscoelasticity with a variational approach to hyperbolic PDEs, our main result consists in establishing the existence of weak solutions in the dynamic case. This is first achieved by including an additional higher-order regularization for the dissipation. Afterwards, this regularization can be removed by passing to a weaker formulation of the heat-transfer equation which complies with a total energy balance. The latter description hinges on regularity theory for the fourth order $p$-Laplacian which induces regularity estimates of the deformation beyond the standard estimates available from energy bounds. Besides being crucial for the proof, these extra regularity properties might be of independent interest and seem to be new in the setting of nonlinear viscoelasticity, also in the static or quasi-static case.</description>

      <title>A weighted eigenvalue problem for mixed local and nonlocal operators with potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study an {\it indefinite weighted eigenvalue problem} for an operator of {\it mixed-type} (that includes both the classical {\it $p$-Laplacian} and the {\it fractional $p$-Laplacian}) in a bounded open subset $\Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^N \,(N\geq2)$ with {\it Lipschitz boundary} $\partial \Omega$, which is given by \begin{align*}
  -\Delta_p u + (-\Delta_p)^su+V(x)|u|^{p-2}u&amp;=\lambda g(x)|u|^{p-2}u~\text{in}~\Omega,
  u&amp;=0~\text{in}~\mathbb{R}^N\setminus\Omega, \end{align*} where $\lambda &gt;0$ is a parameter, exponents $0&lt;s&lt;1&lt;p&lt;N$, and $V, g\in L^q(\Omega)$ for $q\in \left(\frac{N}{sp}, \infty\right)$ with $V\geq 0, g &gt; 0$ a.e. in $\Omega$. Using the variational tools together with a {\it weak comparison} and {\it strong maximum principles}, we investigate the existence and uniqueness of {\it principal eigenvalue} and discuss its qualitative properties. Moreover, with the help of {\it Ljusternik-Schnirelman category theory}, it is proved that there exists a {\it nondecreasing sequence of positive eigenvalues} which goes to infinity. Further, we show that {\it the set of all positive eigenvalues is closed}, and {\it eigenfunctions} associated with every {\it positive eigenvalue} are bounded.</description>

      <title>Homogenization of the 2D Euler system: lakes and porous media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work is devoted to the long-standing open problem of homogenization of 2D perfect incompressible fluid flows, such as the 2D Euler equations with impermeable inclusions modeling a porous medium, and such as the lake equations. The main difficulty is the homogenization of the transport equation for the associated fluid vorticity. In particular, a localization phenomenon for the vorticity could in principle occur, which would rule out the separation of scales. Our approach combines classical results from different fields to prevent such phenomena and to prove homogenization towards variants of the Euler and lake equations: we rely in particular on the homogenization theory for elliptic equations with stiff inclusions, on criteria for unique ergodicity of dynamical systems, and on complex analysis in form of extensions of the Rad\'o-Kneser-Choquet theorem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to construct non-trivial steady-state weak solutions of the three dimensional Electron Magnetohydrodynamics equations in the class of $H^s(\mathbb T^3)$ for some small $s &gt; 0$. By exploiting the formulation of the stationary EMHD equations one can treat them as generalized Navier-Stokes equations with half Laplacian. Therefore with convex integration scheme we obtained such stationary weak solutions, which is not yet realizable in the case of classical 3D Navier-Stokes equations.</description>

      <title>The Cauchy problem for the Degasperis-Procesi Equation: Painlev\'e Asymptotics in Transition Zones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Degasperis-Procesi (DP) equation \begin{align}
  &amp;u_t-u_{txx}+3\kappa u_x+4uu_x=3u_x u_{xx}+uu_{xxx}, \nonumber
  \end{align} serving as an asymptotic approximation for the unidirectional propagation of shallow water waves, is an integrable model of the Camassa-Holm type and admits a $3\times3$ matrix Lax pair. In our previous work, we obtained the long-time asymptotics of the solution $u(x,t)$ to the Cauchy problem for the DP equation in the solitonic region $\{(x,t): \xi&gt;3 \} \cup \{(x,t): \xi&lt;-\frac{3}{8} \}$ and the solitonless region $\{(x,t): -\frac{3}{8}&lt;\xi&lt; 0 \} \cup \{(x,t): 0\leq \xi &lt;3 \}$ where $\xi:=\frac{x}{t}$. In this paper, we derive the leading order approximation to the solution $u(x,t)$ in terms of the solution for the Painlev\'{e} \uppercase\expandafter{\romannumeral2} equation in two transition zones $\left|\xi+\frac{3}{8}\right|t^{2/3}&lt;C$ and $\left|\xi -3\right|t^{2/3}&lt;C$ with $C&gt;0$ lying between the solitonic region and solitonless region. Our results are established by performing the $\bar \partial$-generalization of the Deift-Zhou nonlinear steepest descent method and applying a double scaling limit technique to an associated vector Riemann-Hilbert problem.</description>

      <title>Two-layers neural networks for Schr{\"o}dinger eigenvalue problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this article is to analyze numerical schemes using two-layer neural networks withinfinite width for the resolution of high-dimensional Schr{\"o}dinger eigenvalue problems with smoothinteraction potentials and Neumann boundary condition on the unit cube in any dimension. Moreprecisely, any eigenfunction associated to the lowest eigenvalue of the Schr{\"o}dinger operator is a unitL 2 norm minimizer of the associated energy. Using Barron's representation of the solution witha probability measure defined on the set of parameter values and following the approach initiallysuggested by Bach and Chizat [1], the energy is minimized thanks to a constrained gradient curvedynamic on the 2-Wasserstein space of the set of parameter values defining the neural network. Weprove the existence of solutions to this constrained gradient curve. Furthermore, we prove that,if it converges, the represented function is then an eigenfunction of the considered Schr{\"o}dingeroperator. At least up to our knowledge, this is the first work where this type of analysis is carriedout to deal with the minimization of non-convex functionals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the stability of the Von K\'arm\'an model for thin plates subject to pure Neumann conditions and to dead loads, with no restriction on their direction. We prove a stability alternative, which extends previous results by Lecumberry and M\"uller in the Dirichlet case. Because of the rotation invariance of the problem, their notions of stability have to be modified and combined with the concept of optimal rotations due to Maor and Mora. Finally, we prove that the Von K\'arm\'an model is not compatible with some specific types of forces. Thus, for such, only the Kirchoff model applies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the gain in regularity of the distance to the boundary of a domain in $\R^m$. In particular, we show that if the signed distance function happens to be merely differentiable in a neighborhood of a boundary point, it and the boundary have to be $\mathcal C^{1,1}$ regular. Conversely, we study the regularity of the distance function under regularity hypotheses of the boundary. Along the way, we point out that any solution to the eikonal equation, differentiable everywhere in a domain of the Euclidean space, admits a gradient which is locally Lipschitz.</description>

      <title>A constitutive condition for idealized isotropic Cauchy elasticity involving the logarithmic strain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Following Hill and Leblond, the aim of our work is to show, for isotropic nonlinear elasticity, a relation between the corotational Zaremba-Jaumann objective derivative of the Cauchy stress $\sigma$, i.e.
  \begin{equation}
  \frac{{\rm D}^{\rm ZJ}}{{\rm D} t}[\sigma] = \frac{{\rm d}}{{\rm d}{t}}[\sigma] - W \, \sigma + \sigma \, W, \qquad W = {\rm skew}(\dot F \, F^{-1})
  \end{equation} and a constitutive requirement involving the logarithmic strain tensor. Given the deformation tensor $F ={\rm D} \varphi$, the left Cauchy-Green tensor $B = F \, F^T$, and the strain-rate tensor $D = {\rm sym}(\dot F \, F^{-1})$, we show that
  \begin{equation}
  \label{eqCPSdef}
  \begin{alignedat}{2}
  \forall \,D\in{\rm Sym}(3) \! \setminus \! \{0\}:
  ~
  \langle{\frac{{\rm D}^{\rm ZJ}}{{\rm D} t}[\sigma]},{D}\rangle &gt; 0
  \quad
  &amp;\iff
  \quad
  \log B
  \longmapsto
  \widehat\sigma(\log B)
  \;\textrm{is strongly Hilbert-monotone}
  &amp;\iff \quad {\rm sym} {\rm D}_{\log B} \widehat \sigma(\log B) \in{\rm Sym}^{++}_4(6) \quad \text{(TSTS-M$^{++}$)},
  \end{alignedat} \tag{1}
  \end{equation} where ${\rm Sym}^{++}_4(6)$ denotes the set of positive definite, (minor and major) symmetric fourth order tensors. We call the first inequality ``corotational stability postulate'' (CSP), a novel concept, which implies the \textbf{T}rue-\textbf{S}tress \textbf{T}rue-\textbf{S}train strict Hilbert-\textbf{M}onotonicity (TSTS-M$^+$) for $B \mapsto \sigma(B) = \widehat \sigma(\log B)$, i.e. \begin{equation}
  \langle \widehat\sigma(\log B_1)-\widehat\sigma(\log B_2),{\log B_1-\log B_2} \rangle&gt; 0
  \qquad
  \forall \, B_1\neq B_2\in{\rm Sym}^{++}(3) \, . \end{equation} In this paper we expand on the ideas of Hill and Leblond, extending Leblonds calculus to the Cauchy elastic case.</description>

      <title>Stable standing waves for Nonlinear Schr\"odinger-Poisson system with a doping profile</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the study of the nonlinear Schr\"odinger-Poisson system with a doping profile. We are interested in the existence of stable standing waves by considering the associated $L^2$-minimization problem. The presence of a doping profile causes a difficulty in the proof of the strict sub-additivity. A key ingredient is to establish the strict sub-additivity by adapting a scaling and an iteration argument, which is inspired by \cite{ZZou}. When the doping profile is a characteristic function supported on a bounded smooth domain, smallness of some geometric quantity related to the domain ensures the existence of stable standing waves.</description>

      <title>Boundedness and finite-time blow-up in a repulsion-consumption system with nonlinear chemotactic sensitivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the repulsion-consumption system \begin{align}\tag{$\star$}
  \left\{
  \begin{array}{ll}
  u_t=\Delta u+\nabla \cdot(S(u) \nabla v),
  \tau v_t=\Delta v-u v, \end{array}
  \right. \end{align} under no-flux/Dirichlet conditions for $u$ and $v$ in a ball $B_R(0) \subset \mathbb R^n $. When $\tau=\{0,1\}$ and $0&lt;S(u)\leqslant K(1+u)^{\beta}$ for $u \geqslant 0$ with some $\beta \in (0,\frac{n+2}{2n})$ and $K&gt;0$, we show that for any given radially symmetric initial data, the problem ($\star$) possesses a global bounded classical solution. Conversely, when $\tau=0$, $n=2$ and $S(u) \geqslant k u^{\beta}$ for $u \geqslant 0$ with some $\beta&gt;1$ and $k&gt;0$, for any given initial data $u_0$, there exists a constant $M^{\star}=M^{\star}\left(u_0\right)&gt;0$ with the property that whenever the boundary signal level $M\geqslant M^{\star}$, the corresponding radially symmetric solution blows up in finite time.
  Our results can be compared with that of the papers [J.~Ahn and M.~Winkler, {\it Calc. Var.} {\bf 64} (2023).] and [Y. Wang and M. Winkler, {\it Proc. Roy. Soc. Edinburgh Sect. A}, \textbf{153} (2023).], in which the authors studied the system ($\star$) with the first equation replaced respectively by $u_t=\nabla \cdot ((1+u)^{-\alpha} \nabla u)+\nabla \cdot(u \nabla v)$ and $u_t=\nabla \cdot ((1+u)^{-\alpha} \nabla u)+\nabla \cdot(\frac{u}{v} \nabla v)$. Among other things, they obtained that, under some conditions on $u_0(x)$ and the boundary signal level, there exists a classical solution blowing up in finite time whenever $\alpha&gt;0$.</description>

      <title>Eigenvalue Inequalities for Fully Nonlinear Elliptic Equations via the Alexandroff-Bekelman-Pucci Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we establish eigenvalue inequalities for elliptic differential operators either for Dirichlet or for Robin eigenvalue problems, by using the technique introduced by Alexandrov, Bekelman and Pucci. These inequalities can be extended for fully nonlinear elliptic equations, such as for the Monge-Amp\`ere equation and for Pucci's equations. As an application we establish a lower bound for the $ L^n -$norm of the Laplacian and this bound is sharp, in the sense that, when equality is achieved then a symmetry property is obtained. In addition, we obtain an $ L^{\infty} $ bound for the gradient of solutions to fully nonlinear elliptic equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we consider a general time-periodic linear transport equation with integral source term. We prove the existence of a Floquet principal eigenvalue, namely a real number such that the equation rescaled by this number admits nonnegative periodic solutions. We also prove the exponential attractiveness of these solutions. The method relies on general spectral results about positive operators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the stability of an inverse problem for determining the time-dependent matrix potential appearing in the Dirichlet initial-boundary value problem for the wave equation in an unbounded cylindrical waveguide. The observation is given by the input-output map associated with the wave equation. Considering a suitable geometric optics solution and with the help of light ray transform, we demonstrate the stability estimate in the determination of the time-dependent matrix potential from the given input-output map.</description>

      <title>Boundary conditions for hyperbolic relaxation systems with characteristic boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with initial-boundary-value problems of general multi-dimensional hyperbolic relaxation systems with characteristic boundaries. For the characteristic case, we redefine a Generalized Kreiss condition (GKC) which is essentially necessary to have a well-behaved relaxation limit. Under this characteristic GKC and a Shizuta-Kawashima-like condition, we derive reduced boundary conditions for the relaxation limit solving the corresponding equilibrium systems and justify the validity thereof. The key of the derivation is to select an elaborate version of the characteristic GKC by invoking the Shizuta-Kawashima-like condition. In contrast to the existing results, the present one does not assume that the boundary is non-characteristic for either the relaxation or equilibrium systems. In this sense, this paper completes the task in deriving reduced boundary conditions for general linear relaxation systems satisfying the structural stability condition.</description>

      <title>Weak stability of the sum of $K$ solitary waves for Half-wave equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the subcritical half-wave equation in the one-dimensional case. Let $R_k(t,x)$ be $K$ solitary wave solutions of the half-wave equation with different translations $x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_K$. If the relative distances of the solitary waves $x_k-x_{k-1}$ are large enough, we prove that the sum of the $R_k(t)$ is weakly stable. To prove this result, we use an energy method and the local mass monotonicity property. However, unlike the single-solitary wave or NLS cases, different waves exhibit the strongest interactions in dimension one. In order to obtain the local mass monotonicity property to estimate the remainder of the geometrical decomposition, as well as non-local effects on localization functions and non-local operator $|D|$, we utilize the Carlder\'on estimate and the integration representation formula of the half-wave operator.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the local regularity properties of $(s,p)$-harmonic functions, i.e. local weak solutions to the fractional $p$-Laplace equation of order $s\in (0,1)$ in the case $p\in (1,2]$. It is shown that $(s,p)$-harmonic functions are weakly differentiable and that the weak gradient is locally integrable to any power $q\geq 1$. As a result, $(s,p)$-harmonic functions are H\"older continuous to arbitrary H\"older exponent in $(0,1)$. In addition, the weak gradient of $(s,p)$-harmonic functions has certain fractional differentiability. All estimates are stable when $s$ reaches $1$, and the known regularity properties of $p$-harmonic functions are formally recovered, in particular the local $W^{2,2}$-estimate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the eigenvalue problem for the Schr\"odinger operator on bounded, convex domains with mixed boundary conditions, where a Dirichlet boundary condition is imposed on a part of the boundary and a Neumann boundary condition on its complement. We prove inequalities between the lowest eigenvalues corresponding to two different choices of such boundary conditions on both planar and higher-dimensional domains. We also prove an inequality between higher order mixed eigenvalues and pure Dirichlet eigenvalues on multidimensional polyhedral domains.</description>

      <title>Methods based on Radon transform for non-affine deformable image registration of noisy images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deformable image registration is a standard engineering problem used to determine the distortion experienced by a body by comparing two images of it in different states. This study introduces two new DIR methods designed to capture non-affine deformations using Radon transform-based similarity measures and a classical regularizer based on linear elastic deformation energy. It establishes conditions for the existence and uniqueness of solutions for both methods and presents synthetic experimental results comparing them with a standard method based on the sum of squared differences similarity measure. These methods have been tested to capture various non-affine deformations in images, both with and without noise, and their convergence rates have been analyzed. Furthermore, the effectiveness of these methods was also evaluated in a lung image registration scenario.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a velocity tracking problem for stochastic Navier-Stokes equations in a 2D-bounded domain. The control acts on the boundary through an injection-suction device with uncertainty, which acts in accordance with the non-homogeneous Navier-slip boundary conditions. After establishing a suitable stability result for the solution of the stochastic state equation, we prove the well-posedness of the stochastic linearized state equation and show that the G\^ateaux derivative of the control-to-state mapping corresponds to the unique solution of the linearized equation. Next, we study the stochastic backward adjoint equation and establish a duality relation between the solutions of the forward linearized equation and the backward adjoint equation. Finally, we derive the first-order optimality conditions.</description>

Abstract: This article studies the Stochastic Degasperis-Procesi (SDP) equation on $\mathbb{R}$ with an additive noise. Applying the kinetic theory, and considering the initial conditions in $L^2(\mathbb{R})\cap L^{2+\delta}(\mathbb{R})$, for arbitrary small $\delta&gt;0$, we establish the existence of a global pathwise solution. Restricting to the particular case of zero noise, our result improves the deterministic solvability results that exist in the literature.</description>

      <title>Synchronized Memory-Dependent Intracellular Oscillations for a Cell-Bulk ODE-PDE Model in $\mathbb{R}^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00623v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a cell-bulk ODE-PDE model in $\mathbb{R}^2$, a hybrid asymptotic-numerical theory is developed to provide a new theoretical and computationally efficient approach for studying how oscillatory dynamics associated with spatially segregated dynamically active ``units" or ``cells" are regulated by a PDE bulk diffusion field that is both produced and absorbed by the entire cell population. The study of oscillator synchronization in a PDE diffusion field was one of the initial aims of Yoshiki Kuramoto's foundational work. For this cell-bulk model, strong localized perturbation theory, as extended to a time-dependent setting, is used to derive a new integro-differential ODE system that characterizes intracellular dynamics in a memory-dependent bulk-diffusion field. For this nonlocal reduced system, a novel fast time-marching scheme, relying in part on the \emph{sum-of-exponentials method} to numerically treat convolution integrals, is developed to rapidly and accurately compute numerical solutions to the integro-differential system over long time intervals. For the special case of Sel'kov reaction kinetics, a wide variety of large-scale oscillatory dynamical behavior including phase synchronization, mixed-mode oscillations, and quorum-sensing are illustrated for various ranges of the influx and efflux permeability parameters, the bulk degradation rate and bulk diffusivity, and the specific spatial configuration of cells. Results from our fast algorithm, obtained in under one minute of CPU time on a laptop, are benchmarked against PDE simulations of the cell-bulk model, which are performed with a commercial PDE solver, that have run-times that are orders of magnitude larger.</description>

      <title>IMEX-RK finite volume methods for nonlinear 1d parabolic PDEs. Application to option pricing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to develop 2nd order Implicit-Explicit Runge-Kutta (IMEX-RK) finite volume (FV) schemes for solving 1d parabolic PDEs for option pricing, with possible nonlinearities in the source and advection terms. The spatial semi-discretization of the advection is carried out by combining finite volume methods with 2nd order state reconstructions; while the diffusive terms are discretized using second-order finite differences. The time integration is performed by means of IMEX-RK time integrators: the advection is treated explicitly, and the diffusion, implicitly. The obtained numerical schemes have several advantages: they are computationally very efficient, thanks to the implicit discretization of the diffusion in the IMEX-RK time integrators, which allows to overcome the strict time step restriction; they yield second-order accuracy for even nonlinear problems and with non-regular initial conditions; and they can be extended to higher order.</description>

      <title>Discrete Laplacians on the hyperbolic space -- a compared study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The main motivation behind this paper stems from a notable gap in the existing literature: the absence of a discrete counterpart to the Laplace-Beltrami operator on Riemannian manifolds, which can be effectively used to solve PDEs. We consider that the natural approach to pioneer this field is to first explore one of the simplest non-trivial (i.e., non-Euclidean) scenario, specifically focusing on the $2$-dimensional hyperbolic space $\mathbb{H}^2$. To this end, we present two variants of discrete finite-difference operator tailored to this constant negatively curved space, both serving as approximations to the (continuous) Laplace-Beltrami operator within the $\mathrm{L}^2$ framework. Moreover, we prove that the discrete heat equation associated to both aforesaid operators exhibits stability and converges towards the continuous heat-Beltrami Cauchy problem on $\mathbb{H}^2$. Eventually, we illustrate that a discrete Laplacian specifically designed for the geometry of the hyperbolic space yields a more precise approximation and offers advantages from both theoretical and computational perspectives.</description>

      <title>An integrable pseudospherical equation with pseudo-peakon solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider an integrable equation whose solutions define a triad of one-forms, which in turn describe an abstract surface with a Gaussian curvature equal to $-1$. In our investigation, we identify a local group of diffeomorphisms that preserve the set of solutions and establish conserved quantities. Through the symmetries, we obtain invariant solutions that explicitly provide metrics for the described surfaces. These solutions, however, exhibit an unbounded nature; notably, some appear in pairs that display a sort of "mirror symmetry" with respect to their bounded regions. To address this, we utilize both the conserved quantities and this symmetry to develop a process, which we term the "collage" method. This method effectively removes the unbounded parts from these pairs of solutions and seamlessly glues them together in a smooth manner. Consequently, this process results in weak solutions that remain consistent with the conserved quantities identified. The solutions produced through the collage process are pseudo-peakons, which are smoother than the peakon solutions of Camassa-Holm type equations. Moreover, we apply a Miura-type transformation that connects our original equation to the Degasperis-Procesi equation. This transformation allows us to map the solutions from our initial equation to those of the Degasperis-Procesi equation. As a result, we uncover previously unnoticed phenomena, such as a solution to the Degasperis-Procesi equation that exhibits a novel combination of peakon and shock-peakon features, which appears to be unreported to date.</description>

      <title>Bilateral boundary finite-time stabilization of 2x2 linear first-order hyperbolic systems with spatially varying coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents bilateral control laws for one-dimensional(1-D) linear 2x2 hyperbolic first-order systems (with spatially varying coefficients). Bilateral control means there are two actuators at each end of the domain. This situation becomes more complex as the transport velocities are no longer constant, and this extension is nontrivial. By selecting the appropriate backstepping transformation and target system, the infinite-dimensional backstepping method is extended and a full-state feedback control law is given that ensures the closed-loop system converges to its zero equilibrium in finite time. The design of bilateral controllers enables a potential for fault-tolerant designs.</description>

      <title>On some stochastic hyperbolic equations with symplectic characteristics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the effect of Gaussian perturbations on
  a class of model hyperbolic partial differential
  equations with double symplectic characteristics in
  low spatial dimensions, extending some recent work
  in [5]. The coefficients of our
  partial differential operators contain harmonic oscillators
  in the space variables, while the noise is additive,
  white in time and colored in space.
  We provide sufficient conditions on the spectral
  measure of the covariance functional describing the
  noise that allows for the existence of a random field
  solution for the resulting stochastic partial
  differential equation.
  Furthermore we show how the symplectic structure of the set of
  multiple points affects the regularity of the noise
  needed to build a measurable process solution.
  Our approach is based on some explicit computations for the
  fundamental solutions of several model partial
  differential operators together with their explicit Fourier transforms.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study a system of second order integro-partial differential equations with interconnected obstacles with non-local terms, related to an optimal switching problem with the jump-diffusion model. Getting rid of the monotonicity condition on the generators with respect to the jump component, we construct a continuous viscosity solution which is unique in the class of functions with polynomial growth. In our study, the main tool is the notion of reflected backward stochastic differential equations with jumps with interconnected obstacles for which we show the existence of a solution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2102.08008v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper considers a class of linear Boltzmann transport equations which models a charged particle transport. The equation is an approximation of the original exact transport equation which involves hyper-singular integrals in their collision terms. Hyper-singular integrals can be approximated by partial differential operators together with partial integral operators which leads to an approximation under consideration. This type of approximation is applied, for example in the dose calculation of radiation therapy. The related transport problem is a characteristic initial inflow boundary value problem. Regularity results of solutions are verified utilizing the scales of relevant anisotropic Sobolev spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2201.03699v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider an inverse problem of recovering the unknown coefficients $\beta(t,x)$ and $V(t,x)$ appearing in a time-dependent nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation $ (\mathrm{i} \partial_t +\Delta +V)u + \beta u^2=0$ in $(0,T) \times M$, on Euclidean geometry as well as on Riemannian geometry. We consider measurements in $\Omega \subset M$ that is a neighborhood of the boundary of $M$ and the source-to-solution map $ L_{\beta, V}$ that maps a source $f$ supported in $ \Omega\times (0,T) $ to the restriction of the solution $u$ in $ \Omega\times (0,T) $. We show that the map $L_{\beta, V}$ uniquely determines the time-dependent potential and the coefficient of the non-linearity, for the above non-linear Schr\"odinger equation and for the Gross-Pitaevskii equation, with a cubic non-linear term $\beta |u|^2 \, u$, that is encountered in quantum physics.</description>

Abstract: We show that we can retrieve a Yang--Mills potential and a Higgs field (up to gauge) from source-to-solution type data associated with the classical Yang--Mills--Higgs equations in Minkowski space $\mathbb{R}^{1+3}$. We impose natural non-degeneracy conditions on the representation for the Higgs field and on the Lie algebra of the structure group which are satisfied for the case of the Standard Model. Our approach exploits the non-linear interaction of waves generated by sources with values in the centre of the Lie algebra showing that abelian components can be used effectively to recover the Higgs field.</description>

      <title>Vanishing adsorption limit of Riemann problem solutions for the polymer model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.10326v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the vanishing adsorption limit of solutions of Riemann problems for the Glimm-Isaacson model of chemical flooding of a petroleum reservoir. A contact discontinuity is deemed admissible if it is the limit of traveling waves or rarefaction waves for an augmented system that accounts for weak chemical adsorption onto the rock. We prove that this criterion justifies the admissibility criteria adopted previously by Keyfitz-Kranzer, Isaacson-Temple, and de Souza-Marchesin, provided that the fractional flow function depends monotonically on chemical concentration. We also demonstrate that the adsorption criterion selects the undercompressive contact discontinuities required to solve the general Riemann problem in an example model with non-monotone dependence.</description>

      <title>Landau damping and survival threshold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.08672v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish the large time asymptotic behavior of solutions to the linearized Vlasov-Poisson system near general spatially homogenous equilibria $\mu(\frac12|v|^2)$ with connected support on the torus $\mathbb{T}^3_x \times \mathbb{R}^3_v$ or on the whole space $\mathbb{R}^3_x \times \mathbb{R}^3_v$, including those that are non-monotone. The problem can be solved completely mode by mode for each spatial wave number, and their longtime dynamics is intimately tied to the "survival threshold" of wave numbers computed by $$\kappa_0^2 = 4\pi \int_0^\Upsilon \frac{u^2\mu(\frac12 u^2)}{\Upsilon^2-u^2} \;du$$ where $\Upsilon$ is the maximal speed of particle velocities. It is shown that purely oscillatory electric fields exist and obey a Klein-Gordon's type dispersion relation for wave numbers below the threshold, thus rigorously confirming the existence of Langmuir's oscillatory waves known in the physical literature. At the threshold, the phase velocity of these oscillatory waves enters the range of admissible particle velocities, namely there are particles that move at the same propagation speed of the waves. It is this exact resonant interaction between particles and the oscillatory fields that causes the waves to be damped, classically known as Landau damping. Landau's law of decay is explicitly computed and is sensitive to the decaying rate of the background equilibria. The faster it decays at the maximal velocity, the weaker Landau damping is. Beyond the threshold, the electric fields are a perturbation of those generated by the free transport dynamics and thus decay rapidly fast due to the phase mixing mechanism.</description>

      <title>Viscoelasticity, logarithmic stresses, and tensorial transport equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.14049v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce models for viscoelastic materials, both solids and fluids, based on logarithmic stresses to capture the elastic contribution to the material response. The matrix logarithm allows to link the measures of strain, that naturally belong to a multiplicative group of linear transformations, to stresses, that are additive elements of a linear space of tensors. As regards the viscous stresses, we simply assume a Newtonian constitutive law, but the presence of elasticity and plastic relaxation makes the materials non-Newtonian. Our aim is to discuss the existence of weak solutions for the corresponding systems of partial differential equations in the nonlinear large-deformation regime. The main difficulties arise in the analysis of the transport equations necessary to describe the evolution of tensorial measures of strain. For the solid model, we only need to consider the equation for the left Cauchy-Green tensor, while for the fluid model we add an evolution equation for the elastically-relaxed strain. Due to the tensorial nature of the fields, available techniques cannot be applied to the analysis of such transport equations. To cope with this, we introduce the notion of charted weak solution, based on non-standard a priori estimates, that lead to a global-in-time existence of solutions for the viscoelastic models in the natural functional setting associated with the energy inequality.</description>

Abstract: We study in this article the blow-up of solutions to a coupled semilinear wave equations which are characterized by linear damping terms in the \textit{scale-invariant regime}, time-derivative nonlinearities, mass terms and Tricomi terms. The latter are specifically of great interest from both physical and mathematical points of view since they allow the speeds of propagation to be time-dependent ones. However, we assume in this work that both waves are propagating with the same speeds. Employing this fact together with other hypotheses on the aforementioned parameters (mass and damping coefficients), we obtain a new blow-up region for the system under consideration, and we show a lifespan estimate of the maximal existence time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.12525v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a system of PDEs describing the motion of two compressible viscous fluids occupying the whole space $\mathbb R^d\;(d\in \{2,3\}$). The two phases of the mixture are separated by a $\mathscr{C}^{1+\alpha}$-regular sharp interface $\mathcal{C}$ across which the density can experience jumps. We prove the existence of a unique local-in-time solution assuming that the initial density is $\alpha$-H\"older continuous on both sides of $\mathcal{C}$. The initial velocity belongs to the Sobolev space $H^1(\mathbb R^d)$, and the divergence of the initial stress tensor belongs to $L^2(\mathbb R^d)$. The later assumption expresses somehow the continuity of the stress tensor. This result is more general than the one by Tani [32], as it allows for less regular initial data and furthermore it can serve as a building block for the construction of global-in-time solutions.</description>

      <title>Nonnegative Weak Solution to the Degenerate Viscous Cahn-Hilliard Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16644v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Cahn-Hilliard equation is a widely used model for describing phase separation processes in a binary mixture. In this paper, we investigate the viscous Cahn-Hilliard equation with a degenerate, phase-dependent mobility. We define the concept of a weak solution and establish the existence of such a solution by taking limits of solutions to the viscous Cahn-Hilliard equation with positive mobility. Additionally, assuming that the initial data is positive, we demonstrate that the weak solution remains nonnegative and is not identically zero. Finally, we prove that the weak solution satisfies an energy dissipation inequality.</description>

      <title>Optimal (partial) transport to non-convex polygonal domains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.15655v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the optimal (partial) transport problems when the target is a non-convex polygonal domain in \(\mathbb{R}^2\). For the complete optimal transportation, we prove that the singular set is locally a 1-dimensional smooth curve, except for a finite number of points. For the optimal partial transportation, we prove that the free boundary is smooth except for a finite number of singular points.</description>

      <title>Rigid Lid limit in shallow water over a flat bottom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09605v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform the so-called rigid lid limit on different shallow water models such as the abcd Bousssinesq systems or the Green-Naghdi equations. To do so we consider an appropriate nondimensionalization of these models where two small parameters are involved: the shallowness parameter $\mu$ and a parameter $\epsilon$ which can be interpreted as a Froude number. When parameter $\epsilon$ tends to zero, the surface deformation formally goes to the rest state, hence the name rigid lid limit. We carefully study this limit for different topologies. We also provide rates of convergence with respect to $\epsilon$ and a careful attention is given to the dependence on theshallowness parameter $\mu$.</description>

      <title>A groupoid approach to the Wodzicki residue and the Kontsevich-Vishik trace</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10415v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Building on the work of Debord and Skandalis, van Erp and Yuncken introduced a groupoid approach to pseudo-differential operators which has various advantages over the classical approach using H\"ormander's symbolic calculus. In a recent work by Couchet and Yuncken, they showed that for pseudo-differential operators of order $-\dim(M)$ acting on a smooth manifold $M$ the Wodzicki residue can be naturally obtained from van Erp and Yuncken's approach. In this short note, we extend their work to pseudo-differential operators of any order. We also give a description of the Kontsevich-Vishik trace.</description>

Abstract: The momentum ray transform $I_m^k$ integrates a rank $m$ symmetric tensor field $f$ on $\mathbb R^n$ over lines with the weight $t^k$, $I_m^kf(x,\xi)=\int_{-\infty}^\infty t^k\langle f(x+t\xi),\xi^m\rangle\,\mathrm{d}t$.

      <title>Is the Faber-Krahn inequality true for the Stokes operator?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09801v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to investigate the minimisation of the first eigenvalue of the (vectorial) incompressible Dirichlet-Stokes operator. After providing an existence result, we investigate optimality conditions and we prove the following surprising result: while the ball satisfies first and second-order optimality conditions in dimension 2, it does not in dimension 3, so that the Faber-Krahn inequality for the Stokes operator is probably true in $\mathbb{R}^2$, but does not hold in $\mathbb{R}^3$. The multiplicity of the first eigenvalue of the Dirichlet-Stokes operator in the ball in $\mathbb{R}^3$ plays a crucial role in the proof of that claim.</description>

      <title>Upper estimates of the lifespan for the fractional wave equations with time-dependent damping and a power nonlinearity of subcritical and critical Fujita exponent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10552v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the Cauchy problem of the fractional wave equation with time-dependent damping and the source nonlinearity $f(u)\approx |u|^p$: $$ \begin{cases} \partial_t^2u(t,x)+(-\Delta)^{\sigma/2} u(t,x)+b(t) \partial_t u(t,x) =f(u(t,x)),\ &amp;(t,x)\ \in [0,T)\times \mathbb{R}^N,\\ u(0,x)=u_0(x),\ \partial_tu(0,x)=u_1(x),\ &amp;x\ \in\ \mathbb{R}^N, \end{cases} $$ where $b(t)\approx (1+t)^{-\beta}$. In the subcritical and critical cases $1&lt;p\leq p_c:=1+\frac \sigma N$, we derive the upper estimates of the lifespan for fractional Laplacian with $0&lt;\sigma&lt;2$ and time-dependent damping $\beta \in [-1, 1)$ by the framework of ordinary differential inequality. The blow-up results, with the global existence in the supercritical case $p_c&lt;p&lt;\frac{N}{N-\sigma}$ obtained in [19], shows that the critical exponent for the fractional wave quation is $p_c=1+\frac{\sigma}{N}$ for $0&lt;\sigma&lt;2$. Moreover, together with the lower estimate of lifespan derived in [19], we could conclude that the estimate in this paper is sharp. Note that the our result of the critical case is completely new even in the classical case $b(t)=1$. We also consider the case of $\beta =1$, and obtain the upper estimate of the lifespan.</description>

      <title>On the stability of the spherically symmetric solution to an inflow problem for an isentropic model of compressible viscous fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07469v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate an inflow problem for the multi-dimensional isentropic compressible Navier-Stokes equations. The fluid under consideration occupies the exterior domain of unit ball, $\Omega=\{x\in\mathbb{R}^n\,\vert\, |x|\ge 1\}$, and a constant stream of mass is flowing into the domain from the boundary $\partial\Omega=\{|x|=1\}$. It is shown in Hashimoto-Matsumura(2021) that if the fluid velocity at the far-field is assumed to be zero, then there exists a unique spherically symmetric stationary solution, denoted as $(\tilde{\rho},\tilde{u})(r)$ with $r\equiv |x|$. In this paper, we show that either $\tilde{\rho}$ is monotone increasing or $\tilde{\rho}$ attains a unique global minimum, and this is classified by the boundary condition of density. In addition, we also derive a set of spatial decay rates for $(\tilde{\rho},\tilde{u})$ which allows us to prove the time-asymptotic stability of $(\tilde{\rho},\tilde{u})$ using the energy method. More specifically, we prove this under small initial perturbation on $(\tilde{\rho},\tilde{u})$, provided that the density at the far-field is supposed to be strictly positive but suitably small, in other words, the far-field state of the fluid is not vacuum but suitably rarefied. The main difficulty for the proof is the boundary terms that appears in the a-priori estimates. We resolve this issue by reformulating the problem in Lagrangian coordinate system.</description>

On one hand, under the optimal structural assumptions we derive $C^{2,\alpha}$-estimate for solutions of the equations on closed Hermitian manifolds. On the other hand, we treat the Dirichlet problem. In both cases, we prove the existence theorems with unbounded condition.</description>

Abstract: We derive global curvature estimates for closed, strictly star-shaped $(n-2)$-convex hypersurfaces in warped product manifolds, which satisfy the prescribed $(n-2)$-curvature equation with a general right-hand side. The proof can be readily adapted to establish curvature estimates for semi-convex solutions to the general $k$-curvature equation. Furthermore, it can also be used to prove the same estimates for $k$-convex solutions to the prescribed curvature measure type equations.</description>

      <title>Higher-order asymptotic profiles of solutions to the Cauchy problem for the convection-diffusion equation with variable diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00896v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the asymptotic behavior of solutions to the convection-diffusion equation: \[ \partial_t u - \mathrm{div}\left(a(x)\nabla u\right) = d\cdot\nabla \left(\left\lvert u\right\rvert ^{q-1}u\right),\ \ x\in\mathbb{R}^n, \ t&gt;0 \] with an integrable initial data $u_{0}(x)$, where $n\ge1$, $q&gt;1+\frac{1}{n}$ and $d\in \mathbb{R}^{n}$. Moreover, we take $a(x)=1+b(x)&gt;0$, where $b(x)$ is smooth and decays fast enough at spatial infinity. It is known that the asymptotic profile of the solution to this problem can be given by the heat kernel. Moreover, some higher-order asymptotic expansions of the solution have already been studied. In particular, the structures of the second asymptotic profiles strongly depend on the nonlinear exponent $q$. More precisely, these profiles have different decay orders in each of the following three cases: $1+\frac{1}{n}&lt;q&lt;1+\frac{2}{n}$; $q=1+\frac{2}{n}$; $q&gt;1+\frac{2}{n}$. In this paper, we focus on the critical case $q=1+\frac{2}{n}$. By analyzing the corresponding integral equation in details, we have succeeded to give the more higher-order asymptotic expansion of the solution, which generalizes the previous works.</description>

To do so, we suitably adapt to this setting the proof of Fefferman for the ball multiplier. As a consequence we answer negatively a question by B\'ekoll\'e and Bonami (Colloq. Math. 68, 1995, 81-100), regarding the continuity from $L^p\to L^q$ of the Cauchy-Szeg\"o projections associated with a class of bounded symmetric domains in $\mathbb{C}^n$ with rank $r\geq2$.</description>

      <title>Time-asymptotic stability of composite waves of degenerate Oleinik shock and rarefaction for non-convex conservation laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06801v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We are concerned with the large-time behavior of the solution to one-dimensional (1D) cubic non-convex scalar viscous conservation laws. Due to the inflection point of the cubic non-convex flux, the solution to the corresponding inviscid Riemann problem can be the composite wave of a degenerate Oleinik shock and a rarefaction wave and these two nonlinear waves are always attached together. We give a first proof of the time-asymptotic stability of this composite wave, up to a time-dependent shift to the viscous Oleinik shock, for the viscous equation. The Oleinik shock wave strength can be arbitrarily large. The main difficulty is due to the incompatibility of the time-asymptotic stability proof framework of individual viscous shock by the so-called anti-derivative method and the direct $L^2$-energy method to rarefaction wave. Here we develop a new type of $a$-contraction method with suitable weight function and the time-dependent shift to the viscous shock, which is motivated by [9,12]. Another difficulty comes from that the Oleinik shock and rarefaction wave are always attached together and their wave interactions are very subtle. Therefore, the same time-dependent shift needs to be equipped to both Oleinik shock and rarefaction wave such that the wave interactions can be treated in our stability proof. Time-asymptotically, this shift function grows strictly sub-linear with respect to the time and then the shifted rarefaction wave is equivalent to the original self-similar rarefaction wave.</description>

      <title>Homogenization of Poisson-Nernst-Planck equations for multiple species in a porous medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08831v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Poisson-Nernst-Planck (PNP) equations form a coupled parabolic-elliptic system, which models the transport of charged particles under the influence of diffusion and electric force. In this paper, we rigorously derive a homogenized model for the PNP equations, for the case of multiple species, defined on a periodic porous medium in spatial dimensions two and three. This extends the previous homogenization results for the PNP equations concerning two species. Here, the main difficulty is that the microscopic concentrations remain uniformly bounded in a space with relatively weak regularity. Therefore, the standard Aubin-Lions-Simon-type compactness results for porous media, which give strong convergence of the microscopic solutions, become inapplicable in our weak setting. We overcome this problem by constructing suitable cut-off functions. The cut-off function, together with the previously known energy functional associated with the system, gives us equicontinuity of the microscopic concentrations on the part of the domain where the values of the concentrations do not exceed the height of the cut-off function. Moreover, it turns out that, on the remaining part of the domain where the concentrations are larger than the height of the cut-off function, the application of the energy functional is enough in order to obtain equicontinuity. These arguments eventually yield strong convergence of the microscopic concentrations in $L^1_t L^r_x$, for some $r&gt;2$, enabling us to pass to the limit in the nonlinear drift term. Finally, we derive the homogenized equations by means of two-scale convergence in $L^p_t L^q_x$ setting.</description>

Abstract: We obtain asymptotically sharp identification of fractional Sobolev spaces $ W^{s}_{p,q}$, extension spaces $E^{s}_{p,q}$, and Triebel-Lizorkin spaces $\dot{F}^s_{p,q}$. In particular we obtain for $W^{s}_{p,q}$ and $E^{s}_{p,q}$ a stability theory a la Bourgain-Brezis-Mironescu as $s \to 1$, answering a question raised by Brazke--Schikorra--Yung. Part of the results are new even for $p=q$.</description>

      <title>Smooth asymptotics for collapsing Calabi-Yau metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.03978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2102.03978v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that Calabi-Yau metrics on compact Calabi-Yau manifolds whose Kahler classes shrink the fibers of a holomorphic fibration have a priori estimates of all orders away from the singular fibers. To this end we prove an asymptotic expansion of these metrics in terms of powers of the fiber diameter, with k-th order remainders that satisfy uniform C^k-estimates with respect to a collapsing family of background metrics. The constants in these estimates are uniform not only in the sense that they are independent of the fiber diameter, but also in the sense that they only depend on the constant in the estimate for k=0 known from previous work of the second-named author. For k&gt;0 the new estimates are proved by blowup and contradiction, and each additional term of the expansion arises as the obstruction to proving a uniform bound on one additional derivative of the remainder.</description>

      <title>Inertial Momentum Dissipation for Viscosity Solutions of Euler Equations: External Flow Around a Smooth Body</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.05325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.05325v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the local balance of momentum for weak solutions of incompressible Euler equations obtained from the zero-viscosity limit in the presence of solid boundaries, taking as an example flow around a finite, smooth body. We show that both viscous skin friction and wall pressure exist in the inviscid limit as distributions on the body surface. We define a nonlinear spatial flux of momentum toward the wall for the Euler solution, and show that wall friction and pressure are obtained from this momentum flux in the limit of vanishing distance to the wall, for the wall-parallel and wall-normal components, respectively. We show furthermore that the skin friction describing anomalous momentum transfer to the wall will vanish if velocity and pressure are bounded in a neighborhood of the wall and if also the essential supremum of wall-normal velocity within a small distance of the wall vanishes with this distance (a precise form of the vanishing wall-normal velocity condition). In the latter case, all of the limiting drag arises from pressure forces acting on the body and the pressure at the body surface can be obtained as the limit approaching the wall of the interior pressure for the Euler solution. As one application of this result, we show that Lighthill's theory of vorticity generation at the wall is valid for the Euler solutions obtained in the inviscid limit. Further, in a companion work, we show that the Josephson-Anderson relation for the drag, recently derived for strong Navier-Stokes solutions, is valid for weak Euler solutions obtained in their inviscid limit.</description>

      <title>A top-down approach to algebraic renormalization in regularity structures based on multi-indices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.03036v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide an algebraic framework to describe renormalization in regularity structures based on multi-indices for a large class of semi-linear stochastic PDEs. This framework is ``top-down", in the sense that we postulate the form of the counterterm and use the renormalized equation to build a canonical smooth model for it. The core of the construction is a generalization of the Hopf algebra of derivations in [LOT23], which is extended beyond the structure group to describe the model equation via an exponential map: This allows to implement a renormalization procedure which resembles the preparation map approach in our context.</description>

      <title>Fully discretized Sobolev gradient flow for the Gross-Pitaevskii eigenvalue problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06028v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the numerical approximation of the ground state of the Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) eigenvalue problem with a fully discretized Sobolev gradient flow induced by the $H^1$ norm. For the spatial discretization, we consider the finite element method with quadrature using $P^k$ basis on a simplicial mesh and $Q^k$ basis on a rectangular mesh. We prove the global convergence to a critical point of the discrete GP energy, and establish a local exponential convergence to the ground state under the assumption that the linearized discrete Schr\"odinger operator has a positive spectral gap. We also show that for the $P^1$ finite element discretization with quadrature on an unstructured shape regular simplicial mesh, the eigengap satisfies a mesh-independent lower bound, which implies a mesh-independent local convergence rate for the proposed discrete gradient flow. Numerical experiments with discretization by high order $Q^k$ spectral element methods in two and three dimensions are provided to validate the efficiency of the proposed method.</description>
