      <title>Combined machine learning for stock selection strategy based on dynamic weighting methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel stock selection strategy framework based on combined machine learning algorithms. Two types of weighting methods for three representative machine learning algorithms are developed to predict the returns of the stock selection strategy. One is static weighting based on model evaluation metrics, the other is dynamic weighting based on Information Coefficients (IC). Using CSI 300 index data, we empirically evaluate the strategy' s backtested performance and model predictive accuracy. The main results are as follows: (1) The strategy by combined machine learning algorithms significantly outperforms single-model approaches in backtested returns. (2) IC-based weighting (particularly IC_Mean) demonstrates greater competitiveness than evaluation-metric-based weighting in both backtested returns and predictive performance. (3) Factor screening substantially enhances the performance of combined machine learning strategies.</description>

      <title>MCI-GRU: Stock Prediction Model Based on Multi-Head Cross-Attention and Improved GRU</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20679v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As financial markets grow increasingly complex in the big data era, accurate stock prediction has become more critical. Traditional time series models, such as GRUs, have been widely used but often struggle to capture the intricate nonlinear dynamics of markets, particularly in the flexible selection and effective utilization of key historical information. Recently, methods like Graph Neural Networks and Reinforcement Learning have shown promise in stock prediction but require high data quality and quantity, and they tend to exhibit instability when dealing with data sparsity and noise. Moreover, the training and inference processes for these models are typically complex and computationally expensive, limiting their broad deployment in practical applications. Existing approaches also generally struggle to capture unobservable latent market states effectively, such as market sentiment and expectations, microstructural factors, and participant behavior patterns, leading to an inadequate understanding of market dynamics and subsequently impact prediction accuracy. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a stock prediction model, MCI-GRU, based on a multi-head cross-attention mechanism and an improved GRU. First, we enhance the GRU model by replacing the reset gate with an attention mechanism, thereby increasing the model's flexibility in selecting and utilizing historical information. Second, we design a multi-head cross-attention mechanism for learning unobservable latent market state representations, which are further enriched through interactions with both temporal features and cross-sectional features. Finally, extensive experiments on four main stock markets show that the proposed method outperforms SOTA techniques across multiple metrics. Additionally, its successful application in real-world fund management operations confirms its effectiveness and practicality.</description>
