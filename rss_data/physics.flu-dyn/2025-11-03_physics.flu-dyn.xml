      <title>Erosion induced by a disk translating toward or away from a granular bed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unsteady flows generated when a body approaches or departs from a granular bed arise in swimming, burrowing, and maneuvering devices. Yet, the threshold for grain motion in such transients remains poorly modeled due to the complexity of the flow. In this study, we report laboratory measurements of the onset of erosion when a rigid circular disk is subjected to a single vertical stroke through quiescent water above a granular bed. The stroke length and travel time were varied independently to determine the critical velocity at which the granular bed is eroded for different minimum distances from the bed. Two erosion mechanisms are observed for disk motion towards the bed: during the stroke, the outward squeezing flow erodes grains near the edge, while after stoppage, the starting vortex or associated secondary vortices impinge on the surface. For motion away from the bed, only the early interaction between the inward suction flow and the nascent vortex entrains grains. The resulting dimensionless thresholds clarify the respective roles of radial flows and vortices in transient, impulsively driven erosion.</description>

      <title>Modeling the wall-slip in large eddy simulations with immersed boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a framework for Large Eddy Simulations (LES) with Immersed Boundaries (IBs) to simulate high Reynolds number flows over complex walls. In this approach, which we call Immersed Boundary-Modeled LES (IBMLES), we volume-filter the Navier-Stokes equations to derive the IB bodyforce. This also gives rise to the subfilter stress (SFS) and residual viscous stress tensors, the latter of which is closed, and we expect the SFS can be closed with existing models. We show that the IB bodyforce can be closed by modeling the wall-slip velocity and provide two such models. The first is an algebraic model based on volume filtering the Van-Driest velocity profile, and the second is a slip-length model. We perform an a priori analysis by volume-filtering direct numerical simulation (DNS) data of turbulent channel flow at $\mathrm{Re}_{\tau}=5200$ to inform these models and investigate the behavior of the other terms in this formulation. We find streamwise wall-slip velocity is significant and both models show good agreement with volume-filtered DNS data on average. Slip velocity is non-uniform and retains a signature of inner or large scale flow structures depending on filter size. SFS terms are analogous to those in traditional LES and can likely be modeled with existing SFS models such Dynamic-Smagorinsky. Residual viscous stress is significant, so it must be considered in IBMLES. We perform filtering with multiple filter types and find there is little sensitivity to the choice of filter kernel so long as it abides by the assumptions given in this framework.</description>

      <title>Boundary Layer Transition as Succession of Temporal and Spatial Symmetry Breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that both temporal and spatial symmetry breaking in canonical K-type transition arise as organized hydrodynamic structures rather than stochastic fluctuations. Before the skin-friction maximum, the flow is fully described by a periodic, spanwise symmetric, harmonic response to the Tollmien-Schlichting wave, forming a spatially compact coherent structure that produces hairpin packets. This fundamental harmonic response may visually resemble turbulence, but remains fully periodic and delimits the exact extent of the deterministic regime. A distinct regime change occurs after this point; a hierarchy of new (quasi-)periodic and aperiodic space-time structures emerges, followed shortly by anti-symmetric structures that develop similarly despite no anti-symmetric inputs, marking the onset of aperiodicity and spanwise asymmetry. We identify these structures as symmetry-decomposed spectral and space-time proper orthogonal modes that resolve the full progression from deterministic to broadband dynamics. The key insight is that laminar-turbulent transition can be viewed as a sequence of symmetry breaking events, each driven by energetically dominant, space-time coherent modes that gradually turn an initially harmonic flow into broadband turbulence.</description>

      <title>Comparing the magnetic Rayleigh-Taylor instability dynamics in two- and three-dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magnetic Rayleigh-Taylor instability (MRTI) governs plasma mixing and transport in a wide range of astrophysical and laboratory systems. Owing to computational constraints, MRTI is often studied using two-dimensional (2D) simulations, but the extent to which 2D captures the true three-dimensional (3D) dynamics remains unclear. In this work, we perform direct numerical simulations of non-ideal, incompressible MRTI in both 2D and 3D, systematically varying the magnetic field strength from weakly to strongly magnetized regimes. We find that the 3D system exhibits richer mode interactions due to the coexistence of interchange, undular, and mixed modes structures that are inherently absent in 2D. The mixing layer in 3D has enhanced small-scale mixing and reduced fluid dispersion compared to 2D, which is characterized by large-scale plumes. Energy diagnostics reveal that the gravitational potential energy released is higher in 2D, primarily because of inefficient mixing and significant fluid dispersion. In contrast, 3D systems display greater energy dissipation and anisotropy, driven by small-scale vortical motions. The non-linear growth of the instability increases monotonically with magnetic field strength in 3D but shows a non-monotonic trend in 2D. Despite these broad differences, the rate of magnetic-to-kinetic energy conversion remains remarkably similar across dimensions, indicating that 2D simulations can meaningfully capture reconnection-driven processes but not the full turbulent evolution. Overall, our results demonstrate that 2D MRTI simulations cannot reliably represent 3D mixing, energy dynamics, or nonlinear growth, highlighting the fundamental importance of three-dimensionality in magnetized plasma instabilities.</description>

      <title>Sound generated by the interaction between shock and instability waves in supersonic round jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop an analytical model to investigate the sound generated by the shock-instability interactions (SII) in supersonic round jets, extending our previous two-dimensional planar study to circular configurations. The jet is represented by a vortex sheet, with its motion modeled by the Euler equations. Shock and instability waves are modeled using Pack's approach and the linear stability theory, respectively, while their interaction is calculated by solving an inhomogeneous wave equation. Using the Fourier transform and steepest descent method, we obtain a closed-form solution for the resulting acoustic field. Results due to the interaction between the instability waves and one interaction cell capture the key directivity features of screech reported in experiments and numerical simulations, indicating that the classic monopole assumption may be inadequate. In particular, the screech-tone intensity due to multiple shock cells decays rapidly as the observer angle approaches 180 degrees, which is in better agreement with the experimental data measured by Norum. We further analyze how the instability wave growth rate influences these directivity patterns and examine the sound generation efficiency of the broadband shock-associated noise. Finally, an examination of near-field pressure fluctuations due to the SII reveals that noise is produced primarily via the Mach wave radiation mechanism.</description>

      <title>Rotating thermal counterflow of He II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Horizontally ($\Omega \perp \mathbf{v}_{\rm{ns}}$) and axially ($\Omega \parallel \mathbf{v}_{\rm{ns}}$) rotating counterflow of superfluid $^4$He (He~II) generated thermally in a square channel is studied using the second sound attenuation technique, detecting statistically steady state and temporal decay of the density of quantized vortex lines $L(t,\Omega)$. The array of rectilinear quantized vortices created by rotation at angular velocity $\Omega$ strongly affects the transient regimes of quantum turbulence characterized by counterflow velocity $\mathbf{v}_{\rm{ns}}$, differently in both geometries. Two effects are observed, acting against each other and affecting the late temporal decay $L(t,\Omega)$. The first is gradual decrease of the decay exponent $\mu$ of the power law $L(t,\Omega) \propto t^{-\mu}$, associated with the fact that under rotation thermal counterflow acquires two-dimensional features, clearly observed in the $\Omega \parallel \mathbf{v}_{\rm{ns}}$ geometry. It exists in the $\Omega \perp \mathbf{v}_{\rm{ns}}$ geometry as well, however, it is screened here by the influence of the effective Ekman layer built within the effective Ekman time $T_{\rm{Ek}}^{\rm{eff}}=H (\nu_{\rm{eff}} \Omega)^{-1/2}$ of order seconds, where $H$ is the characteristic size of the turbulent system along $\mathbf \Omega$ and $\nu_{\rm{eff}}$ is the effective kinematic viscosity of turbulent He~II. For faster rotation rates $L(t,\Omega)$ gradually ceases to display a clear power law. Instead, rounded and ever steeper decays occur, gradually shifted toward shorter and shorter times, significantly shortening the time range for a possible self-similar decay of vortex line density. This effect is not observed in $\Omega \parallel \mathbf{v}_{\rm{ns}}$ geometry, as here the much longer $T_{\rm{Ek}}^{\rm{eff}}$ of order minutes cannot affect the observed $L(t,\Omega)$ decay appreciably.</description>

      <title>Influence of the Control Temperature of Park's Two-temperature Model on the Mars Pathfinder Reactive Hypersonic Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerical simulations of reactive hypersonic flow under thermodynamic and chemical non-equilibrium conditions are presented for the Mars Pathfinder capsule. An 8-species chemical model is employed to simulate Mars' atmosphere. Park's two-temperature model is used to account for the thermal non-equilibrium phenomena. The present work analyzes the impact of different values of the weight factors used in Park's model, aiming to broaden the understanding of the weight factors influence. The code used to simulate the flows solves the Navier-Stokes equations modified to account for reacting gas mixtures. The findings are depicted in terms of the Mach number and temperature modes along the stagnation streamline in a region close to the shock wave. The present analysis also includes results regarding the stagnation point convective heat flux. The results indicate that varying the weight factors yields negligible differences in the shock wave position and stagnation point convective heat flux. The changes in the weight factors cause variations in the maximum temperature mode values in the non-equilibrium region. The results presented are in good agreement with experimental data present in the literature. The present work indicates that Park's two-temperature model weight factors can substantially affect the temperature mode distributions in the flow non-equilibrium region.</description>

      <title>Optical Micromanipulations based on Model Predictive Control of Thermoviscous Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-precision micromanipulation techniques, including optical tweezers and hydrodynamic trapping, have garnered wide-spread interest. Recent advances in optofluidic multiplexed assembly and microrobotics demonstrate significant progress, particularly by iteratively applying laser-induced, localized flow fields to manipulate microparticles in viscous solutions. However, these approaches still face challenges such as undesired hydrodynamic coupling and instabilities when multiple particles are brought into close proximity. By leveraging an analytical model of thermoviscous flows, this work introduces a stochastic optimization approach that selects flow fields for precise particle arrangement without relying on rule-based heuristics. Through minimizing a comprehensive objective function, the method achieves sub-micrometer alignment accuracy even in a crowded setting, avoiding instabilities driven by undesired coupling or particle collisions. An autonomously emerging "action at a distance" strategy - placing the laser scan path farther from the manipulated particles over time - exploits the $1/r^2$ decay of thermoviscous flow to refine positioning. Overall, objective function-based model predictive control enhances the versatility of automated optofluidic manipulations, opening new avenues in assembly, micromanufacturing, robotics, and life sciences.</description>

      <title>Water entry of small disks, cones, or anything</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The water entry of solid and liquid bodies has been studied for over a century, and various researchers have classified the different behaviors that occur when the gas-filled cavity collapses. Although four main cavity collapse regimes have been described and classified for the water entry of small, dense, hydrophobic spheres, only some of these regimes have previously been seen for other impactors, and the scaling used for spheres is not universal across all impactor types. In this paper, we create a unifying scaling to predict cavity collapse regimes, pinch-off time, and pinch-off depth using modified definitions of the Bond, Weber, and Froude numbers for various impactor types. The scaling is based on the downward cavity velocity and an effective diameter, which considers the drag coefficient of the impactor. The impactors we tested include dense solid spheres, disks, and cones, as well as continuous liquid jets and droplet streams. Data for all of these impactor types and behaviors are plotted together with good collapse. Our results indicate that the hydrodynamic characteristics of the impactor, not simply its geometry, govern the global behavior of the cavity.</description>

      <title>Force Characterization of Insect-Scale Aquatic Propulsion Based on Fluid-Structure Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present force characterizations of two newly developed insect-scale propulsors--one single-tailed and one double-tailed--for microrobotic swimmers that leverage fluid-structure interaction (FSI) to generate thrust. The designs of these two devices were inspired by anguilliform swimming and are driven by soft tails excited by high-work-density (HWD) actuators powered by shape-memory alloy (SMA) wires. While these propulsors have been demonstrated to be suitable for microrobotic aquatic locomotion and controllable with simple architectures for trajectory tracking in the two-dimensional (2D) space, the characteristics and magnitudes of the associated forces have not been studied systematically. In the research presented here, we adopted a theoretical framework based on the notion of reactive forces and obtained experimental data for characterization using a custom-built micro-N-resolution force sensor. We measured maximum and cycle-averaged force values with multi-test means of respectively 0.45 mN and 2.97 micro-N, for the tested single-tail propulsor. For the dual-tail propulsor, we measured maximum and cycle-averaged force values with multi-test means of 0.61 mN and 22.6 micro-N, respectively. These results represent the first measurements of the instantaneous thrust generated by insect-scale propulsors of this type and provide insights into FSI for efficient microrobotic propulsion.</description>

      <title>Spatial organization of biomass controls intrinsic permeability of porous systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biofilms in porous media critically influence hydraulic properties in environmental and engineered systems. However, a mechanistic understanding of how microbial life controls permeability remains elusive. By combining microfluidics, controlled pressure gradient and time-lapse microscopy, we quantify how motile and non-motile bacteria colonize a porous landscape and alter its resistance to flow. We find that while both strains achieve nearly identical total biomass, they cause drastically different permeability reductions - 78% for motile cells versus 94% for non-motile cells. This divergence stems from motility, which limits biomass spatial accumulation, whereas non-motile cells clog the entire system. We develop a mechanistic model that accurately predicts permeability dynamics from the pore-scale biomass distribution. We conclude that the spatial organization of biomass, not its total amount, is the primary factor controlling permeability.</description>

      <title>Linear inviscid damping for stably stratified Boussinesq flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27278v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the linear asymptotic stability of stably stratified monotone shear flows for the Boussinesq equations in the periodic channel. By means of the limiting absorption principle, we obtain a precise description of the inviscid damping experienced by the perturbed velocity field and density, with time-decay rates that depend on the local Richardson number $\mathcal{J}(y)$ and split into four stratification regimes (non-stratified, weak, mild, and strong) reflecting qualitative changes in the structure of the Green's function at the critical thresholds $\mathcal{J}(y)=0$ and $\mathcal{J}(y) = \frac14$. The velocity and density decay estimates are later used to prove quantitative sub-linear growth of the vorticity and gradient of density. As a byproduct of our analysis, we show that, under mild hypotheses on the underlying shear-type equilibrium, the spectrum of the linearised Boussinesq operator is purely continuous.</description>

      <title>The Rayleigh-Taylor instability with foams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyse the behaviour of the Rayleigh-Taylor instability (RTI) in the presence of a foam. Such a problem may be relevant, for example, to some inertial confinement fusion (ICF) scenarios such as foams within the capsule or lining the inner hohlraum wall. The foam displays 3 different phases: by order of increasing stress, it is first elastic, then plastic, and then fractures. Only the elastic and plastic phases can be subject to a linear analysis of the instability. The growth rate is analytically computed in these 2 phases, in terms of the micro-structure of the foam. In the first, elastic, phase, the RTI can be stabilized for some wavelengths. In this elastic phase, a homogenous foam model overestimates the growth because it ignores the elastic nature of the foam. Although this result is derived for a simplified foam model, it is likely valid for most of them. Besides the ICF context considered here, our results could be relevant for many fields of science.</description>

Abstract: Droplet deformations caused by substrate vibrations are ubiquitous in nature and highly relevant for applications such as microreactors and single-cell sorting. The vibrations can induce droplet oscillations, a fundamental process that requires an in-depth understanding. Here, we report on extensive many-body dissipative particle dynamics simulations carried out to study the oscillations of droplets of different liquids on horizontally vibrating substrates, covering a wide range of vibration frequencies and amplitudes as well as substrate wettability. We categorize the phases observed for different parameter sets based on the capillary number and identify the transitions between the observed oscillation phases, which are characterized by means of suitable parameters, such as the angular momentum and vorticity of the droplet. The instability growth rate for oscillation phase II, which leads to highly asymmetric oscillations and eventual droplet breakup, is also determined. Finally, we characterize the state of the droplet for the various scenarios by means of the particle-particle and particle-substrate contacts. We find a steady-state scenario for phase I, metastable breathing modes for phase II, and an out-of-equilibrium state for phase III. Thus, we anticipate that this study provides much needed insights into a fundamental phenomenon in nature with significant relevance for applications.</description>

      <title>TrajectoryFlowNet: Lagrangian-Eulerian learning of flow field and trajectories</title>

Abstract: Predicting particle transport in complex flows is traditionally achieved by solving the Navier-Stokes equations. While various numerical and experimental methods exist, they typically require deep physical insights and incur high computational costs. Machine learning offers an alternative by learning predictive patterns directly from data, avoiding explicit physical modeling. However, purely data-driven approaches often lack interpretability, physical consistency, and generalizability in sparse data regimes. To this end, we propose TrajectoryFlowNet, a Lagrangian-Eulerian physics-informed neural network architecture, for fluid flow velocimetry and imaging via learning to predict spatiotemporal flow fields and long-range particle trajectories. The salient features of our model include its ability to handle complex flow patterns with irregular boundaries, predict the full-field flows, image the long-range flow trajectory of any arbitrary particle, and ensure physical consistency in predictions based only on very scarce measurement of flow trajectories. We validate TrajectoryFlowNet via both numerical examples (e.g., lid-driven cavity flow and complex cylinder flow) and experimental test cases (e.g., aortic and ventricle blood flows) across diverse flow scenarios. The results demonstrate our model's effectiveness in capturing intricate particle-laden flow dynamics, enabling long-range tracking of particles and accurate construction of flow fields in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>A robust intermittency equation formulation for transition modeling in Spalart-Allmaras simulations of airfoil flows across a wide range of Reynolds numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02547v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a new robust formulation for local correlation-based laminar-to-turbulent transition models. This mechanism is incorporated into Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations, coupled with the Spalart-Allmaras (SA) turbulence model, considering both $\gamma$ and $\gamma$-${\widetilde{\mathrm{Re}}_{\theta,t}}$ transition frameworks. In this context, special attention is placed on numerical stabilization of the $\gamma$ transport equation, which is identified as the root cause of instabilities observed in both $\gamma$ and $\gamma$-${\widetilde{\mathrm{Re}}_{\theta,t}}$ based models. To this end, the intermittency equation is reformulated in logarithmic form and further stabilized through an energy--based limiting to bound excessively high positive values. In order to suppress unphysical pressure oscillations in the transition region, a gradient-driven artificial viscosity is also introduced. Additionally, the SA equation is augmented with strain-rate modulated production and rotation correction terms. The presented approach has demonstrated consistent effectiveness and robustness in the simulation of flow fields around airfoils over a wide range of Reynolds numbers, making it suitable for practical aerodynamic design applications.</description>

      <title>Mean velocity profiles and total shear stress profiles in adverse-pressure-gradient turbulent boundary layers considering history effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07663v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study focuses on developing a predictive model for mean velocity profiles and total shear stress profiles in turbulent boundary layers subjected to adverse pressure gradients, especially with history effects. A new scaling using friction velocity modified by Clauser pressure gradient parameter is introduced to restore streamwise self-similarity. Furthermore, an estimation-correction model is developed, explicitly incorporating a streamwise derivative of pressure gradient, which effectively captures history effect beyond the reach of Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations. With the help of the model, the total shear stress is decomposed into four parts, representing respectively the Reynolds number effects, equilibrium pressure gradient effects, the coupling between free-stream velocity and pressure gradient, and local non-equilibrium pressure gradient effects. The latter two are considered first-order history effects, and can account for up to approximately half of the total stress. Validation against multiple DNS/LES datasets across a wide range of pressure gradients and Reynolds numbers demonstrates the model's accuracy in predicting both mean velocity profiles and total shear stress profiles.</description>

      <title>Diffusioosmotic corner flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18233v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study flows generated within a two-dimensional corner by the chemical activity of the confining boundaries. Catalytic reactions at the surfaces induce diffusioosmotic motion of the viscous fluid throughout the domain. The presence of chemically active sectors can give rise to steady eddies reminiscent of classical Moffatt vortices, which are mechanically induced in similar confined geometries. In our approach, an exact analytical solution of the diffusion problem in a wedge geometry is derived and coupled to the diffusioosmotic slip-velocity formulation, yielding the stream function of associated Stokes flow. In selected limiting cases, simple closed-form expressions provide clear physical insight into the underlying mechanisms. Our results open new perspectives for the design of microscale mixing strategies in dead-end pores and cornered microfluidic channels, and offer benchmarks for numerical simulations of confined (diffusio)osmotic systems.</description>

      <title>Turbulent wind thrust control to reduce pitch motion of floating wind platforms with improved rotor operation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11707v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For the dynamic analysis of floating offshore wind turbines (FOWTs) in realistic operating environment, this paper develops a coupled aero-hydro-mooring-servo model applicable to turbulent wind and irregular sea states with high computational efficiency. A modified rotor control strategy with platform motion feedback is proposed with a novel gain-scheduling technique to mitigate the negative damping effect on platform motions and decouple the rotor dynamics from the platform dynamics for better rotor operating performance. Firstly, the performance for the bottom-fixed wind turbine in steady uniform wind is validated and the turbulent wind tests show that using the rotor-disk-averaged wind speed for control is beneficial for reducing fluctuations of wind thrust and operational parameters compared with using the hub-height wind speed. For the FOWT, the negative damping phenomenon at above-rated wind speeds when using the baseline control is demonstrated through a range of wind and wave scenarios, and effects of control strategy and turbulent wind are investigated. The results indicate that the modified control strategy eliminates the negative damping effect on the platform pitch while maintaining small variations in rotor speed. Though the control including the blade pitch compensation from platform motion feedback with a constant gain can also eliminate the negative damping effect, it produces much larger fluctuations in rotor speed and causes larger overspeed exceeding the safety threshold of 20% at large wind speeds. Compared to steady wind, turbulent wind yields significantly larger low-frequency platform responses and increases the maximum rotor speed by 7.9% to 23.7% for the wind speeds considered.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear space-time model reduction in the frequency domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13531v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a space-time reduced-order model (ROM) for nonlinear dynamical systems, building upon previous work on linear systems. Whereas most ROMs are space-only in that they reduce only the spatial dimension of the state, the proposed method leverages an efficient encoding of the entire trajectory of the state on the time interval $[0,T]$, enabling significant additional reduction. Trajectories are encoded using SPOD modes, a spatial basis at each temporal frequency tailored to the structures that appear at that frequency. These modes have a number of properties that make them an ideal choice for space-time model reduction, including separability and near-optimality for long trajectories. We derive a system of algebraic equations involving the SPOD coefficients, forcing, and initial condition by projecting an implicit solution of the governing equations onto the set of SPOD modes in a space-time inner product. We therefore refer to the method as spectral solution operator projection (SSOP). The online phase of SSOP comprises solving this system for the SPOD coefficients, given the initial condition and forcing. We find that SSOP gives two orders of magnitude lower error than POD-Galerkin projection at the same number of modes and CPU time across a suite of tests, including ones that use out-of-sample forcings and affine parameter variation. In fact, the method is substantially more accurate even than the projection of the solution onto the POD modes, which is a lower bound for the error of any method based on a linear space-only encoding of the state.</description>

      <title>A data free neural operator enabling fast inference of 2D and 3D Navier Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23936v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ensemble simulations of high-dimensional flow models (e.g., Navier Stokes type PDEs) are computationally prohibitive for real time applications. Neural operators enable fast inference but are limited by costly data requirements and poor generalization to 3D flows. We present a data-free operator network for the Navier Stokes equations that eliminates the need for paired solution data and enables robust, real time inference for large ensemble forecasting. The physics-grounded architecture takes initial and boundary conditions as well as forcing functions, yielding solutions robust to high variability and perturbations. Across 2D benchmarks and 3D test cases, the method surpasses prior neural operators in accuracy and, for ensembles, achieves greater efficiency than conventional numerical solvers. Notably, it delivers accurate solutions of the three dimensional Navier Stokes equations, a regime not previously demonstrated for data free neural operators. By uniting a numerically grounded architecture with the scalability of machine learning, this approach establishes a practical pathway toward data free, high fidelity PDE surrogates for end to end scientific simulation and prediction.</description>
