      <title>All-passive upconversion imaging of incoherent near-infrared light at intensities down to 50 nW/cm$^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Frequency upconversion, which converts low-energy photons into higher-energy ones, typically requires intense coherent illumination to drive nonlinear processes or the use of externally driven optoelectronic devices. Here, we demonstrate a high-resolution upconversion imaging system that converts low-intensity (down to 50 nW/cm$^2$) incoherent near-infrared (NIR) light into the visible, reaching intensities perceptible by the human eye, without the use of any external power input. Our upconverting element is enabled by the following ingredients: (1) photon upconversion via triplet-triplet annihilation in a bulk heterojunction of the organic semiconductors Y6 and rubrene; (2) plasmonic enhancement of absorption and field intensity in the heterojunction layer; (3) collection enhancement using a dichroic thin-film assembly. The upconverting element is inserted at an intermediate image plane of a dual-wavelength telescope system, which preserves the relative directionality of rays between the incident NIR light and output visible light. Our all-passive upconversion imaging system will enable NIR imaging and sensing in low-light environments under energy constraints.</description>

      <title>Responsivity and Stability of Nonlinear Exceptional Point Lasers with Saturable Gain and Loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The responsivity of perturbation sensing can be effectively enhanced by using higher-order exceptional points (HOEPs) due to their nonlinear response to frequency perturbations. However, experimental realization can be difficult due to the stringent parameter conditions associated with these points. In this work, we study an EP laser composed of two coupled nonlinear resonators that uses nonlinearity to simplify these tuning requirements. This system demonstrates a distinct cube-root response in the steady-state lasing frequency, with a constant of proportionality that depends on the distribution of linear and saturable gain and loss. This design freedom enables several orders of magnitude higher responsivity than systems with a single nonlinear resonator, which have been previously explored. Maximizing responsivity also improves the robustness of sensing performance against parametric errors. These features are derived from coupled mode theory and further supported by steady-state ab initio laser theory (SALT) results at several nonlinear EPs. Through linear stability analysis, we also identify regions of instability within the class-A regime that arise due to mode competition, which can be induced by asymmetric passive losses. In the class-B regime, we show that the interplay between gain dynamics and detuning can lead to restabilization at slow relaxation rates or higher inter-resonator coupling rates. This regime could be used to increase the maximum achievable responsivity of the system.</description>

      <title>Dual-functional microwave photonic system for concurrent radar and secure communication via radar signal masking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrating functions such as radar and communication into a single system is of great significance for the miniaturization and functional integration of future electronic warfare and 6G systems. Here, we show a dual-functional microwave photonic system for concurrent radar and secure communication. The scheme utilizes microwave photonic frequency multiplying and frequency conversion techniques to shift both the intermediate frequency radar and communication signals to the same frequency band, enabling radar and communication operations at the same time and frequency. The high-power radar signal is also used to mask the communication signal, increasing the difficulty of signal interception and thus enhancing security. By employing de-chirping at the radar receiver and self-interference cancelation at the communication receiver, the radar function can be implemented and the communication signal can also be correctly demodulated after removing the radar masking. An experiment is performed. A 0.3-GHz bandwidth linearly frequency-modulated signal is quadrupled and superimposed with two up-converted 0.5-Gbaud orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing signals. A communication data rate of 2 Gbit/s, a radar ranging measurement error of less than $\pm$ 0.3 cm, and a radar inverse synthetic aperture radar imaging resolution of 12.5$\times$10.2 cm are achieved.</description>

      <title>Second harmonic generation with 48% conversion efficiency from cavity polygon modes in a monocrystalline lithium niobate microdisk resonator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) based optical microresonators offer large nonlinear coefficient d_33 and high light-wave confinement, allowing highly efficient second-order optical nonlinear frequency conversion. Here, we achieved ultra-efficiency second harmonic generation (SHG) from high-Q polygon modes by maximizing the utilization of the highest nonlinear coefficient d_33 in a monocrystalline X-cut TFLN microdisk resonator for the first time. The polygon modes are designed and formed with two parallel sides perpendicular to the optical axis of the lithium niobate crystal by introducing weak perturbations into the microdisk of a tapered fiber, which maximizes the utilization of d_33. The polygon modes exhibit ultrahigh intrinsic Q factors of ~3.86X10(7), due to the fact that polygon modes are located far from the relatively rough sidewall of the microdisk. Moreover, the pump and second harmonic polygon modes share high modal overlap factor of ~80%. Consequently, SHG from cavity polygon modes with absolute conversion efficiency as high as 48.08% was realized at an on-chip pump level of only 4.599 mW without fine domain structures, surpassing the best results (23% and 30%) reported in other two domain-inversion-free phase matching schemes and even approaching the record (52%) in PPLN microresonators.</description>

      <title>Tip-Enhanced Sum Frequency Generation for Molecular Vibrational Nanospectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vibrational sum frequency generation (SFG) is a nonlinear spectroscopic technique widely used to study the molecular structure and dynamics of surface systems. However, the spatial resolution achieved by far-field observations is constrained by the diffraction limit, obscuring molecular details in inhomogeneous structures smaller than the wavelength of light. To overcome this limitation, we developed a system for tip-enhanced SFG (TE-SFG) spectroscopy based on a scanning tunneling microscope. We successfully detected vibrational TE-SFG signals from adsorbed molecules on a gold substrate under ambient conditions. The phase analysis of interferometric SFG spectra provided information on molecular orientation. Furthermore, the observed TE-SFG signal was confirmed to originate from a highly localized region within a gap between the tip apex and the sample substrate. This method offers a novel platform for nonlinear optical nanospectroscopy, paving the way for the investigation of surface molecular systems beyond the diffraction limit.</description>

      <title>High-Performance Green and Blue Light-Emitting Diodes Enabled by CdZnSe/ZnS Core/Shell Colloidal Quantum Wells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The unique anisotropic properties of colloidal quantum wells (CQWs) make them highly promising as components in nanocrystal-based devices. However, the limited performance of green and blue light-emitting diodes (LEDs) based on CQWs has impeded their practical applications. In this study, we tailored alloy CdZnSe core CQWs with precise compositions via direct cation exchange (CE) from CdSe CQWs with specific size, shape, and crystal structure and utilized hot-injection shell (HIS) growth to synthesize CdZnSe/ZnS core/shell CQWs exhibiting exceptional optoelectronic characteristics. This approach enabled us to successfully fabricate green and blue LEDs manifesting superior performance compared to previously reported solution-processed CQW-LEDs. Our devices demonstrated a remarkable peak external quantum efficiency (20.4% for green and 10.6% for blue), accompanied by a maximum brightness 347,683 cd m-2 for green and 38,063 cd m-2 for blue. The high-performance represents a significant advancement for nanocrystal-based light-emitting diodes (Nc-LEDs) incorporating anisotropic nanocrystals. This work provides a comprehensive synthesis strategy for enhancing the efficiency of Nc-LEDs utilizing anisotropic nanocrystals.</description>

      <title>Intertwined Fano resonances in sub-wavelength metallic gratings: omnidirectional and wideband optical transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metallic gratings can be used as infrared filters, but their performance is often limited by bandwidth restrictions due to metallic losses. In this work, we propose a metallic groove-slit-groove (GSG) structure that overcomes these limitations by exhibiting a large bandwidth, angularly independent, extraordinary optical transmission. Our design achieves high transmission efficiency in the longwave infrared range, driven by Fano-type resonances created through the interaction between the grooves and the central slit. This mechanism results in a tunable 2 $\mu$m transmission window with high rejection rate. We extend the concept to a two-dimensional GSG array, exhibiting a polarization insensitive 80% transmission window for incident angles up to 50{\deg}, offering significant potential for infrared filtering applications.</description>

      <title>Noncollinear phase-matching of high harmonic generation in solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose and experimentally demonstrate a scheme allowing to reach noncollinear phase-matching of high harmonic generation in solids, which may potentially lead to an enhancement of the generation efficiency. The principle is based on high-order frequency mixing of two light waves with identical frequencies but different directions of wavevectors. In this process, $N$-th harmonic frequency is produced by frequency mixing of $N$+1 photons from a wave with high amplitude of electric field and a single photon from a wave with low field amplitude, which are propagating noncollinearly in an optically isotropic media. We experimentally verify the feasibility of this scheme by demonstrating phase-matched generation of third and fifth harmonic frequency in sapphire.</description>

      <title>Ghost projection via focal-field diffraction catastrophes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ghost projection is the reversed process of computational classical ghost imaging that allows any desired image to be synthesized using a linear combination of illuminating patterns. Typically, physical attenuating masks are used to produce these illuminating patterns. A mask-free alternative form of ghost projection is explored here, where the illuminations are a set of caustic-laden diffraction patterns known as diffraction catastrophes. These are generated by focusing a coherent beam with spatially modulated phase having random Zernike-polynomial aberrations. We demonstrate, via simulation, that a suitable linear combination of such random focal-field intensity patterns can be used as a basis to synthesize arbitrary images. In our proof-of-concept ghost-projection synthesis, the positive weighting coefficients in the decomposition are proportional to exposure times for each focal-field diffraction catastrophe. Potential applications include dynamic on-demand beam shaping of focused fields, aberration correction and lithography.</description>

      <title>Cascaded Raman lasing in a lithium tetraborate (LB4) whispering gallery mode resonator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lithium tetraborate (LB4) is a lithium borate compound and recently has shown renewed interest due to its exceptional linear and nonlinear optical properties. Its wide transparency range, spanning from 0.16$\mu m$ to 3.5$\mu m$, and low loss in the visible range make LB4 highly popular in applications of harmonics generation and deep ultraviolet radiation. Also, LB4 is a good Raman-active material due to its high Raman gain. Here, a millimeter sized LB4 whispering gallery mode resonator (WGMR) is machined using single point diamond cutting, which has, to the best of our knowledge, the highest reported quality ($Q$) factor of $2.0 \times 10^9$ at 517 nm. Then, stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) was investigated in this LB4 WGMR. When pumped with about 7 mW at 517 nm, four cascaded SRS peaks with wavelengths ranging from 537 nm to 608 nm are demonstrated, which can be clearly observed using an optical grating. Among them, the first order SRS is characterized and has a threshold of 0.69 mW with a slope efficiency of 7.2 %. This is the first implementation of a LB4 whispering gallery mode Raman laser, which will facilitate usages of LB4 WGMR as compact Raman lasing source in future.</description>

Abstract: This study examines the behavior and tunability of plasmonic lenses created from arrays of nanoslits, applicable in sub-wavelength optical microscopy and other high-resolution imaging systems. We performed simulations on COMSOL Multiphysics to assess power flow and focal shifts in plasmonic lenses with differing slit designs, refractive indices, and angular distributions. The findings indicate that the confinement can be regulated by adjusting these parameters.</description>

      <title>Monolithic piezoelectrically tunable hybrid integrated laser with sub-fiber laser coherence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultra-low noise lasers are essential tools in a wide variety of applications, including data communication, light detection and ranging (LiDAR), quantum computing and sensing, and optical metrology. Recent advances in integrated photonics, specifically the development of ultra-low loss silicon nitride (Si$_3$N$_4$) platform, have allowed attaining performance that exceeds conventional legacy laser systems, including the phase noise of fiber lasers. This platform can moreover be combined with monolithic integration of piezoelectrical materials, enabling frequency agile low noise lasers. However, this approach has to date not surpassed the trade-off between ultra-low frequency noise and frequency agility. Here we overcome this challenge and demonstrate a fully integrated laser based on the Si$_3$N$_4$ platform with frequency noise lower than that of a fiber laser, while maintaining the capability for high-speed modulation of the laser frequency. The laser achieves an output power of 30 mW with an integrated linewidth of 4.3 kHz and an intrinsic linewidth of 3 Hz, demonstrating phase noise performance that is on par with or lower than commercial fiber lasers. Frequency agility is accomplished via a monolithically integrated piezoelectric aluminum nitride (AlN) micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMS) actuator, which enables a flat frequency actuation bandwidth extending up to 400 kHz. This combination of ultra-low noise and frequency agility is a useful feature enabling tight laser locking for frequency metrology, fiber sensing, and coherent sensing applications. Our results demonstrate the ability of 'next generation' integrated photonic circuits (beyond silicon) to exceed the performance of legacy laser systems in terms of coherence and frequency actuation.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Frequency Fluctuation Super-Resolution Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inherent non-linearity of intensity correlation functions can be used to spatially distinguish identical emitters beyond the diffraction limit, for example, achieved in Super-Resolution Optical Fluctuation Imaging (SOFI). Here, we propose a complementary concept based on spectral correlation functions, termed Spectral Fluctuation Super-Resolution (SFSR) imaging. Through theoretical and computational analysis, we show that spatially resolving time-domain spectral correlation functions using second-order correlation analysis can improve resolution by up to twofold for two emitters. This enhancement is achieved by quantifying the correlated to uncorrelated spectral fluctuations on different time scales at different positions. Experimentally, SFSR can be implemented using a combination of interferometry and photon-correlation measurements. The method works for non-blinking emitters and stochastic spectral fluctuations of arbitrary temporal statistics. This suggests its utility in super-resolution microscopy of quantum emitters at low temperatures, for which spectral diffusion is often more pronounced than emitter blinking.</description>

      <title>Friedrich-Wintgen bound states in the continuum in dimerized dielectric metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bound states in the continuum (BIC) are trapped eigenmodes with infinite $Q$ factors that are confined in the system. In this work, we propose a simple design for engineering a Friedrich-Wintgen BIC through the interference between a symmetry protected BIC and a surface lattice mode in a dimerized dielectric metasurface. The meta-atoms are comprised a symmetric double bar dimer. Using incident angle tuning an avoided crossing between the symmetry protected BIC and surface lattice mode is observed. At a specific detuning, the lower energy resonance vanishes, resulting in the formation of a Friedrich-Wintgen BIC. Investigations using coupled mode theory elucidate the role of the damping rate and coupling strength in the formation of the Friedrich-Wintgen BIC in the dimerized bar metasurface. By tuning the spacing between the two bars, Friedrich-Wintgen BIC can be engineered with controlled energy and damping rate. It is shown that the damping rate of the coupled modes can be considerably suppressed in this system. We envision that these results will not only enhance the understanding of strongly coupled interactions in metasurfaces but also indicate new paths for actively and passively controlling metasurface resonators for photonic applications.</description>

      <title>Achromatic single-layer hologram</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase retrieval is a fundamental technique of advanced optical technologies, enabling precise control over wavefront properties. A persistent challenge in diffractive optical element (DOE) design is that a single hologram typically operates within a single wavelength or color channel, limiting it to monochromatic image generation. This limitation in channel capacity significantly restricts the applicability of DOE in optical applications. In this study, we propose a design strategy for full-color, single-layer hologram based on a variable-scale diffraction model. By imposing strict constraints in Fourier domain and reducing depth of focus (DOF), we achieve the simultaneous encryption and storage of red, green, and blue channel information within a single achromatic hologram. This strategy facilitates color separation in large-depth 3D holography and enables achromatic full-color image displays. We demonstrated full-color holographic video playback at a full refresh rate of 60 Hz, achieving a temporal resolution three times greater than that of existing methods. Furthermore, we successfully fabricated achromatic, twin-image-free, full-color binary pure-phase DOEs at low cost. This achromatic strategy addresses the demands across various fields in optics, including high-refresh-rate full-color displays, high-density optical information storage, advanced optical security, high-reusability holographic metasurface optical element, and high-performance achromatic metalenses.</description>

      <title>Design and fabrication of fiber optic microlenses using an arc fusion splicing system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we introduce a new approach to fabricating fiber optic microlenses using a three-electrode arc fusion splicer. Through beam propagation method-based simulations, we verified the performance of our lenses, achieving highly consistent results across both simulations and experiments. We fabricated three distinctive microlens types: ball-type, fiber tip, and ball-type on a tapered fiber, demonstrating versatility in lens shape and function. By precisely adjusting lens designs, we achieved beam radii between 2.7 um and 23.5 um, with focal lengths spanning from 12 um to 787 um. Our method offers robust control over lens geometry, enabling tailored beam parameters for specific applications. This technique is efficient, cost-effective, and adaptable to various optical fibers, including multimode and polarization-maintaining, highlighting its potential for broader optical and photonic applications.</description>

      <title>Real-time surface plasmon polariton propagation in silver nanowires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electron microscopy techniques such as electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) facilitate the spatio-spectral characterization of plasmonic nanostructures. In this work, a time-dependent perspective is presented, which significantly enhances the utility of EELS. Specifically, silver nanowires offer the material and geometric features for various high-quality plasmonic excitations. This provides an ideal illustrative system for combined experimental-theoretical analyses of the different plasmonic excitations and their real-time dynamics. It is demonstrated how the plasmonic excitations propagating inside the wire repeatedly interact with the swift electrons in an EELS configuration. In addition, the role of azimuthal modes, often overlooked for very thin wires, is observed and analyzed in both the energy-loss spectrum and the dynamical perspective. Such a complete understanding of the interaction of electrons and plasmonic excitation is key for the design of efficient plasmonic sensors, the study of hot electron dynamics in metals, and applications in the context of electron quantum optics, where full control of the spatial and temporal characteristics of the fields at the nanometer and femtosecond scales is highly desirable.</description>

      <title>Highly coherent two-color laser with stability below 3E-17 at 1 second</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-color lasers with high coherence are paramount in precision measurement, accurate light-matter interaction, and low-noise photonic microwave generation. However, conventional two-color lasers often suffer from low coherence, particularly when these two colors face large frequency spacings. Here, harnessing the Pound-Drever-Hall technique, we synchronize two lasers to a shared ultra-stable optical reference cavity to break through the thermal noise constraint, achieving a highly coherent two-color laser. With conquering these non-common mode noises, we demonstrate an exceptional fractional frequency instability of 2.7E-17 at 1 second when normalized to the optical frequency. Characterizing coherence across large frequency spacings poses a significant challenge. To tackle this, we employ electro-optical frequency division to transfer the relative stability of a 0.5 THz spacing two-color laser to a 25 GHz microwave signal. As its performance surpasses the sensitivity of the current apparatus, we establish two independent systems for comparative analyses. The resulting 25 GHz signals exhibit exceptional phase noise of -74 dBc/Hz at 1 Hz and -120 dBc/Hz at 100 Hz, demonstrating the two-color laser's performance approaching the quantum noise limit of its synchronization system. It also sets a new record for the two-point frequency division method in photonic microwave generation. Our achievement in highly coherent two-color lasers and low-noise microwave signals will usher in a new era for precision measurements and refine the accuracy of light-matter and microwave-matter interactions to their next decimal place.</description>

      <title>Normal Mode Splitting and Force Sensing in Cavity Magnomechanical System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the dynamics of system composed of a single cavity consisting of an optical parametric amplifier (OPA) and a YIG sphere influenced by a bias magnetic field. This bias field leads to magnetostrictive effects on magnon modes that induces phonons. We investigate the position fluctuation spectrum and the output field spectrum, finding that at G =0, the system displays a single peak, indicative of weak coupling between the optical and phononic modes. As G increases (e.g., G =0.1 kappa_a, 0.2 kappa_a, 0.4 kappa_a, we observe a transition to double peak, which reflects stronger coupling in the vicinity of cavity along with phonon modes that leads to normal mode splitting (NMS) in cavity magnomechanic system. Furthermore, we examine that the OPA amplifies the Y quadrature while squeezing the X quadrature of the output field spectrum. This sensitive behavior results in a more pronounced splitting in the Y quadrature spectra compared to the X quadrature. Our findings emphasize the essential role of the OPA in adjusting the interaction strength between the optical and phononic modes as well as underscore the importance of quadrature analysis in characterizing the system's response. NMS mechanism open avenues for advanced applications in quantum sensing and information processing, highlighting the potential for tunable devices in emerging quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Open and trapping channels in complex resonant media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a statistical study of the transmission and dwell-time matrices in disordered media composed of resonators, focusing on how frequency detuning influences their eigenvalue distributions. Our analysis reveals that the distribution of transmission eigenvalues undergoes a transition from a monomodal to a bimodal profile, and back to monomodal, as the frequency approaches the resonant frequency of the particles. Moreover, the distribution of dwell-time eigenvalues broadens significantly near resonance, with the longest lifetimes exceeding the median by several orders of magnitude. These results are explained by examining how frequency $\omega$ affects the transport mean free path of light, $\ell(\omega)$, and the energy transport velocity, $v_E(\omega)$, which in turn shape the observed distributions. We demonstrate the strong potential of wavefront shaping to enhance both transmission and energy storage in resonant disordered media. In the diffusive regime, where the system thickness $L$ exceeds the mean free path, both transmission and dwell time can be enhanced by a factor $\varpropto L/\ell(\omega) \gg 1$ when using wavefronts associated with the largest eigenvalues instead of plane waves. In the localized regime, the enhancements become $\varpropto Ne^{2L/\xi}$ for transmission and $\varpropto N\xi /L$ for dwell time, where $\xi$ is the localization length and $N$ is the number of controlled scattering channels. Finally, we show that employing high-$Q$ resonators instead of low-$Q$ ones increases energy storage within the medium by a factor of $\varpropto Q/k\ell(\omega)$, in both the diffusive and localized regimes.</description>

      <title>Emulating time interfaces via smooth temporal transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The introduction of time as a new degree of freedom to control wave-matter interactions have opened new avenues to fully control wave propagation in four dimensions (x,y,z,t). Time interfaces (rapid changes of the constitutive relations of the medium where a wave propagates) have recently become popular as they are the temporal analogue of spatial interfaces. While recent groundbreaking experimental work has demonstrated time interfaces from water waves, microwaves and the optical regime, rapidly changing, for instance, the permittivity of the medium requires carefully engineered structures. Here, we study the possibility of implementing smooth temporal transitions of the refractive index of the medium in order to mimic the response of time interfaces via adiabatic modulations. It is shown that indeed, as long as the signal is inside the structure during the modulation time, there are some values of rising/falling time of the adiabatic modulation that enables a full approximate emulation of a time interface. These results may open further avenues to explore by relaxing the speed at which the time-modulation should be introduced when designing four-dimensional media.</description>

      <title>Efficiency Enhancement of c-Si/TiO$_2$ Heterojunction Thin Film Solar Cell Using Hybrid Metal-Dielectric Nanostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hybrid metal-dielectric nanostructures (HMDN) are promising candidates to address the ohmic loss by conventional nanostructures in photovoltaic applications by strong confinement and high scattering directivity. In this study, we present a c-Si/TiO$_2$ heterojunction thin film solar cell (TFSC) where a pair of triangular HMDN comprised of Ag and AZO was utilized to enhance the longer wavelength light absorption. The presence of the TiO$_2$ inverted pyramid layer, in combination with the ITO and SiO$_2$-based pyramid layers at the front, enhanced the shorter wavelength light absorption by increasing the optical path and facilitating the coupling of incoming light in photonic mode. Consequently, the average absorption by 1000 nm thick photoactive layer reached 83.32 % for AM 1.5G within the wavelength range of 300 - 1100 nm which was investigated by employing the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method. The electric field profile and current density profile demonstrated the respective contributions of each layer in the absorption of light at shorter and longer wavelengths. The structure exhibited a short circuit current density ($J_{sc}$) of 37.96 mA/cm$^2$ and a power conversion efficiency ($PCE$) of 17.42 %. The efficiency of our proposed structure experienced a maximum relative change of 0.34 % when a polarized light was exposed with an angle of 0$^\circ$ to 90$^\circ$. The incorporation of self-heating in non-isothermal conditions reduced $PCE$ by $13.77 \%$. In addition, the comparative analysis to assess the impact of HMDN on our structure revealed a $4.54 \%$ increase in $PCE$ of the structure with metallic nanostructures, paving the way for the utilization of HMDN to enhance the performance of TFSC.</description>

      <title>Efficient short-wave infrared upconversion by self-sensitized holmium-doped nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photon upconversion, combining several low-energy photons to generate one high-energy photon is of wide interest for biomedical, catalytic and photonic applications. Lanthanide-doped nanoparticles (LnNP) are a unique type of upconversion nanoconverter, which can realize ultralarge anti-Stokes shift (&gt;1000 nm) and high photostability, without photo-bleaching and photo-blinking. The excitation wavelength of LnNPs has been limited to the second near-infrared window (1000-1700 nm), mainly sensitized by erbium ions with absorption centered around 1.5 $\mu$m. Here, we demonstrate novel self-sensitized holmium (Ho)-doped nanoconverters to further expand the sensitization range to the short-wave infrared at 2 $\mu$m and achieve efficient upconversion to 640 nm. We show that this upconversion is a 4-photon conversion process with an underlying energy transfer upconversion mechanism. Via careful control of dopant concentration and shelling we achieve a relative upconversion-to-downconversion efficiency up to 15.2%, more than half the theoretical maximum. The placement of the Ho doped LnNPs into a plasmonic nanocavity device enables large gains in emission intensity (up to 32-fold), due to the dramatic shortening of the emission lifetime of Ho from 29 $\mu$s to &lt;1 ns, indicating a high Purcell-enhancement factor of 3x10$^4$. These results open new possibilities at the frontier of short-wave infrared upconversion and the nanoplasmonic enhancement of LnNP emission, with potential applications in detection, theranostics, photonics and optoelectronics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a protocol based on the interplay between superradiance and superabsorption to achieve the coherent deflection of an atomic sample due to the momentum transfer from the atoms to a cavity field. The coherent character of this momentum transfer, causing the atomic sample to deflect as a whole, follows from the collective nature of the atomic superradiant pulse and its superabsorption by the cavity field. The protocol is then used for the construction of positional mesoscopic atomic superpositions.</description>

      <title>Low-profile Aperiodic Metasurfaces for High-efficiency Achromatic Anomalous Reflection over a Wide Bandwidth</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metasurface anomalous reflectors can enhance future wireless communication systems due to their ability to redirect electromagnetic waves and establish metasurface-assisted communication links. However, metasurface reflectors typically suffer from chromatic aberrations with the reflected angle shifting as the frequency varies. Herein, we design achromatic metasurfaces for anomalous reflection by using an integral-equation framework that fully accounts for the frequency dispersion of the individual scatterers (unit cells). Rather than engineering the dispersion of each metasurface cell locally, we harness the emerging near-field interactions (evanescent waves) between the scatterers to realize anomalous reflection at a fixed angle over a wide frequency range. Three anomalous reflectors are designed and experimentally verified at 10GHz, demonstrating high performance metrics compared to traditional achromatic reflectors, while employing simple, low-profile unit cells. The presented results pave an effective way to realize achromatic wave functionalities, such as anomalous reflection, refraction or lensing, over a wide bandwidth with low-profile and highly efficient metasurfaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entanglement often increases quantum measurement schemes' sensitivity. However, we find that in precision measurements with zero-mean Gaussian states, such as squeezed states, entanglement between different paths degrades measurement sensitivity. We prove an inverse relationship between entanglement entropy and sensitivity for measurements of single-mode phase shifts in multimode systems and for phase shifts on both modes in two-mode systems. In the two-mode case, which models devices such as interferometers, we find that entanglement strongly degrades differential phase sensitivity. Finally, we show that minimizing entanglement between paths maximizes the phase sensitivity of $N$-mode systems with zero-mean Gaussian state inputs.</description>

      <title>Axisymmetric model for 1-color laser filament THz emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A 3D axisymmetric model for laser beam propagation in air is proposed for use with THz emission calculations. The model accounts for nonlinear propagation of the femtosecond pulse that generates the filament (Kerr self-focusing and plasma defocusing). The formalism proposed is quite general and can be applied across a broad range of experimental parameters - focal lengths, beam profiles, and intensities. We adapt existing models of 1-color THz emission for use with the beam propagation model to calculate THz emission signatures. Two THz emission models are used, a 1D model and a more detailed 3D axisymmetric model. For the 3D axisymmetric model, simplified current source terms are derived by applying the slowly-varying amplitude envelope approximation. The two models give consistent results for the THz emission signal. For the test case considered, nonlinear propagation dynamics have a large impact on the amplitude of the THz signal, but only a minimal impact on the frequency content and angular distribution of the signal.</description>

      <title>Thermal noise cancellation for optomechanically induced nonreciprocity in a whispering-gallery-mode microresonator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic-free optomechanically induced nonreciprocity may stimulate a wide range of practical applications in quantum technologies. However, how to suppress the thermal noise flow from the mechanical reservoir is still a difficulty encountered in achieving optomechanically nonreciprocal effects on a few- and even single-photon level. Here, we show how to realize thermal noise cancellation by quantum interference for optomechanically induced nonreciprocity in a whispering-gallery-mode (WGM) microresonator. We find that both nonreciprocal transmission and amplification can be achieved in the WGM microresonator when it coupled to two coupled mechanical resonators. More interestingly, the thermal noise can be suppressed when the two coupled mechanical resonators couple to a common thermal reservoir. The thermal noise cancellation is induced by the destructive quantum interference between the two flow paths of the thermal noises from the common reservoir. The scheme of quantum interference induced thermal noise cancellation can be applied in both sideband resolved and unresolved regimes, even with strong backscattering taken into account. Our work provides an effective way to achieve nonreciprocal effects on a few- or single-photon level without precooling the mechanical mode to the ground state.</description>

      <title>Sensing Based on Quantum Correlation of Photons in the Weak Nonlinear Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum correlation of photons based on quantum interference, such as unconventional photon blockade (UPB), has been extensively studied for realizing single-photon sources in weak nonlinear regime. However, how to use this effect for other practical applications is rarely studied. Here, we propose schemes to realize sensitive sensing by the quantum correlation of photons based on quantum interference. We demonstrate that UPB can be observed in the mixing field output from a Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) with two cavities in the two arms based on quantum interference. We show that the second-order correlation function of the output field is sensitive to the parameters of system and propose schemes to realize angular velocity and temperature sensing by measuring the second-order correlation of the photons output from the MZI. We find that the second-order correlation function of the output field is much more sensitive to the parameters of system than the mean photon number, which provides an application scenario for the quantum correlation of photons in sensitive sensing.</description>

      <title>V-band Optoelectronic Oscillator for Earth Observation Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An optoelectronic oscillator (OEO) producing a signal at 45.86 GHz is demonstrated that may potentially be utilized in the local oscillator (LO) generation of Earth observation applications such as the microwave sounding (MWS), microwave imaging (MWI) and ice cloud imaging (ICI) missions of METOP 2 of ESA. Preliminary results show that the performance of this lower SWaP OEO system is comparable or in some respects better than the electrical system already used in the MWS, MWS and MWI missions of ESA. Specifically, a sidemode suppression of about 46 dB, a phase noise of -102 dBc/Hz at 100 kHz offset, and frequency stability of 30 kHz in a ten-minute interval is achieved for the 45.86 GHz signal. The OEO is a promising candidate to replace or supplement the electronic systems of phase locked dielectric resonator oscillator and frequency multipliers used currently in Earth observation.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous two-dimensional velocity and distance measurements based on laser triangulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Laser triangulation sensors are widely used in industry for surface inspection due to simple setup, micron precision and low cost. Conventional laser triangulation methods only enable axial distance measurement limiting further applications, and their lateral resolution is limited by surface microstructure. For overcoming these issues, based on the geometric optics we propose novel theoretical models and methods to achieve lateral velocity measurement. Moreover, a novel axial distance measurement method using edge detection is presented, which can increase the lateral resolution by the order of one magnitude. The performance of the proposed methods are validated through simultaneous orthogonal velocity and distance measurements on a moving established metal specimen, showing the relative error and relative uncertainty can reach 10^{-4}. The versatility of this multi degree of freedom measurement method paves the way for its broad application across all laser triangulation systems. Therefore, this simultaneous two-dimensional velocity and distance sensing approach can propel advancements in dynamic behavior discipline, including but not limited to motion mechanology and fluid mechanics.</description>

      <title>Spatially resolved photon statistics of general nanophotonic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While experimental measurements of photon correlations have become routine in laboratories, theoretical access to these quantities for the light generated in complex nanophotonic devices remains a major challenge. Current methods are limited to specific simplified cases and lack generality. Here we present a novel method that provides access to photon statistics resolved in space and frequency in arbitrary electromagnetic environments. Within the macroscopic QED framework, we develop a practical tool to compute electric field correlations for complex quantum systems by including lossy two-level systems that act as field detectors within the system. To make the implementation feasible, we use a recently developed multi-emitter few-mode quantization method to correctly account for fully retarded light propagation to the detectors. We demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed technique by studying the photon correlations of one and two emitters in close proximity to a plasmonic nanoparticle. The simulations show that even in these relatively simple configurations, the light statistics exhibit a strong angular dependence. These results highlight the importance of going beyond conventional quantum-optical approaches to fully capture the analyzed physical effects and enable the study of the quantum light generation in realistic nanophotonic devices.</description>

      <title>Input-Output Optics as a Causal Time Series Mapping: A Generative Machine Learning Solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The response of many-body quantum systems to an optical pulse can be extremely challenging to model. Here we explore the use of neural networks, both traditional and generative, to learn and thus simulate the response of such a system from data. The quantum system can be viewed as performing a complex mapping from an input time-series (the optical pulse) to an output time-series (the systems response) which is often also an optical pulse. Using both the transverse and non-integrable Ising models as examples, we show that not only can temporal convolutional networks capture the input/output mapping generated by the system but can also be used to characterize the complexity of the mapping. This measure of complexity is provided by the size of the smallest latent space that is able to accurately model the mapping. We further find that a generative model, in particular a variational auto-encoder, significantly outperforms traditional auto-encoders at learning the complex response of many-body quantum systems. For the example that generated the most complex mapping, the variational auto-encoder produces outputs that have less than 10% error for more than 90% of inputs across our test data.</description>

      <title>Universal non-Hermitian transport in disordered systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In disordered Hermitian systems, localization of energy eigenstates prohibits wave propagation. In non-Hermitian systems, however, wave propagation is possible even when the eigenstates of Hamiltonian are exponentially localized by disorders. We find in this regime that non-Hermitian wave propagation exhibits novel universal scaling behaviors without Hermitian counterpart. Furthermore, our theory demonstrates how the tail of imaginary-part density of states dictates wave propagation in the long-time limit. Specifically, for the three typical classes, namely the Gaussian, the uniform, and the linear imaginary-part density of states, we obtain logarithmically suppressed sub-ballistic transport, and two types of subdiffusion with exponents that depend only on spatial dimensions, respectively. Our work highlights the fundamental differences between Hermitian and non-Hermitian Anderson localization, and uncovers unique universality in non-Hermitian wave propagation.</description>

      <title>Wavelength-Agnostic Metasurface Design for Next-Generation 2D Photodetectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10601v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore a versatile technique for inverse designing 2D photonic crystal metasurfaces. These surfaces, known for their ability to manipulate light-matter interactions, can be precisely controlled to achieve specific functionalities. The key lies in efficiently optimizing the geometric patterns and dimensions of the metasurface. Through a composite method which exploits two well-established paradigms - Covariance Matrix Adaptation optimization and Rigorous Coupled Wave Analysis (RCWA), we demonstrate our ability to design and optimize resonances in metaelements to achieve desired optical performance such as near-perfect absorption at chosen wavelengths/optical modes, which otherwise proves to be challenging or even impossible with conventional inverse design implementations. We apply our method to design three-layered structures involving a monolayer absorber, transparent metasubstrate, and a back mirror to get near 100% absorption at one or two chosen wavelengths. For illustration, we choose black phosphorus and silicon metasurface to predict ~100% absorption in a monolayer at 1550 nm. The versatile technique can be applied to tailor reflectance and transmittance for any optical mode and wavelength. This computationally efficient design method paves the way for creating high-performance 2D metasurface-based devices with a variety of applications, including quantum technology components such as single photon sensors and biphoton sources, communication systems, and non-linear light conversion.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the nature of cathodoluminescence from photon statistics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12824v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cathodoluminescence (CL), the emission of light induced by accelerated free electrons, has been extensively utilized in various applications, such as displays, streak cameras, and high-spatial-resolution analysis of optical material, surpassing the diffraction limit of light. Despite its long history, the photon statistics of CL have only recently been examined, revealing unexpectedly large bunching of photons. Here we find that this peculiar photon bunching contains information of intervening excitation processes before the photon emission, which can be extracted from the photon statistics within each excitation event by a single free electron. Using this approach, we experimentally unveiled the statistical differences of coherent CL involving a single electromagnetic interaction process and incoherent CL involving multiple excitation processes. The developed formulation is universally applicable for particle generation processes in general to investigate the nature of cascade reactions.</description>

Abstract: Microwave photonics, with its advanced high-frequency signal processing capabilities, is expected to play a crucial role in next-generation wireless communications and radar systems. The realization of highly integrated, high-performance, and multifunctional microwave photonic links will pave the way for its widespread deployment in practical applications, which is a significant challenge. Here, leveraging thin-film lithium niobate intensity modulator and programmable cascaded microring resonators, we demonstrate for the first time a tunable microwave photonic notch filter that simultaneously achieves high level of integration along with high dynamic range, high link gain, low noise figure, and ultra-high rejection ratio. Additionally, this programmable on-chip system is multifunctional, allowing for the dual-band notch filter and the suppression of the high-power interference signal. This work demonstrates the potential applications of the thin-film lithium niobate platform in the field of high-performance integrated microwave photonic filtering and signal processing, facilitating the advancement of microwave photonic system towards practical applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16616v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Feibelman $d$-parameter, a mesoscopic complement to the local bulk permittivity, describes quantum optical surface responses for interfaces, including nonlocality, spill-in and-out, and surface-enabled Landau damping. It has been incorporated into the macroscopic Maxwellian framework for convenient modeling and understanding of nanoscale electromagnetic phenomena, calling for the compilation of a $d$-parameter database for interfaces of interest in nano-optics. However, accurate first-principles calculations of $d$-parameters face computational challenges, whereas existing measurements of $d$-parameters are scarce and restricted to narrow spectral windows. We demonstrate a general broadband ellipsometric approach to measure $d$-parameters at a gold--air interface across the visible--ultraviolet regimes. Gold is found to spill in and spill out at different frequencies. We also observe gold's Bennett mode, a surface-dipole resonance associated with a pole of the $d$-parameter, around 2.5 eV. Our measurements give rise to and are further validated by the passivity and Kramers--Kronig causality analysis of $d$-parameters. Our work advances the understanding of quantum surface response and may enable applications like enhanced electron field emission.</description>

Abstract: Optical tweezers have revolutionized particle manipulation at the micro- and nanoscale, playing a critical role in fields such as plasmonics, biophysics, and nanotechnology. While traditional optical trapping methods primarily rely on optical forces to manipulate and organize particles, recent studies suggest that optothermal traps in surfactant solutions can induce unconventional effects such as enhanced trapping stiffness and increased diffusion. Thus, there is a need for further exploration of this system to gain a deeper understanding of the forces involved. This work investigates the behaviour of gold nanoparticles confined in an optothermal trap around a heated anchor particle in a surfactant (CTAC) solution. We observe unexpected radial confinement and synchronized rotational diffusion of particles at micrometre-scale separations from the anchor particle. These dynamics differ from known optical binding and thermophoretic effects, suggesting unexplored forces facilitated by the surfactant environment. This study expands the understanding of optothermal trapping driven by anchor plasmonic particles and introduces new possibilities for nanoparticle assembly, offering insights with potential applications in nanoscale fabrication and materials science.</description>

      <title>Scaling Enhancement of Photon Blockade in Output Fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18299v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Photon blockade enhancement is an exciting and promising subject that has been well studied for photons in cavities. However, whether photon blockade can be enhanced in the output fields remains largely unexplored. We show that photon blockade can be greatly enhanced in the mixing output field of a nonlinear cavity and an auxiliary (linear) cavity, where no direct coupling between the nonlinear and auxiliary cavities is needed. We uncover a biquadratic scaling relation between the second-order correlation of the photons in the output field and intracavity nonlinear interaction strength, in contrast to a quadratic scaling relation for the photons in a nonlinear cavity. We identify that this scaling enhancement of photon blockade in the output field is induced by the destructive interference between two of the paths for two photons passing through the two cavities. We then extend the theory to the experimentally feasible Jaynes-Cummings model consisting of a two-level system strongly coupled to one of the two uncoupled cavities and also predict a biquadratic scaling law in the mixing output field. Our proposed scheme is general and can be extended to enhance blockade in other bosonic systems.</description>

      <title>Coherent Optical Modems for Full-Wavefield Lidar</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08439v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The advent of the digital age has driven the development of coherent optical modems--devices that modulate the amplitude and phase of light in multiple polarization states. These modems transmit data through fiber optic cables that are thousands of kilometers in length at data rates exceeding one terabit per second. This remarkable technology is made possible through near-THz-rate programmable control and sensing of the full optical wavefield. While coherent optical modems form the backbone of telecommunications networks around the world, their extraordinary capabilities also provide unique opportunities for imaging. Here, we repurpose off-the-shelf coherent optical modems to introduce full-wavefield lidar: a type of random modulation continuous wave lidar that simultaneously measures depth, axial velocity, and polarization. We demonstrate this modality by combining a 74 GHz-bandwidth coherent optical modem with free-space coupling optics and scanning mirrors. We develop a time-resolved image formation model for this system and formulate a maximum-likelihood reconstruction algorithm to recover depth, velocity, and polarization information at each scene point from the modem's raw transmitted and received symbols. Compared to existing lidars, full-wavefield lidar promises improved mm-scale ranging accuracy from brief, microsecond exposure times, reliable velocimetry, and robustness to interference from ambient light or other lidar signals.</description>

      <title>Accelerating two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy simulations with a probe qubit protocol</title>

Abstract: Two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2DES) is a powerful tool for exploring quantum effects in energy transport within photosynthetic systems and investigating novel material properties. However, simulating the dynamics of these experiments poses significant challenges for classical computers due to the large system sizes, long timescales and numerous experiment repetitions involved. This paper introduces the probe qubit protocol (PQP)-for quantum simulation of 2DES on quantum devices-addressing these challenges. The PQP offers several enhancements over standard methods, notably reducing computational resources, by requiring only a single-qubit measurement per circuit run and achieving Heisenberg scaling in detection frequency resolution, without the need to apply expensive controlled evolution operators in the quantum circuit. The implementation of the PQP protocol requires only one additional ancilla qubit, the probe qubit, with one-to-all connectivity and two-qubit interactions between each system and probe qubits. We evaluate the computational resources necessary for this protocol in detail, demonstrating its function as a dynamic frequency-filtering method through numerical simulations. We find that simulations of the PQP on classical and quantum computers enable a reduction on the number of measurements, i.e. simulation runtime, and memory savings of several orders of magnitude relatively to standard quantum simulation protocols of 2DES. The paper discusses the applicability of the PQP on near-term quantum devices and highlights potential applications where this spectroscopy simulation protocol could provide significant speedups over standard approaches such as the quantum simulation of 2DES applied to the Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO) complex in green sulphur bacteria.</description>
