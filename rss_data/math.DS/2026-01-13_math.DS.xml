      <title>Estimating the Evolution of Solution Norms in Vector Delay Nonlinear Systems: Stability and Boundedness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing methods rarely capture the temporal evolution of solution norms in vector nonlinear DDEs with variable delays and coefficients, often leading to overly conservative boundedness and stability criteria. We develop a framework that constructs scalar counterparts of vector DDEs whose solutions upper-bound the evolution of the original solution norms when the corresponding history functions are matched. This reduction enables boundedness and stability assessment of vector DDEs through the dynamics of their scalar counterparts, using straightforward simulations or simplified analytical reasoning. New boundedness and stability criteria and the estimates of the radii of balls containing history functions that yield bounded or stable solutions for the original vector systems were derived and validated through representative simulations.</description>

      <title>Bilateral Solution Bounds and Successive Estimation of Boundedness and Stability Regions for Vector Delay Nonlinear Time-Varying Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stability and boundedness analysis for vector nonlinear systems with variable delays and coefficients remains challenging due to the conservatism of existing methods. Moreover, estimates of the transient behavior of solution norms remain insufficiently developed. This paper presents an approach to estimate the temporal evolution of solution norms and applies it to the analysis of boundedness and stability of vector nonlinear systems with variable delays and coefficients. The method is based on a novel scheme for successive approximations of the original solutions, complemented by the estimates of the corresponding residual norms. This leads to the construction of a scalar nonlinear delay equation whose solutions provide upper bounds for the evolution of residual norms. As a result, bilateral bounds on the original solution norms are obtained, yielding effective boundedness and stability criteria and enabling estimation of the associated regions.
  Simulations demonstrate that the proposed approximations rapidly approach the reference boundaries of the regions of interest as the iteration count increases. Moreover, the bilateral bounds progressively approach each other and the norm of the reference solution when the initial function remains within the considered regions.</description>

      <title>Khintchin conjecture and related topics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by Khintchin's 1923 conjecture, refuted by Marstrand in 1970, we study the Khintchin class of functions associated to a given increasing sequence of integers. When the Khintchin class contains L^p(\mathbb{T}), we call the sequence a L^p-Khintchin sequence. We establish basic properties of Khintchin sequences, provide several constructions, and propose open problems for further research. We also initiate the study of Khintchin sequences of group endomorphisms on compact abelian groups. Under a Fourier-tightness assumption, we show that ergodicity (respectively, weakly mixing or strongly mixing) of a skew product of endomorphisms is equivalent to the corresponding property of the base system, supporting the idea that typical fiber orbits in such skew products should form Khintchin sequences.</description>

      <title>On the conformal preimage decay exponent of the Julia sets of rational graph-directed Markov systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define and investigate the conformal preimage decay exponent of the Julia sets of rational graph-directed Markov systems. We show that this exponent coincides with the difference between the topological entropy and upper sequential capacity topological pressure for the rational skew product map associated with the system $S$. Here, upper sequential capacity topological pressure is a slight generalisation of upper capacity topological pressure given in \cite{MR969568}.</description>

      <title>A note on Bohr chaos and hyperbolic sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the relationship between shadowing phenomena and Bohr chaos in dynamical systems. We provide sufficient conditions for Bohr chaos in terms of shadowing. By combining those conditions with the shadowing lemma, we obtain some results on Bohr chaos and hyperbolic sets. Our results also highlight some simple but non-trivial structural properties of hyperbolic sets.</description>

      <title>Infinite sumsets in $U^k(\Phi)$-uniform sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extending recent developments of Kra, Moreira, Richter and Roberson, we study infinite sumset patterns in $U^k(\Phi)$-uniform subsets of the integers, defined via the local uniformity seminorms introduced by Host and Kra. The main result relates the degree $k$ of a $U^k(\Phi)$-uniform set to the existence of sumset patterns along prescribed vertices of $\ell$-dimensional parallelepipeds, for $k \leq \ell$. The proof relies on a dynamical analysis of return-time sets to neighborhoods of points lying over pronilfactor fibers. We then derive higher-order parity obstructions for sumset patterns and consequences in topological dynamics.</description>

      <title>The structure of Morse flows and co-dimension one gradient flows on the sphere with holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe all possible topological structures of typical one-parameter bifurcations of gradient flows on the 2-sphere with holes in the case that the number of singular point of flows is at most six. To describe structures, we separatrix diagrams of flows. The saddle-node singularity is specified by selecting a separatrix in the diagram of the flow befor the bifurcation and the saddle connection is specified by a separatrix, which conect two saddles.</description>

      <title>Inverse problems for history-enriched linear model reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Standard projection-based model reduction for dynamical systems incurs closure error because it only accounts for instantaneous dependence on the resolved state. From the Mori-Zwanzig (MZ) perspective, projecting the full dynamics onto a low-dimensional resolved subspace induces additional noise and memory terms arising from the dynamics of the unresolved component in the orthogonal complement. The memory term makes the resolved dynamics explicitly history dependent. In this work, based on the MZ identity, we derive exact, history-enriched models for the resolved dynamics of linear driven dynamical systems and formulate inverse problems to learn model operators from discrete snapshot data via least-squares regression. We propose a greedy time-marching scheme to solve the inverse problems efficiently and analyze operator identifiability under full and partial observation data availability. For full observation data, we show that, under mild assumptions, the operators are identifiable even when the full-state dynamics are governed by a general time-varying linear operator, whereas with partial observation data the inverse problem has a unique solution only when the full-state operator is time-invariant. To address the resulting non-uniqueness in the time-varying case, we introduce a time-smoothing Tikhonov regularization. Numerical results demonstrate that the operators can be faithfully reconstructed from both full and partial observation data and that the learned history-enriched MZ models yield accurate trajectories of the resolved state.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic values of solutions to a periodic linear difference equation modeling discrimination training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work is concerned with the study of $w(mT)$ as $m$ goes to infinity, where $w(t)$ evolves according to $w(t)-w(t-1)=F(t)-A(t)w(t-1)$, and where $T$ is the period of the vector $F(t)$ and the matrix $A(t)$. Motivated by applications to associative learning, particularly to discrimination training, extra conditions are imposed on $F(t)$ and $A(t)$, one of them relating $A(t)$ to a symmetric non-negative definite matrix $K$ relevant to mathematical models of associative learning. Structural relationships between the matrices imply an identity satisfied by the Floquet multipliers driving the dynamics of $w(mT)$ from which follows that the unstable subspace is $\ker K$. Then, the limit of $w(mT)$ is explicitly identified when $K$ is invertible, while the limit of $Kw(mT)$ is established otherwise. Given that divergence of $w(mT)$ can happen when $K$ is singular, while $Kw(mT)$ is the psychologically relevant quantity, the result can be considered optimal.</description>

      <title>On faithfulness and DP-transformations generated by arithmetic Cantor series expansions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper is devoted to the study of conditions for the Hausdorff-Besicovitch faithfulness of the family of cylinders generated by Cantor series expansions. We show that there exist subgeometric Cantor series expansions for which the corresponding families of cylinders are not faithful for the Hausdorff-Besicovitch dimension on the unit interval. On the other hand we found a rather wide subfamily of subgeometric Cantor series expansions generating faithful families of cylinders.
  We also study conditions for the Hausdorff-Besicovitch dimension preservation on [0;1] by probability distribution functions of random variables with independent symbols of arithmetic Cantor series expansions.</description>

      <title>On the geometry of generalised Koch snowflakes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the geometry of a class of fractal sets in $\mathbb{R}^{2}$ that generalise the famous Koch curve and Koch snowflake. While the classical Koch curve is defined by an iterative process that divides a line segment into three parts and replaces the middle part by the legs of an isosceles triangle 'above' the line segment, in this more general setting, a choice can be made at each iteration as to whether to place this triangle 'above' or 'below' the line segment. The resulting fractals bear a striking visual resemblance to curves appearing in nature, such as coastlines and snowflakes. While these fractals can be generated by a random process that flips a coin each time to decide the orientation of the triangle, leading to 'almost sure' results for their geometrical properties, we define and study them deterministically to provide exact results. In particular, we show, using the theory of non-integer expansions, that the set of all possible values for the area enclosed by these generalised Koch curves is a closed interval. Moreover, we prove that the union of all these generalised snowflakes does not contain an open set, and has zero $2$-dimensional Lebesgue measure. Complementing these results, using arguments from calculus and fractal geometry, namely properties of geometric series and Frostman's Lemma, we show that each generalised Koch curve has infinite length and the same Hausdorff dimension as its classical counterpart. Further, we also give a classification for when a generalised Koch curve is a quasicircle.</description>

      <title>Modeling and analysis of a novel two-strain dengue epidemics model considering secondary infections with increased mortality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we develop and analyze a deterministic two-strain host-vector model for dengue transmission that incorporates key immuno-epidemiological mechanisms, including temporary cross-immunity, antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), disease-induced mortality during secondary infections, and explicit vector co-infection. The human population is divided into compartments for primary and secondary infections, while the mosquito population includes single- and co-infected classes. ADE is modeled through distinct primary ($\alpha$) and secondary ($\sigma$) transmission rates. Using the next-generation matrix method, we derive the basic reproduction number $R_0$ and establish the local stability of the disease-free equilibrium for $R_0 &lt; 1$. Analytical results show that one-strain endemic equilibria lose stability under ADE conditions ($\sigma &gt; \alpha$), allowing invasion by a heterologous strain. Employing center-manifold theory and numerical continuation (COCO), we demonstrate the occurrence of backward bifurcation, bistability between disease-free and endemic states, and Hopf-induced oscillations. Numerical simulations confirm transitions among disease-free, endemic, and periodic regimes as key parameters vary. The model highlights how ADE, waning cross-immunity, and vector co-infection interact to generate complex dengue dynamics and provides insights useful for designing effective control and vaccination strategies in dengue-endemic regions.</description>

      <title>Foundations of local iterated function systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we present a systematic study of continuous local iterated function systems. We prove local iterated function systems admit compact attractors and, under a contractivity assumption, construct their code space and present an extended shift that describes admissible compositions. In particular, the possible combinatorial structure of a local iterated function system is in bijection with the space of invariant subsets of the full shift. Nevertheless, these objects reveal a degree of unexpectedness relative to the classical framework, as we build examples of local iterated function systems which are not modeled by subshifts of finite type and give rise to non self-similar attractors. We also prove that all attractors of graph-directed IFSs are obtained from local IFSs on an enriched compact metric space.
  We provide several classes of examples illustrating the scope of our results, emphasizing both their contrasts and connections with the classical theory of iterated function systems.</description>

      <title>Bystander effect emerges from individual psychological prospects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The bystander effect is a social psychological phenomenon in which individuals are less likely to help a person potentially in need if there are others present. Sociologists and psychologists have proposed multiple plausible reasons for the bystander effect, from situational ambiguity and social contagion to diffusion of responsibility and mutual denial. We build a new model of an individual's decision to intervene in a bystander situation based on these social psychological hypotheses, along with ideas borrowed from prospect theory. This model shows, for the first time, that the bystander effect emerges from social risk perception among non-coordinating individuals in ambiguous bystander situations. Expanding upon this static model, we explore the effect of social learning, where individuals update their perceived risk of intervening after experiencing or witnessing the social repercussions of previous interventions. A novel result of this model is that social learning exacerbates the bystander effect. We validate these models using a new database of 42 experimental and observational studies across a wide range of bystander situations, demonstrating a straightforward and generalizable explanation for the observed phenomenon, which may suggest effective interventions tailored to specific bystander situations.</description>

      <title>A Relaxed Direct-insertion Downscaling Method For Discrete-in-time Data Assimilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper improves the spectrally-filtered direct-insertion downscaling method for discrete-in-time data assimilation by introducing a relaxation parameter that overcomes a constraint on the observation frequency. Numerical simulations demonstrate that taking the relaxation parameter proportional to the time between observations allows one to vary the observation frequency over a wide range while maintaining convergence of the approximating solution to the reference solution. Under the same assumptions we analytically prove that taking the observation frequency to infinity results in the continuous-in-time nudging method.</description>

      <title>Symmetry Breaking, Hysteresis, and Convergence to the Mean Voter in two-party Spatial Competition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classical spatial models of two-party competition typically predict convergence to the median voter, yet real-world party systems often exhibit persistent and asymmetric polarization. We develop a spatial model of two-party competition in which voters evaluate parties through general satisfaction functions, and a width parameter $q$ captures how tolerant they are of ideological distance. This parameter governs the balance between centripetal and centrifugal incentives and acts as the bifurcation parameter governing equilibrium configurations. Under mild regularity assumptions, we characterize Nash equilibria through center-distance coordinates, which separate the endogenous political center from polarization. When the voter density is symmetric, the reduced equilibrium condition exhibits a generic supercritical pitchfork bifurcation at a critical value $q_{c}$. Above $q_{c}$, the unique stable equilibrium features convergence to the center, recovering the classical median voter result, whereas below it two symmetric polarized equilibria arise. Asymmetry in the voter distribution unfolds the pitchfork, producing drift in the endogenous center and asymmetric polarized equilibria. The resulting equilibrium diagram has an S-shaped geometry that generates hysteresis, allowing polarization to persist even after tolerance returns to levels that would support convergence in a symmetric environment. In the high-tolerance regime, we show that the unique non-polarized equilibrium converges to the mean of the voter distribution, while the median is recovered only under symmetry. Hence, unlike the Hotelling--Downs model, where convergence to the median is universal, the median voter appears here as an asymptotic benchmark rather than a robust predictor.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of the translation semigroup on directed metric trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07561v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of the left translation semigroup $\{T_t\}_{t \geq 0}$ on weighted $L^p$ spaces over a directed metric tree $L(G)$ is investigated. Necessary and sufficient conditions on the weight family $\rho$ for the strong continuity of the semigroup are provided. Furthermore, hypercyclicity and weak mixing properties are characterized in terms of the asymptotic decay of $\rho$ along the tree structure. These results generalize classical $L^p$ translation semigroup dynamics to a graph setting.</description>

      <title>Rigidity of the escaping set of polynomial automorphisms of $\mathbb{C}^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $H$ be a polynomial automorphism of $\mathbb{C}^2$ of positive entropy and degree $d \ge 2$. We prove that the escaping set $U^+$ (or equivalently, the non-escaping set $K^+$), of $H$ is rigid under the action of holomorphic automorphisms of $\mathbb{C}^2$. Specifically, every holomorphic automorphism of $\mathbb{C}^2$ that preserves $U^+$ takes the form $L \circ H^s$ where $s \in \mathbb{Z}$ and $L$ belongs to a finite cyclic group of affine maps that preserve the escaping set.
  Second, note that the sub-level sets $\{G^+ &lt; c\}$, $c &gt; 0$, of the Greens function $G^+$ associated with the map $H$ are canonical examples of Short $\mathbb{C}^2$s. As a consequence of the above theorem, we show that the holomorphic automorphisms of these Short $\mathbb{C}^2$s are affine automorphisms of $\mathbb{C}^2$ preserving the escaping set $U^+$. Hence, the automorphism group of these Short $\mathbb{C}^2$s are the same for every $c&gt;0$ and is a finite cyclic group.</description>

      <title>Predefined-time One-Shot Cooperative Estimation, Guidance, and Control for Simultaneous Target Interception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work develops a unified nonlinear estimation-guidance-control framework for cooperative simultaneous interception of a stationary target under a heterogeneous sensing topology, where sensing capabilities are non-uniform across interceptors. Specifically, only a subset of agents is instrumented with onboard seekers (informed/seeker-equipped agents), whereas the rest of them (seeker-less agents) acquire the information about the target indirectly via the informed agents and execute a distributed cooperative guidance for simultaneous target interception. To address the resulting partial observability, a predefined-time distributed observer is leveraged, guaranteeing convergence of the target state estimates for seeker-less agents through information exchange with seeker-equipped neighbors over a directed communication graph. Thereafter, an improved time-to-go estimate accounting for wide launch envelopes is utilized to design the distributed cooperative guidance commands. This estimate is coupled with a predefined-time consensus protocol, ensuring consensus in the agents' time-to-go values. The temporal upper bounds within which both observer error and time-to-go consensus error converge to zero can be prescribed as design parameters. Furthermore, the cooperative guidance commands are realized by means of an autopilot, wherein the interceptor is steered by canard actuation. The corresponding fin deflection commands are generated using a predefined-time convergent sliding mode control law. This enables the autopilot to precisely track the commanded lateral acceleration within a design-specified time, while maintaining non-singularity of the overall design. Theoretical guarantees are supported by numerical simulations across diverse engagement geometries, verifying the estimation accuracy, the cooperative interception performance, and the autopilot response using the proposed scheme.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the composition of omega-series by surreal numbers, or more generally by elements of any confluent field of transseries, is monotonic in its second argument. In particular, omega-series and LE-series interpreted as functions on positive infinite omega-series, or respectively LE-series, have the intermediate value property. We also deduce a Taylor approximation theorem for omega-series with maximal radius of validity.</description>

      <title>Bounded geometry for PCF-special subvarieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17343v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For each integer $d\geq 2$, let $M_d$ denote the moduli space of maps $f: \mathbb{P}^1\to \mathbb{P}^1$ of degree $d$. We study the geometric configurations of subsets of postcritically finite (or PCF) maps in $M_d$. A complex-algebraic subvariety $Y \subset M_d$ is said to be PCF-special if it contains a Zariski-dense set of PCF maps. Here we prove that there are only finitely many positive-dimensional irreducible PCF-special subvarieties in $M_d$ with degree $\leq D$. In addition, there exist constants $N = N(D,d)$ and $B = B(D,d)$ so that for any complex algebraic subvariety $X \subset M_d$ of degree $\leq D$, the Zariski closure $\overline{X\cap\mathrm{PCF}}~$ has at most $N$ irreducible components, each with degree $\leq B$. We also prove generalizations of these results for points with small critical height in $M_d(\bar{\mathbb{Q}})$.</description>

      <title>The geometry of preperiodic points in families of maps on $\mathbb{P}^N$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10894v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of algebraic families of maps on $\mathbb{P}^N$, over the field $\mathbb{C}$ of complex numbers, and the geometry of their preperiodic points. The goal of this note is to formulate a conjectural characterization of the subvarieties of $S \times\mathbb{P}^N$ containing a Zariski-dense set of preperiodic points, where the parameter space $S$ is a quasiprojective complex algebraic variety; the characterization is given in terms of the non-vanishing of a power of the invariant Green current associated to the family of maps. This conjectural characterization is inspired by and generalizes the Relative Manin-Mumford Conjecture for families of abelian varieties, recently proved by Gao and Habegger, and it includes as special cases the Manin-Mumford Conjecture (theorem of Raynaud) and the Dynamical Manin-Mumford Conjecture (posed by Ghioca, Tucker, and Zhang). We provide examples where the equivalence is known to hold, and we show that several recent results can be viewed as special cases. Finally, we give the proof of one implication in the conjectural characterization.</description>

      <title>A Comparison of Parametric Dynamic Mode Decomposition Algorithms for Thermal-Hydraulics Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24205v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, algorithms aiming at learning models from available data have become quite popular due to two factors: 1) the significant developments in Artificial Intelligence techniques and 2) the availability of large amounts of data. Nevertheless, this topic has already been addressed by methodologies belonging to the Reduced Order Modelling framework, of which perhaps the most famous equation-free technique is Dynamic Mode Decomposition. This algorithm aims to learn the best linear model that represents the physical phenomena described by a time series dataset: its output is a best state operator of the underlying dynamical system that can be used, in principle, to advance the original dataset in time even beyond its span. However, in its standard formulation, this technique cannot deal with parametric time series, meaning that a different linear model has to be derived for each parameter realization. Research on this is ongoing, and some versions of a parametric Dynamic Mode Decomposition already exist. This work contributes to this research field by comparing the different algorithms presently deployed and assessing their advantages and shortcomings compared to each other. To this aim, three different thermal-hydraulics problems are considered: two benchmark 'flow over cylinder' test cases at diverse Reynolds numbers, whose datasets are, respectively, obtained with the FEniCS finite element solver and retrieved from the CFDbench dataset, and the DYNASTY experimental facility operating at Politecnico di Milano, which studies the natural circulation established by internally heated fluids for Generation IV nuclear applications, whose dataset was generated using the RELAP5 nodal solver.</description>

Abstract: Let $\mathbbm{P}^{1,an}$ be the Berkovich projective line over a complete, algebraically closed, non-Archimedean field. Let $\phi$ be a degree $\geq 2$ rational map with potential good reduction, acting on $\mathbbm{P}^{1,an}$. In this article, we study the topology of the fixed locus of $\phi$. we show that the reduction of $\phi$ at its type~II totally ramified fixed point dictates the topological structure of the fixed locus of $\phi$. We give an easily verifiable equivalent criterion for the fixed locus of $\phi$ to be connected as well as an equivalent criterion for the fixed locus of $\phi$ to be finite. Moreover, we provide a sharp upper bound for the number of connected components of the fixed locus of a rational map with potential good reduction.</description>

      <title>A rotational hyperbolic theory for surface homeomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14232v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a rotational hyperbolic theory for surface homeomorphisms. We use the equivalence relation on ergodic measures that have nontrivial rotational behaviour defined in [arXiv:2312.06249] to define a rotational counterpart of homoclinic classes. These allows to produce a network of horseshoes representing the whole rotational behaviour f the homeomorphism. We also study the counterpart of heteroclinic connections and give 5 different characterizations of such connections.
  The main technical tool is the forcing theory of Le Calvez and Tal [arXiv:1503.09127], [arXiv:1803.04557], and in particular a result of creation of periodic points that can also be seen as a statement of homotopically bounded deviations [arXiv:2511.14222].
  This theoretical article is followed by a paper focused of some applications of it to the case of homeomorphisms with big rotation set [arXiv:2511.15220].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.15220v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article consists in applications of [arXiv:2511.14232] in the case of homemomorphisms of higher genus surfaces whose homological rotation set is big enough -- a class of dynamics that is open. We first prove a structure theorem for the rotation set of such homeomorphisms: it is a finite union of convex sets, we get an optimal bound for the number of such pieces. This bound can be improved in the case of transitive (in this case the rotation set is convex) and non-wandering dynamics (and for such homeomorphisms we get the existence of a family of invariant essential open sets). We also get boundedness of deviations for homeomorphisms with big rotation set and some consequences of it, including a answer to Boyland's conjecture in our framework.</description>

      <title>Nonsmooth bifurcations in families of one-dimensional piecewise-linear quasiperiodically forced maps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04234v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study nonsmooth bifurcations of four types of families of one-dimensional quasiperiodically forced maps of the form $F_i(x,\theta) = (f_i(x,\theta), \theta+\omega)$ for $i=1,\dots,4$, where $x$ is real, $\theta\in\mathbb{T}$ is an angle, $\omega$ is an irrational frequency, and $f_i(x,\theta)$ is a real piecewise linear map with respect to $x$. The first two types of families $f_i$ have a symmetry with respect to $x$, and the other two could be viewed as quasiperiodically forced piecewise-linear versions of saddle-node and period-doubling bifurcations. The four types of families depend on two real parameters, $a\in\mathbb{R}$ and $b\in\mathbb{R}$. Under certain assumptions for $a$, we prove the existence of a continuous map $b^*(a)$ where for $b=b^*(a)$ there exists a nonsmooth bifurcation for these types of systems. In particular we prove that for $b=b^*(a)$ we have a strange nonchaotic attractor. It is worth to mention that the four families are piecewise-linear versions of smooth families which seem to have nonsmooth bifurcations. Moreover, as far as we know, we give the first example of a family with a nonsmooth period-doubling bifurcation.</description>

Abstract: For the family of complex rational functions of the form R(z)= z^n + a/z^n+b, known as "Generalized McMullen maps", for non-zero a, and integer n fixed and at least 3, we describe the apparent phenomena of baby Julia sets in parameter space appearing both in slices with independent critical orbits and a slice defined by imposing a critical orbit relation.
  Specifically, we introduce the subfamily where one of two critical orbits is set to be a super-attracting fixed point, provide some general results on this subfamily and describe how Julia set copies in the parameter space slice occur--due to parameters for which the other critical orbit is in the (not immediate) basin of attraction of this fixed critical point. We provide several conjectures on this intriguing phenomena to catalyze further study.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07040v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce high-order Basis-Update &amp; Galerkin (BUG) integrators based on explicit Runge-Kutta methods for large-scale matrix differential equations. These dynamical low-rank integrators extend the BUG integrator to arbitrary explicit Runge-Kutta schemes by performing a BUG step at each stage of the method. The resulting Runge-Kutta BUG (RK-BUG) integrators are robust with respect to small singular values, fully forward in time, and high-order accurate, while enabling conservation and rank adaptivity. We prove that RK-BUG integrators retain the order of convergence of the underlying Runge-Kutta method until the error reaches a plateau corresponding to the low-rank truncation error, which vanishes as the rank becomes full. This theoretical analysis is supported by several numerical experiments. The results demonstrate the high-order convergence of the RK-BUG integrator and its superior accuracy compared to other existing dynamical low-rank integrators.</description>

      <title>Instability of the Standing Pulse in Skew-Gradient Systems and Its Application to FitzHugh-Nagumo Type Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11211v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Classical results from Sturm-Liouville theory establish that the Morse index of a one-dimensional Sturm-Liouville operator defined on $\mathbb{R}$ is equal to the number of its associated conjugate points. Recent advancements by Beck et al.~\cite{BCJLM18} have extended these results to higher-dimensional Sturm-Liouville operators on $\mathbb{R}$, utilizing the Maslov index to characterize the spectral stability of nonlinear waves in multi-component systems. In this paper, we extend this framework further to non-self-adjoint settings by investigating skew-gradient reaction-diffusion systems. By utilizing the Maslov index and spectral flow, we derive an instability criterion for standing pulses. This approach bridges the gap between variational methods and the stability index in systems where the standard self-adjoint structure is absent. As a primary application, we apply our results to FitzHugh-Nagumo type systems, where the reaction terms for both the activator and inhibitor exhibit intrinsic nonlinearities. This provides a robust topological method to account for the influence of nonlinear inhibition on pulse stability in the non-self-adjoint regime.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we show that the stabilized automorphism group of free exact odometers arising from actions of finitely generated residually finite groups coincides with the topological full group of the odometer acting on itself by right multiplication. We then prove that two free exact odometers have isomorphic stabilized automorphism groups if and only if they have isomorphic clopen subgroups of the same index. As a consequence, continuous orbit equivalence implies isomorphic stabilized automorphism groups, while for free $\mathbb{Z}^d$-odometers, isomorphic stabilized automorphism groups imply orbit equivalence. In general, neither continuous orbit equivalence nor orbit equivalence is equivalent to having isomorphic stabilized automorphism groups.</description>
