      <title>The turbulence development at its initial stage: a scenario based on the idea of vortices decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.05908v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, a model of the development of a quantum turbulence in its initial stage is proposed. The origin of the turbulence in the suggested model is the decay of vortex loops with an internal structure. We consider the initial stage of this process, before an equilibrium state is established. As result of our study, the density matrix of developing turbulent flow is calculated.
  The quantization scheme of the classical vortex rings system is based on the approach proposed by the author earlier.</description>

      <title>Parallelization of Network Dynamics Computations in Heterogeneous Distributed Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19075v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of parallelizing computations to study non-linear dynamics in large networks of non-locally coupled oscillators using heterogeneous computing resources. The proposed approach can be applied to a variety of non-linear dynamics models with runtime specification of parameters and network topologies. Parallelizing the solution of equations for different network elements is performed transparently and, in contrast to available tools, does not require parallel programming from end-users. The runtime scheduler takes into account the performance of computing and communication resources to reduce downtime and to achieve a quasi-optimal parallelizing speed-up. The proposed approach was implemented, and its efficiency is proven by numerous applications for simulating large dynamical networks with 10^3-10^8 elements described by Hodgkin-Huxley, FitzHugh-Nagumo, and Kuramoto models, for investigating pathological synchronization during Parkinson's disease, analyzing multi-stability, for studying chimera and solitary states in 3D networks, etc. All the above computations may be performed using symmetrical multiprocessors, graphic processing units, and a network of workstations within the same run and it was demonstrated that near-linear speed-up can be achieved for large networks. The proposed approach is promising for extension to new hardware like edge-computing devices.</description>

      <title>Construction of approximate invariants for non-integrable Hamiltonian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07568v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a method to construct high-order polynomial approximate invariants (AI) for non-integrable Hamiltonian dynamical systems, and apply it to modern ring-based particle accelerators. Taking advantage of a special property of one-turn transformation maps in the form of a square matrix, AIs can be constructed order-by-order iteratively. Evaluating AI with simulation data, we observe that AI's fluctuation is actually a measure of chaos. Through minimizing the fluctuations with control knobs in accelerators, the stable region of long-term motions could be enlarged.</description>

      <title>Tree-based Learning for High-Fidelity Prediction of Chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13836v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Model-free forecasting of the temporal evolution of chaotic systems is crucial but challenging. Existing solutions require hyperparameter tuning, significantly hindering their wider adoption. In this work, we introduce a tree-based approach not requiring hyperparameter tuning: TreeDOX. It uses time delay overembedding as explicit short-term memory and Extra-Trees Regressors to perform feature reduction and forecasting. We demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of TreeDOX using the Henon map, Lorenz and Kuramoto-Sivashinsky systems, and the real-world Southern Oscillation Index.</description>

      <title>Superdiffusion, normal diffusion and chaos in semiclassical Bose-Hubbard chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19584v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the evolution of two-point correlation functions of one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model in the semiclassical regime in the framework of Truncated Wigner Approximation (TWA) with quantum jumps as first-order corrections. At early times, the correlation functions show strong superdiffusion with universal integer exponents determined solely by the initial conditions and completely insensitive to system parameters and chaos. Only after a long time this regime crosses over to normal diffusion regime which is most robust when nonintegrability is strong. For strong nonintegrability, the system ends up in a homogeneous state while for weak nonintegrability the oscillations and inhomogeneities persist, despite the fact that chaos is nearly always strong and only weakly depends on nonintegrability parameter. We conclude that the superidiffusive regime is neither prethermalized nor a precursor to thermalization but a novel early-time phenomenon related to a special scaling symmetry of the Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian.</description>
