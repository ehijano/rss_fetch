      <title>Gas conditions of a star-formation selected sample in the first billion years</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Atacama Large Millimetre/submillimetre Array (ALMA) observations of the [O$_{\rm III}$] 88 $\mu$m emission of a sample of thirteen galaxies at $z$ = 6 to 7.6 selected as [C$_{\rm II}$]-emitting companion sources of quasars. To disentangle the origins of the luminous Oxygen line in the $z$ &gt; 6 Universe, we looked at emission-line galaxies that are selected through an excellent star-formation tracer [C$_{\rm II}$] with star-formation rates between 9 and 162 M$_{\odot}$/yr. Direct observations reveal [O$_{\rm III}$] emission in just a single galaxy (L$_{\rm [O_{\rm III}]}$/L$_{\rm [C_{\rm II}]}$ = 2.3), and a stacked image shows no [O$_{\rm III}$] detection, providing deep upper limits on the L$_{\rm [O_{\rm III}]}$/L$_{\rm [C_{\rm II}]}$ ratios in the $z &gt; 6$ Universe (L$_{\rm [O_{\rm III}]}$/L$_{\rm [C_{\rm II}]}$ &lt; 1.2 at 3${\sigma}$). While the fidelity of this sample is high, no obvious optical/near-infrared counterpart is seen in the JWST imaging available for four galaxies. Additionally accounting for low-redshift CO emitters, line stacking shows that our sample-wide result remains robust: The enhanced L$_{\rm [O_{\rm III}]}$/L$_{\rm [C_{\rm II}]}$ reported in the first billion years of the Universe is likely due to the selection towards bright, blue Lyman-break galaxies with high surface star-formation rates or young stellar populations. The deep upper limit on the rest-frame 90 $\mu$m continuum emission (&lt; 141 $\mu$Jy at 3${\sigma}$), implies a low average dust temperature (T$_{\rm dust}$ &lt; 30K) and high dust mass (M$_{\rm dust}$ ~ 10$^8$ M$_{\odot}$). As more normal galaxies are explored in the early Universe, synergy between JWST and ALMA is fundamental to further investigate the ISM properties of the a broad range of samples of high-$z$ galaxies.</description>

      <title>Dynamics around supermassive black holes: Extreme mass-ratio inspirals as gravitational-wave sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supermassive black holes and their surrounding dense stellar environments nourish a variety of astrophysical phenomena. We focus on the distribution of stellar-mass black holes around the supermassive black hole and the consequent formation of extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs). We derive a steady-state distribution, considering the effects of two-body scatterings and gravitational wave emission, and calculate the EMRI formation rate, eccentricity distribution and EMRI-to-plunge ratio. Our model predicts: (I) A stronger segregation than previously estimated at the outskirts of the sphere of influence (at $\sim0.01\rm pc$ to $2\rm pc$ for a Milky-way like galaxy). (II) An increased EMRI-to-plunge ratio, favoring EMRIs at galaxies where stellar-mass black holes are scarce. (III) A detection of about $2\times10^3$ resolvable EMRIs, with a signal-to-noise ratio above $20$, along a $4$ year LISA mission time. (IV) A confusion noise, induced by a cosmological population of unresolved EMRIs, reducing LISA sensitivity in the $1-10\ \rm mHz$ frequency range by up to a factor of $\approx3.5$, relative to the instrumental noise.</description>

      <title>On the minimum number of radiation field parameters to specify gas cooling and heating functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast and accurate approximations of gas cooling and heating functions are needed for hydrodynamic galaxy simulations. We use machine learning to analyze atomic gas cooling and heating functions in the presence of a generalized incident local radiation field computed by Cloudy. We characterize the radiation field through binned radiation field intensities instead of the photoionization rates used in our previous work. We find a set of 6 energy bins whose intensities exhibit relatively low correlation. We use these bins as features to train machine learning models to predict Cloudy cooling and heating functions at fixed metallicity. We compare the relative SHAP importance of the features. From the SHAP analysis, we identify a feature subset of 3 energy bins ($0.5-1, 1-4$, and $13-16 \, \mathrm{Ry}$) with the largest importance and train additional models on this subset. We compare the mean squared errors and distribution of errors on both the entire training data table and a randomly selected 20% test set withheld from model training. The machine learning models trained with 3 and 6 bins, as well as 3 and 4 photoionization rates, have comparable accuracy everywhere. We conclude that 3 energy bins (or 3 analogous photoionization rates: molecular hydrogen photodissociation, neutral hydrogen HI, and fully ionized carbon CVI) are sufficient to characterize the dependence of the gas cooling and heating functions on our assumed incident radiation field model.</description>

      <title>Radio study of the Arc and the Sgr A complex near the Galactic center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio continuum and radio recombination line observations of the inner degree of the galactic center reveal a rich collection of thermal and nonthermal radio structures: (a) A network of linear filaments that are oriented perpendicular to the galactic plane constitute the major portion of the radio Arc at l~ 0.2{\deg}. These filaments have nonthermal characteristics, show polarized emission at 6, 3 and 2 cm, are organized over a 100 pc scale, and have a flat spectrum. (b) A number of thread-like filaments are situated asymmetrical with respect to the galactic plane and appear to be isolated unlike the linear filaments which are grouped together. The polarization and spectra of these so called "threads" are not yet known. (c) A network of arched filamentary structures that is disorganized in its appearance constitutes the curved portion of the Arc. Radio recombination line emission from these filaments indicates a thermal character for the emission. (d) A very steep-spectrum ridge of emission is seen to emerge from Sgr A. (e) The relative location of Sgr A East, West, a cluster of HII regions and the 50 km/s molecular cloud are discussed. Comparisons of the low and high-frequency maps show clearly that Sgr A East lies behind Sgr A West.</description>

      <title>Unobscured radio-quiet Active Galactic Nuclei under the eyes of IXPE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the results of the X-ray polarimetric analyses performed on unobscured radio-quiet Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) with the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE), with simultaneous XMM-Newton and NuSTAR data. The synergy of these instruments is crucial to constrain the X-ray corona physical properties and assess its geometry. In the first two years of operation, three AGN have been observed: significant polarization was detected for NGC 4151 (4.9$\pm$1.1 per cent) and IC 4329A (albeit with less confidence, 3.3$\pm$1.1 per cent), with polarization angles aligned with their radio jets, while only an upper limit was found for MCG-05-23-16 ($&lt;$3.2 per cent). Monte Carlo simulations, conducted to investigate the coronal geometry of these AGN, favor a radially extended corona geometry in NGC 4151 and IC 4329A, a scenario consistent also with MCG-05-23-16, if the disk inclination angle is below 50$^\circ$.</description>

      <title>Galaxy Group Ellipticity Confirms a Younger Cosmos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analysis of the ellipticities of galaxy groups, derived from the spatial distribution of member galaxies, revealing a notable incongruity between the observed local galaxy groups and their counterparts in the Lambda cold dark matter cosmology. Specifically, our investigation reveals a substantial disparity in the ellipticities of observed groups with masses \mbox{$10^{13.0}&lt;M_{\rm{h}}&lt;10^{14.5}\ {\rm M_{\odot}}\ h^{-1}$} exhibiting significantly higher ellipticities (at a confidence level of approximately $4\sigma$) compared to their simulated counterparts. Notably, the consistent use of the same group finder for identifying galaxy groups in both observational and simulated datasets underscores the robustness of this result. This observation may imply a potential incongruence between the inferred age of the Universe from observations and the predictions of the model, which aligns with the younger Universe hypothesis suggested by the elevated fraction of observed satellite pairs with correlated line-of-sight relative velocities compared to simulations. Our findings significantly strengthen the plausibility of a younger age for our Universe.</description>

      <title>The impact of shear on the rotation of Galactic plane molecular clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stars form in the densest regions of molecular clouds, however, there is no universal understanding of the factors that regulate cloud dynamics and their influence on the gas-to-stars conversion. This study considers the impact of Galactic shear on the rotation of giant molecular clouds (GMCs) and its relation to the solenoidal modes of turbulence. We estimate the direction of rotation for a large sample of clouds in the \ce{^{13}CO}/\ce{C^{18}O} (3-2) Heterodyne Inner Milky Way Plane Survey (CHIMPS) and their corresponding sources in a new segmentation of the \ce{^{12}CO}(3-2) High-Resolution Survey (COHRS). To quantify the strength of shear, we introduce a parameter that describes the shear's ability to disrupt growing density perturbations within the cloud. Although we find no correlation between the direction of cloud rotation, the shear parameter, and the magnitude of the velocity gradient, the solenoidal fraction of the turbulence in the CHIMPS sample is positively correlated with the shear parameter and behaves similarly when plotted over Galactocentric distance. GMCs may thus not be large or long-lived enough to be affected by shear to the point of showing rotational alignment. In theory, Galactic shear can facilitate the rise of solenoidal turbulence and thus contribute to suppressing star formation. These results also suggest that the rotation of clouds is not strictly related to the overall rotation of the disc, but is more likely to be the imprint of Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities in the colliding flows that formed the clouds.</description>

      <title>Shocks in the warm neutral medium II -- Origin of neutral carbon at high pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aims: Ultraviolet (UV) lines of neutral carbon observed in absorption in the local diffuse interstellar medium (ISM) have long revealed that a substantial fraction of the mass of the gas lies at a thermal pressure one to three orders of magnitude above that of the bulk of the ISM. In this paper, we propose that this enigmatic component originates from shocks propagating at intermediate ($V_S &gt; 30$ km s$^{-1}$) and high velocities ($V_S \geqslant 100$  km s$^{-1}$) in the Warm Neutral Medium (WNM).
  Methods: Shock waves irradiated by the standard interstellar radiation field (ISRF) are modelled using the Paris-Durham shock code designed to follow the dynamical, thermal, and chemical evolutions of shocks with velocities up to 500 km s$^{-1}$. Each observed line of sight is decomposed into a high pressure and a low pressure components. The column density of carbon at high pressure is confronted to the model predictions to derive the number of shocks along the line of sight and their total dissipation rate.
  Results: Phase transition shocks spontaneously lead to the presence of high pressure gas in the diffuse ISM and are found to naturally produce neutral carbon with excitation conditions and linewidths in remarkable agreement with the observations. The amounts of neutral carbon at high pressure detected over a sample of 89 lines of sight imply a dissipation rate of mechanical energy with a median of $\sim 3x10^{-25}$ erg cm$^{-3}$ s$^{-1}$ and a dispersion of about a factor of three. This distribution of the dissipation rate weakly depends on the detailed characteristics of shocks as long as they propagate at velocities between 30 and 200 kms s$^{-1}$ in a medium with a preshock density $n_H^0 \ge 0.3$ cm s$^{-3}$ and a transverse magnetic field $B_0 \leqslant 3$ $\mu$G. We not only show that this solution is consistent with a scenario of shocks driven by supernovae remnants (SNR) but also that this scenario is, in fact, unavoidable. Any line of sight in the observational sample is bound to intercept SNRs, mostly distributed in the spiral arms of the Milky Way, and expanding in the diffuse ionized and neutral phases of the Galaxy. Surprisingly, the range of dissipation rate derived here, in events that probably drive turbulence in the WNM, is found to be comparable to the distribution of the kinetic energy transfer rate of the turbulent cascade derived from the observations of CO in the Cold Neutral Medium (CNM).
  Conclusions: This work reveals a possible direct tracer of the mechanisms by which mechanical energy is injected in the ISM. It also suggests that a still unknown connection exists between the amount of energy dissipated during the injection process in the WNM and that used to feed interstellar turbulence and the turbulent cascade observed in the CNM.</description>

      <title>Spatial distribution of C4H and c-C3H2 in cold molecular cores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: C$_4$H and $c$-C$_3$H$_2$, as unsaturated hydrocarbon molecules, are important for forming large organic molecules in the interstellar medium. We present mapping observations of C$_4$H ($N$=9$-8$) lines, $c$-C$_3$H$_2$ ($J_{Ka,Kb}$=2$_{1,2}$-1$_{0,1}$) %at 85338.894 MHz and H$^{13}$CO$^+$ ($J$=1$-0$) %at 86754.2884 MHz toward 19 nearby cold molecular cores in the Milky Way with the IRAM 30m telescope. C$_4$H 9--8 was detected in 13 sources, while $c$-C$_3$H$_2$ was detected in 18 sources. The widely existing C$_4$H and $c$-C$_3$H$_2$ molecules in cold cores provide material to form large organic molecules. Different spatial distributions between C$_4$H 9--8 and $c$-C$_3$H$_2$ 2--1 were found. The relative abundances of these three molecules were obtained under the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium conditions with a fixed excitation temperature. The abundance ratio of C$_4$H to $c$-C$_3$H$_2$ ranged from 0.34 $\pm$ 0.09 in G032.93+02 to 4.65 $\pm$ 0.50 in G008.67+22. A weak correlation between C$_4$H/H$^{13}$CO$^+$ and $c$-C$_3$H$_2$/H$^{13}$CO$^+$ abundance ratios was found, with a correlation coefficient of 0.46, which indicates that there is no tight astrochemical connection between C$_4$H and $c$-C$_3$H$_2$ molecules.</description>

      <title>The MAGPI survey: The interdependence of mass, star formation rate, and metallicity in galaxies at z~0.3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.20017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.20017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Star formation rates (SFRs), gas-phase metallicities, and stellar masses are crucial for studying galaxy evolution. The different relations resulting from these properties give insights into the complex interplay of gas inside galaxies and their evolutionary trajectory and current characteristics. We aim to characterize these relations at $z\sim 0.3$, corresponding to a 3-4 Gyr lookback time. We utilize optical integral field spectroscopy of 65 emission-line galaxies from the MAGPI survey at a redshift of $0.28&lt;z&lt;0.35$ and spanning a total stellar mass range of $8.2&lt;\log(M_{*}/M_{\odot}) &lt; 11.4$. We derive the resolved star formation main sequence (rSFMS), resolved mass metallicity relation (rMZR), and resolved fundamental metallicity relation (rFMR) at $z\sim 0.3$. We find a relatively shallow rSFMS slope of $\sim 0.425 \pm 0.014$ compared to the expected slope at this redshift for an ordinary least square (OLS) fitting routine. For an orthogonal distance regression (ODR) routine, a much steeper slope of $\sim 1.162 \pm 0.022$ is measured. We confirm the existence of an rMZR at $z\sim 0.3$ with an average metallicity located $\sim 0.03$ dex above the local Universe's metallicity. Via Partial Correlation Coefficients, evidence is found that the local metallicity is predominantly determined by the stellar mass surface density and has a weak secondary (inverse) dependence on the SFR surface density $\Sigma_{SFR}$. Additionally, a significant dependence of the local metallicity on the total stellar mass $M_{*}$ is found. Furthermore, we find that the stellar mass surface density $\Sigma_{*}$ and $M_{*}$ have a significant influence in determining the strength with which $\Sigma_{SFR}$ correlates with the local metallicity. We observe that at lower stellar masses, there is a tighter correlation between $\Sigma_{SFR}$ and the gas-phase metallicity, resulting in a more pronounced rFMR.</description>

      <title>FAST survey of H I and OH absorption towards extragalactic radio sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.20026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.20026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutral atomic hydrogen and molecular gas in the host galaxies of radio active galactic nuclei (AGN) can be traced using H I 21-cm and OH-1667 MHz absorption lines to understand the fueling and feedback processes. We present the results of an H I and OH absorption survey with the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) towards 40 radio sources of low-intermediate radio luminosity ($\sim$10$^{23}$-10$^{26}$ W Hz$^{-1}$ at 1.4 GHz), red mid-infrared color (W2[4.6 $\mu$m]$-$W3[12 $\mu$m] $&gt;$ 2.5 mag) and redshift up to 0.35. From 13 sources with good data at H I observing frequencies, we report the detection of H I absorption towards 8 sources, 5 of which are new detections including 4 in the redshift range 0.25 to 0.35. Our detection rates are consistent with our previous results with dependence on the star-formation history of the host galaxy reflected in the mid-infrared \textit{WISE} W2$-$W3 colors and the compactness of the radio source. We find no significant dependence of detection rates on radio luminosity or redshift. We also find that H I column densities are anti-correlated with the low-frequency spectral indices ($\alpha_{\rm 150 MHz}^{\rm 1.4 GHz}$, $S_{\nu}\propto \nu^{-\alpha}$). We do not have any detection from 23 sources with good data at OH observing frequencies. However, by stacking the spectra we estimate the 3$\sigma$ upper limit of OH column density to be 2.27$\times$10$^{14}$$T_{\rm ex}$/10 K $\times$1/$f_{\rm c}$ cm$^{-2}$. By stacking the OH spectra for 7 associated H I absorbers, we get a 3$\sigma$ upper limit of 3.47$\times$10$^{14}$ $T_{\rm ex}$/10 K $\times$1/$f_{\rm c}$ cm$^{-2}$ on OH column density and 1.78$\times$10$^{-7}$ on [OH]/[H I] ratio.</description>

      <title>Galaxy Zoo DESI: large-scale bars as a secular mechanism for triggering AGN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.20096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.20096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the evidence that supermassive black holes (SMBHs) co-evolve with their host galaxy, and that most of the growth of these SMBHs occurs via merger-free processes, the underlying mechanisms which drive this secular co-evolution are poorly understood. We investigate the role that both strong and weak large-scale galactic bars play in mediating this relationship. Using 72,940 disc galaxies in a volume-limited sample from Galaxy Zoo DESI, we analyse the active galactic nucleus (AGN) fraction in strongly barred, weakly barred, and unbarred galaxies up to z = 0.1 over a range of stellar masses and colours. After controlling for stellar mass and colour, we find that the optically selected AGN fraction is 31.6 +/- 0.9 per cent in strongly barred galaxies, 23.3 +/- 0.8 per cent in weakly barred galaxies, and 14.2 +/- 0.6 per cent in unbarred disc galaxies. These are highly statistically robust results, strengthening the tantalising results in earlier works. Strongly barred galaxies have a higher fraction of AGNs than weakly barred galaxies, which in turn have a higher fraction than unbarred galaxies. Thus, while bars are not required in order to grow a SMBH in a disc galaxy, large-scale galactic bars appear to facilitate AGN fuelling, and the presence of a strong bar makes a disc galaxy more than twice as likely to host an AGN than an unbarred galaxy at all galaxy stellar masses and colours.</description>

      <title>pop-cosmos: Scaleable inference of galaxy properties and redshifts with a data-driven population model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an efficient Bayesian method for estimating individual photometric redshifts and galaxy properties under a pre-trained population model (pop-cosmos) that was calibrated using purely photometric data. This model specifies a prior distribution over 16 stellar population synthesis (SPS) parameters using a score-based diffusion model, and includes a data model with detailed treatment of nebular emission. We use a GPU-accelerated affine invariant ensemble sampler to achieve fast posterior sampling under this model for 292,300 individual galaxies in the COSMOS2020 catalog, leveraging a neural network emulator (Speculator) to speed up the SPS calculations. We apply both the pop-cosmos population model and a baseline prior inspired by Prospector-$\alpha$, and compare these results to published COSMOS2020 redshift estimates from the widely-used EAZY and LePhare codes. For the $\sim 12,000$ galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts, we find that pop-cosmos yields redshift estimates that have minimal bias ($\sim10^{-4}$), high accuracy ($\sigma_\text{MAD}=7\times10^{-3}$), and a low outlier rate ($1.6\%$). We show that the pop-cosmos population model generalizes well to galaxies fainter than its $r&lt;25$ mag training set. The sample we have analyzed is $\gtrsim3\times$ larger than has previously been possible via posterior sampling with a full SPS model, with average throughput of 15 GPU-sec per galaxy under the pop-cosmos prior, and 0.6 GPU-sec per galaxy under the Prospector prior. This paves the way for principled modeling of the huge catalogs expected from upcoming Stage IV galaxy surveys.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: SDSS-V is carrying out a dedicated survey for white dwarfs, single and in binaries, and we report the analysis of the spectroscopy of 505 cataclysmic variables (CVs) and CV candidates obtained during the first 34 months of observations of SDSS-V. We developed a convolutional neural network (CNN) to aid with the identification of CV candidates among the over 2 million SDSS-V spectra obtained with the BOSS spectrograph. The CNN reduced the number of spectra that required visual inspection to $\simeq2$ per cent of the total. We identified 779 CV spectra among the CNN-selected candidates, plus an additional 37 CV spectra that the CNN misclassified, but that were found serendipitously by human inspection of the data. Analysing the SDSS-V spectroscopy and ancillary data of the 505 CVs in our sample, we report 62 new CVs, spectroscopically confirm 243 and refute 13 published CV candidates, and we report 68 new or improved orbital periods. We discuss the completeness and possible selection biases of the machine learning methodology, as well as the effectiveness of targeting CV candidates within SDSS-V. Finally, we re-assess the space density of CVs, and find $1.3\times 10^{-5}\,\mathrm{pc^{-3}}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Young associations record complete histories of star forming events through their demographics and dynamics, and Gaia has greatly expanded our knowledge of these associations. We present the first structural and dynamical overview study of the Cep-Her Complex, which has recently emerged as the largest stellar population within 500 pc that still lacks substantial follow-up. We reveal that Cep-Her is not a singular association, but rather an amalgam of four, consisting of the older ($\tau &gt; 100$ Myr) open cluster Roslund 6, in addition to three dynamically coherent and highly substructured young associations that we focus on: Orpheus (25-40 Myr), Cinyras (28-43 Myr), and Cupavo (54-80 Myr). With $9552 \pm 960$ stars in Orpheus, $3872 \pm 455$ stars in Cinyras, and $8794 \pm 1827$ stars in Cupavo, all three are among the largest young associations within 500 pc, rivalling major associations like Sco-Cen. Our novel view of the ages and dynamics of these associations reveals evidence for sequential star formation in Cinyras, in addition to a multi-origin pattern of stellar dispersal in Orpheus that may hint to the presence of multiple clouds at formation. Dynamical simulations indicate that while some embedded open clusters and central components of these associations are converging, they likely lack the mass necessary to capture one another and undergo hierarchical cluster assembly. Our results provide our first view of the complex star-forming environments that gave rise to the associations of Cep-Her, which will serve as important laboratories for future studies of star and planet formation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AGN bubbles in cool-core galaxy clusters are believed to significantly facilitate the transport of cosmic ray electrons (CRe) throughout the cluster. Recent radio observations are revealing complex morphologies of cluster diffuse emission, potentially linked to interactions between AGN bursts and the cluster environment. We perform three-dimensional magneto-hydrodynamical simulations of binary cluster mergers and inject a bi-directional jet at the center of the main cluster. Kinetic, thermal, magnetic and CRe energy are included in the jet and we use the two-fluid formalism to model the CRe component. We explore a wide range of cluster merger and jet parameters. We discuss the formation of various wide-angle-tail (WAT) and X-shaped sources in the course of the early evolution of the jet and merger. During the last phase of the evolution, we find that the CR material efficiently permeates the central region of the cluster reaching radii of $\sim1$--2 Mpc within $\sim5$--6 Gyr, depending on the merger mass ratio. We find that solenoidal turbulence dominates during the binary merger and explore the possibility for the CRe jet material to be re-accelerated by super-Alfv\`enic turbulence and contribute to cluster scale radio emission. We find that the emission can be volume-filing, $\gtrsim 70$\%. Finally, we study the merger shock interaction with the CRe material and show that it is unlikely that this material significantly contributes to the radio relic emission associated with the shocks. We suggest that multiple jet outbursts and/or off-center radio galaxies would increase the likelihood of detecting these merger shocks in the radio due to shock re-acceleration.</description>

      <title>[OIII] 5007 emissions in extremely red quasars (ERQs) are compact</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.03917v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: ``Extremely red quasars'' (ERQs) are a non-radio-selected, intrinsically luminous population of quasars at cosmic noon selected by their extremely red colour from rest-frame UV to mid-IR. ERQs are uniquely associated with exceptionally broad and blueshifted [OIII] 5007 emission reaching speeds &gt;6000 km s^-1. We obtained adaptive optics integral-field spectroscopic observations using Keck/OSIRIS and Gemini/NIFS of a sample of 10 ERQs with bolometric luminosities (10^47.0-10^47.9) erg s^-1 at z ~(2.3-3.0). The goal is to measure the sizes and spatially-resolved kinematics of the [OIII]-emitting regions. We study the surface brightness maps and aperture-extracted spectra and model the point-spread functions. We identify signs of merger activities in the continuum emissions. We identify physically distinct [OIII] kinematic components that are bimodal and respectively trace ERQ-driven outflows of velocity dispersion &gt;250 km s^-1 and dynamically quiescent interstellar media. We find that the ERQ-driven ionized outflows are typically at ~1 kpc scales whereas the quiescent ionized gas extend to a few kpc. Compared to normal quasars the extremely fast ERQ-driven [OIII] outflows tend to be more compact, supporting the notion that ERQs are in a young stage of quasar/galaxy evolution and represent systems with unique physical conditions beyond orientation differences with normal quasar populations. The kinematically quiescent [OIII] emissions in ERQs tend to be spatially-resolved but less extended than in normal quasars, which can be explained by global and patchy dust obscuration. The hint of ionization cones suggests some of the obscuration can be partially explained by a patchy torus.</description>

Abstract: We used low- to high-frequency ALMA observations to investigate the cold gas and dust in ten QSOs at $z\gtrsim 6$. Our analysis of the CO(6-5) and CO(7-6) emission lines in the selected QSOs provided insights into their molecular gas masses, which average around $10^{10}\ \rm M_\odot$, consistent with typical values for high-redshift QSOs. Proprietary and archival ALMA observations in bands 8 and 9 enabled precise constraints on the dust properties and star formation rate (SFR) of four QSOs in our sample for the first time. The examination of the redshift distribution of dust temperatures revealed a general trend of increasing $T_{\rm dust}$ with redshift, which agrees with theoretical expectations. We computed a mean cold dust spectral energy distribution considering all ten QSOs. This offers a comprehensive view of the dust properties of high-$z$ QSOs. The QSOs marked by a more intense growth of the supermassive black hole (HYPERION QSOs) showed lower dust masses and higher gas-to-dust ratios on average, but their $\rm H_2$ gas reservoirs are consistent with those of other QSOs at the same redshift. The observed high SFR in our sample yields high SF efficiencies and thus very short gas depletion timescales ($\tau_{\rm dep}\sim 10^{-2}$ Gyr). Beyond supporting the paradigm that high-$z$ QSOs reside in highly star-forming galaxies, our findings portrayed an interesting evolutionary path at $z&gt;6$. Our study suggests that they are undergoing rapid galaxy growth that might be regulated by strong outflows. Their inferred evolutionary path shows a convergence toward the massive end of the local relation, which supports the idea that they are candidate progenitors of local massive galaxies. The observed pathway involves intense BH growth followed by substantial galaxy growth, in contrast with a symbiotic growth scenario.

      <title>Understanding the Multi-wavelength Thermal Dust Polarisation from the Orion Molecular Cloud in Light of the Radiative Torque Paradigm</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17088v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dust grains are important in various astrophysical processes and serve as indicators of interstellar medium structures, density, and mass. Understanding their physical properties and chemical composition is crucial in astrophysics. Dust polarisation is a valuable tool for studying these properties. The Radiative Torque (RAT) paradigm, which includes Radiative Torque Alignment (RAT-A) and Radiative Torque Disruption (RAT-D), is essential to interpret the dust polarisation data and constrain the fundamental properties of dust grains. However, it has been used primarily to interpret observations at a single wavelength. In this study, we analyse the thermal dust polarisation spectrum obtained from observations with SOFIA/HAWC+ and JCMT/POL-2 in the OMC-1 region and compare the observational data with our numerical results using the RAT paradigm. In general, we show that the dense gas exhibits a positive spectral slope, whereas the warm regions show a negative one. We demonstrate that a one-layer dust (one-phase) model can only reproduce the observed spectra at certain locations and cannot match those with prominent V-shaped spectra (for which the degree of polarisation initially decreases with wavelength from 54 to $\sim$ 300$\,\mu$m and then increases at longer wavelengths). To address this, we improve our model by incorporating two dust components (warm and cold) along the line of sight, resulting in a two-phase model. This improved model successfully reproduces the V-shaped spectra. The best model corresponds to a mixture composition of silicate and carbonaceous grains in the cold medium. Finally, by assuming the plausible model of grain alignment, we infer the inclination angle of the magnetic fields in OMC-1. This approach represents an important step towards better understanding the physics of grain alignment and constraining 3D magnetic fields using dust polarisation spectra.</description>

      <title>UVCANDELS: The role of dust on the stellar mass-size relation of disk galaxies at 0.5 $\leq z \leq$ 3.0</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10908v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use the Ultraviolet Imaging of the Cosmic Assembly Near-infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey fields (UVCANDELS) to measure half-light radii in the rest-frame far-UV for $\sim$16,000 disk-like galaxies over $0.5\leq z \leq 3$. We compare these results to rest-frame optical sizes that we measure in a self-consistent way and find that the stellar mass-size relation of disk galaxies is steeper in the rest-frame UV than in the optical across our entire redshift range. We show that this is mainly driven by massive galaxies ($\gtrsim10^{10}$M$_\odot$), which we find to also be among the most dusty. Our results are consistent with the literature and have commonly been interpreted as evidence of inside-out growth wherein galaxies form their central structures first. However, they could also suggest that the centers of massive galaxies are more heavily attenuated than their outskirts. We distinguish between these scenarios by modeling and selecting galaxies at $z=2$ from the VELA simulation suite in a way that is consistent with UVCANDELS. We show that the effects of dust alone can account for the size differences we measure at $z=2$. This indicates that, at different wavelengths, size differences and the different slopes of the stellar mass-size relation do not constitute evidence for inside-out growth.</description>

      <title>The size of the Milky Way galaxy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05604v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The size of a galaxy is one of the fundamental parameters that reflects its growth and assembly history. Traditionally, the size of the Milky Way has been characterized by the scale length of the disk, based on the assumption of an exponential density profile. Earlier scale length measurements suggest the Milky Way is an overly compact galaxy, compared to similar galaxies of its mass. These size measurements, however, ignore the presence of the bulge, and the assumption of a single-exponential disk profile faces growing challenges from the recent observations. The half-light radius is an alternative size measurement that is independent of the galaxy density profile and has been widely used to quantify the size of external galaxies. Here we report the half-light radius of the Milky Way, derived from a new measurement of the age-resolved Galactic surface brightness profile in an unprecedentedly wide radial range from ${\rm R=0}$ to 17~kpc. We find a broken surface brightness profile with a nearly flat distribution between 3.5 and 7.5 kpc, which results in a half-light radius of 5.75$\pm$0.38 kpc, significantly larger than the scale-length inferred from the canonical single-exponential disk profile but in good consistency with local disk galaxies of similar mass. Because our density profile can be decomposed by stellar age and extrapolated backwards in time, we can also confirm that the size history of the Milky Way is broadly consistent with high-redshift galaxies but with systematically smaller size at each look back time. Our results suggest that the Milky Way is a typical disk galaxy regarding its size and has likely experienced inefficient secular size growth.</description>

      <title>Deriving the star formation histories of galaxies from spectra with simulation-based inference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18661v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-resolution galaxy spectra encode information about the stellar populations within galaxies. The properties of the stars, such as their ages, masses, and metallicities, provide insights into the underlying physical processes that drive the growth and transformation of galaxies over cosmic time.
  We explore a simulation-based inference (SBI) workflow to infer from optical absorption spectra the posterior distributions of metallicities and the star formation histories (SFHs) of galaxies (i.e. the star formation rate as a function of time).
  We generated a dataset of synthetic spectra to train and test our model using the spectroscopic predictions of the MILES stellar population library and non-parametric SFHs. We reliably estimate the mass assembly of an integrated stellar population with well-calibrated uncertainties. Specifically, we reach a score of $0.97\,R^2$ for the time at which a given galaxy from the test set formed $50\%$ of its stellar mass, obtaining samples of the posteriors in only $10^{-4}$\,s. We then applied the pipeline to real observations of massive elliptical galaxies, recovering the well-known relationship between the age and the velocity dispersion, and show that the most massive galaxies ($\sigma\sim300$ km/s) built up to 90\% of their total stellar masses within $1$\,Gyr of the Big Bang. The inferred properties also agree with the state-of-the-art inversion codes, but the inference is performed up to five orders of magnitude faster.
  This SBI approach coupled with machine learning and applied to full spectral fitting makes it possible to address large numbers of galaxies while performing a thick sampling of the posteriors. It will allow both the deterministic trends and the inherent uncertainties of the highly degenerated inversion problem to be estimated for large and complex upcoming spectroscopic surveys, such as DESI, WEAVE, or 4MOST.</description>

      <title>The orbital evolution of the tidally stripped star and disk-driven stable mass transfer for QPEs in GSN 069</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07177v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The origin of the quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) is possibly mass loss at the periastron of a body moving around the supermassive black hole (SMBH) in a high eccentric orbit. Such a tidally stripped star is expected to radiate gravitational wave thereby leading to shrinkage of the periastron distance, and thus will eventually be disrupted by the SMBH in the previous studies. This scenario predicts a gradually increasing mass transfer, contradicting the long term evolution of the observed intensity of the QPEs in GSN 069.In this paper, we first revisited the orbital evolution of the stripped star. Then we suggested a model of a tidal stripped WD moving inside an accretion disk for QPEs in GSN 069.We found the effect of the mass transfer finally dominates the orbital evolution, resulting in the stripped star finally escaping the SMBH rather than being disrupted by it. The drag force by the disk can effectively reduce mass transfer and thus explain the observed long term evolution in the intensity of the QPEs in GSN 069. The disk is likely a fallback disk of the tidal disruption event in GSN 069. Considering the evolution of its accretion rate, the increase in the intensity of the latest eruption can also be explained.</description>

      <title>Shaping the nebula around the symbiotic system R Aquarii</title>

Abstract: We present an analysis of high-dispersion spectroscopic observations of the symbiotic system R Aquarii (R Aqr) obtained with the Manchester Echelle Spectrograph (MES) at the 2.1 m telescope of the San Pedro M\'artir Observatory (Mexico). An interpretation of these data is presented by means of the shape software to disclose the morpho-kinematics of the nebulosities associated with R Aqr. The best model that reproduces narrow-band images and position-velocity diagrams is composed by three structures: an outer (large) hourglass structure surrounding an inner bipolar with a spiral-like filament entwined around the later. Different expansion velocity patterns are predefined for each structure, which predict kinematic ages of $\tau_{1}$=450$\pm$25 yr (outer hourglass), $\tau_{2}$=240$\pm$20 yr (inner bipolar) and $\tau_{3}$=215$\pm$20 yr (spiral-like filament). We suggest that the spiral-like filament is tracing the regions of interaction of the precessing jet with the circumstellar material, which simultaneously carves the inner bipolar structure. If a similar process created the large hourglass structure, it means that the action of the jet ceased for about 230 yr. We discuss the implication for other unresolved symbiotic systems detected in X-rays.</description>

      <title>Damping Wing-Like Features in the Stacked Ly$\alpha$ Forest: Potential Neutral Hydrogen Islands at $z&lt;6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12275</link>

Abstract: Recent quasar absorption line observations suggest that reionization may end as late as $z \approx 5.3$. As a means to search for large neutral hydrogen islands at $z&lt;6$, we revisit long dark gaps in the Ly$\beta$ forest in VLT/X-Shooter and Keck/ESI quasar spectra. We stack the Ly$\alpha$ forest corresponding to both edges of these Ly$\beta$ dark gaps and identify a damping wing-like extended absorption profile. The average redshift of the stacked forest is $z=5.8$. By comparing these observations with reionization simulations, we infer that such a damping wing-like feature can be naturally explained if these gaps are at least partially created by neutral islands. Conversely, simulated dark gaps lacking neutral hydrogen struggle to replicate the observed damping wing features. Furthermore, this damping wing-like profile implies that the volume-averaged neutral hydrogen fraction must be $\langle x_{\rm HI} \rangle \geq 6.1 \pm 3.9\%$ at $z = 5.8$. Our results offer robust evidence that reionization extends below $z=6$.</description>

      <title>Repeating nuclear transients from repeating partial tidal disruption events: reproducing ASASSN-14ko and AT2020vdq</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03675v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Some electromagnetic outbursts from the nuclei of distant galaxies have been found to repeat on months-to-years timescales, and each of these sources can putatively arise from the accretion flares generated through the repeated tidal stripping of a star on a bound orbit about a supermassive black hole (SMBH), i.e., a repeating partial tidal disruption event (rpTDE). Here we test the rpTDE model through analytical estimates and hydrodynamical simulations of the interaction between a range of stars, which differ from one another in mass and age, and an SMBH. We show that higher-mass ($\gtrsim 1 M_{\odot}$), evolved stars can survive many ($\gtrsim 10-100$) encounters with an SMBH while simultaneously losing $few \times 0.01 M_{\odot}$, resulting in accretion flares that are approximately evenly spaced in time with nearly the same amplitude, quantitatively reproducing ASASSN-14ko. We also show that the energy imparted to the star via tides can lead to a change in its orbital period that is comparable to the observed decay in the recurrence time of ASASSN-14ko's flares, $\dot{P}\simeq-0.0026$. Contrarily, lower-mass and less-evolved stars lose progressively more mass and produce brighter accretion flares on subsequent encounters for the same pericenter distances, leading to the rapid destruction of the star and cessation of flares. Such systems cannot reproduce ASASSN-14ko-like transients, but are promising candidates for recreating events such as AT2020vdq, which displayed a second and much brighter outburst compared to the first. Our results imply that the lightcurves of repeating transients are tightly coupled with stellar type.</description>
