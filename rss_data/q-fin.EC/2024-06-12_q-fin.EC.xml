      <title>Interconnected Markets: Exploring the Dynamic Relationship Between BRICS Stock Markets and Cryptocurrency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study uses data from the BRICS stock market index, cryptocurrencies, and investor sentiment indicators from January 6, 2015, to June 29, 2023. BRICS nations emerge as pivotal representatives of emerging economies. This study employs a time-varying parameter vector autoregression model to unravel the intricate interdependence between traditional stock assets and the evolving landscape of cryptocurrencies. The analysis investigates spillover effects between BRICS stock markets and cryptocurrencies, revealing increasing interconnectedness during highly uncertain events like COVID-19, but no significant impact on major US stock market indices.</description>

      <title>Long-Term Effects of Hiring Subsidies for Low-Educated Unemployed Youths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use regression discontinuity design and difference-in-differences methods to estimate the impact of a one-time hiring subsidy for low-educated unemployed youths in Belgium during the recovery from the Great Recession. Within a year of unemployment, the subsidy increases job-finding in the private sector by 10 percentage points. Over six years, high school graduates secure 2.8 more quarters of private employment. However, they transition from public jobs and self-employment, resulting in no net increase in overall employment, albeit with better wages. High school dropouts experience no lasting benefits. Additionally, in tight labor markets near Luxembourg's employment hub, the subsidy results in a complete deadweight loss.</description>

      <title>Is the EJRA proportionate and therefore justified? A critical review of the EJRA policy at Cambridge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14611v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper critically evaluates the HESA (Higher Education Statistics Agency) Data Report for the Employer Justified Retirement Age (EJRA) Review Group at the University of Cambridge (\cite{CambridgeHESA2024}), identifying significant methodological flaws and misinterpretations. Our analysis reveals issues such as unclear application of data filters, inconsistent variable treatment, and erroneous statistical conclusions. The Report suggests that the EJRA increased job creation rates at Cambridge, but we show Cambridge consistently had lower job creation rates for Established Academic Careers compared to other Russell Group universities, both before and after EJRA implementation in 2011, with no evidence for a significant change in this deficit post implementation. This suggests that EJRA is not a significant factor driving job creation rates. Since other universities without an EJRA exhibit higher job creation rates, this suggests job creation can be sustained without such a policy. We conclude that the EJRA did not achieve its intended goal of increasing opportunities for young academics and may have exacerbated existing disparities compared to other leading universities. We recommend EJRA be abolished at Cambridge since it does not meet its aims and could be viewed as unlawful age discrimination.\newline \it{This version is a revision reflecting some of the comments made by members of the university EJRA review group in public discussion, see \cite{Holmes24}.}</description>
