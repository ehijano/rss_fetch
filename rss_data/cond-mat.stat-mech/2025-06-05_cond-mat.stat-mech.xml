      <title>Tensor Renormalization Group Meets Computer Assistance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tensor renormalization group, originally devised as a numerical technique, is emerging as a rigorous analytical framework for studying lattice models in statistical physics. Here we introduce a new renormalization map - the 2x1 map - which coarse-grains the lattice anisotropically by a factor of two in one direction followed by a 90-degree rotation. We develop a novel graphical language that translates the action of the 2x1 map into a system of inequalities on tensor components, with rigorous estimates in the Hilbert-Schmidt norm. We define a finite-dimensional "bounding box" called the hat-tensor, and a master function governing its RG flow. Iterating this function numerically, we establish convergence to the high-temperature fixed point for tensors lying within a quantifiable neighborhood. Our main theorem shows that tensors with deviations bounded by 0.02 in 63 orthogonal sectors flow to the fixed point. We also apply the method to specific models - the 2D Ising and XY models - obtaining explicit bounds on their high-temperature phase. This work brings the Tensor RG program closer towards a rigorous, computer-assisted construction of critical fixed points.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the different scaling regimes of the one-dimensional Kardar-Parisi-Zhang--Burgers equation using the functional renormalisation group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation is a celebrated non-linear stochastic equation featuring non-equilibrium scaling. Although in one dimension, its statistical properties are very well understood, a new scaling regime has been reported in recent numerical simulations. This new regime is characterised by a dynamical exponent $z=1$, markedly different from the expected one $z=3/2$ for the KPZ universality class, and it emerges when approaching the inviscid limit. The origin of this scaling has been traced down to the existence of a new fixed point, termed the inviscid Burgers (IB) fixed point, which was uncovered using the functional renormalisation group (FRG). The FRG equations can be solved analytically in the asymptotic regime of vanishing viscosity and large momenta, showing that indeed $z=1$ exactly at the IB fixed point. In this work, we set up an advanced method to numerically solve the full FRG flow equations in a certain approximation, which allows us to determine in a unified way the correlation function over the whole range of momenta, not restricted to some particular regime. We analyse the crossover between the different fixed points, and quantitatively determine the extent of the IB regime.</description>

      <title>Dreaming up scale invariance via inverse renormalization group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore how minimal neural networks can invert the renormalization group (RG) coarse-graining procedure in the two-dimensional Ising model, effectively "dreaming up" microscopic configurations from coarse-grained states. This task-formally impossible at the level of configurations-can be approached probabilistically, allowing machine learning models to reconstruct scale-invariant distributions without relying on microscopic input. We demonstrate that even neural networks with as few as three trainable parameters can learn to generate critical configurations, reproducing the scaling behavior of observables such as magnetic susceptibility, heat capacity, and Binder ratios. A real-space renormalization group analysis of the generated configurations confirms that the models capture not only scale invariance but also reproduce nontrivial eigenvalues of the RG transformation. Surprisingly, we find that increasing network complexity by introducing multiple layers offers no significant benefit. These findings suggest that simple local rules, akin to those generating fractal structures, are sufficient to encode the universality of critical phenomena, opening the door to efficient generative models of statistical ensembles in physics.</description>

      <title>Fluctuations in the number of local minima in discrete-time fractional Brownian motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The analysis of local minima in time series data and random landscapes is essential across numerous scientific disciplines, offering critical insights into system dynamics. Recently, Kundu, Majumdar, and Schehr derived the exact distribution of the number of local minima for a broad class of Markovian symmetric walks [Phys. Rev. E \textbf{110}, 024137 (2024)]; however, many real-world systems are non-Markovian, typically due to interactions with possibly hidden degrees of freedom. This work investigates the statistical properties of local minima in discrete-time samples of fractional Brownian motion (fBm), a non-Markovian Gaussian process with stationary increments, widely used to model complex, anomalous diffusion phenomena. We derive expressions for the variance of the number of local minima $m_N$ in an $N$-step discrete-time fBm. In contrast to the mean of $m_N$, which depends solely on nearest-neighbor correlations, the variance captures all long-range correlations inherent in fBm. Remarkably, we find that the variance exhibits two distinct scaling regimes: for Hurst exponent $H &lt; 3/4$, $\mathrm{Var}(m_N) \propto N$, conforming to the central limit theorem (CLT); whereas for $H &gt; 3/4$, $\mathrm{Var}(m_N) \propto N^{4H-2}$, resulting in the breakdown of the CLT. These findings are supported by numerical simulations and provide deeper insight into the interplay between memory effects and statistical fluctuations in non-Markovian processes.</description>

      <title>Universal Resources for QAOA and Quantum Annealing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a variational ansatz that resembles the Trotterized dynamics of a Quantum Annealing (QA) protocol. This work formalizes this connection formally and empirically, showing the angles of a multilayer QAOA circuit converge to universal QA trajectories. Furthermore, the errors in both QAOA circuits and QA paths act as thermal excitations in pseudo-Boltzmann probability distributions whose temperature decreases with the invested resource -- i.e. integrated angles or total time -- and which in QAOA also contain a higher temperature arising from the Trotterization. This also means QAOA and QA are cooling protocols and simulators of partition functions whose target temperature can be tuned by rescaling the universal trajectory. The average cooling power of both methods exhibits favorable algebraic scalings with respect to the target temperature and problem size, whereby in QAOA the coldest temperature is inversely proportional to the number of layers, $T\sim 1/p$, and to the integrated angles -- or integrated interactions in QA.</description>

      <title>Theory of Angle Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy of Altermagnetic Mott Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Altermagnetism has emerged as an unconventional form of collinear magnetism with spatial rotational symmetries, that give rise to strongly spin-split bands despite of an underlying fully-compensated antiferromagnetic order. Here, we develop a theory for the Angle Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy (ARPES) response of altermagnetic Mott insulators. Crucially, the spectrum does not simply reflect the non-interacting band structure, but instead a magnetic polaron is formed at low energies, that can be interpreted as a spinon-holon bound state. We develop a spinon-holon parton theory and predict a renormalized bandwidth that we confirm by tensor network simulations. We analyze the characteristic spin-split spectrum and identify a spin-dependent spectral weight of the magnetic polaron, resulting from the altermagnetic symmetry. Our work paves the way for a systematic study of doping effects and correlation phenomena in altermagnetic Mott insulators.</description>

      <title>Fast offline decoding with local message-passing automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a local offline decoder for topological codes that operates according to a parallelized message-passing framework. The decoder works by passing messages between anyons, with the contents of received messages used to move nearby anyons towards one another. We prove the existence of a threshold, and show that in a system of linear size $L$, decoding terminates with an $O((\log L)^\eta)$ average-case runtime, where $\eta$ is a small constant. For i.i.d Pauli noise, our decoder has $\eta=1$ and a threshold at a noise strength of $p_c\approx 7.3\%$.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics and Statistical Equilibrium of Large-Scale Hydroelastic Wave Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03353v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how statistical equilibrium can occur in out-of-equilibrium systems is of paramount interest, as it would enable the use of statistical mechanics tools to these systems. Here, we report the first experimental evidence of statistical equilibrium of the large scales of hydroelastic turbulent waves driven by small-scale random forcing. The wave field statistics at scales larger than the forcing scale, resolved in space and time, align well with the predictions of Rayleigh-Jeans equilibrium spectra over more than a decade. We measure zero net energy flux in this regime, as expected. We also determine the effective temperature, entropy, and heat capacity of this nonequilibrium system, demonstrating that classical thermodynamic concepts apply to describe large scales in statistical equilibrium of turbulent systems.</description>

      <title>Robust Scaling in Human Brain Dynamics Despite Latent Variables and Limited Sampling Distortions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The idea that information-processing systems operate near criticality to enhance computational performance is supported by scaling signatures in brain activity. However, external signals raise the question of whether this behavior is intrinsic or input-driven. We show that autocorrelated inputs and temporal resolution influence observed scaling exponents in simple neural models. We also demonstrate analytically that under subsampling, non-critical systems driven by independent autocorrelated signals can exhibit strong signatures of apparent criticality. To address these pitfalls, we develop a robust framework and apply it to pooled neural data, revealing resting-state brain activity at the population level is slightly sub-critical yet near-critical. Notably, the extracted critical exponents closely match predictions from a simple recurrent firing-rate model, supporting the emergence of near-critical dynamics from reverberant network activity, with potential implications for information processing and artificial intelligence.</description>

      <title>The Yang-Baxter integrability of the critical Ising chain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the one dimensional, critical transverse field Ising model is Yang-Baxter integrable. This is done by constructing commuting transfer matrices built out of a $R$-matrix satisfying the Yang-Baxter equation with additive spectral parameters. The $R$-matrix is non-local, as it is expressed in terms of Majorana fermions. It is also non-regular. Nevertheless, we show that the quantum inverse scattering method can still be suitably adapted. We then recursively obtain the conserved quantities [in the infinite volume] by the boost operator method. Remarkably, among the conserved charges we also find the Kramers-Wannier duality and other non-invertible symmetries for the periodic transverse field Ising model.</description>

      <title>Learning-at-Criticality in Large Language Models for Quantum Field Theory and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03703v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fundamental physics often confronts complex symbolic problems with few guiding exemplars or established principles. While artificial intelligence (AI) offers promise, its typical need for vast datasets to learn from hinders its use in these information-scarce frontiers. We introduce learning at criticality (LaC), a reinforcement learning (RL) scheme that tunes Large Language Models (LLMs) to a sharp learning transition, addressing this information scarcity. At this transition, LLMs achieve peak generalization from minimal data, exemplified by 7-digit base-7 addition -- a test of nontrivial arithmetic reasoning. To elucidate this peak, we analyze a minimal concept-network model (CoNet) designed to capture the essence of how LLMs might link tokens. Trained on a single exemplar, this model also undergoes a sharp learning transition. This transition exhibits hallmarks of a second-order phase transition, notably power-law distributed solution path lengths. At this critical point, the system maximizes a ``critical thinking pattern" crucial for generalization, enabled by the underlying scale-free exploration. This suggests LLMs reach peak performance by operating at criticality, where such explorative dynamics enable the extraction of underlying operational rules. We demonstrate LaC in quantum field theory: an 8B-parameter LLM, tuned to its critical point by LaC using a few exemplars of symbolic Matsubara sums, solves unseen, higher-order problems, significantly outperforming far larger models. LaC thus leverages critical phenomena, a physical principle, to empower AI for complex, data-sparse challenges in fundamental physics.</description>

      <title>{\guillemotleft}Anticommuting{\guillemotright} $\mathbb{Z}_2$ quantum spin liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss a class of lattice $S=\frac{1}{2}$ quantum Hamiltonians with bond-dependent Ising couplings with a mutually {\guillemotleft}anticommuting{\guillemotright} algebra of extensively many local $\mathbb{Z}_2$ conserved charges that was introduced in [arXiv:2407.06236] including the nomenclature. This mutual algebra is reminiscent of the spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ Pauli matrix algebra but encoded in the structure of \emph{local conserved charges}. These models have finite residual entropy density in the ground state with a simple but non-trivial degeneracy counting and concomitant quantum spin liquidity as proved in [arXiv:2407.06236]. The spin liquidity relies on a geometrically site-interlinked character of the local conserved $\mathbb{Z}_2$ charges that is rather natural in presence of an {\guillemotleft}anticommuting{\guillemotright} structure. One may contrast this with say the bond-interlinked character of the local conserved $\mathbb{Z}_2$ charges on the hexagonal plaquettes of the Kitaev honeycomb spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ model which leads to a mutually commuting local algebra. In this work, we elucidate the differences of this kind of quantum spin liquidity in relation to many-body topological order found in some gapped quantum spin liquids whose canonical example is the Kitaev toric code. The toric code belongs to the more general class of Levin-Wen or string net constructions that possess mutually commuting algebras for the local conserved charges. We will make several exact statements on the kinds of many-body order that can be present within the class of {\guillemotleft}anticommuting{\guillemotright} $\mathbb{Z}_2$ quantum spin liquids co-existing with extensive residual ground state entropy. We will also point out a mutually commuting algebra with local support that are naturally expressed as multi-linear Majorana forms in the Kitaev representation of these quantum spin liquids.</description>

      <title>Estimation of the reduced density matrix and entanglement entropies using autoregressive networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an application of autoregressive neural networks to Monte Carlo simulations of quantum spin chains using the correspondence with classical two-dimensional spin systems. We use a hierarchy of neural networks capable of estimating conditional probabilities of consecutive spins to evaluate elements of reduced density matrices directly. Using the Ising chain as an example, we calculate the continuum limit of the ground state's von Neumann and R\'enyi bipartite entanglement entropies of an interval built of up to 5 spins. We demonstrate that our architecture is able to estimate all the needed matrix elements with just a single training for a fixed time discretization and lattice volume. Our method can be applied to other types of spin chains, possibly with defects, as well as to estimating entanglement entropies of thermal states at non-zero temperature.</description>

      <title>Finding signatures of low-dimensional geometric landscapes in high-dimensional cell fate transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multicellular organisms develop a wide variety of highly-specialized cell types. The consistency and robustness of developmental cell fate trajectories suggests that complex gene regulatory networks effectively act as low-dimensional cell fate landscapes. A complementary set of works draws on the theory of dynamical systems to argue that cell fate transitions can be categorized into universal decision-making classes. However, the theory connecting geometric landscapes and decision-making classes to high-dimensional gene expression space is still in its infancy. Here, we introduce a phenomenological model that allows us to identify gene expression signatures of decision-making classes from single-cell RNA-sequencing time-series data. Our model combines low-dimensional gradient-like dynamical systems and high-dimensional Hopfield networks to capture the interplay between cell fate, gene expression, and signaling pathways. We apply our model to the maturation of alveolar cells in mouse lungs to show that the transient appearance of a mixed alveolar type 1/type 2 state suggests the triple cusp decision-making class. We also analyze lineage-tracing data on hematopoetic differentiation and show that bipotent neutrophil-monocyte progenitors likely undergo a heteroclinic flip bifurcation. Our results suggest it is possible to identify universal decision-making classes for cell fate transitions directly from data.</description>

      <title>Topological Mixed States: Axiomatic Approaches and Phases of Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For closed quantum systems, topological orders are understood through the equivalence classes of ground states of gapped local Hamiltonians. The generalization of this conceptual paradigm to open quantum systems, however, remains elusive, often relying on operational definitions without fundamental principles. Here, we fill this gap by proposing an approach based on three axioms: ($i$) local recoverability, ($ii$) absence of long-range correlations, and ($iii$) spatial uniformity. States that satisfy these axioms are fixed points; requiring the axioms only after coarse-graining promotes each fixed point to an equivalence class, i.e. a phase, presenting the first step towards the axiomatic classification of mixed-state phases of matter: \emph{mixed-state bootstrap program}.
  From these axioms, a rich set of topological data naturally emerges. For example, each topological mixed state supports locally indistinguishable classical and/or quantum logical memories with distinct responses to topological operations. These data label distinct mixed-state phases, allowing one to distinguish them. We further uncover a hierarchy of secret-sharing constraints: in non-Abelian phases, reliable recovery-even of information that looks purely classical -- demands a specific coordination among spatial subregions, a requirement different across non-Abelian classes. This originates from non-Abelian fusion rules that can stay robust under decoherence. Finally, we performed large-scale numerical simulations to corroborate stability-weakly decohered fixed points respect the axioms once coarse-grained. These results lay the foundation for a systematic classification of topological states in open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>A new quadrature for the generalized hydrodynamics equation and absence of shocks in the Lieb-Liniger model</title>

Abstract: In conventional fluids, it is well known that Euler-scale equations are plagued by ambiguities and instabilities. Smooth initial conditions may develop shocks, and weak solutions, such as for domain wall initial conditions (the paradigmatic Riemann problem of hydrodynamics), are not unique. The absence of shock formation experimentally observed in quasi-one-dimensional cold-atomic gases, which are described by the Lieb-Liniger model, provides perhaps the strongest pointer to a modification of the hydrodynamic equation due to integrability. Generalised hydrodynamics (GHD) is the required hydrodynamic theory, taking into account the infinite number of conserved quantities afforded by integrability. We provide a new quadrature for the GHD equation -- a solution in terms of a Banach fixed-point problem where time has been explicitly integrated. The quadrature is an efficient numerical solution tool; and it allows us, in the Lieb-Liniger model, to rigorously show that no shock may appear at all times, and, when combined with recent hydrodynamic fluctuation theories, to obtain new expressions for correlations in non-stationary states, establishing for the first time the presence of discontinuities characteristic of the non-equilibrium dynamics.</description>

      <title>Origin of the hidden energy scale and the $f$-ratio in geometrically frustrated magnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12966v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sufficiently clean geometrically frustrated (GF) magnets are the largest class of candidate materials that may host quantum spin liquids (QSLs). Some of them have been shown to exhibit spin-glass freezing, potentially precluding QSLs, at the "hidden energy scale", which is significantly lower than the microscopic energy scale of spin interactions. Here, we investigate the origin of the hidden energy scale and its relationship to the $f$-ratio, the figure of merit for the degree of frustration in GF magnetic materials. The available experimental and numerical data provide evidence that GF magnets display, universally, two distinct temperature scales in the specific heat, the lowest of which is of the order of the hidden energy scale $T^*$. We argue that this scale is determined by non-magnetic excitations, similar to spin exchanges in chains of spins. The collective entropy of such excitations matches the entropy of the ground states of the Ising model on the same lattice, which provides a way to verify the proposed scenario in experiment. We demonstrate that in the presence of quenched disorder, a broad class of materials exhibits spin-glass freezing at temperatures of order $T^*$, in accordance with experimental observations. As $T^*$ is a property of the clean GF medium, it leads to a constraint on the $f$-ratio.</description>

      <title>Gaussian approximation of dynamic cavity equations for linearly-coupled stochastic dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14200v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stochastic dynamics on sparse graphs and disordered systems often lead to complex behaviors characterized by heterogeneity in time and spatial scales, slow relaxation, localization, and aging phenomena. The mathematical tools and approximation techniques required to analyze these complex systems are still under development, posing significant technical challenges and resulting in a reliance on numerical simulations. We introduce a novel computational framework for investigating the dynamics of sparse disordered systems with continuous degrees of freedom. Starting with a graphical model representation of the dynamic partition function for a system of linearly-coupled stochastic differential equations, we use dynamic cavity equations on locally tree-like factor graphs to approximate the stochastic measure. Here, cavity marginals are identified with local functionals of single-site trajectories. Our primary approximation involves a second-order truncation of a small-coupling expansion, leading to a Gaussian form for the cavity marginals. For linear dynamics with additive noise, this method yields a closed set of causal integro-differential equations for cavity versions of one-time and two-time averages. These equations provide an exact dynamical description within the local tree-like approximation, retrieving classical results for the spectral density of sparse random matrices. Global constraints, non-linear forces, and state-dependent noise terms can be addressed using a self-consistent perturbative closure technique. The resulting equations resemble those of dynamical mean-field theory in the mode-coupling approximation used for fully-connected models. However, due to their cavity formulation, the present method can also be applied to ensembles of sparse random graphs and employed as a message-passing algorithm on specific graph instances.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00694v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Steady-state quantum thermal machines are typically characterized by a continuous flow of heat between different reservoirs. However, at the level of discrete stochastic realizations, heat flow is unraveled as a series of abrupt quantum jumps, each representing an exchange of finite quanta with the environment. In this work, we present a framework that resolves the dynamics of quantum thermal machines into cycles classified as engine-like, cooling-like, or idle. We analyze the statistics of individual cycle types and their durations, enabling us to determine both the fraction of cycles useful for thermodynamic tasks and the average waiting time between cycles of a given type. Central to our analysis is the notion of intermittency, which captures the operational consistency of the machine by assessing the frequency and distribution of idle cycles. Our framework offers a novel approach to characterizing thermal machines with significant relevance to experiments involving mesoscopic transport through quantum dots.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14652v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We numerically investigate the effect of coupling a two-dimensional many-body localized system to a finite heat bath, using shallow quantum circuits as a variational ansatz. Specifically, we simulate optical lattice experiments with two components of ultracold bosons, where only one species is subject to a random disorder potential and the other acts as a heat bath. We obtain a filling fraction dependent phase diagram with a critical filling consistent with experiments. We also calculate two-point correlation functions and the quantum mutual information between sites. We observe a distribution of the quantum mutual information in the many-body localized regime which is consistent with the presence of resonances, similar to those observed in one-dimensional many-body localized systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11097v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Competition among repetitive measurements of noncommuting observables and unitary dynamics can give rise to a wide variety of entanglement phases. Here, we propose a general framework based on Lyapunov analysis to characterize topological properties in monitored quantum systems through their spectrum and many-body topological invariants. We illustrate this framework by analyzing (1+1)-dimensional monitored circuits for Majorana fermions, which are known to exhibit topological and trivial area-law entangled phases as well as a critical phase with sub-volume-law entanglement. Through the Lyapunov analysis, we identify the presence (absence) of edge-localized zero modes inside the bulk gap in the topological (trivial) phase and a bulk gapless spectrum in the critical phase. Furthermore, by suitably exploiting the fermion parity with twisted measurement outcomes at the boundary, we construct a topological invariant that distinguishes the two area-law phases and dynamically characterizes the critical phase. Our framework thus provides a general route to extend the notion of bulk-edge correspondence to monitored quantum dynamics.</description>

      <title>Bridging conformal field theory and parton approaches to SU(n)_k chiral spin liquids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09567v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We employ the $\mathrm{SU}(n)_k$ Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) model in conformal field theory to construct lattice wave functions in both one and two dimensions. The spins on all lattice sites are chosen to transform under the $\mathrm{SU}(n)$ irreducible representation with a single row and $k$ boxes in the Young tableau. It is demonstrated that the wave functions can be reinterpreted as parton states, which enables efficient conversion to matrix product states such that many physical properties can be evaluated directly. In one dimension, these wave functions describe critical spin chains whose universality classes are in one-to-one correspondence with the WZW models used in the construction. In two dimensions, our constructions yield model wave functions for chiral spin liquids, and we show how to find all topological sectors of them in a systematic way. Using the null vectors of Kac-Moody algebras, parent Hamiltonians of the $\mathrm{SU}(3)_k$ series are derived. The $\mathrm{SU}(3)_k$ chiral spin liquids are lattice analogs of non-Abelian spin-singlet fractional quantum Hall states, and the $k=2$ member hosts Fibonacci anyons.</description>

      <title>A theoretical framework for overfitting in energy-based modeling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.19158v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of limited data on training pairwise energy-based models for inverse problems aimed at identifying interaction networks. Utilizing the Gaussian model as testbed, we dissect training trajectories across the eigenbasis of the coupling matrix, exploiting the independent evolution of eigenmodes and revealing that the learning timescales are tied to the spectral decomposition of the empirical covariance matrix. We see that optimal points for early stopping arise from the interplay between these timescales and the initial conditions of training. Moreover, we show that finite data corrections can be accurately modeled through asymptotic random matrix theory calculations and provide the counterpart of generalized cross-validation in the energy based model context. Our analytical framework extends to binary-variable maximum-entropy pairwise models with minimal variations. These findings offer strategies to control overfitting in discrete-variable models through empirical shrinkage corrections, improving the management of overfitting in energy-based generative models. Finally, we propose a generalization to arbitrary energy-based models by deriving the neural tangent kernel dynamics of the score function under the score-matching algorithm.</description>

      <title>The anomalously slow dynamics of inhomogeneous quantum annealing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03535v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inhomogeneous quantum annealing (IQA), in which transverse fields are turned off one by one rather than simultaneously, has been proposed as an effective way to avoid the first-order phase transitions that impede conventional quantum annealing (QA). Here we explicitly study the dynamics of IQA, rather than merely the thermodynamics, and find that it is appreciably slower than the phase diagram would suggest. Interestingly, this slowdown manifests both when IQA succeeds in circumventing phase transitions and when it fails. Even in the absence of transitions, such as for the mean-field models that have been analyzed previously, IQA is slower than expected by a factor of the number of spins $N$. More significantly, we show that in non-mean-field models, first-order transitions are likely to be quite common, and the gap at such transitions is not merely exponential in $N$ but exactly zero. Thus IQA cannot reach the ground state on any timescale. Both of these results can be understood through the simple observation that a spin's magnetization becomes conserved once its field is turned off during the IQA protocol.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00070v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study how probes of quantum scrambling dynamics respond to two kinds of imperfections -- unequal forward and backward evolutions and decoherence -- in a solvable Brownian circuit model. We calculate a ``renormalized'' out-of-time-order correlator (ROTOC) in the model with $N$ qubits, and we show that the circuit-averaged ROTOC is controlled by an effective probability distribution in operator weight space which obeys a system of $N$ non-linear equations of motion. These equations can be easily solved numerically for large system sizes which are beyond the reach of exact methods. Moreover, for an operator initially concentrated on weight one $w_0=1$, we provide an exact solution to the equations in the thermodynamic limit of many qubits that is valid for all times, all non-vanishing perturbation strengths $p\gtrsim 1/\sqrt{N}$, and all decoherence strengths. We also show that a generic initial condition $w_0 &gt;1$ leads to a metastable state that eventually collapses to the $w_0=1$ case after a lifetime $\sim \log(N/w_0)$. Our results highlight situations where it is still possible to extract the unperturbed chaos exponent even in the presence of imperfections, and we comment on the applications of our results to existing experiments with nuclear spins and to future scrambling experiments.</description>

      <title>Self-reorganization and Information Transfer in Massive Schools of Fish</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05822v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The remarkable cohesion and coordination observed in moving animal groups and their collective responsiveness to threats are thought to be mediated by scale-free correlations, where changes in the behavior of one animal influence others in the group, regardless of the distance between them. But are these features independent of group size? Here, we investigate group cohesiveness and collective responsiveness in computational models of massive schools of fish of up to 50,000 individuals. We show that as the number of swimmers increases, flow interactions destabilize the school, creating clusters that constantly fragment, disperse, and regroup, similar to their biological counterparts. We calculate the spatial correlation and speed of information propagation in these dynamic clusters. Spatial correlations in cohesive and polarized clusters are indeed scale free, much like in natural animal groups, but fragmentation events are preceded by a decrease in correlation length, thus diminishing the group's collective responsiveness, leaving it more vulnerable to predation events. Importantly, in groups undergoing collective turns, the information about the change in direction propagates linearly in time among group members, thanks to the non-reciprocal nature of the visual interactions between individuals. Merging speeds up the transfer of information within each cluster by several fold, while fragmentation slows it down. Our findings suggest that flow interactions may have played an important role in group size regulation, behavioral adaptations, and dispersion in living animal groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20459v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The integration of high-energy degrees of freedom along the renormalization group (RG) flow in Poincar\'e-invariant theories can be captured by a monotonic c-function. For such theories, holographic monotonic c-functions have been constructed using entanglement entropy. However, in theories with broken Lorentz invariance, such constructions generally fail, reflecting both the violation of the entanglement RG monotonicity and its limitations in capturing certain properties of non-relativistic RG flows. Since many quantum many-body systems lack Lorentz invariance, it is of significant importance to identify a quantity that reflects the decrease in degrees of freedom along non-relativistic RG flows. We show that the recently introduced holographic timelike entanglement entropy naturally gives rise to a new c-function applicable to all such theories. We further demonstrate the existence of this c-function in theories with Lifshitz and hyperscaling-violating fixed points, showing that, provided the null energy conditions and thermodynamic stability are satisfied, the proposed c-function exhibits the expected monotonic behavior along the RG flow.</description>
