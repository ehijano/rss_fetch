      <title>The Dynamical State of the Didymos System Before and After the DART Impact</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: NASA's Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) spacecraft impacted Dimorphos, the natural satellite of (65803) Didymos, on 2022 September 26, as a first successful test of kinetic impactor technology for deflecting a potentially hazardous object in space. The experiment resulted in a small change to the dynamical state of the Didymos system consistent with expectations and Level 1 mission requirements. In the pre-encounter paper Richardson (2022), predictions were put forward regarding the pre- and post-impact dynamical state of the Didymos system. Here we assess these predictions, update preliminary findings published after the impact, report on new findings related to dynamics, and provide implications for ESA's Hera mission to Didymos, scheduled for launch in 2024 with arrival in late December 2026. Pre-encounter predictions tested to date are largely in line with observations, despite the unexpected, flattened appearance of Didymos compared to the radar model and the apparent pre-impact oblate shape of Dimorphos (with implications for the origin of the system that remain under investigation). New findings include that Dimorphos likely became prolate due to the impact and may have entered a tumbling rotation state. A possible detection of a post-impact transient secular decrease in the binary orbital period suggests possible dynamical coupling with persistent ejecta. Timescales for damping of any tumbling and clearing of any debris are uncertain. The largest uncertainty in the momentum transfer enhancement factor of the DART impact remains the mass of Dimorphos, which will be resolved by the Hera mission.</description>

      <title>Calibrating the Instrumental Drift in MAROON-X using an Ensemble Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: MAROON-X is a state-of-the-art extreme precision radial velocity spectrograph deployed on the 8.1-meter Gemini-N telescope on Maunakea, Hawai'i. Using a stabilized Fabry-P\'erot etalon for wavelength and drift calibration, MAROON-X has achieved a short-term precision of $\sim$\,30\,cm\,s$^{-1}$. However, due to a long-term drift in the etalon (2.2\,cm\,s$^{-1}$ per day) and various interruptions of the instrument baseline over the first few years of operation, MAROON-X experiences RV offsets between observing runs several times larger than the short-term precision during any individual run, which hinders the detection of longer-period signals. In this study, we analyze RV measurements of 11 targets that either exhibit small RV scatter or have signals that can be precisely constrained using Keplerian or Gaussian Process models. Leveraging this ensemble, we calibrate MAROON-X's run offsets for data collected between September 2020 and early January 2024 to a precision of $\sim$0.5\,m\,s$^{-1}$. When applying these calibrated offsets to HD 3651, a quiet star, we obtain residual velocities with an RMS of $&lt;$70\,cm\,s$^{-1}$ in both the Red and Blue channels of MAROON-X over a baseline of 29 months. We also demonstrate the sensitivity of MAROON-X data calibrated with these offsets through a series of injection-recovery tests. Based on our findings, MAROON-X is capable of detecting sub m\,s$^{-1}$ signals out to periods of more than 1,000 days.</description>

      <title>Evidence for a sub-jovian planet in the young TWA7 disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Planets are thought to form from dust and gas in protoplanetary disks, and debris disks are the remnants of planet formation. Aged a few Myr up to a few Gyr, debris disks have lost their primordial gas, and their dust is produced by steady-state collisions between larger, rocky bodies. Tens of debris disks, with sizes of tens, sometimes hundreds of au, have been resolved with high spatial resolution, high contrast imagers at optical/near-IR or (sub)-millimeter interferometers. They commonly show cavities, ring-like structures, and gaps, which are often regarded as indirect signatures of the presence of planets that gravitationally interact with unseen planetesimals. However, no planet responsible for these features has been detected yet, probably because of the limited sensitivity (typically 2-10 MJ) of high contrast imaging instruments prior to JWST. We have used the unprecedented sensitivity of JWST/MIRI in the thermal IR to search for such planets in the disk of the ~ 6.4 Myr old star TWA 7. With its pole-on orientation, this three-ring debris disk is indeed ideally suited for such a detection. We unambiguously detected a source 1.5 arsec from the star, that is best interpreted as a cold, sub-Jupiter mass planet. Its estimated mass (~ 0.3 MJ) and position (~ 52 au, de-projected) can thoroughly account for the main disk structures.</description>

      <title>Calibration of MAJIS (Moons And Jupiter Imaging Spectrometer): I. On-ground setup description and characterisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The visible and infrared Moon And Jupiter Imaging Spectrometer (MAJIS), aboard the JUpiter ICy Moons Explorer (JUICE) spacecraft, will characterize the composition of the surfaces and atmospheres of the Jupiter system. Prior to the launch, a campaign was carried out to obtain the measurements needed to calibrate the instrument. The aim was not only to produce data for the calculation of the radiometric, spectral, and spatial transfer functions, but also to evaluate MAJIS performance, such as signal-to-noise ratio and amount of straylight, under near-flight conditions. Here, we first describe the setup implemented to obtain these measurements, based on five optical channels. We notably emphasize the concepts used to mitigate thermal infrared emissions generated at ambient temperatures, since the MAJIS spectral range extends up to 5.6 $\mu$m. Then, we characterize the performance of the setup by detailing the validation measurements obtained before the campaign. In particular, the radiometric, geometric, and spectral properties of the setup needed for the inversion of collected data and the calculation of the instrument's calibration functions are presented and discussed. Finally, we provide an overview of conducted measurements with MAJIS, and we discuss unforeseen events encountered during the on-ground calibration campaign.</description>

      <title>3D Simulations of Semiconvection in Spheres: Turbulent Mixing and Layer Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semiconvection occurs in regions of stars and planets that are unstable to overturning convection according to the Schwarzschild criterion, yet stable according to the Ledoux criterion. Previous simulations in Cartesian boxes have advanced our understanding of the semiconvective instability, layer formation, and transport properties. However, much less is known about semiconvection in spherical geometry and under the influence of rotation or magnetic fields. We present 3D simulations of semiconvection in the full sphere (including $r=0$), and accounting for rotation. We find that the formation and evolution of semiconvective layers in nonrotating spheres occurs in a similar way to nonrotating Cartesian boxes, in the sense that the critical density ratio at which layers are expected to form is approximately the same in both geometries. Layers rapidly merge once they form, ultimately leading to a fully mixed convective sphere. The transport properties measured through the Nusselt numbers and the buoyancy flux ratio are also similar to results from previous studies in boxes. When rotation is added to the system, layer formation and evolution proceeds in a similar fashion to the nonrotating runs. However, rotation hampers the radial transport of heat and composition, and, as a result, the time required for the sphere to become fully mixed gets longer as the flow becomes more rotationally constrained. We also find that semiconvective layers exhibit spherical mixing in nonrotating cases, whereas in rotating cases, the mixing becomes more cylindrical. We discuss what is needed for future work to build more realistic models.</description>

      <title>Activity of low mass stars in the light of spot signature in the Fourier domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. Magnetic fields exhibit a wide variety of behaviours in low mass stars and further characterization is required to understand these observations. Stellar photometry from space missions such as MOST, CoRoT, Kepler, and, in future PLATO, provide thousands of highly precise light curves (LC) that can shed new light upon stellar activity, in particular through the signature of transiting spots. Aims. We study the impact of star spots on light curves in the Fourier domain, reducing the degeneracies encountered by direct spot modelling in the temporal domain, and use this new formulation to explore the spot properties from the available data. Methods. We propose a model of LC power spectra at low frequency based on a description of spot transits that allows us to retrieve information about the amplitude of their photometric impact $\mathcal{H}$, and about the spot mean lifetime over the observation $\tau_{\rm life}$ when the power spectrum exibits rotation peaks. We first validate this method with simulated LCs and then apply it to the Kepler data to extract global trends over a set of more than 37 755 stars. Results. This analysis leads to a classification of the sample into "peakless" or "with peaks" spectra, and enables the identification of different activity regimes based on $\mathcal{H}$ and $\tau_{\rm life}$ for different ranges of Rossby number. More specifically, we observe an intense regime of activity between Ro = 0.7 and Ro = 1, for stars with masses under 1$M_\odot$. Conclusions. This new systematic method can be used to provide new observational constraints on stellar activity (and possibly a link with stellar magnetism) when applied to large photometric datasets, such as those from the future PLATO mission.</description>

      <title>A hybrid origin for the Martian atmosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15508v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Martian isotopic record displays a dichotomy in volatile compositions. Interior volatiles from the mantle record a chondritic heritage (e.g., H, N, Kr, Xe) whereas the atmospheric reservoir of Kr and Xe - which do not currently experience escape - record heritage from a solar-like source. Motivated by disparate inferences on the source of Martian atmospheric volatiles (outgassed versus nebular captured), we consider hybrid-source accretionary atmospheres in which a high molecular weight (e.g., CO2-rich) outgassed component is mixed in with the low molecular weight H2-rich nebular atmosphere. We conduct calculations of nebular capture with and without a high molecular weight outgassed component mixed into the atmosphere during the lifetime of the solar nebula. Mixing an outgassed component into the nebular layer enhances the captured gas inventory by 1-3 orders of magnitude - depending on the outgassed inventory - relative to "pure" nebular capture. These observations and calculations suggest that the Martian atmosphere arose as a subequal mixture of outgassed and nebular-derived components, and provide a framework for assessing the role of various mechanisms of gas loss over the entire history of the planet.</description>

      <title>Influence of Modeling Assumptions on the Inferred Dynamical State of Resonant Systems: A Case Study of the HD 45364 System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21429v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Planetary systems exhibiting mean-motion resonances (MMRs) offer unique opportunities to study the imprint of disk-induced migration on the orbital architectures of planetary systems. The HD 45364 system, discovered via the radial velocity (RV) method to host two giant planets in a 3:2 MMR, has been the subject of several studies attempting to reconstruct the system's orbital migration history based on its present-day resonant configuration. Recently, Li et al. (2022) called into question the system's residence in the 3:2 MMR based on a revised orbital solution derived from an expanded set of RV observations that extend the time baseline of the original discovery data by over a decade. However, we show that inferences about the planets' dynamical state with respect to the 3:2 MMR are sensitive to the particular prior assumptions adopted in the orbital modeling. Using $N$-body dynamical models, we show that orbital solutions constrained to reside deep in the 3:2 MMR fit the RV data with a similar quality to unconstrained orbital solutions. We conclude that the RV observations of HD 45364 are consistent with orbital configurations produced by smooth migration and resonance capture. We further show that past convergent orbital migration can reproduce the system's present-day orbital configuration provided that the ratio of migration to eccentricity damping timescales, $K$, was in the range $11\lesssim K \lesssim 144$. We also find that dynamical interactions in the system can break the usual mass-inclination degeneracy inherent to Keplerian models of RV observations and constrain the planets' absolute masses to within a factor of $\sim1.5$.</description>

      <title>2D numerical simulation of lunar response to gravitational waves using finite element method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17898v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Previous studies of the response of the Moon to gravitational waves have been carried out using analytical or semi-analytical models assuming ideal lunar structures. Such models are advantageous for their high-speed calculation but fail to account for the extremely heterogeneous subsurface and/or interior structures of the Moon. Numerical calculations are needed, but it is challenging to model the topography and lateral heterogeneity of the Moon. In addition, the computational cost is great especially when performing the GW simulation for a long time. As a first step towards overcoming the above difficulties, we employ a two-dimensional finite element method to numerically simulate the lunar response to gravitational waves. We verify our method by comparing our numerical results with those semi-analytical solutions. Based on such comparison, we also analyze the limitation of the two-dimensional simulation. Our work breaks a new way towards the precise simulation of realistic lunar response to gravitational waves in the future and lays down a solid foundation for three-dimensional numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Examining the Potential for Methyl Halide Accumulation and Detectability in Possible Hycean-Type Atmospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13856v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Some sub-Neptune planets may host habitable conditions; for example "Hycean" worlds with H2 envelopes over liquid water oceans can maintain potentially hospitable pressures and temperatures at their surface. Recent JWST observations of K2-18b and TOI-270d have shown that such worlds could be compelling targets for biosignature searches, given their extended scale heights and therefore large atmospheric signatures. Methylated biosignatures, a broad group of gases that can be generated by biological attachment of a CH3 group to an environmental substrate, have been proposed as candidate signs of life for Earth-like exoplanets. However, methyl halides (CH3 + halogen) have not yet been robustly examined with self-consistent photochemical and spectral models for planets with H2-dominated atmospheres. Here we demonstrate that methyl chloride (CH3Cl), predominantly produced by marine microbes, could be detected using JWST in tens of transits or fewer for Hycean planets, comparable to detection requirements for other potential atmospheric biosignatures. The threshold atmospheric mixing ratio for detectability is $\sim$10 ppm, which can accumulate with global fluxes comparable to moderately productive local environments on Earth.</description>
