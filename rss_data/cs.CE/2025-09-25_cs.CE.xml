      <title>Robust AI-ECG for Predicting Left Ventricular Systolic Dysfunction in Pediatric Congenital Heart Disease</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence-enhanced electrocardiogram (AI-ECG) has shown promise as an inexpensive, ubiquitous, and non-invasive screening tool to detect left ventricular systolic dysfunction in pediatric congenital heart disease. However, current approaches rely heavily on large-scale labeled datasets, which poses a major obstacle to the democratization of AI in hospitals where only limited pediatric ECG data are available. In this work, we propose a robust training framework to improve AI-ECG performance under low-resource conditions. Specifically, we introduce an on-manifold adversarial perturbation strategy for pediatric ECGs to generate synthetic noise samples that better reflect real-world signal variations. Building on this, we develop an uncertainty-aware adversarial training algorithm that is architecture-agnostic and enhances model robustness. Evaluation on the real-world pediatric dataset demonstrates that our method enables low-cost and reliable detection of left ventricular systolic dysfunction, highlighting its potential for deployment in resource-limited clinical settings.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Language Models with Modality-Specific Experts for Financial Forecasting from Interleaved Sequences of Text and Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text and time series data offer complementary views of financial markets: news articles provide narrative context about company events, while stock prices reflect how markets react to those events. However, despite their complementary nature, effectively integrating these interleaved modalities for improved forecasting remains challenging. In this work, we propose a unified neural architecture that models these interleaved sequences using modality-specific experts, allowing the model to learn unique time series patterns, while still enabling joint reasoning across modalities and preserving pretrained language understanding capabilities. To further improve multimodal understanding, we introduce a cross-modal alignment framework with a salient token weighting mechanism that learns to align representations across modalities with a focus on the most informative tokens. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a large-scale financial forecasting task, achieving state-of-the-art performance across a wide variety of strong unimodal and multimodal baselines. We develop an interpretability method that reveals insights into the value of time series-context and reinforces the design of our cross-modal alignment objective. Finally, we demonstrate that these improvements translate to meaningful economic gains in investment simulations.</description>

      <title>Characterizing failure morphologies in fiber-reinforced composites via k-means clustering based multiscale framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel homogenization methodology is proposed for analyzing the failure of fiber-reinforced composite materials, utilizing elastic and eigen influence tensors within a damage informed transformation field analysis (D-TFA) framework. This approach includes a technique for calculating macroscopic damage under uniform stress and strain conditions, offering more realistic simulations. Computational efficiency is enhanced through a reduced-order modeling strategy, while elastic and eigen strain distribution driven k-means clustering methods are employed to partition the microscale domain. The model's performance is assessed by simulating the response of a representative volume element (RVE) treated as a homogenized continuum. Subsequently, a comparative assessment is carried out to check the efficacy of two clustering schemes. Damage morphologies are calculated using proposed framework and compared with predictions obtained using finite element method. Furthermore, open-hole specimen tests are simulated and failure paths are predicted for the domains with different fiber layups. Ultimately, we show that D-TFA can accurately capture damage patterns and directional strengths, providing improved predictions of the mechanical behavior of composite materials. It has been demonstrated that higher cluster counts are crucial for capturing a more accurate stress-strain response, especially for complex microstructures.</description>

      <title>Efficient Multi-Objective Constrained Bayesian Optimization of Bridge Girder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The buildings and construction sector is a significant source of greenhouse gas emissions, with cement production alone contributing 7~\% of global emissions and the industry as a whole accounting for approximately 37~\%. Reducing emissions by optimizing structural design can achieve significant global benefits. This article introduces an efficient multi-objective constrained Bayesian optimization approach to address this challenge. Rather than attempting to determine the full set of non-dominated solutions with arbitrary trade-offs, the approach searches for a solution matching a specified trade-off. Structural design is typically conducted using computationally expensive finite element simulations, whereas Bayesian optimization offers an efficient approach for optimizing problems that involve such high-cost simulations. The proposed method integrates proper orthogonal decomposition for dimensionality reduction of simulation results with Kriging partial least squares to enhance efficiency. Constrained expected improvement is used as an acquisition function for Bayesian optimization. The approach is demonstrated through a case study of a two-lane, three-span post-tensioned concrete bridge girder, incorporating fifteen design variables and nine constraints. A comparison with conventional design methods demonstrates the potential of this optimization approach to achieve substantial cost reductions, with savings of approximately 10\% to 15\% in financial costs and about 20\% in environmental costs for the case study, while ensuring structural integrity.</description>

      <title>An Overview of Meshfree Collocation Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a comprehensive overview of meshfree collocation methods for numerically approximating differential operators on continuously labeled unstructured point clouds. Meshfree collocation methods do not require a computational grid or mesh. Instead, they approximate smooth functions and their derivatives at potentially irregularly distributed collocation points, often called particles, to a desired order of consistency. We review several meshfree collocation methods from the literature, trace the historical development of key concepts, and propose a classification of methods according to their principle of derivation. Although some of the methods reviewed are similar or identical, there are subtle yet important differences between many, which we highlight and discuss. We present a unifying formulation of meshfree collocation methods that renders these differences apparent and show how each method can be derived from this formulation. Finally, we propose a generalized derivation for meshfree collocation methods going forward.</description>

      <title>Enabling Multi-Species Bird Classification on Low-Power Bioacoustic Loggers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces WrenNet, an efficient neural network enabling real-time multi-species bird audio classification on low-power microcontrollers for scalable biodiversity monitoring. We propose a semi-learnable spectral feature extractor that adapts to avian vocalizations, outperforming standard mel-scale and fully-learnable alternatives. On an expert-curated 70-species dataset, WrenNet achieves up to 90.8\% accuracy on acoustically distinctive species and 70.1\% on the full task. When deployed on an AudioMoth device ($\leq$1MB RAM), it consumes only 77mJ per inference. Moreover, the proposed model is over 16x more energy-efficient compared to Birdnet when running on a Raspberry Pi 3B+. This work demonstrates the first practical framework for continuous, multi-species acoustic monitoring on low-power edge devices.</description>

      <title>Data Fusion for Full-Range Response Reconstruction via Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00795v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurately capturing the full-range response of structures is crucial in structural health monitoring (SHM) for ensuring safety and operational integrity. However, limited sensor deployment due to cost, accessibility, or scale often hinders comprehensive monitoring. This paper presents a generative data fusion framework utilizing diffusion models, to reconstruct the full-range structural response from sparse and heterogeneous sensor measurements. We incorporate Diffusion Posterior Sampling (DPS) into the reconstruction framework, using sensor measurements as probabilistic constraints to guide the sampling process. Three forward models are designed: Direct Observation Mapping (DOM), Channel-based Observation Mapping (COM), and Neural Network Forward Model (NNFM), enabling flexible adaptation to different sensor placement conditions and reconstruction targets. The proposed framework is validated on a steel plate shear wall exhibiting nonlinear responses. By simultaneously sampling 100 realizations and averaging them as the ensemble prediction result, the three forward models achieve Weighted Mean Absolute Percentage Errors of 1.62% (DOM), 3.27% (COM), and 3.49% (NNFM). Sensitivity analyses further demonstrate robust performance under varying hyperparameters, sensor configurations, and noise levels. The proposed framework shows new possibilities for probabilistic modeling and decision-making in SHM by harnessing the capabilities of diffusion models, offering a novel data fusion approach for full-range monitoring of structures.</description>

      <title>Time Series Analysis in Frequency Domain: A Survey of Open Challenges, Opportunities and Benchmarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07099v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Frequency-domain analysis has emerged as a powerful paradigm for time series analysis, offering unique advantages over traditional time-domain approaches while introducing new theoretical and practical challenges. This survey provides a comprehensive examination of spectral methods from classical Fourier analysis to modern neural operators, systematically summarizing three open challenges in current research: (1) causal structure preservation during spectral transformations, (2) uncertainty quantification in learned frequency representations, and (3) topology-aware analysis for non-Euclidean data structures. Through rigorous reviewing of over 100 studies, we develop a unified taxonomy that bridges conventional spectral techniques with cutting-edge machine learning approaches, while establishing standardized benchmarks for performance evaluation. Our work identifies key knowledge gaps in the field, particularly in geometric deep learning and quantum-enhanced spectral analysis. The survey offers practitioners a systematic framework for method selection and implementation, while charting promising directions for future research in this rapidly evolving domain.</description>
