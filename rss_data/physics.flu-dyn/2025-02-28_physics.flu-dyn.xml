      <title>Development of transitional Reynolds number correlation and assessment of RANS for predictions of bypass transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present direct numerical simulations (DNSs) of bypass transition over a flat plate with inlet freestream turbulence intensity levels of 0.75%, 1.5%, 2.25%, 3.0%, and 6.0%, respectively. A new definition of the transition intermittency is proposed based on the mean skin friction. Based on these, we develop an intermittency correlation to predict flow transition. The proposed model is consistent with the classical correlation of Abu-Ghannam and Shaw and reasonably predicts transition Reynolds number (within 10.8% error) for the experiments of Fransson &amp; Shahinfar (2020). Accompanying Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulations for our DNS cases simulations are performed. The RANS results are sensitive to the specification of the inlet turbulence length scale and overpredict (underpredict) the growth of the integral flow scales across the boundary layer during transitional stages when the inlet freestream turbulence is low (high), respectively.</description>

      <title>Reduced Basis Model for Compressible Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerical simulations are a valuable research and layout tool for fluid flow problems, yet repeated evaluations of parametrized problems, necessary to solve optimization problems, can be very costly. One option to speed up this process is to replace the costly CFD model with a cheaper one. These surrogate models can be either data-driven or they can also rely on reduced basis (RB) methods to speed up the calculations. In contrast to data-driven surrogate models, the latter are not based on regression techniques but are still aimed at explicitly solving the conservation equations. Their speed-up comes from a strong reduction of the solution space, which results in much smaller algebraic systems that need to be solved. Within this work, an RB model, suited for slightly compressible flow, is presented and tested on different flow configurations. The model is stabilized using a Petrov-Galerkin method with trial and test function spaces of different dimensionality to generate stable results for a wide range of Reynolds numbers. The presented model applies to geometrically and physically parametrized flow problems. Finally, a data-driven approach was used to extend it to turbulent flows.</description>

      <title>Turbulence and large-scale structures in self-gravitating superfluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study turbulence in self-gravitating superfluids by performing direct numerical simulations of the 3D Gross-Pitaevskii-Poisson (GPP) equation, which is also a model for dark matter haloes around galaxies. In the absence of self-gravity, the spectrally truncated Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) equation shows the emergence of Kolmogorov's $5/3$ scaling in the incompressible kinetic energy spectrum. Introducing self-gravity, we observe the formation of spherically collapsed structures, which introduce a minimum in the kinetic energy spectrum that corresponds to the sizes of these structures. The system shows early convergence towards statistically stationary states, which we show by the onset of thermalisation in the compressible kinetic energy spectrum, where $E_{\rm kin}^c \propto k^2$. We also show that the formation of such large-scale structures suggests that the particles (bosons) move from small to large scales through an inverse cascade, supporting a mechanism for the formation of large-scale structures, such as dark matter haloes, around our galaxy Milky Way.</description>

      <title>The cross-over from viscous to inertial lengthscales in rapidly-rotating convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Convection is the main heat transport mechanism in the Earth's liquid core and is thought to power the dynamo that generates the geomagnetic field. Core convection is strongly constrained by rotation while being turbulent. Given the difficulty in modelling these conditions, some key properties of core convection are still debated, including the dominant energy-carrying lengthscale. Different regimes of rapidly-rotating, unmagnetised, turbulent convection exist depending on the importance of viscous and inertial forces in the dynamics, and hence different theoretical predictions for the dominant flow lengthscale have been proposed. Here we study the transition from viscously-dominated to inertia-dominated regimes using numerical simulations in spherical and planar geometries. We find that the cross-over occurs when the inertial lengthscale approximately equals the viscous lengthscale. This suggests that core convection in the absence of magnetic fields is dominated by the inertial scale, which is hundred times larger than the viscous scale.</description>

      <title>A curvilinear surface ALE formulation for self-evolving Navier-Stokes manifolds -- General theory and analytical solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) formulation for Navier-Stokes flow on self-evolving surfaces is presented. It is based on a new curvilinear surface parameterization that describes the motion of the ALE frame. Its in-plane part becomes fully arbitrary, while its out-of-plane part follows the material motion of the surface. This allows for the description of flows on deforming surfaces using only surface meshes. The unknown fields are the fluid density or pressure, the fluid velocity and the surface motion, where the latter two share the same normal velocity. The corresponding field equations are the continuity equation or area-incompressibility constraint, the surface Navier-Stokes equations, and suitable surface mesh equations. The presentation focuses on their strong and weak forms, and presents several manufactured steady and transient solutions. These solutions are used to illustrate and discuss the properties of the proposed new ALE formulation. They also serve as basis for the development and verification of corresponding computational methods. The new formulation allows for a detailed study of fluidic membranes such as soap films, capillary menisci and lipid bilayers.</description>

      <title>A review of Bayesian sensor-based estimation and uncertainty quantification of aerodynamic flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many applications in aerodynamics depend on the use of sensors to estimate the evolving state of the flow. In particular, a wide variety of traditional and learning-based strategies for closed-loop control rely on some knowledge of the aerodynamic state in order to decide on actions. This estimation task is inherently accompanied by uncertainty due to the noisy measurements of sensors or the non-uniqueness of the underlying mapping, and knowledge of this uncertainty can be as important for decision-making as that of the state itself. The tracking of uncertainty is challenged by the often-nonlinear relationship between the sensor measurements and the flow state. For example, a collection of passing vortices leaves a footprint in wall pressure sensors that depends nonlinearly on the strengths and positions of the vortices. In this paper, we will review the recent body of work on flow estimation. We will discuss the basic tools of probability, including sampling and estimation, in the powerful setting of Bayesian inference and demonstrate these tools in static flow estimation examples. We will then proceed to unsteady examples and illustrate the application of sequential estimation, and particularly, the ensemble Kalman filter. Finally, we will discuss uncertainty quantification in neural network approximations of the mappings between sensor measurements and flow states. Recent aerodynamic applications of neural networks have shown that the flow state can be encoded into a very low-dimensional latent space, and we will discuss the implications of this encoding on uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Surface detachment and bed entrainment of fluvial plastics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03081v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Over the last decade, fluvial plastics have been identified as major threat to aquatic environments and human health. In order to develop adequate mitigation strategies for plastic pollution, a fundamental process understanding of riverine plastic transport is of significant importance. In this context, the implementation of research findings into numerical simulation environments is anticipated to enhance modelling capabilities and to support a rigorous decision making. Recent experimental research has focused on the incipient motion of plastic particles, as well as on the effects of surface tension on plastic concentration profiles. While these investigations have advanced the state-of-the-art knowledge, current literature still displays a lack of basic insights into layer-specific plastic transport physics. In this study, first principles are applied to advance knowledge on free-surface detachment and bed entrainment of fluvial plastics. A novel relationship for the critical surface detachment velocity is derived, followed by the development of a framework that allows to relate plastic Shields parameters to those of natural sediments. Overall, it is anticipated that these developments will trigger new research within the plastics community, and it is hoped that present findings will be implemented into Lagrangian particle tracking software.</description>

      <title>Gravity current energetics and particle suspension</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19675v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravity currents are a ubiquitous density driven flow occurring in both the natural environment and in industry. They include: seafloor turbidity currents, primary vectors of sediment, nutrient and pollutant transport; cold fronts; and hazardous gas spills. However, while the energetics are critical for their evolution and particle suspension, they are included in system scale models only crudely, so we cannot yet predict and explain the dynamics and run-out of such real-world flows. Herein, a novel depth-averaged framework is developed to capture the evolution of volume, concentration, momentum, and turbulent kinetic energy from direct integrals of the full governing equations. For the first time, we show the connection between the vertical profiles, the evolution of the depth-averaged flow, and the energetics. The viscous dissipation of mean-flow energy near the bed makes a leading order contribution, and an energetic approach to entrainment captures detrainment of fluid through particle settling. These observations allow a reconsideration of particle suspension, advancing over 50-years of research. We find that the new formulation can describe the full evolution of a shallow dilute current, with the accuracy depending primarily on closures for the profiles and source terms. Critically, this enables accurate and computationally efficient hazard risk analysis and earth surface modelling.</description>

      <title>An Insight into Parameter Identifiability Issues in the Carreau-Yasuda Model: a More Consistent Rheological Formulation for Shear-thinning non-Newtonian Inelastic Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14728v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Carreau-Yasuda rheological model is widely employed in both research and industrial applications to describe the shear-thinning behaviour of non-Newtonian inelastic fluids. However, its calibration against experimental data is often affected by intrinsic identifiability issues, which can lead to misleading physical interpretations of model parameters and unreliable flow predictions. In this paper, starting from the analysis of the identifiability challenges associated with the Carreau-Yasuda model, a novel rheological formulation for shear-thinning non-Newtonian inelastic fluids is proposed. Analytical results and exemplary numerical case studies demonstrate that the proposed formulation is based on physically meaningful model parameters, whose identifiability is not compromised by the key limitations of the Carreau-Yasuda model. Moreover, the new approach allows for effective parameter estimation through a straightforward direct identification strategy, eliminating the need for inverse calibration procedures based on optimization techniques.</description>

      <title>A Quasi-Analytical Solution for "Carreau-Yasuda-like" Shear-thinning Fluids Flowing in Slightly Tapered Pipes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14991v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a quasi-analytical framework for "Carreau-Yasuda-like" fluids with a viscosity characterized by two constant plateau at low and high shear rates connected by a shear-thinning branch, and flowing in slightly tapered pipes. This setup is common in research and industrial applications since the last century, by assuming both a Newtonian or a non-Newtonian inelastic behaviour. Nevertheless, an analytical solution for "Carreau-Yasuda-like" fluids is still lacking. The expressions have been derived by using the order-of-magnitude analysis and neglecting the inertial terms in the momentum balance equations. The analytical solutions are employed to an extrusion bioprinting process as an application example, and verified through numerical procedures.</description>

      <title>Statistical machine learning tools for probabilistic closures of turbulence models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17316v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Turbulent flow remains a challenging subject, despite extensive efforts to find analytical descriptions. Modeling small scales of motion is crucial for saving time and resources in numerical simulations, particularly in industrial applications. Here we attempt to model small scales of motion by creating closures for a Shell model of turbulence, more specifically for Sabra. Shell models are infinite dimensional dynamical systems that retain most key properties of Navier-Stokes equation, such as energy cascade and intermittency, while being computationally treatable. To account for Sabra's intermittent fluctuations we employ a set of scaling relations that recover a hidden symmetry and leaves us with universal statistics across the inertial range. On data from these rescaled variables we then adapt and apply two machine learning tools, a variational auto-encoder and sparse identification of non-linear dynamics. We estimate the data's densities and dynamics in order to then generate new instances of data. Given a mid-inertial range cutoff scale, we evolve reduced models in time, resolving only scales of motion larger than the cutoff scale, closing the reduced model with data generated by the machine learning tools. We compare statistics of our reduced models against a Sabra's fully resolved simulation to evaluate each closure's performances. Our results show improvement regarding previous work, and all our closures are probabilistic and cutoff-independent.</description>

      <title>Universal Physics Transformers: A Framework For Efficiently Scaling Neural Operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.12365v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural operators, serving as physics surrogate models, have recently gained increased interest. With ever increasing problem complexity, the natural question arises: what is an efficient way to scale neural operators to larger and more complex simulations - most importantly by taking into account different types of simulation datasets. This is of special interest since, akin to their numerical counterparts, different techniques are used across applications, even if the underlying dynamics of the systems are similar. Whereas the flexibility of transformers has enabled unified architectures across domains, neural operators mostly follow a problem specific design, where GNNs are commonly used for Lagrangian simulations and grid-based models predominate Eulerian simulations. We introduce Universal Physics Transformers (UPTs), an efficient and unified learning paradigm for a wide range of spatio-temporal problems. UPTs operate without grid- or particle-based latent structures, enabling flexibility and scalability across meshes and particles. UPTs efficiently propagate dynamics in the latent space, emphasized by inverse encoding and decoding techniques. Finally, UPTs allow for queries of the latent space representation at any point in space-time. We demonstrate diverse applicability and efficacy of UPTs in mesh-based fluid simulations, and steady-state Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes simulations, and Lagrangian-based dynamics.</description>

      <title>Spectral-Refiner: Accurate Fine-Tuning of Spatiotemporal Fourier Neural Operator for Turbulent Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17211v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in operator-type neural networks have shown promising results in approximating the solutions of spatiotemporal Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). However, these neural networks often entail considerable training expenses, and may not always achieve the desired accuracy required in many scientific and engineering disciplines. In this paper, we propose a new learning framework to address these issues. A new spatiotemporal adaptation is proposed to generalize any Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) variant to learn maps between Bochner spaces, which can perform an arbitrary-length temporal super-resolution for the first time. To better exploit this capacity, a new paradigm is proposed to refine the commonly adopted end-to-end neural operator training and evaluations with the help from the wisdom from traditional numerical PDE theory and techniques. Specifically, in the learning problems for the turbulent flow modeled by the Navier-Stokes Equations (NSE), the proposed paradigm trains an FNO only for a few epochs. Then, only the newly proposed spatiotemporal spectral convolution layer is fine-tuned without the frequency truncation. The spectral fine-tuning loss function uses a negative Sobolev norm for the first time in operator learning, defined through a reliable functional-type a posteriori error estimator whose evaluation is exact thanks to the Parseval identity. Moreover, unlike the difficult nonconvex optimization problems in the end-to-end training, this fine-tuning loss is convex. Numerical experiments on commonly used NSE benchmarks demonstrate significant improvements in both computational efficiency and accuracy, compared to end-to-end evaluation and traditional numerical PDE solvers under certain conditions.

      <title>Synchronization of wave-propelled capillary spinners</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06652v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When a millimetric body is placed atop a vibrating liquid bath, the relative motion between the object and interface generates outward propagating waves with an associated momentum flux. Prior work has shown that isolated chiral objects, referred to as spinners, can thus rotate steadily in response to their self-generated wavefield. Here, we consider the case of two co-chiral spinners held at a fixed spacing from one another but otherwise free to interact hydrodynamically through their shared fluid substrate. Two identical spinners are able to synchronize their rotation, with their equilibrium phase difference sensitive to their spacing and initial conditions, and even cease to rotate when the coupling becomes sufficiently strong. Non-identical spinners can also find synchrony provided their intrinsic differences are not too disparate. A hydrodynamic wave model of the spinner interaction is proposed, recovering all salient features of the experiment. In all cases, the spatially periodic nature of the capillary wave coupling is directly reflected in the emergent equilibrium behaviors.</description>

Abstract: The viscosity of the suspension consisting of fine particles dispersed in a Newtonian liquid diverges close to the jamming packing fraction. The contact microstructure in suspensions governs this macroscopic behavior in the vicinity of jamming through a frictional contact network (FCN). FCN is composed of mechanical load-bearing contacts that lead to the emergence of rigidity near the jamming transition. The stress transmission and network topology, in turn, depend sensitively on constraints on the relative motion of the particles. Despite their significance, predicting the FCN, especially close to jamming conditions, remains challenging due to experimental and computational impediments. This study introduces a cost-effective machine learning approach to predict the FCN using a graph neural network (GNN), which inherently captures hidden features and underlying patterns in dense suspension by mapping interparticle interactions. Employing a variation of GNN called the Deep Graph Convolutional Network (DeepGCN) trained on data-driven simulations, this study demonstrates robust generalization and extrapolation capabilities, accurately predicting FCNs in systems with divergent flow parameters and phase spaces, despite each being trained exclusively on a single condition. The study covers a wide range of phase space, from semi-dilute to jammed states, spanning transient to steady states, while systematically varying parameters such as shear stress (${\sigma}_{xy}$), packing fraction(${\phi}$) and sliding and rolling friction (${{\mu}_s, {\mu}_r}$). The results of this research pave the way for innovative transferable techniques in predicting the properties of particulate systems, offering new avenues for advancement in material science and related fields.</description>
