      <title>Tropicalization of $\psi$ classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Under suitable conditions on a family of logarithmic curves, we endow the tropicalization of the family with an affine structure in a neighborhood of the sections in such a way that the tropical $\psi$ classes from \cite{psi-classes} arise as tropicalizations of algebraic $\psi$ classes.</description>

      <title>The Prym-Hitchin Connection and Anti-Invariant Level-Rank Duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a "Hitchin-type" connection on bundles of non-abelian theta functions on higher-rank Prym varieties, for unramified double covers of curves. We formulate a version of level-rank duality in this Prym setting (building on work of Zelaci), show it holds for level one, and establish that the duality respects the flat connections at all levels.</description>

      <title>Secondary staircase complexes on isotropic Grassmannians</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a class of equivariant vector bundles on isotropic symplectic Grassmannians $\mathrm{IGr}(k,2n)$ defined as appropriate truncations of staircase complexes and show that these bundles can be assembled into a number of complexes quasi-isomorphic to the symplectic wedge powers of the symplectic bundle on $\mathrm{IGr}(k,2n)$. We are planning to use these secondary staircase complexes to study fullness of exceptional collections in the derived categories of isotropic Grassmannians and Lefschetz exceptional collections on $\mathrm{IGr}(3,2n)$.</description>

      <title>Generalised Howe curves of genus five attaining the Serre bound</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We find that non-hyperelliptic generalised Howe curves and their twists of genus 5 attain the Hasse-Weil-Serre bound over some finite fields of order p, p^2 or p^3 for a prime p. We are able to decompose their Jacobians completely under certain assumptions and to determine the precise condition on the finite field over which they attain the Hasse-Weil-Serre bound.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a result that relates Donaldson-Futaki type invariants (that is, the numerical invariants used to define $K$-stability for general polarised manifolds) for a toric polarised manifold and for a compactification of its mirror Landau-Ginzburg model, nearby the large volume limit. In general, this expansion contains a term involving the base loci of certain linear systems determined by the Landau-Ginzburg potential (as expected from known constructions of compactified mirrors), and we give a condition under which this term is subleading.</description>

      <title>Six-Functor Formalisms II : The $\infty$-categorical compactification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is a part of series of articles where we reprove the statements regarding the abstract six-functor formalism developed by Liu-Zheng. In this paper, we prove a theorem which is an $\infty$-categorical version for defining the exceptional pushforward functor in an abstract-six functor formalism. The article involves defining specific combinatorial simplcial sets related to the idea of compactifications and pullback squares. This theorem plays a key role in constructing the abstract six-functor formalism which shall be constructed in the forthcoming article.</description>

      <title>Quantum Modules of Semipositive Toric Varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A smooth projective toric variety $X=X_\Sigma$ has a geometric quotient description $V /\!/ T$. Using $2|1$-pointed quasimap invariants, one can define a quantum $H^*(T)$-module $QM(X)$, which deforms a natural module structure given by the Kirwan map $H^*(T) \rightarrow H^*(X)$. The Batyrev ring of $X$, defined from combinatorial data of the fan $\Sigma$, has its natural module structure given by the quotient of a polynomial ring, say BatM$(X)$. In this paper, we prove that $QM(X)$ and BatM$(X)$ are naturally isomorphic when $X$ is semipositive.</description>

      <title>Berkovich Motives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a theory of (etale) Berkovich motives. This is closely related to Ayoub's theory of rigid-analytic motives, but works uniformly in the archimedean and nonarchimedean setting. We aim for a self-contained treatment, not relying on previous work on algebraic or analytic motives. Applying the theory to discrete fields, one still recovers the etale version of Voevodsky's theory. Two notable features of our setting which do not hold in other settings are that over any base, the cancellation theorem holds true, and under only minor assumptions on the base, the stable $\infty$-category of motivic sheaves is rigid dualizable.</description>

      <title>Curves with colliding points: logarithmic and stacky</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new notion of generalized log twisted curves, which are marked nodal curves with additional data at the marked points. In the case when the markings are distinct this notion agrees with the notion of twisted curve introduced by Abramovich and Vistoli. In addition to developing the basic notions and results, we study in this article the moduli of such curves as well as contraction maps between them. This is motivated, in part, by applications to twisted stable maps which will be studied in a subsequent article.</description>

      <title>Singularities of character varieties: $g&gt;1$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For any complex reductive group $G$ and any compact Riemann surface with genus $g&gt;1$, we show that every connected component of the associated character variety has symplectic singularities, and has terminal singularities unless $g=2$ and the Dynkin diagram of $G$ contains an $A_1$-component. We also show that the identity component is $\mathbb{Q}$-factorial. The singularities caused by irreducible local systems with automorphism groups larger than the centre of $G$ are controlled by elliptic endoscopy.</description>

      <title>Toric sheaves and polyhedra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over a smooth projective toric variety we study toric sheaves, that is, reflexive sheaves equivariant with respect to the acting torus, from a polyhedral point of view. One application is the explicit construction of the torus invariant universal extension of two nef line bundles via polyhedral inclusion/exclusion sequences.
  Second, we link the cohomology of toric sheaves to the cohomology of certain constructible sheaves explicitly built out of the associated polyhedra. For the latter we define a concrete double complex and a spectral sequence which computes the cohomology of toric sheaves from the reduced cohomology of polyhedral subsets living in the realification of the character lattice of the toric variety.</description>

      <title>A complete theory of smoothable compactified Jacobians of nodal curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and study a new class of compactified Jacobians for nodal curves, that we call compactified Jacobians of vine type, or simply V-compactified Jacobians. This class is strictly larger than the class of classical compactified Jacobians, as constructed by Oda-Seshadri, Simpson, Caporaso and Esteves.
  We characterize V-compactified Jacobians as the compactified Jacobians that can arise as limits of Jacobians of smooth curves under a one-parameter smoothing of the nodal curve, extending previous works on fine compactified Jacobians by Pagani-Tommasi and Viviani to the case of all compactified Jacobians.</description>

      <title>Schubert polynomials and patterns in permutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the number of supports of the Schubert polynomial $\mathfrak{S}_w(x)$ indexed by a permutation $w$. This number also equals the number of lattice points in the Newton polytope of $\mathfrak{S}_w(x)$. We establish a lower bound for this number in terms of the occurrences of patterns in $w$. The analysis is carried out in the general framework of dual characters of flagged Weyl modules. Our result considerably improves the bounds for principal specializations of Schubert polynomials or dual flagged Weyl characters previously obtained by Weigandt, Gao, and M{\'e}sz{\'a}ros--St. Dizier--Tanjaya. Some problems and conjectures are discussed.</description>

      <title>Partitioning Theorems for Sets of Semi-Pfaffian Sets with Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We generalize the seminal polynomial partitioning theorems of Guth and Katz to a set of semi-Pfaffian sets. Specifically, given a set $\Gamma \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ of $k$-dimensional semi-Pfaffian sets, where each $\gamma \in \Gamma$ is defined by a fixed number of Pfaffian functions, and each Pfaffian function is in turn defined with respect to a Pfaffian chain $\vec{q}$ of length $r$, for any $D \ge 1$, we prove the existence of a polynomial $P \in \mathbb{R}[X_1, \ldots, X_n]$ of degree at most $D$ such that each connected component of $\mathbb{R}^n \setminus Z(P)$ intersects at most $\sim \frac{|\Gamma|}{D^{n - k - r}}$ elements of $\Gamma$. Also, for any $D \ge 1$, we prove the existence of a Pfaffian function $P'$ of degree at most $D$ defined with respect to $\vec{q}$, such that each connected component of $\mathbb{R}^n \setminus Z(P')$ intersects at most $\sim \frac{|\Gamma|}{D^{n-k}}$ elements of $\Gamma$. To do so, given a $k$-dimensional semi-Pfaffian set $\mathcal{X} \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$, and a polynomial $P \in \mathbb{R}[X_1, \ldots, X_n]$ of degree at most $D$, we establish a uniform bound on the number of connected components of $\mathbb{R}^n \setminus Z(P)$ that $\mathcal{X}$ intersects; i.e. we prove that the number of connected components of $(\mathbb{R}^n \setminus Z(P)) \cap \mathcal{X}$ is at most $\sim D^{k+r}$. Finally as applications, we derive Pfaffian versions of Szemer\'edi-Trotter type theorems, and also prove bounds on the number of joints between Pfaffian curves.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03234v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study the mixed Poincar\'e polynomial of generic parabolic $\mathrm{PGL}_2(\mathbb{C})$-character varieties with coefficients in some local systems arising from the conjugacy class of $\mathrm{PGL}_2(\mathbb{C})$ which has a non-connected stabiliser. We give a conjectural formula that we prove to be true under the Euler specialisation. We then prove that this conjectured formula interpolates the structure coefficients of the two based rings$ \left(\mathcal{C}(\mathrm{PGL}_2(\mathbb{F}_q)),Loc(\mathrm{PGL}_2),*\right)$ and $\left(\mathcal{C}(\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{F}_q)), CS(\mathrm{SL}_2),\cdot\right) $ where for a group $H$, $\mathcal{C}(H)$ denotes the space of complex valued class functions on $H$, $Loc(\mathrm{PGL}_2)$ denotes the basis of characteristic functions of intermediate extensions of equivariant local systems on conjugacy classes of $\mathrm{PGL}_2$ and $CS(\mathrm{SL}_2)$ the basis of characteristic functions of Lusztig's character-sheaves on $\mathrm{SL}_2$. Our result reminds us of a non-abelian Fourier transform.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider three isogeny invariants of abelian varieties over finite fields: the Galois group, Newton polygon, and the angle rank. Motivated by work of Dupuy, Kedlaya, and Zureick-Brown, we define a new invariant called the weighted permutation representation which encompasses all three of these invariants and use it to study the subtle relationships between them. We use this permutation representation to classify the triples of invariants that occur for abelian surfaces and simple abelian threefolds.</description>

The collection $\overline{\mathcal{M}}=\{\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{0,n+1}\}_{n\geq 2}$ forms an operad in the category of complex projective varieties; its homology $Hycom= H_*(\overline{\mathcal{M}})$ is called the Hypercommutative operad. In this paper we construct a chain model for the hypercommutative operad, i.e. an operad of chain complexes $C_*^{dual}(\overline{\mathcal{M}})$ which is weakly equivalent to the operad of singular chains $C_*(\overline{\mathcal{M}})$. We prove that $C_*^{dual}(\overline{\mathcal{M}})$ is the linear dual of the bar construction $B(grav)$, where $grav$ is a chain model of the gravity operad based on cacti without basepoint. This shows that the Gravity and Hypercommutative operad are Koszul dual also at the chain level, refining a previous result of Getzler. The construction is topological, since $C_*^{dual}(\overline{\mathcal{M}})(n)$ is the cellular complex associated to a regular CW-decomposition of $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{0,n+1}$.</description>

Abstract: We present a preliminary investigation of algebraic surfaces that have non-planar degenerations, along with their Galois covers and fundamental groups. Specifically, we investigate the tetrahedron and the double tetrahedron. The resulting fundamental groups indicate that the tetrahedron and the double tetrahedron are in different components of the moduli space of algebraic surfaces.</description>

      <title>Rank 4 stable vector bundles on hyperk\"ahler fourfolds of Kummer type</title>

      <description>arXiv:2203.03987v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We partially extend to hyperk\"ahler fourfolds of Kummer type the results that we have proved regarding stable rigid vector bundles on hyperk\"ahler (HK) varieties of type $K3^{[n]}$. Let $(M,h)$ be a general polarized HK fourfold of Kummer type such that $q_M(h)\equiv -6\pmod{16}$ and the divisibility of $h$ is $2$, or $q_M(h)\equiv -6\pmod{144}$ and the divisibility of $h$ is $6$. We show that there exists a unique (up to isomorphism) slope stable vector bundle $\cal F$ on $M$ such that $r({\cal F})=4$, $ c_1({\cal F})=h$, $\Delta({\cal F})=c_2(M)$. Moreover $\cal F$ is rigid. One of our motivations is the desire to describe explicitly a locally complete family of polarized HK fourfolds of Kummer type.</description>

      <title>The fundamental group of Galois covers of surfaces with octahedral envelope</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.05241v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the fundamental group of the Galois cover of a surface of degree~$8$, with singularities of degree $4$, whose degeneration envelope is isomorphic to an octahedron. The group is shown to be a metabelian group of order $2^{23}$. The computation amalgamates local groups, classified elsewhere, by an iterative combination of computational and group theoretic methods. Three simplified surfaces, for which the fundamental group of the Galois cover is trivial, demonstrate how nontrivial cycles in the degenerated surface complicate the computation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.05622v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We count singular vector tuples of a system of tensors assigned to the edges of a directed hypergraph. To do so, we study the generalisation of quivers to directed hypergraphs. Assigning vector spaces to the nodes of a hypergraph and multilinear maps to its hyperedges gives a hyperquiver representation. Hyperquiver representations generalise quiver representations (where all hyperedges are edges) and tensors (where there is only one multilinear map). The singular vectors of a hyperquiver representation are a compatible assignment of vectors to the nodes. We compute the dimension and degree of the variety of singular vectors of a sufficiently generic hyperquiver representation. Our formula specialises to known results that count the singular vectors and eigenvectors of a generic tensor. Lastly, we study a hypergraph generalisation of the inverse tensor eigenvalue problem and solve it algorithmically.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.17029v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A famous theorem of Shokurov states that a general anticanonical divisor of a smooth Fano threefold is a smooth K3 surface. This is quite surprising since there are several examples where the base locus of the anticanonical system has codimension two. In this paper we show that for four-dimensional Fano manifolds the behaviour is completely opposite: if the base locus is a normal surface, hence has codimension two, all the anticanonical divisors are singular.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.00985v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It was conjectured by M\textsuperscript{c}Kernan and Shokurov that for any Fano contraction $f:X \to Z$ of relative dimension $r$ with $X$ being $\epsilon$-lc, there is a positive $\delta$ depending only on $r,\epsilon$ such that $Z$ is $\delta$-lc and the multiplicity of the fiber of $f$ over a codimension one point of $Z$ is bounded from above by $1/\delta$. Recently, this conjecture was confirmed by Birkar \cite{Bi23}. In this paper, we give an explicit value for $\delta$ in terms of $\epsilon,r$ in the toric case, which belongs to $O(\epsilon^{2^r})$ as $\epsilon\rightarrow 0$. The order $O(\epsilon^{2^r})$ is optimal in some sense.</description>

      <title>Normal Forms and Tyurin Degenerations of K3 Surfaces Polarised by a Rank 18 Lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.10394v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study projective Type II degenerations of K3 surfaces polarised by a certain rank 18 lattice, where the central fibre consists of a pair of rational surfaces glued along a smooth elliptic curve. Given such a degeneration, one may construct other degenerations of the same kind by flopping curves on the central fibre, but the degenerations obtained from this process are not usually projective. We construct a series of examples which are all projective and which are all related by flopping single curves from one component of the central fibre to the other. Moreover, we show that this list is complete, in the sense that no other flops are possible. The components of the central fibres obtained include weak del Pezzo surfaces of all possible degrees. This shows that projectivity need not impose any meaningful constraints on the surfaces that can arise as components in Type II degenerations.</description>

      <title>On the codimension of permanental varieties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17839v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we study permanental varieties, i.e. varieties defined by the vanishing of permanents of fixed size of a generic matrix. Permanents and their varieties play an important, and sometimes poorly understood, role in combinatorics. However, there are essentially no geometric results about them in the literature, in very sharp contrast to the well-behaved and ubiquitous case of determinants and minors. Motivated by the study of the singular locus of the permanental hypersurface, we focus on the codimension of these varieties. We introduce a $\mathbb C^{*}$-action on matrices and prove a number of results. In particular, we improve a lower bound on the codimension of the aforementioned singular locus established by von zur Gathen in 1987.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17586v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A parametrised diffusion operator on the regular domain $\Omega$ of a $p$-adic Schottky group is constructed. It is defined as an integral operator on the complex-valued functions on $\Omega$ which are invariant under the Schottky group $\Gamma$, where integration is against the measure defined by an invariant regular differential 1-form $\omega$. It is proven that the space of Schottky invariant $L^2$-functions on $\Omega$ outside the zeros of $\omega$ has an orthonormal basis consiting of $\Gamma$-invariant extensions of Kozyrev wavelets which are eigenfunctions of the operator. The eigenvalues are calculated, and it is shown that the heat equation for this operator provides a unique solution for its Cauchy problem with Schottky-invariant continuous initial conditions supportes outside the zero set of $\omega$, and gives rise to a strong Markov process on the corresponding orbit space for the Schottky group whose paths are c\`adl\`ag.</description>

      <title>TR and the $r$-Nygaard filtered prismatic cohomology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00914v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given an animated ring $S$, we define a filtration on its absolute prismatic cohomology $\mathcal{N}_r^{\geq i} \mathbb{\Delta}_S$, which we call the $r$-Nygaard filtration and study some of its main properties using a mixture of algebraic and homotopy theoretic techniques. This filtration is obtained by suitably gluing $r$-copies of the usual Nygaard filtration and corresponds to the $\xi_r$-adic filtration on $\mathbb{A}_{\mathrm{inf}}$, in the case that $S$ is a perfectoid ring.
  Using this, we study the motivic filtration of topological restriction homology $\mathrm{TR}^r (S;\mathbb{Z}_p)$ and of its $S^1$-homotopy fixed points. We also pursue connections with the theory of topological cyclic homology. Finally we discuss connections with the de Rham--Witt complex, towards a prismatic - de Rham--Witt comparison theorem.</description>

Abstract: We develop the fibration method to produce rational (or integral) points on the total space with few multiple fibers over the projective line over number fields. As its application, we prove strong approximation without off any place and arithmetic purity for two classes of open rationally connected varieties: the smooth locus of singular del Pezzo surfaces of degree $\geq 4$ and the smooth locus of complete normal toric varieties. We also study strong approximation for the intersection of two affine quadrics. As its application, we get an unconditional result of fibration method for rank 4.</description>

Abstract: We study the conditions under which a subvariety of the Grassmannian may be recovered from certain of its linear projections. In the special case that our Grassmannian is projective space, this is equivalent to asking when a variety can be recovered from its Chow form; the answer is "always" by work of Chow in 1937. In the general Grassmannian setting, the analogous question is when a variety can be recovered from its Chow-Lam form. We give both necessary conditions for recovery and families of examples where, in contrast with the projective case, recovery is not possible.</description>

Abstract: This article constructs the moduli stack of torsionfree $G$-jet-structures in homotopy type theory with one monadic modality. This yields a construction of this moduli stack for any $\infty$-topos equipped with any stable factorization systems.
  In the intended applications of this theory, the factorization systems are given by the deRham-Stack construction. Homotopy type theory allows a formulation of this abstract theory with surprising low complexity. This is witnessed by the accompanying formalization of large parts of this work.</description>

Abstract: The geometric Satake equivalence and the Springer correspondence are closely related when restricting to small representations of the Langlands dual group. We prove this result for \'etale sheaves, including the case of the mixed characteristic affine Grassmannian, assuming a sufficient ramification. In this process, we construct a monoidal structure on the restriction functor of Satake categories. We construct also a canonical isomorphism between a mixed characteristic affine Grassmannian under a sufficient ramification and an equal characteristic one.</description>

Abstract: The global magnificent four theory is the homological version of a maximally supersymmetric $(8+1)$-dimensional gauge theory on a Calabi-Yau fourfold fibered over a circle. In the case of a toric fourfold we conjecture the formula for its twisted Witten index. String-theoretically we count the BPS states of a system of $D0$-$D2$-$D4$-$D6$-$D8$-branes on the Calabi-Yau fourfold in the presence of a large Neveu-Schwarz $B$-field. Mathematically, we develop the equivariant $K$-theoretic DT4 theory, by constructing the four-valent vertex with generic plane partition asymptotics. Physically, the vertex is a supersymmetric localization of a non-commutative gauge theory in $8+1$ dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10720v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We review the notion of symplectic duality earlier introduced in the context of topological recursion. We show that the transformation of symplectic duality can be expressed as a composition of $x-y$ dualities in a broader context of log topological recursion. As a corollary, we establish nice properties of symplectic duality: various convenient explicit formulas, invertibility, group property, compatibility with topological recursion and KP integrability. As an application of these properties, we get a new and uniform proof of topological recursion for large families of weighted double Hurwitz numbers; this encompasses and significantly extends all previously known results on this matter.</description>

Abstract: The motivic version of the $c_1$-spherical cobordism spectrum is constructed. A connection of this spectrum with other motivic Thom spectra is established. Using this connection, we compute the $\mathbb{P}^1$-diagonal of the homotopy groups of the special linear algebraic cobordism $\pi_{2*,*}(\mathrm{MSL})$ over a local Dedekind domain $k$ with $1/2\in k$ after inverting the exponential characteristic of the residue field of $k$. We discuss the action of the motivic Hopf element $\eta$ on this ring, obtain a description of the localization away from $2$ and compute the $2$-primary torsion subgroup. The complete answer is given in terms of the special unitary cobordism ring. An important component of the computation is the construction of Pontryagin characteristic numbers with values in the Hermitian K-theory. We also construct Chern numbers in this setting, prove the motivic version of the Anderson--Brown--Peterson theorem and briefly discuss classes of Calabi--Yau varieties in the $\mathrm{SL}$-cobordism ring.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15370v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform a systematic study of the base change conductor for Jacobians. Through the lens of intersection theory and Deligne's Riemann-Roch theorem, we present novel computational approaches for both the tame and wild parts of the base change conductor. Our key results include a general formula of the tame part, as well as a computation of the wild part in terms of Galois quotients of semistable models of the curves. We treat in detail the case of potential good reduction when the quotient only has weak wild quotient singularities, relying on recent advances by Obus and Wewers.</description>

      <title>Maximum likelihood estimation of log-affine models using detailed-balanced reaction networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07986v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A fundamental question in the field of molecular computation is what computational tasks a biochemical system can carry out. In this work, we focus on the problem of finding the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) for log-affine models. We revisit a construction due to Gopalkrishnan of a mass-action system with the MLE as its unique positive steady state, which is based on choosing a basis for the kernel of the design matrix of the model. We extend this construction to allow for any finite spanning set of the kernel, and explore how the choice of spanning set influences the dynamics of the resulting network, including the existence of boundary steady states, the deficiency of the network, and the rate of convergence. In particular, we prove that using a Markov basis as the spanning set guarantees global stability of the MLE steady state.</description>
