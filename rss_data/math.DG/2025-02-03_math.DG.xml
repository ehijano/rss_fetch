      <title>Elliptic Harnack inequality and its applications on Finsler metric measure spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the elliptic Harnack inequality and its applications on forward complete Finsler metric measure spaces under the conditions that the weighted Ricci curvature ${\rm Ric}_{\infty}$ has non-positive lower bound and the distortion $\tau$ is of linear growth, $|\tau|\leq ar+b$, where $a,b$ are some non-negative constants, $r=d(x_0,x)$ is the distance function for some point $x_{0} \in M$. We obtain an elliptic $p$-Harnack inequality for positive harmonic functions from a local uniform Poincar\'{e} inequality and a mean value inequality. As applications of the Harnack inequality, we derive the H\"{o}lder continuity estimate and a Liouville theorem for positive harmonic functions. Furthermore, we establish a gradient estimate for positive harmonic functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A longstanding open question in sub-Riemannian geometry is the following: are sub-Riemannian length minimizers smooth? We give a negative answer to this question, exhibiting an example of a $C^2$ but not $C^3$ length-minimizer of a real-analytic (even polynomial) sub-Riemannian structure.</description>

      <title>Geometric and topological rigidity of pinched submanifolds II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We continue the study of the geometry and topology of compact submanifolds of arbitrary codimension in space forms satisfying a certain pinching condition involving the length of the second fundamental form and the mean curvature. Our primary focus is on four-dimensional submanifolds, where, to our surprise, both the results obtained and the methods employed differ significantly and are notably more intricate compared to those in higher dimensions. This study heavily relies on concepts from four-dimensional geometry, the geometry of Riemannian manifolds with nonnegative isotropic curvature, and the Bochner technique, each playing a crucial role. The results are sharp and extend previous results by several authors, without imposing any further assumption on either the mean curvature or the fundamental group of the submanifold.</description>

      <title>New perspectives on the d'Alembertian from general relativity. An invitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This survey has multiple objectives. First, we motivate and review a new distributional notion of the d'Alembertian from mathematical relativity, more precisely, a nonlinear $p$-version thereof, where $p$ is a nonzero number less than one. This operator comes from natural Lagrangian actions introduced relatively recently. Unlike its classical linear yet hyperbolic counterpart, it is nonlinear yet has elliptic characteristics. Second, we describe recent comparison estimates for the $p$-d'Alembertian of Lorentz distance functions (notably a point or a spacelike hypersurface). Their new contribution implied by prior works on optimal transport through spacetime is a control of the timelike cut locus. Third, we illustrate exact representation formulas for these $p$-d'Alembertians employing methods from convex geometry. Fourth, several applications and open problems are presented.</description>

      <title>The closure of linear foliations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a simplified geometric proof of the Molino-Alexandrino-Radeschi (MAR) Theorem, which states that the closure of a singular Riemannian foliation on a complete Riemannian manifold is itself a smooth singular Riemannian foliation. Our approach circumvents several technical and analytical tools employed in the previous proof of the Theorem, resulting in a more direct geometric demonstration. We first establish conditions for a projectable foliation to be Riemannian, focusing on compatible connections. We then apply these results to linear foliations on vector bundles and their lifts to frame bundles. Finally, we use these findings to the linearization of singular Riemannian foliations around leaf closures. This method allows us to prove the smoothness of the closure directly for the linear semi-local model, bypassing the need for intermediate results on orbit-like foliations.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Entropy and Cauchy-Hadamard Renormalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This note presents a purely geometric construction of the so-called twist-field correlation functions in Conformal Field Theory (CFT), derived from conical singularities. This approach provides a purely mathematical interpretation of the seminal results in physics by Cardy and Calabrese on the entanglement entropy of quantum systems. Specifically, we begin by defining CFT partition functions on surfaces with conical singularities, using a ``Cauchy-Hadamard renormalization'' of the Polyakov anomaly integral. Next, we demonstrate that for a branched cover $f:\Sigma_d\to \Sigma$ with $d$ sheets, where the cover inherits the pullback of a smooth metric from the base, a specific ratio of partition functions on the cover to the base transforms under conformal changes of the base metric in the same way as a correlation function of CFT primary fields with specific conformal weights. We also provide a discussion of the physical background and motivation for entanglement entropy, focusing on path integrals and the replica trick, which serves as an introduction to these ideas for a mathematical audience.</description>

      <title>Differential geometry and general relativity with algebraifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06548v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is often noted that many of the basic concepts of differential geometry, such as the definition of connection, are purely algebraic in nature. Here, we review and extend existing work on fully algebraic formulations of differential geometry which eliminate the need for an underlying manifold. While the literature contains various independent approaches to this, we focus on one particular approach that we argue to be the most natural one based on the definition of "algebraifold", by which we mean a commutative algebra $\mathcal{A}$ for which the module of derivations of $\mathcal{A}$ is finitely generated projective. Over $\mathbb{R}$ as the base ring, this class of algebras includes the algebra $C^\infty(M)$ of smooth functions on a manifold $M$, and similarly for analytic functions. An importantly different example is the Colombeau algebra of generalized functions on $M$, which makes distributional differential geometry an instance of our formalism. Another instance is a fibred version of smooth differential geometry, since any smooth submersion $M \to N$ makes $C^\infty(M)$ into an algebraifold with $C^\infty(N)$ as the base ring. Over any field $k$ of characteristic zero, examples include the algebra of regular functions on a smooth affine variety as well as any function field.
  Our development of differential geometry in terms of algebraifolds comprises tensors, connections, curvature, geodesics and we briefly consider general relativity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17666v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We call a foliation $\mathcal{F}$ on a compact manifold infinitesimally rigid if its deformation cohomology $H^{1}(\mathcal{F},N\mathcal{F})$ vanishes. This paper studies infinitesimal rigidity for a distinguished class of Riemannian foliations, namely Lie foliations with dense leaves. We construct infinitesimally rigid Lie foliations with dense leaves, modeled on any compact semisimple Lie algebra with simple ideals different from $\mathfrak{so}(3)$. To our knowledge, these are the first examples of infinitesimally rigid Riemannian foliations that are not Hausdorff.</description>

Abstract: To study a one parameter deformation of an $S_1$ singularity taking into consideration their differential geometric properties, we give a form representing the deformation using only diffeomorphisms on the source and isometries of the target. Using this form, we study differential geometric properties of $S_1$ singularities and the Whitney umbrellas appearing in the deformation.</description>

      <title>Gradient Einstein-type warped products: rigidity, existence and nonexistence results via a nonlinear PDE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10337v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish the necessary and sufficient conditions for constructing gradient Einstein-type warped metrics. One of these conditions leads us to a general Lichnerowicz equation with analytic and geometric coefficients for this class of metrics on the space of warping functions. In this way, we prove gradient estimates for positive solutions of a nonlinear elliptic differential equation on a complete Riemannian manifold with associated Bakry-\'Emery Ricci tensor bounded from below. As an application, we provide nonexistence and rigidity results for a large class of gradient Einstein-type warped metrics. Furthermore, we show how to construct gradient Einstein-type warped metrics, and then we give explicit examples which are not only meaningful in their own right, but also help to justify our results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09185v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that a uniformly Euclidean metric with isolated singularity on $M^n = T^n \# M_0$, where $4\leq n\leq 7$ or $n\geq 4$, $M_0$ spin, and nonnegative scalar curvature on the smooth part is Ricci flat and extends smoothly over the singularity. This confirms Schoen's Conjecture in these cases. The key to the proof is to show that the space has nonnegative synthetic Ricci curvature, i.e., an $RCD(0, n)$ space. Our result also holds when the singular set consists of a finite union of submanifolds (of possibly different dimensions) intersecting transversally under additional assumption on the co-dimension and the location of the singular set.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04707v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present necessary and sufficient conditions for a group homomorphism between spaces of smooth sections of Lie group bundles to be a weighted composition operator. These results provide new insights into a wide range of problems related to weighted composition operators. Specifically, we prove that the algebraic structure of the space of smooth sections of an algebra bundle, where the typical fiber is a positive dimensional simple unital algebra, completely determines the bundle structure. Furthermore, we derive a homomorphism version of the Shanks-Pursell theorem and identify a class of homomorphisms of multiplicative semigroups between spaces of smooth functions on finite dimensional manifolds, including all isomorphisms. Our approach is based on a method called range decreasing group homomorphisms.</description>

      <title>Large-$n$ asymptotics for Weil-Petersson volumes of moduli spaces of bordered hyperbolic surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11412v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the geometry and spectral theory of Weil-Petersson random surfaces with genus-$g$ and $n$ cusps in the large-$n$ limit. We show that for a random hyperbolic surface in $\mathcal{M}_{g,n}$ with $n$ large, the number of small Laplacian eigenvalues is linear in $n$ with high probability. By work of Otal and Rosas [41], this result is optimal up to a multiplicative constant. We also study the relative frequency of simple and non-simple closed geodesics, showing that on random surfaces with many cusps, most closed geodesics with lengths up to $\log(n)$ scales are non-simple. Our main technical contribution is a novel large-$n$ asymptotic formula for the Weil-Petersson volume $V_{g,n}\left(\ell_{1},\dots,\ell_{k}\right)$ of the moduli space $\mathcal{M}_{g,n}\left(\ell_{1},\dots,\ell_{k}\right)$ of genus-$g$ hyperbolic surfaces with $k$ geodesic boundary components and $n-k$ cusps with $k$ fixed, building on work of Manin and Zograf [30].</description>

      <title>Energy Identity for Stationary Harmonic Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.02242v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we consider sequences $u_j:B_2\subseteq M\to N$ of stationary harmonic maps between smooth Riemannian manifolds with uniformly bounded energy $E[u_j]\equiv \int |\nabla u_j|^2\leq \Lambda$ . After passing to a subsequence it is known one can limit $u_j\to u:B_1\to N$ with the associated defect measure $|\nabla u_j|^2 dv_g \to |\nabla u|^2dv_g+\nu$, where $\nu = e(x)\, H^{m-2}_S$ is an $m-2$ rectifiable measure \cite{lin_stat}. For a.e. $x\in S=\operatorname{supp}(\nu)$ one can produce a finite number of bubble maps $b_j:S^2\to N$ by blowing up the sequence $u_j$ near $x$.
  We prove the energy identity in this paper. Namely, we have at a.e. $x\in S$ that $e(x)=\sum_j E[b_j]$ for a complete set of such bubbles. That is, the energy density of the defect measure $\nu$ is precisely the sum of the energies of the bubbling maps.</description>

      <title>The graph groupoid of a quantum sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02169v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum spheres are among the most studied examples of compact quantum spaces, described by C*-algebras which are Cuntz-Krieger algebras of a directed graph, as proved by Hong and Szyma\'nski in 2002. About five years earlier, in 1997, Sheu proved that the C*-algebra of a quantum sphere is a groupoid C*-algebra. Here we show that the path groupoid of the directed graph of Hong and Szyma\'nski is isomorphic to the groupoid discovered by Sheu.</description>

      <title>$L^2$-Betti numbers of Dehn fillings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16090v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We initiate the study of the $L^2$-Betti numbers of group-theoretic Dehn fillings. For a broad class of virtually special groups $G$, we prove that the $L^2$-Betti numbers of sufficiently deep Dehn fillings $\overline{G}$ are equal to those of $G$. As applications, we verify the Singer Conjecture for certain Einstein manifolds, establish a virtual fibering criterion for $\overline{G}$, obtain bounds on deficiency of $\overline{G}$, and provide new examples of hyperbolic groups with exotic subgroups that arise as Dehn fillings of any cusped arithmetic hyperbolic manifold of dimension at least four.</description>
