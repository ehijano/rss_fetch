      <title>Acoustic gravitational waves beyond leading order in bubble over Hubble radius</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the gravitational wave power spectrum from sound waves in a cosmological first order phase transition in the unexplored regime of large bubbles, by which we mean that the mean bubble spacing $R_*$ is a non-negligible fraction of the Hubble length $\mathcal{H}_*^{-1}$, i.e. $R_*\mathcal{H}_* \lesssim \mathcal{O}(1)$. Since the amplitude of the gravitational wave signal increases with $R_*\mathcal{H}_*$, this is also the loud signal regime. In this regime the effects of gravity, hitherto neglected, become relevant. We carry out the calculation in cosmological perturbation theory expanding in the parameter $R_*\mathcal{H}_*$, or bubble over Hubble radius. The leading order term is the standard result for acoustic production of gravitational waves. At next-to-leading order we find three novel contributions: two contributions arise from general relativistic corrections to the dynamics of both sound and gravitational waves. A third contribution comes from gravitational waves induced by curvature perturbations. These contributions suppress the gravitational wave peak amplitude. The suppression factor, with respect to the leading order contribution, scales as $(R_*\mathcal{H}_*)^2$, and also depends on other transition parameters, such as the sound speed $c_s$, the duration of the acoustic source, and the peak wavenumber of the velocity field $k_p$. In a simplified model of the velocity field, we find that the suppression factor lies between $2\%$ and $15\%$ when $R_*\mathcal{H}_* \simeq 0.5$, but is independent of the root mean squared fluid velocity. We provide analytical approximations to the next-to-leading order corrections, and a recipe to join them smoothly across different frequency regimes. Our work improves the precision of the current estimations of the gravitational wave power spectrum in the relatively unexplored regime of phase transition with large bubbles.</description>

      <title>From kinetic gasses to an exponentially expanding universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the gravitational field of a kinetic gas beyond its usual derivation from the second moment of the one-particle distribution function (1PDF), that serves as energy-momentum tensor in the Einstein equations. This standard procedure raises the question why the other moments of the 1PDF (which are needed to fully characterize the kinematical properties of the gas) do not contribute to the gravitational field and what could be their relevance in addressing the dark energy problem? Using the canonical coupling of the entire 1PDF to Finsler spacetime geometry via the Finsler gravity equation, we show that these higher moments contribute non-trivially. A Finslerian geometric description of our universe allows us to determine not only the scale factor but also of the causal structure dynamically. We find that already a Finslerian vacuum solution naturally permits an exponential expanding universe, without the need for a cosmological constant or any additional quantities. This solution possesses a causal structure which is a mild deformation of the causal structure of Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) geometry; close to the rest frame defined by cosmological time (i.e., for slowly moving objects), the causal structures of the two geometries are nearly indistinguishable.</description>

      <title>How much spin wandering can continuous gravitational wave search algorithms handle?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The canonical signal model in continuous gravitational wave searches is deterministic, and stable over the long integration times needed to separate a putative signal from the noise, e.g. with a matched filter. However, there exist plausible physical mechanisms that give rise to "spin-wandering", i.e. small stochastic variations in the frequency of the gravitational wave. Stochastic variations degrade the sensitivity of matched filters which assume a deterministic frequency evolution. Suites of synthetic spin-wandering injections are performed to infer the loss in sensitivity depth $D_{\rm SW}$ when compared to the depth for a canonical signal $D_{\rm det}$. For a fiducial spin-wandering signal that wanders by $\lesssim5 \times 10^{-6}\,$Hz per day, the depth ratio is $D_{\rm det} / D_{\rm SW}=4.39^{+0.23}_{-0.27}$, $1.51^{+0.02}_{-0.03}$, $1.75^{+0.04}_{-0.04}$, and $1.07^{+0.01}_{-0.02}$ for the coherent $F$-statistic, semi-coherent $F$-statistic, CrossCorr, and HMM-Viterbi algorithms respectively. Increasing the coherence time of the semi-coherent algorithms does not necessarily increase their sensitivity to spin-wandering signals.</description>

      <title>Numerical evolution of Maxwell's equations for wavefronts propagating through a spherical gravitational potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a scheme for numerically solving Maxwell's equations in a weakly perturbed spacetime without introducing the usual geometric optics approximation. Using this scheme, we study light propagation through a spherical perturbation of a stationary metric in the linear limit. Going beyond geometric approximation allows us to explore the wave optics effects that occur when the wavefront propagates through the gravitational potential. We find that the wavefront breaks on the gravitational potential due to the Shapiro time delay, i.e. due to the slowing down of light when propagating in an inhomogeneous spacetime. This again leads to constructive interference, resulting in a persistent frequency dependent amplification of parts of the wave amplitude. When the wave length is shorter than a certain threshold set by the induced gravitational mass, the waves are reflected on the curvature gradient.</description>

      <title>Einstein ring of dust shells with quantum hair</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The information about the internal structure of a compact object is classically inaccessible to external observers. In this paper, we investigate how quantum corrections to gravitational fields can reveal the internal structure of compact objects composed of dust shells. Using an effective field theory approach to incorporate quantum corrections up to second order in curvature, we derive a quantum-corrected metric for $N$ uniformly spaced shells with equal surface mass density and then examine how these corrections manifest in the deflection angle for gravitational lensing. In particular, we mainly investigate quantum-corrected astrophysical observables such as the Einstein ring and image magnification. Compared to the classical scenario, the deflection angle and the corresponding Einstein angle differ by a term that depends explicitly on the number of dust shells, which play the role of quantum hair. Specifically, the quantum correction to them diminishes as $N$ increases, yet a finite deviation from the classical result remains even in the continuum limit $N\to\infty$. Consequently, our results show that the internal structures of compact objects with identical mass and radius can be distinguished by quantum hair through their lensing observables.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore $2+1$-dimensional scalar-tensor theories derived from well-defined dimensional regularizations of the Lovelock invariants. In the limit where an infinite series of corrections is included, we obtain theories that admit fully regular black hole solutions. We analyze the properties of these regular black holes, investigate geodesics in these spacetimes, and examine the tidal forces, finding they remain finite everywhere.</description>

      <title>Oscillating scalar field as dark matter through the cosmological epochs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An oscillating scalar field can behave like cold dark matter in the expanding Universe. In relativistic cosmology, this perspective is primarily reasoned by an evolution of a background scalar field and its subhorizon perturbations in a matter-dominated era. A corresponding relativistic description is usually based on the ansatz that the perturbations oscillate in the same way as the background field and on time averaging to find the oscillation amplitudes. In contrast, the presented approach makes no initial assumptions about the perturbation behavior and does not use time averages. It is shown that although the previous treatments are valid only well inside the Hubble scale, the scalar field reproduces the CDM scenarios on the superhorizon scale and also throughout the evolution of the Universe from the beginning of the oscillations. The misunderstanding about the Jeans length scale in the matter-dominated epoch is also clarified. An analog of the Jeans effect is found in a radiation-dominated era. It can prevent an overproduction of small halos for the scalars with $m\sim 10^{-13}$~eV.</description>

      <title>Symmetry energy dependence of the bulk viscosity of nuclear matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We clarify how the weak-interaction-driven bulk viscosity $\zeta$ and the bulk relaxation time $\tau_\Pi$ of neutrino-transparent $npe$ matter depend on the nuclear symmetry energy. We show that, at saturation density, the equation-of-state dependence of these transport quantities is fully determined by the experimentally constrained nuclear symmetry energy $S$ and its slope $L$. Variations of $L$ within current experimental uncertainties can change the (frequency-independent) bulk viscosity by orders of magnitude. This suggests that dissipative effects encoded in the gravitational-wave signatures of binary neutron star inspirals may help constrain nuclear symmetry energy properties.</description>

      <title>Perturbation Theory in the Minimally Extended Varying Speed of Light (meVSL) Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmological perturbation theory provides a fundamental framework for analyzing the evolution of density fluctuations and gravitational potentials in the Universe. It plays a crucial role in understanding large-scale structure formation and cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies. In this study, we apply perturbation theory to the minimally extended varying speed of light (meVSL) model to investigate the effects of a varying speed of light on the matter density contrast and the Newtonian gravitational potential. Unlike conventional models with a constant speed of light, the meVSL model introduces modifications to the cosmological evolution equations, leading to potential deviations in structure formation and gravitational interactions. By deriving and analyzing the perturbed equations within this framework, we explore how a varying speed of light affects the growth of density perturbations and the evolution of gravitational potentials. Compared to the standard constant speed of the light model, we find deviations of approximately $2$\% in the subhorizon modes of both quantities. Although detecting these effects observationally remains a significant challenge, our results provide new theoretical insights into the meVSL model and its potential observational signatures, such as the integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect and gravitational lensing of the CMB.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08027v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a correspondence between the gravitational phase space at null infinity and the subleading phase space near a finite-distance null hypersurface, such as a black hole horizon. Within this framework, we identify the celestial $Lw_{1+\infty}$ symmetries in the subleading phase space at the horizon by constructing their canonical generators and imposing self-duality conditions. This leads to an infinite tower of conserved charges in the absence of radiation, revealing new gravitational observables relevant to black hole physics.</description>

      <title>In the grip of the disk: dragging the companion through an AGN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active galactic nuclei (AGN) have been proposed as environments that can facilitate the capture of extreme-mass-ratio binaries and accelerate their inspiral beyond the rate expected from gravitational wave emission alone. In this work, we explore binaries shortly after capture, focusing on the evolution of the binary parameters when the system is still far from merger. We find that repeated interactions with the AGN disk typically reduce both the inclination and semi-major axis of the orbit. The evolution of the eccentricity is more intricate, exhibiting phases of growth and decay. Nevertheless, as the binary gradually aligns with the disk plane, the system tends to circularize. Interestingly, we also identify scenarios where initially highly eccentric, nearly counter-rotating orbits can undergo a rapid transition to co-rotation while maintaining a constant eccentricity. These dynamical effects could have significant implications for the modeling and interpretation of LISA sources.</description>

      <title>The canonical ensemble of a self-gravitating matter thin shell in AdS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We build the canonical ensemble of a hot self-gravitating matter thin shell in anti-de Sitter (AdS) space by finding its partition function through the Euclidean path integral approach with fixed temperature at the conformal boundary. We obtain the reduced action of the system by restricting the path integral to spherically symmetric metrics with given boundary conditions and with the Hamiltonian constraint satisfied. The stationary conditions, i.e., the mechanical equilibrium and the thermodynamic equilibrium, are obtained from minimizing the reduced action. Evaluating the perturbed reduced action at the stationary points yields the mechanical stability condition and the thermodynamic stability condition. The reduced action calculated at the stationary points gives the partition function in the zero-loop approximation and from it the thermodynamic properties of the system are acquired. Within thermodynamics alone, the only stability condition that one can establish is thermodynamic stability, which follows from the computation of the heat capacity. For given specific pressure and temperature equations of state for the shell, we obtain the solutions of the ensemble. There are four different thin shell solutions, one of them is fully stable, i.e., is stable mechanically and thermodynamically. For the equations of state given, we find a first order phase transition from the matter thermodynamic phase to the Hawking-Page black hole phase. Moreover, there is a maximum temperature above which the shell ceases to exist, presumably at these high temperatures the shell inevitably collapses to a black hole.</description>

      <title>Replica manifolds, pole skipping, and the butterfly effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The black hole butterfly effect is a signal of quantum chaos in holographic theories that can be probed in different ways, including out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs), pole skipping (PS), and entanglement wedge (EW) reconstruction. Each of these three phenomena can be used to define a butterfly velocity that measures the speed at which chaos spreads. In a general quantum system the three velocities $v_B^{\text{OTOC}}$, $v_B^{\text{PS}}$, and $v_B^{\text{EW}}$ can be different, but it is known from explicit calculations that they are all equal in certain holographic theories dual to Einstein gravity plus higher-curvature corrections. A conceptual explanation for this apparent coincidence is lacking. We show that it follows from a deeper relationship: The pole-skipping mode, added to the black hole background, can be reinterpreted as the gravitational replica manifold for the late-time entanglement wedge, and its imaginary part is the shockwave that computes the OTOC. Thus pole skipping is directly related to entanglement dynamics in holographic theories, and the origin of the pole-skipping mode is an extremal surface on the horizon. This explains the coincidence $v_B^{\text{OTOC}} = v_B^{\text{PS}} = v_B^{\text{EW}}$ in known cases, and extends it to general theories of gravity with a pole-skipping mode having the usual behavior.</description>

      <title>Perturbative Distinguishability of Black Hole Microstates from AdS/CFT Correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish direct evidence for the perturbative distinguishability between black hole microstates and thermal states using the AdS/CFT correspondence. In two-dimensional holographic conformal field theories, we obtain the short interval expansion of subsystem fidelity and quantum Jensen-Shannon divergence, both of which provide rigorous lower and upper bounds for trace distance. This result demonstrates that quantum gravity corrections break semiclassical indistinguishability, thereby supporting the recovery of information even from a small amount of the Hawking radiation.</description>

      <title>Astrophysical constraints on the simulation hypothesis for this Universe: why it is (nearly) impossible that we live in a simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We assess how physically realistic the ''simulation hypothesis'' for this Universe is, based on physical constraints arising from the link between information and energy, and on known astrophysical constraints. We investigate three cases: the simulation of the entire visible Universe, the simulation of Earth only, or a low resolution simulation of Earth, compatible with high-energy neutrino observations. In all cases, the amounts of energy or power required by any version of the simulation hypothesis are entirely incompatible with physics, or (literally) astronomically large, even in the lowest resolution case. Only universes with very different physical properties can produce some version of this Universe as a simulation. On the other hand, our results show that it is just impossible that this Universe is simulated by a universe sharing the same properties, regardless of technological advancements of the far future.</description>

      <title>Dependence of post-merger properties on the thermal heating efficiency in neutron star mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We systematically perform numerical-relativity simulations for equal-mass binary neutron star mergers for the models varying the thermal index $\Gamma_{\rm th}$ with 3 different equations of state (EOSs) of the neutron stars (NSs), which are consistent with current multi-messenger observational data and state-of-the-art theoretical calculations, and 2 different binary total mass ($m_0=2.7\ \text{and}\ 2.9~M_\odot$). By varying the value of $\Gamma_{\rm th}$ within the hybrid EOS framework, we investigate the thermal effects on the merger dynamics, gravitational waves (GWs), and the dynamical mass ejection process. We find that the choice of the constant $\Gamma_{\rm th}$ can change the outcome of the remnant for specific EOSs and $m_0$. We also show that the dynamical ejecta mass is affected by the $\Gamma_{\rm th}$ value in a different way for different EOSs: for a stiff EOS the ejecta mass is high when $\Gamma_{\rm th}$ is small, while for softer EOSs the largest ejecta is achieved when $\Gamma_{\rm th} = 1.3$--$1.4$. While the inspiral motion does not depend on the $\Gamma_{\rm th}$, the post merger phase evolution is highly affected by that. We show that the dominant peak frequency $f_2$ of the post merger GW spectrum monotonically decreases as the $\Gamma_{\rm th}$ increases. We find that the universal relations between NS macroscopic properties and post-merger GW frequencies are subject to non-negligible thermal uncertainties, which can obscure the universal relation between the tidal deformability and $f_2$.</description>

      <title>Screened volume law of Holographic Entanglement Entropy in Holographic Spontaneous Vectorization model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a holographic study of spontaneous vectorization in the background of an isotropic asymptotically AdS black brane. By extending spontaneous scalarization to vector fields, we demonstrate how the effective mass of the vector field drives tachyonic instability, leading to a transition from the AdS-RN phase to a vectorized phase. Thermodynamic analysis reveals the critical temperature $ T_c $ and coupling $ \alpha_c $ for this transition, with the vectorized phase exhibiting lower free energy. A central discovery is the emergence of a ``screened volume law'' in the holographic entanglement entropy (HEE), a novel phenomenon where the entanglement entropy scales with the subregion size via a screened entropy density distinct from thermal entropy. This arises from a geometric constraint tied to the vanishing of the Christoffel symbol $ \Gamma^z{}_{xx} $, which defines an effective boundary outside the horizons. Unlike conventional ``entanglement shadows'' in black hole systems, this surface acts as a boundary for minimal surfaces in a translationally invariant geometry. This screening effect suggests the inability of entanglement measure to fully probe the Hilbert space of this thermal system. Additionally, the HEE in the vectorized phase displays non-monotonic temperature dependence. These results establish spontaneous vectorization as a mechanism for generating novel entanglement structures in holographic systems, with implications for quantum information and critical phenomena in strongly coupled systems.</description>

      <title>Hidden Twin Star Solutions from an Agnostic Speed-of-Sound Model: Confronting XTE J1814--338's Extreme Compactness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The twin star configuration, where two neutron stars share the same mass but exhibit different radii, arises from a strong first-order phase transition within the stellar interior. In widely used equation of state (EoS) meta-models, such as the Polytrope (PP) and Speed-of-Sound (CS) models, this first-order phase transition behavior can be naturally mimicked by tuning some model parameters. Here, we systematically explore the under-explored parameter space within one of a widely adopted CS model that leads to twin stars via a strong first-order phase transition. Within this twin-star subspace, we perform a comprehensive Bayesian analysis that integrates mass--radius (MR) constraints from X-ray observations of rotation-powered millisecond pulsars. The resultant twin star branch, situated within the 1--1.2 $M_{\odot}$ mass range and approximately 7 km in radius, surprisingly coincides with the MR ranges proposed for the recent anomaly in the Accreting Millisecond X-ray Pulsars XTE J1814--338 (J1814), suggesting a hybrid twin star configuration. Moreover, incorporating the J1814 observation as an additional constraint yields an extreme phase transition pressure $P_{\text{trans}} = 108.9_{-4.85}^{+6.46}$ MeV/fm$^3$, a transition density of $\varepsilon_{\text{trans}}/\varepsilon_0 = 4.847_{-0.134}^{+0.271}$(where $\varepsilon_0$ is the nuclear saturation energy density) and an energy density jump $\Delta \varepsilon = 558.7_{-278.7}^{+303.6}$ MeV/fm$^3$, corresponding to $\Delta \varepsilon/\varepsilon_0 = 3.716_{-1.854}^{+2.020}$. Notably, to satisfy all astrophysical constraints, the speed of sound inside of the hybrid twin star core is driven toward the speed of light ($c_s^2/c^2 &gt; 0.9$), indicating the potential presence of strongly interacting, exotic matter in this core region.</description>

Abstract: In the present work, we obtain and analyze a new class of analytical solutions of magnetically charged black bounces in k-essence theory, spherically symmetric in (3+1)-dimensions, coupled to nonlinear electrodynamics (NED). We consider two metric models, Simpson-Visser and Bardeen, for the k-essence configurations n = 1/3 and n = 1/5. We obtain in an analytical way which scalar field, field potential, and Lagrangian NED are necessary to support the metrics. We analyze the behavior of these quantities and the energy conditions due to the scalar field and the NED.</description>

      <title>Detectability of lensed gravitational waves in matched-filtering searches</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13058v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational lensing by compact, small-scale intervening masses causes frequency-dependent distortions to gravitational-wave events. The optimal signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is often used as a proxy for the detectability of exotic signals in gravitational-wave searches. In reality, the detectability of such signals in a matched-filtering search requires comprehensive consideration of match-filtered SNR, signal-consistency test value, and other factors. In this work, we investigate for the first time the detectability of lensed gravitational waves from compact binary coalescences with a match-filtering search pipeline, GstLAL. Contrary to expectations from the optimal-SNR approximation approach, we show that the strength of a signal (i.e., higher optimal SNR) does not necessarily result in higher detectability. We also demonstrate that lensed gravitational waves with wave optics effects can suffer significantly, from $~90\%$ (unlensed) to $&lt;1\%$ (lensed) detection efficiency, due to downranking by the signal-consistency test values. These findings stress the need to extend current template banks to effectively search for lensed gravitational waves and to reassess current constraints on compact dark matter scenarios.</description>

      <title>A unified framework for graviton, "partially massless" graviton, and photon fields in de Sitter spacetime under conformal symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07367v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a conformally invariant (CI) framework in $(1+3)$-dimensional de Sitter (dS) spacetime, that unifies the descriptions of graviton, ``partially massless'' graviton, and photon fields. This framework is grounded in a rigorous group-theoretical analysis in the Wigner sense and employs Dirac's six-cone formalism. Originally introduced by Dirac, the concept of conformal space and the six-cone formalism were used to derive the field equations for spinor and vector fields in $(1+3)$-dimensional Minkowski spacetime in a manifestly CI form. Our framework extends this approach to dS spacetime, unifying the treatment of massless and ``partially massless'' fields with integer spin $s&gt;0$ under conformal symmetry. This unification enhances the understanding of fundamental aspects of gravitational theories in curved backgrounds.</description>

      <title>Toward a realistic Buchdahl limit in f(R) theories of gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07933v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The so-called Buchdahl limit is not yet fully understood in the context of theories of gravity beyond the Einsteinian framework. In this investigation, we generalize this limit for the case of static, spherically-symmetric, relativistic compact stars in f(R) theories of gravity within the metric formalism. We present a comprehensive analysis that ensures regularity, thermodynamic stability, fulfillment of all required junction conditions, recovery of the Newtonian potential at long distances and a correct extraction of the asymptotic mass. Our results are exemplified for the f(R)=R+ alpha R^2 Starobinsky model and several realistic equations of state describing neutron-star matter. We also compare these results with the case of compact stars immersed ad hoc in an Schwarzschild exterior vacuum, although this scenario does not fulfill all necessary f(R) junction conditions. To test the validity of viable f(R) models, we show that such stars can indeed host additional energetic content, so their gravitational redshift can be greater than 2, which is prohibited in General Relativity.</description>

      <title>Measuring anisotropies in the PTA band with cross-correlations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17401v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The astrophysical gravitational wave background in the nanohertz (nHz) band is expected to be primarily composed of the superposition of signals from binaries of supermassive black holes. The spatial discreteness of these sources introduces shot noise, which, in certain regimes, would overwhelm efforts to measure the anisotropy of the gravitational wave background. Moreover, the fact the time-residual map has a finite angular resolution and the presence of pulsar noise, affects our ability to construct the angular power spectrum of the anisotropy from a time-residual map (finite resolution noise). In this work, we explicitly demonstrate, starting from first principles, that cross-correlating a gravitational wave background map with a sufficiently dense galaxy survey can mitigate this issue. This approach could potentially reveal underlying properties of the gravitational wave background that would otherwise remain obscured. We quantify both the shot noise and the finite resolution noise level and show that cross-correlating the gravitational wave background with a galaxy catalog improves by more than one order of magnitude the prospects for a first detection of the background anisotropy by a gravitational wave observatory operating in the nHz frequency range. In particular, we find that with a futuristic scenario with an effective number of frequencies equal to $N_f=10$, the detection of the spectral amplitude can be achieved combining the first $20$ multipoles, with a threshold to resolve single events SKA-like. Increasing observation time, pulsar number or reducing the pulsar white noise considerably improves the detection significance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00728v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultralight boson clouds can form around black holes in binaries through superradiance, and undergo resonant level transitions at certain orbit frequencies. In this work, we investigate the gravitational waves emitted by the clouds during resonant level transitions, and forecast their detectability with future gravitational wave observations. We find that, for scalar fields of mass around $10^{-12}$ eV, clouds in stellar mass black hole binaries can radiate gravitational waves around $0.1$ Hz during hyperfine level transition, that can be detected with future gravitational wave detectors such as DECIGO and BBO, providing a potential way of searching for ultralight boson fields. We also consider the clouds in intermediate mass black hole binaries, which can emit milli-Hz gravitational waves during hyperfine level transition. The resulting gravitational waves, however, can be hardly detected with LISA-like detectors.</description>

      <title>Thin-shell gravastar model in a BTZ geometry with minimum length</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03824v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct two spherically symmetric thin-shell gravastar models within a BTZ geometry with minimum length. Therefore, in the inner region of the gravastar, we consider an anti- de Sitter metric with minimum length. Thus, for the first model, we introduce the minimum length effect using the probability density of the ground state of the hydrogen atom in two dimensions. For the second gravastar model, we adopt a Lorentzian-type distribution. Also in the outer region, we consider the BTZ black hole metric. So, by examining the inner spacetime, the thin shell, and the outer spacetime, we find that there are different physical characteristics regarding their energy densities and pressures that make the gravastar stable. This effect persists even when the cosmological constant is zero. In addition, we determined the entropy of the gravastar thin shell. Besides, we explore the thermodynamic properties of the BTZ black hole with minimum length in Schwarzschild-type form and also check its stability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04567v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work establishes a series of no-go conjectures that impose rigorous constraints on the localization of bulk fields in braneworld scenarios, specifically affecting gauge and spinor fields within five-dimensional spacetimes. Our approach differs from traditional methods as it does not rely on specific equations of motion, making our results broadly applicable across various braneworld models. These no-go conditions reveal fundamental limitations in field localization, challenging the feasibility of embedding fields on the brane. For instance, our analysis demonstrates that existing models fail to achieve consistent localization for gauge and spinor fields. Additionally, one of our conditions indicates that the effective Lagrangian on the brane cannot exhibit conformal invariance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10425v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we constrain the values of the parameters of the Generalized Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (GTOV) equation through Bayesian inference. We use the mass and radius data from the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) for PSR J0740$+$6620 and PSR J0030$+$0451, as well as the mass, radius, and dimensionless tidal deformability from the gravitational wave (GW) events GW190814 and GW170817. We use two distinct parameterizations of the extended non-linear Walecka model (eNLW) with and without hyperons. The GTOV employed for the study contains additional free parameters with different physical motivations. Two possible scenarios are considered in our analysis: conservative and speculative. In the first case, we take into account the most reliable neutron star (NS) data from NICER and the GW170817 event. In the second case, we consider the possibility that the compact object with a mass of $2.54 M_{\odot}$ in the GW190814 event is an NS. Our findings show significant improvements in the physical quantities analyzed, leading to better agreement with the observational data compared to the results obtained using the TOV equation.</description>

      <title>Spin-Dependent Force and Inverted Harmonic Potential for Rapid Creation of Macroscopic Quantum Superpositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11909v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Creating macroscopic spatial superposition states is crucial for investigating matter-wave interferometry and advancing quantum sensor technology. Currently, two potential methods exist to achieve this objective. The first involves using inverted harmonic potential (IHP) to spatially delocalize quantum states through coherent inflation [1]. The second method employs a spin-dependent force to separate two massive wave packets spatially [2]. The disadvantage of the former method is the slow initial coherent inflation, while the latter is hindered by the diamagnetism of spin-embedded nanocrystals, which suppresses spatial separation. In this study, we integrate two methods: first, we use the spin-dependent force to generate initial spatial separation, and second, we use IHP to achieve coherent inflating trajectories of the wavepackets. This approach enables the attainment of massive large spatial superposition in minimal time. For instance, a spatial superposition with a mass of $10^{-15}$ kg and a size of 50 $\mu$m is realized in $0.1$ seconds. We also calculate the evolution of wave packets in both harmonic potential (HP) and IHP using path integral approach.</description>

      <title>On the Schwinger effect during axion inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16538v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pair-creation of charged particles in a strong gauge-field background - the renowned Schwinger effect - can strongly alter the efficiency of gauge-field production during axion inflation. It is therefore crucial to have a clear understanding and proper description of this phenomenon to obtain reliable predictions for the physical observables in this model. In the present work, we revisit the problem of Schwinger pair production during axion inflation in the presence of both electric and magnetic fields and improve on the state of the art in two ways: (i) taking into account that the electric- and magnetic-field three-vectors are in general not collinear, we derive the vector decomposition of the Schwinger-induced current in terms of these fields and determine the corresponding effective electric and magnetic conductivities; (ii) by identifying the physical momentum scale associated with the pair-creation process, we incorporate Schwinger damping of the gauge field in a scale-dependent fashion in the relevant equations of motion. Implementing this new description in the framework of the gradient-expansion formalism, we obtain numerical results in a benchmark scenario of axion inflation and perform a comprehensive comparison with earlier results in the literature. In some cases, the resulting energy densities of the produced gauge fields differ from the old results by more than one order of magnitude, which reflects the importance of taking the new effects into account.</description>

      <title>Fast Radio Bursts as probes of the late-time universe: a new insight on the Hubble tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01974v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are bright radio transient events, a subset of which have been localized to their host galaxies. Their high dispersion measures offer valuable insights into the ionized plasma along their line of sight, enabling them to serve as probes of cosmological parameters. One of the major challenges in contemporary cosmology is the Hubble tension -- an unresolved discrepancy between two independent methods of determining the Universe's expansion rate, yielding differing values for the Hubble constant. In this study, we analyze a sample of 64 extragalactic, localized FRBs observed by various telescopes, employing Bayesian analysis with distinct likelihood functions. Our findings suggest that FRBs serve as tracers of the Hubble constant in the late-time Universe. Notably, our results exhibit smaller error bars compared to previous studies, and the derived Hubble constant with 1$\sigma$ error bars no longer overlap with those obtained from early-Universe measurements. These results underscore the continuing tension between early- and late-time measurements of the Hubble constant.</description>

      <title>Unitarity through PT symmetry in Quantum Quadratic Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08278v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Theories described by non-Hermitian Hamiltonians are known to possess strictly positive energy eigenvalues and exhibit unitary time evolution if the Hamiltonian is symmetric under discrete parity and time (PT) transformation. In this work, we demonstrate how quantum quadratic gravity, a theory that generally violates unitarity when viewed as a Hermitian quantum field theory, can be complex-deformed into such a PT-symmetric theory with an action that consists of a ghost-less Hermitian free part and non-Hermitian interactions. Paying special attention to the gauge symmetry present in the theory, we quantize in the covariant operator formalism after suggesting how the framework might be extended to the pseudo-Hermitian picture. We find compelling evidence that the resulting quantum theory possesses a unitary inner product and a sensible interpretation of quantum probability, thus avoiding the ghost problem present in the Hermitian formulation of quadratic gravity.</description>

      <title>Robustness of dark energy phenomenology across different parameterizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04929v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent evidence for dynamical dark energy from DESI, in combination with other cosmological data, has generated significant interest in understanding the nature of dark energy and its underlying microphysics. However, interpreting these results critically depends on how dark energy is parameterized. This paper examines the robustness of conclusions about the viability of particular kinds of dynamical dark energy models to the choice of parameterization, focusing on four popular two-parameter models: the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL), Jassal-Bagla-Padmanabhan (JBP), Barboza-Alcaniz (BA), and exponential (EXP) parameterizations. We find that conclusions regarding the viability of minimally and non-minimally coupled quintessence models are independent of the parameterization adopted. We demonstrate this both by mapping these dark energy models into the $(w_0, w_a)$ parameter space defined by these various parameterizations and by showing that all of these parameterizations can equivalently account for the phenomenology predicted by these dark energy models to a high degree of accuracy.</description>

      <title>Has DESI detected exponential quintessence?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04226v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The new Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) DR2 results have strengthened the possibility that dark energy is dynamical, i.e., it has evolved over the history of the Universe. One simple, but theoretically well motivated and widely studied, physical model of dynamical dark energy is minimally coupled, single-field quintessence $\phi$ with an exponential potential $V(\phi)=V_0\,e^{-\lambda\phi}$. We perform a full Bayesian statistical analysis of the model using the DESI DR2 data, in combination with other cosmological observations, to constrain the model's parameters and to compare its goodness of fit to that of the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. We find that the quintessence model provides a significantly better fit to the data, both when the spatial curvature of the Universe is fixed to zero and when it is allowed to vary. The significance of the preference varies between $\sim3.3\sigma$ and $\sim3.8\sigma$, depending on whether the curvature density parameter $\Omega_K$ is fixed or varied. We obtain the values $0.698^{+0.173}_{-0.202}$ and $0.722^{+0.182}_{-0.208}$ at the $68.3\%$ (i.e., $1\sigma$) confidence level for the parameter $\lambda$ in the absence and presence of $\Omega_K$, respectively, which imply $\sim3.5\sigma$ preference for a nonzero $\lambda$. We also obtain $\Omega_K=0.003\pm 0.001$, which implies $\sim3\sigma$ preference for a positive $\Omega_K$, i.e., a negative curvature. Finally, we discuss the differences between quintessence and phenomenological parametrizations of the dark energy equation-of-state parameter, in particular the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parametrization, as well as a few caveats to our results.</description>
