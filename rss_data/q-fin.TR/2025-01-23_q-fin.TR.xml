      <title>Optimal Rebate Design: Incentives, Competition and Efficiency in Auction Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the design of an efficient rebate policy in auction markets, focusing on a continuous-time setting with competition among market participants. In this model, a stock exchange collects transaction fees from auction investors executing block trades to buy or sell a risky asset, then redistributes these fees as rebates to competing market makers submitting limit orders. Market makers influence both the price at which the asset trades and their arrival intensity in the auction. We frame this problem as a principal-multi-agent problem and provide necessary and sufficient conditions to characterize the Nash equilibrium among market makers. The exchange's optimization problem is formulated as a high-dimensional Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation with Poisson jump processes, which is solved using a verification result. To numerically compute the optimal rebate and transaction fee policies, we apply the Deep BSDE method. Our results show that optimal transaction fees and rebate structures improve market efficiency by narrowing the spread between the auction clearing price and the asset's fundamental value, while ensuring a minimal gain for both market makers indexed on the price of the asset on a coexisting limit order book.</description>

      <title>Statistical Learning with Sublinear Regret of Propagator Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.05157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.05157v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a class of learning problems in which an agent liquidates a risky asset while creating both transient price impact driven by an unknown convolution propagator and linear temporary price impact with an unknown parameter. We characterize the trader's performance as maximization of a revenue-risk functional, where the trader also exploits available information on a price predicting signal. We present a trading algorithm that alternates between exploration and exploitation phases and achieves sublinear regrets with high probability. For the exploration phase we propose a novel approach for non-parametric estimation of the price impact kernel by observing only the visible price process and derive sharp bounds on the convergence rate, which are characterised by the singularity of the propagator. These kernel estimation methods extend existing methods from the area of Tikhonov regularisation for inverse problems and are of independent interest. The bound on the regret in the exploitation phase is obtained by deriving stability results for the optimizer and value function of the associated class of infinite-dimensional stochastic control problems. As a complementary result we propose a regression-based algorithm to estimate the conditional expectation of non-Markovian signals and derive its convergence rate.</description>
