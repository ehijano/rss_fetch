      <title>A Random Forest approach to detect and identify Unlawful Insider Trading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: According to The Exchange Act, 1934 unlawful insider trading is the abuse of access to privileged corporate information. While a blurred line between "routine" the "opportunistic" insider trading exists, detection of strategies that insiders mold to maneuver fair market prices to their advantage is an uphill battle for hand-engineered approaches. In the context of detailed high-dimensional financial and trade data that are structurally built by multiple covariates, in this study, we explore, implement and provide detailed comparison to the existing study (Deng et al. (2019)) and independently implement automated end-to-end state-of-art methods by integrating principal component analysis to the random forest (PCA-RF) followed by a standalone random forest (RF) with 320 and 3984 randomly selected, semi-manually labeled and normalized transactions from multiple industry. The settings successfully uncover latent structures and detect unlawful insider trading. Among the multiple scenarios, our best-performing model accurately classified 96.43 percent of transactions. Among all transactions the models find 95.47 lawful as lawful and $98.00$ unlawful as unlawful percent. Besides, the model makes very few mistakes in classifying lawful as unlawful by missing only 2.00 percent. In addition to the classification task, model generated Gini Impurity based features ranking, our analysis show ownership and governance related features based on permutation values play important roles. In summary, a simple yet powerful automated end-to-end method relieves labor-intensive activities to redirect resources to enhance rule-making and tracking the uncaptured unlawful insider trading transactions. We emphasize that developed financial and trading features are capable of uncovering fraudulent behaviors.</description>

      <title>Applying Informer for Option Pricing: A Transformer-Based Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate option pricing is essential for effective trading and risk management in financial markets, yet it remains challenging due to market volatility and the limitations of traditional models like Black-Scholes. In this paper, we investigate the application of the Informer neural network for option pricing, leveraging its ability to capture long-term dependencies and dynamically adjust to market fluctuations. This research contributes to the field of financial forecasting by introducing Informer's efficient architecture to enhance prediction accuracy and provide a more adaptable and resilient framework compared to existing methods. Our results demonstrate that Informer outperforms traditional approaches in option pricing, advancing the capabilities of data-driven financial forecasting in this domain.</description>

      <title>FlowOE: Imitation Learning with Flow Policy from Ensemble RL Experts for Optimal Execution under Heston Volatility and Concave Market Impacts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optimal execution in financial markets refers to the process of strategically transacting a large volume of assets over a period to achieve the best possible outcome by balancing the trade-off between market impact costs and timing or volatility risks. Traditional optimal execution strategies, such as static Almgren-Chriss models, often prove suboptimal in dynamic financial markets. This paper propose flowOE, a novel imitation learning framework based on flow matching models, to address these limitations. FlowOE learns from a diverse set of expert traditional strategies and adaptively selects the most suitable expert behavior for prevailing market conditions. A key innovation is the incorporation of a refining loss function during the imitation process, enabling flowOE not only to mimic but also to improve upon the learned expert actions. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to apply flow matching models in a stochastic optimal execution problem. Empirical evaluations across various market conditions demonstrate that flowOE significantly outperforms both the specifically calibrated expert models and other traditional benchmarks, achieving higher profits with reduced risk. These results underscore the practical applicability and potential of flowOE to enhance adaptive optimal execution.</description>

      <title>Robust financial calibration: a Bayesian approach for neural SDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06551v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper presents a Bayesian framework for the calibration of financial models using neural stochastic differential equations (neural SDEs), for which we also formulate a global universal approximation theorem based on Barron-type estimates. The method is based on the specification of a prior distribution on the neural network weights and an adequately chosen likelihood function. The resulting posterior distribution can be seen as a mixture of different classical neural SDE models yielding robust bounds on the implied volatility surface. Both, historical financial time series data and option price data are taken into consideration, which necessitates a methodology to learn the change of measure between the risk-neutral and the historical measure. The key ingredient for a robust numerical optimization of the neural networks is to apply a Langevin-type algorithm, commonly used in the Bayesian approaches to draw posterior samples.</description>

      <title>The Structure of Financial Equity Research Reports -- Identification of the Most Frequently Asked Questions in Financial Analyst Reports to Automate Equity Research Using Llama 3 and GPT-4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18327v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This research dissects financial equity research reports (ERRs) by mapping their content into categories. There is insufficient empirical analysis of the questions answered in ERRs. In particular, it is not understood how frequently certain information appears, what information is considered essential, and what information requires human judgment to distill into an ERR. The study analyzes 72 ERRs sentence-by-sentence, classifying their 4940 sentences into 169 unique question archetypes. We did not predefine the questions but derived them solely from the statements in the ERRs. This approach provides an unbiased view of the content of the observed ERRs. Subsequently, we used public corporate reports to classify the questions' potential for automation. Answers were labeled "text-extractable" if the answers to the question were accessible in corporate reports. 78.7% of the questions in ERRs can be automated. Those automatable question consist of 48.2% text-extractable (suited to processing by large language models, LLMs) and 30.5% database-extractable questions. Only 21.3% of questions require human judgment to answer. We empirically validate using Llama-3-70B and GPT-4-turbo-2024-04-09 that recent advances in language generation and information extraction enable the automation of approximately 80% of the statements in ERRs. Surprisingly, the models complement each other's strengths and weaknesses well. The research confirms that the current writing process of ERRs can likely benefit from additional automation, improving quality and efficiency. The research thus allows us to quantify the potential impacts of introducing large language models in the ERR writing process. The full question list, including the archetypes and their frequency, will be made available online after peer review.</description>
