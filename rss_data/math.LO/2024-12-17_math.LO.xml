      <title>Frege on the reference of sentences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to show that Frege's argument which concluded that the reference of a sentence is its truth-value, presented in 'On Sense and Reference' (1892), can be reconstructed taking into account the problems of the notion of conceptual content presented in the 'Begriffsschrift' (1879) and also other passages from a letter to Russell (1902) and the posthumous 'Logic in Mathematics' (1914). Once the `hybrid' notion of conceptual content was rejected as the semantic value of the expressions of the formal language designed to carry out the logicist project, there was no alternative between truth-values and thoughts. I claim that the reconstructed argument is perfectly sound and convincing.</description>

      <title>Analytic proofs for logics of evidence and truth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a sound, complete, and decidable analytic tableau system for the logic of evidence and truth \letf, introduced in
  Rodrigues, Bueno-Soler \&amp; Carnielli (Synthese, DOI: 10.1007/s11229-020-02571-w, 2020). \letf\ is an extension of the logic of first-degree entailment (\fde), also known as Belnap-Dunn logic. \fde\ is a widely studied four-valued paraconsistent logic, with applications in computer science and in the algebra of processes. \letf\ extends \fde\ in a very natural way, by adding a classicality operator \cons, which recovers classical logic for propositions in its scope, and a non-classicality operator \incon, dual of \cons.</description>

      <title>Relative differential closure in Hardy fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study relative differential closure in the context of Hardy fields. Using our earlier work on algebraic differential equations over Hardy fields, this leads to a proof of a conjecture of Boshernitzan (1981): the intersection of all maximal analytic Hardy fields agrees with that of all maximal Hardy fields. We also generalize a key ingredient in the proof, and describe a cautionary example delineating the boundaries of its applicability.</description>

      <title>The Monadic Grzegorczyk Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a semantic criterion for determining whether a given monadic modal logic axiomatizes the one-variable fragment of a predicate modal logic. We show that the criterion applies to the monadic Grzegorczyk logic \textbf{MGrz}, thus establishing that \textbf{MGrz} axiomatizes the one-variable fragment of the predicate Grzegorczyk logic \textbf{QGrz}. This we do by proving the finite model property of \textbf{MGrz}, which is achieved by strengthening the notion of a maximal point of a descriptive \textbf{MGrz}-frame and by refining the existing selective filtration methods.</description>

      <title>An arithmetic algebraic regularity lemma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give an 'arithmetic regularity lemma' for groups definable in finite fields, analogous to Tao's 'algebraic regularity lemma' for graphs definable in finite fields. More specifically, we show that, for any $M&gt;0$, any finite field $\mathbf{F}$, and any definable group $(G,\cdot)$ in $\mathbf{F}$ and definable subset $D\subseteq G$, each of complexity at most $M$, there is a normal definable subgroup $H\leqslant G$, of index and complexity $O_M(1)$, such that the following holds: for any cosets $V,W$ of $H$, the bipartite graph $(V,W,xy^{-1}\in D)$ is $O_M(|\mathbf{F}|^{-1/2})$-quasirandom. Various analogous regularity conditions follow; for example, for any $g\in G$, the Fourier coefficient $||\widehat{1}_{H\cap Dg}(\pi)||_{\mathrm{op}}$ is $O_M(|\mathbf{F}|^{-1/8})$ for every non-trivial irreducible representation $\pi$ of $H$.</description>

      <title>Properties preserved by classes of Chu transforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chu spaces and Chu transforms were first investigated in category theory by Barr and Chu in 1979. In 2000 van Benthem shifted to the model-theoretic point of view by isolating a class of infinitary two-sorted properties, the flow formulas, which are preserved by all Chu transforms. D\v{z}amonja and V\"a\"an\"anen in 2021 considered a special kind of Chu transforms, satisfying a density condition. These authors used dense Chu transforms to compare abstract logics, in particular showing that such transforms preserve compactness.
  This motivates the problem of characterizing which properties are preserved by dense Chu transforms. We solve this problem by isolating the inconsistency-flow formulas, which are flow formulas with an added predicate to express inconsistency. Our main result characterizes the first-order inconsistency-flow formulas exactly as those first-order properties preserved by dense Chu transforms. Furthermore, we consider several instances of Chu transforms in concrete situations such as topological spaces, graphs and ultrafilters. In particular, we prove that Chu transforms between ultrafilters correspond to the Rudin-Keisler ordering.</description>

      <title>Ramsey-like theorems for the Schreier barrier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The family of finite subsets $s$ of the natural numbers such that $|s|=1+\min s$ is known as the Schreier barrier in combinatorics and Banach Space theory, and as the family of exactly $\omega$-large sets in Logic. We formulate and prove the generalizations of Friedman's Free Set and Thin Set theorems and of Rainbow Ramsey's theorem to colorings of the Schreier barrier. We analyze the strength of these theorems from the point of view of Computability Theory and Reverse Mathematics. Surprisingly, the exactly $\omega$-large counterparts of the Thin Set and Free Set theorems can code $\emptyset^{(\omega)}$, while the exactly $\omega$-large Rainbow Ramsey theorem does not code the halting set.</description>

      <title>Products of C*-algebras that do not embed into the Calkin algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the Calkin algebra $\mathcal{Q}(\ell_2)$, i.e., the quotient of the algebra $\mathcal B(\ell_2)$ of all bounded linear operators on the separable Hilbert space $\ell_2$ divided by the ideal $\mathcal K(\ell_2)$ of all compact operators on $\ell_2$. We show that in the Cohen model of set theory ZFC there is no embedding of the product $(c_0(2^\omega))^{\mathbb{N}}$ of infinitely many copies of the abelian C*-algebra $c_0(2^\omega)$ into $\mathcal{Q}(\ell_2)$ (while $c_0(2^\omega)$ always embeds into $\mathcal{Q}(\ell_2)$). This enlarges the collection of the known examples due to Vaccaro and to McKenney and Vignati of abelian algebras, asymptotic sequence algebras, reduced products and coronas of stabilizations which consistently do not embed into the Calkin algebra. As in the Cohen model the rigidity of quotient structures fails in general, our methods do not rely on these rigidity phenomena as is the case of most examples mentioned above. The results should be considered in the context of the result of Farah, Hirshberg and Vignati which says that consistently all C*-algebras of density up to $2^\omega$ do embed into $\mathcal{Q}(\ell_2)$. In particular, the algebra $(c_0(2^\omega))^{\mathbb{N}}$ consistently embeds into the Calkin algebra as well.</description>

      <title>The Relational Quotient Completion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Taking a quotient roughly means changing the notion of equality on a given object, set or type. In a quantitative setting, equality naturally generalises to a distance, measuring how much elements are similar instead of just stating their equivalence. Hence, quotients can be understood quantitatively as a change of distance.
  In this paper, we show how, combining Lawvere's doctrines and the calculus of relations, one can unify quantitative and usual quotients in a common picture. More in detail, we introduce relational doctrines as a functorial description of (the core of) the calculus of relations. Then, we define quotients and a universal construction adding them to any relational doctrine, generalising the quotient completion of existential elementary doctrine and also recovering many quantitative examples. This construction deals with an intensional notion of quotient and breaks extensional equality of morphisms. Then, we describe another construction forcing extensionality, showing how it abstracts several notions of separation in metric and topological structures. Combining these two constructions, we get the extensional quotient completion, whose essential image is characterized through the notion of projective cover. As an application, we show that, under suitable conditions, relational doctrines of algebras arise as the extensional quotient completion of free algebras. Finally, we compare relational doctrines to other categorical structures where one can model the calculus of relations.</description>

      <title>Borel Local Lemma: arbitrary random variables and limited exponential growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Lov\'asz Local Lemma (the LLL for short) is a powerful tool in probabilistic combinatorics that is used to verify the existence of combinatorial objects with desirable properties. Recent years saw the development of various "constructive" versions of the LLL. A major success of this research direction is the Borel version of the LLL due to Cs\'oka, Grabowski, M\'ath\'e, Pikhurko, and Tyros, which holds under a subexponential growth assumption. A drawback of their approach is that it only applies when the underlying random variables take values in a finite set. We present an alternative proof of a Borel version of the LLL that holds even if the underlying random variables are continuous and applies to dependency graphs of limited exponential growth.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.11220v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Several structural results about permutation groups of finite rank definable in differentially closed fields of characteristic zero (and other similar theories) are obtained. In particular, it is shown that every finite rank definably primitive permutation group is definably isomorphic to an algebraic permutation group living in the constants. Applications include the verification, in differentially closed fields, of the finite Morley rank permutation group conjectures of Borovik-Deloro and Borovik-Cherlin. Applying the results to binding groups for internality to the constants, it is deduced that if complete types $p$ and $q$ are of rank $m$ and $n$, respectively, and are nonorthogonal, then the $(m+3)$rd Morley power of $p$ is not weakly orthogonal to the $(n+3)$rd Morley power of $q$. An application to transcendence of generic solutions of pairs of algebraic differential equations is given.</description>

In this paper we improve this to $o(\kappa)\geq\kappa+1$ and show that if $\kappa$ is a $\kappa^{++}$-supercompact cardinal, then there is a symmetric extension in which it is the least inaccessible and the least measurable cardinal.</description>

      <title>Elementary equivalence of endomorphism rings and automorphism groups of periodic Abelian groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11098v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove that the endomorphism rings End A and End A' of periodic infinite Abelian groups A and A' are elementarily equivalent if and only if the endomorphism rings of their p-components are elementarily equivalent for all primes p. Additionally, we show that the automorphism groups Aut A and Aut A' of periodic Abelian groups A and A' that do not have 2-components and do not contain cocyclic p-components are elementarily equivalent if and only if, for any prime p, the corresponding p-components A_p and A_p' of A and A' are equivalent in second-order logic if they are not reduced, and are equivalent in second-order logic bounded by the cardinalities of their basic subgroups if they are reduced. For such groups A and A', their automorphism groups are elementarily equivalent if and only if their endomorphism rings are elementarily equivalent, and the automorphism groups of the corresponding p-components for all primes p are elementarily equivalent.</description>
