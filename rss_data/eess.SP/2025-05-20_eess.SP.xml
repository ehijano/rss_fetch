      <title>Joint Precoding and Probabilistic Constellation Shaping using Arithmetic Distribution Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of joint shaping and precoding is studied in this paper. We introduce statistical dependencies among consecutive symbols to shape the constellation while minimizing the total transmit power when the signal goes through the precoding filter. We propose a stationary Markovian model for optimizing the transition probability of transmit symbols to avoid high-energy sequences when convolved with the precoding filter. A new algorithm based on arithmetic coding is proposed to generate a shaped sequence of symbols with the given Markov model transition probabilities.</description>

      <title>S-Crescendo: A Nested Transformer Weaving Framework for Scalable Nonlinear System in S-Domain Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulation of high-order nonlinear system requires extensive computational resources, especially in modern VLSI backend design where bifurcation-induced instability and chaos-like transient behaviors pose challenges. We present S-Crescendo - a nested transformer weaving framework that synergizes S-domain with neural operators for scalable time-domain prediction in high-order nonlinear networks, alleviating the computational bottlenecks of conventional solvers via Newton-Raphson method. By leveraging the partial-fraction decomposition of an n-th order transfer function into first-order modal terms with repeated poles and residues, our method bypasses the conventional Jacobian matrix-based iterations and efficiently reduces computational complexity from cubic $O(n^3)$ to linear $O(n)$.The proposed architecture seamlessly integrates an S-domain encoder with an attention-based correction operator to simultaneously isolate dominant response and adaptively capture higher-order non-linearities. Validated on order-1 to order-10 networks, our method achieves up to 0.99 test-set ($R^2$) accuracy against HSPICE golden waveforms and accelerates simulation by up to 18(X), providing a scalable, physics-aware framework for high-dimensional nonlinear modeling.</description>

      <title>Fine-Grained ECG-Text Contrastive Learning via Waveform Understanding Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrocardiograms (ECGs) are essential for diagnosing cardiovascular diseases. While previous ECG-text contrastive learning methods have shown promising results, they often overlook the incompleteness of the reports. Given an ECG, the report is generated by first identifying key waveform features and then inferring the final diagnosis through these features. Despite their importance, these waveform features are often not recorded in the report as intermediate results. Aligning ECGs with such incomplete reports impedes the model's ability to capture the ECG's waveform features and limits its understanding of diagnostic reasoning based on those features. To address this, we propose FG-CLEP (Fine-Grained Contrastive Language ECG Pre-training), which aims to recover these waveform features from incomplete reports with the help of large language models (LLMs), under the challenges of hallucinations and the non-bijective relationship between waveform features and diagnoses. Additionally, considering the frequent false negatives due to the prevalence of common diagnoses in ECGs, we introduce a semantic similarity matrix to guide contrastive learning. Furthermore, we adopt a sigmoid-based loss function to accommodate the multi-label nature of ECG-related tasks. Experiments on six datasets demonstrate that FG-CLEP outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both zero-shot prediction and linear probing across these datasets.</description>

      <title>OFDM Based Bistatic Integrated Sensing and Communication: Sensing Beyond CP Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates a bistatic OFDM-based integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system under a single-target scenario, considering both line-of-sight (LOS) presence and LOS blockage cases. A sliding window-based sensing receiver architecture is proposed to extend the intersymbol interference (ISI)-free sensing range beyond the cyclic prefix (CP) duration by exploiting pilot symbols embedded in the time-frequency grid. The performance of the proposed receiver is evaluated in terms of range and velocity estimation accuracy and is compared against the Cramer-Rao bounds (CRBs) for the bi-static ISAC setting. Numerical results confirm that the proposed method achieves estimation performance that closely approaches the CRBs in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime.</description>

      <title>UAV-Enabled Joint Sensing, Communication, Powering and Backhaul Transmission in Maritime Monitoring Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of energy-constrained maritime monitoring networks by proposing an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled integrated sensing, communication, powering and backhaul transmission scheme with a tailored time-division duplex frame structure. Within each time slot, the UAV sequentially implements sensing, wireless charging and uplink receiving with buoys, and lastly forwards part of collected data to the central ship via backhaul links. Considering the tight coupling among these functions, we jointly optimize time allocation, UAV trajectory, UAV-buoy association, and power scheduling to maximize the performance of data collection, with the practical consideration of sea clutter effects during UAV sensing. A novel optimization framework combining alternating optimization, quadratic transform and augmented first-order Taylor approximation is developed, which demonstrates good convergence behavior and robustness. Simulation results show that under sensing quality-of-service constraint, buoys are able to achieve an average data rate over 22bps/Hz using around 2mW harvested power per active time slot, validating the scheme's effectiveness for open-sea monitoring. Additionally, it is found that under the influence of sea clutters, the optimal UAV trajectory always keeps a certain distance with buoys to strike a balance between sensing and other multi-functional transmissions.</description>

      <title>Simultaneously Exposing and Jamming Covert Communications via Disco Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Covert communications provide a stronger privacy protection than cryptography and physical-layer security (PLS). However, previous works on covert communications have implicitly assumed the validity of channel reciprocity, i.e., wireless channels remain constant or approximately constant during their coherence time. In this work, we investigate covert communications in the presence of a disco RIS (DRIS) deployed by the warden Willie, where the DRIS with random and time-varying reflective coefficients acts as a "disco ball", introducing timevarying fully-passive jamming (FPJ). Consequently, the channel reciprocity assumption no longer holds. The DRIS not only jams the covert transmissions between Alice and Bob, but also decreases the error probabilities of Willie's detections, without either Bob's channel knowledge or additional jamming power. To quantify the impact of the DRIS on covert communications, we first design a detection rule for the warden Willie in the presence of time-varying FPJ introduced by the DRIS. Then, we define the detection error probabilities, i.e., the false alarm rate (FAR) and the missed detection rate (MDR), as the monitoring performance metrics for Willie's detections, and the signal-to-jamming-plusnoise ratio (SJNR) as a communication performance metric for the covert transmissions between Alice and Bob. Based on the detection rule, we derive the detection threshold for the warden Willie to detect whether communications between Alice and Bob is ongoing, considering the time-varying DRIS-based FPJ. Moreover, we conduct theoretical analyses of the FAR and the MDR at the warden Willie, as well as SJNR at Bob, and then present unique properties of the DRIS-based FPJ in covert communications. We present numerical results to validate the derived theoretical analyses and evaluate the impact of DRIS on covert communications.</description>

      <title>Toward Near-Space Communication Network in the 6G and Beyond Era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Near-space communication network (NS-ComNet), as an indispensable component of sixth-generation (6G) and beyond mobile communication systems and the space-air-ground-sea integrated network (SAGSIN), demonstrates unique advantages in wide-area coverage, long-endurance high-altitude operation, and highly flexible deployment. This paper presents a comprehensive review of NS-ComNet for 6G and beyond era. Specifically, by contrasting satellite, low-altitude unmanned-aerial-vehicle (UAV), and terrestrial communications, we first elucidate the background and motivation for integrating NS-ComNet into 6G network architectures. Subsequently, we review the developmental status of near-space platforms, including high-altitude balloons, solar-powered UAVs, and stratospheric airships, and analyze critical challenges faced by NS-ComNet. To address these challenges, the research focuses on key enabling technologies such as topology design, resource and handover management, multi-objective joint optimization, etc., with particular emphasis on artificial intelligence techniques for NS-ComNet. Finally, envisioning future intelligent collaborative networks that integrate NS-ComNet with satellite-UAV-terrestrial systems, we explore promising directions. This paper aims to provide technical insights and research foundations for the systematic construction of NS-ComNet and its deep deployment in the 6G and beyond era.</description>

      <title>Resolving the Double Near-Far Problem via Wireless Powered Pinching-Antenna Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter introduces a novel wireless powered communication system, referred to as a wireless powered pinching-antenna network (WPPAN), utilizing a single waveguide with pinching antennas to address the double near-far problem inherent in wireless powered networks. In the proposed WPPAN, users harvest energy from spatially distributed pinching antennas in the downlink and use the collected power to transmit messages in the uplink. Furthermore, to manage the combinatorial complexity associated with activating the pinching antennas, we propose three approaches of varying complexity to simplify the original resource allocation problem and then solve it efficiently using convex optimization methods. Simulation results confirm that the proposed WPPAN system effectively mitigates the double near-far problem by providing antenna resources closer to the users, thereby enhancing both downlink energy harvesting and uplink data transmission.</description>

      <title>Bistatic Sensing in 5G NR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose and evaluate the performance of a 5th generation (5G) New Radio (NR) bistatic Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISaC) system. Unlike the full-duplex monostatic ISaC systems, the bistatic approach enables sensing in the current cellular networks without significantly modifying the transceiver design. The sensing utilizes data channels, such as the Physical Uplink Shared Channel (PUSCH), which carries information on the air interface. We provide the maximum likelihood estimator for the delay and Doppler parameters and derive a lower bound on the Mean Square Error (MSE) for a single target scenario. Link-level simulations show that it is possible to achieve significant throughput while accurately estimating the sensing parameters with PUSCH. Moreover, the results reveal an interesting tradeoff between the number of reference symbols, sensing performance, and throughput in the proposed 5G NR bistatic ISaC system.</description>

      <title>Multi-View Wireless Sensing via Conditional Generative Learning: Framework and Model Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we incorporate physical knowledge into learning-based high-precision target sensing using the multi-view channel state information (CSI) between multiple base stations (BSs) and user equipment (UEs). Such kind of multi-view sensing problem can be naturally cast into a conditional generation framework. To this end, we design a bipartite neural network architecture, the first part of which uses an elaborately designed encoder to fuse the latent target features embedded in the multi-view CSI, and then the second uses them as conditioning inputs of a powerful generative model to guide the target's reconstruction. Specifically, the encoder is designed to capture the physical correlation between the CSI and the target, and also be adaptive to the numbers and positions of BS-UE pairs. Therein the view-specific nature of CSI is assimilated by introducing a spatial positional embedding scheme, which exploits the structure of electromagnetic(EM)-wave propagation channels. Finally, a conditional diffusion model with a weighted loss is employed to generate the target's point cloud from the fused features. Extensive numerical results demonstrate that the proposed generative multi-view (Gen-MV) sensing framework exhibits excellent flexibility and significant performance improvement on the reconstruction quality of target's shape and EM properties.</description>

      <title>Bridging the Modality Gap: Enhancing Channel Prediction with Semantically Aligned LLMs and Knowledge Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate channel prediction is essential in massive multiple-input multiple-output (m-MIMO) systems to improve precoding effectiveness and reduce the overhead of channel state information (CSI) feedback. However, existing methods often suffer from accumulated prediction errors and poor generalization to dynamic wireless environments. Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable modeling and generalization capabilities in tasks such as time series prediction, making them a promising solution. Nevertheless, a significant modality gap exists between the linguistic knowledge embedded in pretrained LLMs and the intrinsic characteristics of CSI, posing substantial challenges for their direct application to channel prediction. Moreover, the large parameter size of LLMs hinders their practical deployment in real-world communication systems with stringent latency constraints. To address these challenges, we propose a novel channel prediction framework based on semantically aligned large models, referred to as CSI-ALM, which bridges the modality gap between natural language and channel information. Specifically, we design a cross-modal fusion module that aligns CSI representations . Additionally, we maximize the cosine similarity between word embeddings and CSI embeddings to construct semantic cues. To reduce complexity and enable practical implementation, we further introduce a lightweight version of the proposed approach, called CSI-ALM-Light. This variant is derived via a knowledge distillation strategy based on attention matrices. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that CSI-ALM achieves a 1 dB gain over state-of-the-art deep learning methods. Moreover, under limited training data conditions, CSI-ALM-Light, with only 0.34M parameters, attains performance comparable to CSI-ALM and significantly outperforms conventional deep learning approaches.</description>

      <title>Multi-Reference and Adaptive Nonlinear Transform Source-Channel Coding for Wireless Image Semantic Transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a multi-reference and adaptive nonlinear transform source-channel coding (MA-NTSCC) system for wireless image semantic transmission to improve rate-distortion (RD) performance by introducing multi-dimensional contexts into the entropy model of the state-of-the-art (SOTA) NTSCC system. Improvements in RD performance of the proposed MA-NTSCC system are particularly significant in high-resolution image transmission under low bandwidth constraints. The proposed multi-reference entropy model leverages correlations within the latent representation in both spatial and channel dimensions. In the spatial dimension, the latent representation is divided into anchors and non-anchors in a checkerboard pattern, where anchors serve as reference to estimate the mutual information between anchors and non-anchors. In the channel dimension, the latent representation is partitioned into multiple groups, and features in previous groups are analyzed to estimate the mutual information between features in previous and current groups. Taking mutual information into account, the entropy model provides an accurate estimation on the entropy, which enables efficient bandwidth allocation and enhances RD performance. Additionally, the proposed lightweight adaptation modules enable the proposed MA-NTSCC model to achieve transmission quality comparable to separately trained models across various channel conditions and bandwidth requirements. In contrast, traditional NTSCC models provide signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)-distortion performance degrading with channel quality deviating from the fixed training SNR, and consume inflexible bandwidth to transmit an image. Comprehensive experiments are conducted to verify the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) performance and adaptability of the proposed MA-NTSCC model superior to SOTA methods over both additive white Gaussian noise channel and Rayleigh fading channel.</description>

      <title>Algorithms for Nonlinear Mixed-Integer Location Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For three decades, carrier-phase observations have been used to obtain the most accurate location estimates using global navigation satellite systems (GNSS). These estimates are computed by minimizing a nonlinear mixed-integer least-squares problem. Existing algorithms linearize the problem, orthogonally project it to eliminate real variables, and then solve the integer least-square problem. There is now considerable interest in developing similar localization techniques for terrestrial and indoor settings. We show that algorithms that linearize first fail in these settings and we propose several algorithms for computing the estimates. Some of our algorithms are elimination algorithms that start by eliminating the non-linear terms in the constraints; others construct a geometric arrangement that allows us to efficiently enumerate integer solutions (in polynomial time). We focus on simplified localization problems in which the measurements are range (distance) measurements and carrier phase range measurements, with no nuisance parameters. The simplified problem allows us to focus on the core question of untangling the nonlinearity and the integer nature of some parameters. We show using simulations that the new algorithms are effective at close ranges at which the linearize-first approach fails.</description>

      <title>The role of data partitioning on the performance of EEG-based deep learning models in supervised cross-subject analysis: a preliminary study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning is significantly advancing the analysis of electroencephalography (EEG) data by effectively discovering highly nonlinear patterns within the signals. Data partitioning and cross-validation are crucial for assessing model performance and ensuring study comparability, as they can produce varied results and data leakage due to specific signal properties (e.g., biometric). Such variability leads to incomparable studies and, increasingly, overestimated performance claims, which are detrimental to the field. Nevertheless, no comprehensive guidelines for proper data partitioning and cross-validation exist in the domain, nor is there a quantitative evaluation of their impact on model accuracy, reliability, and generalizability. To assist researchers in identifying optimal experimental strategies, this paper thoroughly investigates the role of data partitioning and cross-validation in evaluating EEG deep learning models. Five cross-validation settings are compared across three supervised cross-subject classification tasks (BCI, Parkinson's, and Alzheimer's disease detection) and four established architectures of increasing complexity (ShallowConvNet, EEGNet, DeepConvNet, and Temporal-based ResNet). The comparison of over 100,000 trained models underscores, first, the importance of using subject-based cross-validation strategies for evaluating EEG deep learning models, except when within-subject analyses are acceptable (e.g., BCI). Second, it highlights the greater reliability of nested approaches (N-LNSO) compared to non-nested counterparts, which are prone to data leakage and favor larger models overfitting to validation data. In conclusion, this work provides EEG deep learning researchers with an analysis of data partitioning and cross-validation and offers guidelines to avoid data leakage, currently undermining the domain with potentially overestimated performance claims.</description>

      <title>Simplicity is Key: An Unsupervised Pretraining Approach for Sparse Radio Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the Sparse pretrained Radio Transformer (SpaRTran), an unsupervised representation learning approach based on the concept of compressed sensing for radio channels. Our approach learns embeddings that focus on the physical properties of radio propagation, to create the optimal basis for fine-tuning on radio-based downstream tasks. SpaRTran uses a sparse gated autoencoder that induces a simplicity bias to the learned representations, resembling the sparse nature of radio propagation. For signal reconstruction, it learns a dictionary that holds atomic features, which increases flexibility across signal waveforms and spatiotemporal signal patterns. Our experiments show that SpaRTran reduces errors by up to 85 % compared to state-of-the-art methods when fine-tuned on radio fingerprinting, a challenging downstream task. In addition, our method requires less pretraining effort and offers greater flexibility, as we train it solely on individual radio signals. SpaRTran serves as an excellent base model that can be fine-tuned for various radio-based downstream tasks, effectively reducing the cost for labeling. In addition, it is significantly more versatile than existing methods and demonstrates superior generalization.</description>

      <title>Distributed Beamforming Using Decentralized Time Synchronization in a Six-Element Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate a distributed beamforming and beamsteering from a six-node distributed phased array using fully wireless coordination with decentralized time synchronization. In wireless applications such as distributed beamforming, high-accuracy time synchronization across the array is crucial for high coherent gain. The decentralized time synchronization method employed is based on the average consensus algorithm and the two-way time transfer method presented in our previous work, which achieved picosecond time synchronization with a cabled frequency reference. The system presented in this paper utilizes a centralized wireless frequency transfer method to achieve wireless frequency syntonization in a fully wireless coordination and a distributed computing system architecture. We experimentally evaluate system performance through beamforming and beamsteering to a receiver 16.3 m away from the six-node non-uniformly distributed antenna array, achieving an average coherent gain of 98% of the ideal gain at a carrier frequency of 1.05 GHz. The average time synchronization accuracy achieved was less than 36 ps.</description>

      <title>Beyond-Diagonal RIS Prototype and Performance Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first experimental prototype of a reflective beyond-diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surface (BD-RIS), i.e., a RIS with reconfigurable inter-element connections. Our BD-RIS consists of an antenna array whose ports are terminated by a tunable load network. The latter can terminate each antenna port with three distinct individual loads or connect it to an adjacent antenna port. Extensive performance evaluations in a rich-scattering environment validate that inter-element connections are beneficial. Moreover, we observe that our tunable load network's mentioned hardware constraints significantly influence, first, the achievable performance, second, the benefits of having inter-element connections, and, third, the importance of mutual-coupling awareness during optimization.</description>

      <title>Improving Open-Set Semantic Segmentation in 3D Point Clouds by Conditional Channel Capacity Maximization: Preliminary Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Point-cloud semantic segmentation underpins a wide range of critical applications. Although recent deep architectures and large-scale datasets have driven impressive closed-set performance, these models struggle to recognize or properly segment objects outside their training classes. This gap has sparked interest in Open-Set Semantic Segmentation (O3S), where models must both correctly label known categories and detect novel, unseen classes. In this paper, we propose a plug and play framework for O3S. By modeling the segmentation pipeline as a conditional Markov chain, we derive a novel regularizer term dubbed Conditional Channel Capacity Maximization (3CM), that maximizes the mutual information between features and predictions conditioned on each class. When incorporated into standard loss functions, 3CM encourages the encoder to retain richer, label-dependent features, thereby enhancing the network's ability to distinguish and segment previously unseen categories. Experimental results demonstrate effectiveness of proposed method on detecting unseen objects. We further outline future directions for dynamic open-world adaptation and efficient information-theoretic estimation.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Spatiotemporal Reasoning in LLMs and Reasoning Models: Capabilities and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatiotemporal reasoning plays a key role in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). Despite advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), their capacity to reason about complex spatiotemporal signals remains underexplored. This paper proposes a hierarchical SpatioTemporal reAsoning benchmaRK, STARK, to systematically evaluate LLMs across three levels of reasoning complexity: state estimation (e.g., predicting field variables, localizing and tracking events in space and time), spatiotemporal reasoning over states (e.g., inferring spatial-temporal relationships), and world-knowledge-aware reasoning that integrates contextual and domain knowledge (e.g., intent prediction, landmark-aware navigation). We curate 26 distinct spatiotemporal tasks with diverse sensor modalities, comprising 14,552 challenges where models answer directly or by Python Code Interpreter. Evaluating 3 LRMs and 8 LLMs, we find LLMs achieve limited success in tasks requiring geometric reasoning (e.g., multilateration or triangulation), particularly as complexity increases. Surprisingly, LRMs show robust performance across tasks with various levels of difficulty, often competing or surpassing traditional first-principle-based methods. Our results show that in reasoning tasks requiring world knowledge, the performance gap between LLMs and LRMs narrows, with some LLMs even surpassing LRMs. However, the LRM o3 model continues to achieve leading performance across all evaluated tasks, a result attributed primarily to the larger size of the reasoning models. STARK motivates future innovations in model architectures and reasoning paradigms for intelligent CPS by providing a structured framework to identify limitations in the spatiotemporal reasoning of LLMs and LRMs.</description>

      <title>Joint Graph Estimation and Signal Restoration for Robust Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a robust aggregation method for model parameters in federated learning (FL) under noisy communications. FL is a distributed machine learning paradigm in which a central server aggregates local model parameters from multiple clients. These parameters are often noisy and/or have missing values during data collection, training, and communication between the clients and server. This may cause a considerable drop in model accuracy. To address this issue, we learn a graph that represents pairwise relationships between model parameters of the clients during aggregation. We realize it with a joint problem of graph learning and signal (i.e., model parameters) restoration. The problem is formulated as a difference-of-convex (DC) optimization, which is efficiently solved via a proximal DC algorithm. Experimental results on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets show that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches by up to $2$--$5\%$ in classification accuracy under biased data distributions and noisy conditions.</description>

      <title>Study of Robust Resource Allocation in Cell-Free Multiple-Antenna Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cell-free networks outperform cellular networks in many aspects, yet their efficiency is affected by imperfect channel state information (CSI). In order to address this issue, this work presents a robust resource allocation framework designed for the downlink of user-centric cell-free massive multi-input multi-output (CF-mMIMO) networks. This framework employs a sequential resource allocation strategy with a robust user scheduling algorithm designed to maximize the sum-rate of the network and two robust power allocation algorithms aimed at minimizing the mean square error, which are developed to mitigate the effects of imperfect CSI. An analysis of the proposed robust resource allocation problems is developed along with a study of their computational cost. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed robust resource allocation algorithms, showing a performance improvement of up to 30\% compared to existing techniques.</description>

      <title>Communication-Efficient Hybrid Language Model via Uncertainty-Aware Opportunistic and Compressed Transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To support emerging language-based applications using dispersed and heterogeneous computing resources, the hybrid language model (HLM) offers a promising architecture, where an on-device small language model (SLM) generates draft tokens that are validated and corrected by a remote large language model (LLM). However, the original HLM suffers from substantial communication overhead, as the LLM requires the SLM to upload the full vocabulary distribution for each token. Moreover, both communication and computation resources are wasted when the LLM validates tokens that are highly likely to be accepted. To overcome these limitations, we propose communication-efficient and uncertainty-aware HLM (CU-HLM). In CU-HLM, the SLM transmits truncated vocabulary distributions only when its output uncertainty is high. We validate the feasibility of this opportunistic transmission by discovering a strong correlation between SLM's uncertainty and LLM's rejection probability. Furthermore, we theoretically derive optimal uncertainty thresholds and optimal vocabulary truncation strategies. Simulation results show that, compared to standard HLM, CU-HLM achieves up to 206$\times$ higher token throughput by skipping 74.8% transmissions with 97.4% vocabulary compression, while maintaining 97.4% accuracy.</description>

      <title>LLM-guided DRL for Multi-tier LEO Satellite Networks with Hybrid FSO/RF Links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite significant advancements in terrestrial networks, inherent limitations persist in providing reliable coverage to remote areas and maintaining resilience during natural disasters. Multi-tier networks with low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites and high-altitude platforms (HAPs) offer promising solutions, but face challenges from high mobility and dynamic channel conditions that cause unstable connections and frequent handovers. In this paper, we design a three-tier network architecture that integrates LEO satellites, HAPs, and ground terminals with hybrid free-space optical (FSO) and radio frequency (RF) links to maximize coverage while maintaining connectivity reliability. This hybrid approach leverages the high bandwidth of FSO for satellite-to-HAP links and the weather resilience of RF for HAP-to-ground links. We formulate a joint optimization problem to simultaneously balance downlink transmission rate and handover frequency by optimizing network configuration and satellite handover decisions. The problem is highly dynamic and non-convex with time-coupled constraints. To address these challenges, we propose a novel large language model (LLM)-guided truncated quantile critics algorithm with dynamic action masking (LTQC-DAM) that utilizes dynamic action masking to eliminate unnecessary exploration and employs LLMs to adaptively tune hyperparameters. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed LTQC-DAM algorithm outperforms baseline algorithms in terms of convergence, downlink transmission rate, and handover frequency. We also reveal that compared to other state-of-the-art LLMs, DeepSeek delivers the best performance through gradual, contextually-aware parameter adjustments.</description>

      <title>Multi-Attribute Graph Estimation with Sparse-Group Non-Convex Penalties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of inferring the conditional independence graph (CIG) of high-dimensional Gaussian vectors from multi-attribute data. Most existing methods for graph estimation are based on single-attribute models where one associates a scalar random variable with each node. In multi-attribute graphical models, each node represents a random vector. In this paper we provide a unified theoretical analysis of multi-attribute graph learning using a penalized log-likelihood objective function. We consider both convex (sparse-group lasso) and sparse-group non-convex (log-sum and smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD) penalties) penalty/regularization functions. An alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) approach coupled with local linear approximation to non-convex penalties is presented for optimization of the objective function. For non-convex penalties, theoretical analysis establishing local consistency in support recovery, local convexity and precision matrix estimation in high-dimensional settings is provided under two sets of sufficient conditions: with and without some irrepresentability conditions. We illustrate our approaches using both synthetic and real-data numerical examples. In the synthetic data examples the sparse-group log-sum penalized objective function significantly outperformed the lasso penalized as well as SCAD penalized objective functions with $F_1$-score and Hamming distance as performance metrics.</description>

      <title>T-Rex: Fitting a Robust Factor Model via Expectation-Maximization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the past decades, there has been a surge of interest in studying low-dimensional structures within high-dimensional data. Statistical factor models $-$ i.e., low-rank plus diagonal covariance structures $-$ offer a powerful framework for modeling such structures. However, traditional methods for fitting statistical factor models, such as principal component analysis (PCA) or maximum likelihood estimation assuming the data is Gaussian, are highly sensitive to heavy tails and outliers in the observed data. In this paper, we propose a novel expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm for robustly fitting statistical factor models. Our approach is based on Tyler's M-estimator of the scatter matrix for an elliptical distribution, and consists of solving Tyler's maximum likelihood estimation problem while imposing a structural constraint that enforces the low-rank plus diagonal covariance structure. We present numerical experiments on both synthetic and real examples, demonstrating the robustness of our method for direction-of-arrival estimation in nonuniform noise and subspace recovery.</description>

      <title>WaLRUS: Wavelets for Long-range Representation Using SSMs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: State-Space Models (SSMs) have proven to be powerful tools for modeling long-range dependencies in sequential data. While the recent method known as HiPPO has demonstrated strong performance, and formed the basis for machine learning models S4 and Mamba, it remains limited by its reliance on closed-form solutions for a few specific, well-behaved bases. The SaFARi framework generalized this approach, enabling the construction of SSMs from arbitrary frames, including non-orthogonal and redundant ones, thus allowing an infinite diversity of possible "species" within the SSM family. In this paper, we introduce WaLRUS (Wavelets for Long-range Representation Using SSMs), a new implementation of SaFARi built from Daubechies wavelets.</description>

      <title>An Information-Theoretic Framework for Receiver Quantization in Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate information-theoretic limits and design of communication under receiver quantization. Unlike most existing studies, this work is more focused on the impact of resolution reduction from high to low. We consider a standard transceiver architecture, which includes i.i.d. complex Gaussian codebook at the transmitter, and a symmetric quantizer cascaded with a nearest neighbor decoder at the receiver. Employing the generalized mutual information (GMI), an achievable rate under general quantization rules is obtained in an analytical form, which shows that the rate loss due to quantization is $\log\left(1+\gamma\mathsf{SNR}\right)$, where $\gamma$ is determined by thresholds and levels of the quantizer. Based on this result, the performance under uniform receiver quantization is analyzed comprehensively. We show that the front-end gain control, which determines the loading factor of quantization, has an increasing impact on performance as the resolution decreases. In particular, we prove that the unique loading factor that minimizes the MSE also maximizes the GMI, and the corresponding irreducible rate loss is given by $\log\left(1+\mathsf {mmse}\cdot\mathsf{SNR}\right)$, where mmse is the minimum MSE normalized by the variance of quantizer input, and is equal to the minimum of $\gamma$. A geometrical interpretation for the optimal uniform quantization at the receiver is further established. Moreover, by asymptotic analysis, we characterize the impact of biased gain control, including how small rate losses decay to zero and achievable rate approximations under large bias. From asymptotic expressions of the optimal loading factor and mmse, approximations and several per-bit rules for performance are also provided. Finally we discuss more types of receiver quantization and show that the consistency between achievable rate maximization and MSE minimization does not hold in general.</description>

      <title>Generative Diffusion Model Driven Massive Random Access in Massive MIMO Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Massive random access is an important technology for achieving ultra-massive connectivity in next-generation wireless communication systems. It aims to address key challenges during the initial access phase, including active user detection (AUD), channel estimation (CE), and data detection (DD). This paper examines massive access in massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, where deep learning is used to tackle the challenging AUD, CE, and DD functions. First, we introduce a Transformer-AUD scheme tailored for variable pilot-length access. This approach integrates pilot length information and a spatial correlation module into a Transformer-based detector, enabling a single model to generalize across various pilot lengths and antenna numbers. Next, we propose a generative diffusion model (GDM)-driven iterative CE and DD framework. The GDM employs a score function to capture the posterior distributions of massive MIMO channels and data symbols. Part of the score function is learned from the channel dataset via neural networks, while the remaining score component is derived in a closed form by applying the symbol prior constellation distribution and known transmission model. Utilizing these posterior scores, we design an asynchronous alternating CE and DD framework that employs a predictor-corrector sampling technique to iteratively generate channel estimation and data detection results during the reverse diffusion process. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed approaches significantly outperform baseline methods with respect to AUD, CE, and DD.</description>

      <title>Time-Continuous Frequency Allocation for Feeder Links of Mega Constellations with Multi-Antenna Gateway Stations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the recent rapid advancement of mega low earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellations, multi-antenna gateway station (MAGS) has emerged as a key enabler to support extremely high system capacity via massive feeder links. However, the densification of both space and ground segment leads to reduced spatial separation between links, posing unprecedented challenges of interference exacerbation. This paper investigates graph coloring-based frequency allocation methods for interference mitigation (IM) of mega LEO systems. We first reveal the characteristics of MAGS interference pattern and formulate the IM problem into a $K$-coloring problem using an adaptive threshold method. Then we propose two tailored graph coloring algorithms, namely Generalized Global (GG) and Clique-Based Tabu Search (CTS), to solve this problem. GG employs a low-complexity greedy conflict avoidance strategy, while CTS leverages the unique clique structure brought by MAGSs to enhance IM performance. Subsequently, we innovatively modify them to achieve time-continuous frequency allocation, which is crucial to ensure the stability of feeder links. Moreover, we further devise two mega constellation decomposition methods to alleviate the complexity burden of satellite operators. Finally, we propose a list coloring-based vacant subchannel utilization method to further improve spectrum efficiency and system capacity. Simulation results on Starlink constellation of the first and second generations with 34396 satellites demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed methodology.</description>

      <title>Exploring Sparsity for Parameter Efficient Fine Tuning Using Wavelets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12532v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficiently adapting large foundation models is critical, especially with tight compute and memory budgets. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods such as LoRA offer limited granularity and effectiveness in few-parameter regimes. We propose Wavelet Fine-Tuning (WaveFT), a novel PEFT method that learns highly sparse updates in the wavelet domain of residual matrices. WaveFT allows precise control of trainable parameters, offering fine-grained capacity adjustment and excelling with remarkably low parameter count, potentially far fewer than LoRA's minimum -- ideal for extreme parameter-efficient scenarios. In order to demonstrate the effect of the wavelet transform, we compare WaveFT with a special case, called SHiRA, that entails applying sparse updates directly in the weight domain. Evaluated on personalized text-to-image generation using Stable Diffusion XL as baseline, WaveFT significantly outperforms LoRA and other PEFT methods, especially at low parameter counts; achieving superior subject fidelity, prompt alignment, and image diversity.</description>

      <title>Acoustic Field Reconstruction in Tubes via Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the application of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to inverse problems in acoustic tube analysis, focusing on reconstructing acoustic fields from noisy and limited observation data. Specifically, we address scenarios where the radiation model is unknown, and pressure data is only available at the tube's radiation end. A PINNs framework is proposed to reconstruct the acoustic field, along with the PINN Fine-Tuning Method (PINN-FTM) and a traditional optimization method (TOM) for predicting radiation model coefficients. The results demonstrate that PINNs can effectively reconstruct the tube's acoustic field under noisy conditions, even with unknown radiation parameters. PINN-FTM outperforms TOM by delivering balanced and reliable predictions and exhibiting robust noise-tolerance capabilities.</description>

      <title>Event-based Star Tracking under Spacecraft Jitter: the e-STURT Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12588v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Jitter degrades a spacecraft's fine-pointing ability required for optical communication, earth observation, and space domain awareness. Development of jitter estimation and compensation algorithms requires high-fidelity sensor observations representative of on-board jitter. In this work, we present the Event-based Star Tracking Under Jitter (e-STURT) dataset -- the first event camera based dataset of star observations under controlled jitter conditions. Specialized hardware employed for the dataset emulates an event-camera undergoing on-board jitter. While the event camera provides asynchronous, high temporal resolution star observations, systematic and repeatable jitter is introduced using a micrometer accurate piezoelectric actuator. Various jitter sources are simulated using distinct frequency bands and utilizing both axes of motion. Ground-truth jitter is captured in hardware from the piezoelectric actuator. The resulting dataset consists of 200 sequences and is made publicly available. This work highlights the dataset generation process, technical challenges and the resulting limitations. To serve as a baseline, we propose a high-frequency jitter estimation algorithm that operates directly on the event stream. The e-STURT dataset will enable the development of jitter aware algorithms for mission critical event-based space sensing applications.</description>

      <title>MSCEKF-MIO: Magnetic-Inertial Odometry Based on Multi-State Constraint Extended Kalman Filter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12634v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To overcome the limitation of existing indoor odometry technologies which often cannot simultaneously meet requirements for accuracy cost-effectiveness, and robustness-this paper proposes a novel magnetometer array-aided inertial odometry approach, MSCEKF-MIO (Multi-State Constraint Extended Kalman Filter-based Magnetic-Inertial Odometry). We construct a magnetic field model by fitting measurements from the magnetometer array and then use temporal variations in this model-extracted from continuous observations-to estimate the carrier's absolute velocity. Furthermore, we implement the MSCEKF framework to fuse observed magnetic field variations with position and attitude estimates from inertial navigation system (INS) integration, thereby enabling autonomous, high-precision indoor relative positioning. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves superior velocity estimation accuracy and horizontal positioning precision relative to state-of-the-art magnetic array-aided INS algorithms (MAINS). On datasets with trajectory lengths of 150-250m, the proposed method yields an average horizontal position RMSE of approximately 2.5m. In areas with distinctive magnetic features, the magneto-inertial odometry achieves a velocity estimation accuracy of 0.07m/s. Consequently, the proposed method offers a novel positioning solution characterized by low power consumption, cost-effectiveness, and high reliability in complex indoor environments.</description>

      <title>Identifiability of Nonnegative Tucker Decompositions -- Part I: Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tensor decompositions have become a central tool in data science, with applications in areas such as data analysis, signal processing, and machine learning. A key property of many tensor decompositions, such as the canonical polyadic decomposition, is identifiability: the factors are unique, up to trivial scaling and permutation ambiguities. This allows one to recover the groundtruth sources that generated the data. The Tucker decomposition (TD) is a central and widely used tensor decomposition model. However, it is in general not identifiable. In this paper, we study the identifiability of the nonnegative TD (nTD). By adapting and extending identifiability results of nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF), we provide uniqueness results for nTD. Our results require the nonnegative matrix factors to have some degree of sparsity (namely, satisfy the separability condition, or the sufficiently scattered condition), while the core tensor only needs to have some slices (or linear combinations of them) or unfoldings with full column rank (but does not need to be nonnegative). Under such conditions, we derive several procedures, using either unfoldings or slices of the input tensor, to obtain identifiable nTDs by minimizing the volume of unfoldings or slices of the core tensor.</description>

      <title>Secrecy Capacity of Hybrid VLC-RF Systems with Light Energy Harvesting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the performance of physical layer security (PLS) in a multi-user hybrid heterogeneous visible light communication (VLC) and radio frequency (RF) wireless communication system with simultaneous lightwave information and power transfer (SLIPT). In the considered system, VLC is used for downlink (DL) while RF is employed for uplink (UL) transmission. In addition, to support multiple users, time division multiple access (TDMA) is assumed for both DL and UL channels. In the DL, each user receives information during its allocated time slot of the TDMA frame and harvests energy from the received signal outside the time slot. The harvested energy is then used for transmitting the signal over the UL channel, which is subject to eavesdropping by an unauthorized user. Therefore, PLS is employed to protect the confidentiality of the UL information. Then, an optimization problem is formulated to solve the optimal DL and UL time slots that maximize the PLS performance given a target sum rate of the DL. We show that the problem can be cast as a difference of convex functions (DC) program, which can be solved efficiently using the DC algorithm (DCA).</description>

      <title>Optimal Scalogram for Computational Complexity Reduction in Acoustic Recognition Using Deep Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) is an effective tool for feature extraction in acoustic recognition using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), particularly when applied to non-stationary audio. However, its high computational cost poses a significant challenge, often leading researchers to prefer alternative methods such as the Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT). To address this issue, this paper proposes a method to reduce the computational complexity of CWT by optimizing the length of the wavelet kernel and the hop size of the output scalogram. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly reduces computational cost while maintaining the robust performance of the trained model in acoustic recognition tasks.</description>

      <title>Lightweight Transformer via Unrolling of Mixed Graph Algorithms for Traffic Forecast</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To forecast traffic with both spatial and temporal dimensions, we unroll a mixed-graph-based optimization algorithm into a lightweight and interpretable transformer-like neural net. Specifically, we construct two graphs: an undirected graph $\mathcal{G}^u$ capturing spatial correlations across geography, and a directed graph $\mathcal{G}^d$ capturing sequential relationships over time. We formulate a prediction problem for the future samples of signal $\mathbf{x}$, assuming it is "smooth" with respect to both $\mathcal{G}^u$ and $\mathcal{G}^d$, where we design new $\ell_2$ and $\ell_1$-norm variational terms to quantify and promote signal smoothness (low-frequency reconstruction) on a directed graph. We construct an iterative algorithm based on alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), and unroll it into a feed-forward network for data-driven parameter learning. We insert graph learning modules for $\mathcal{G}^u$ and $\mathcal{G}^d$, which are akin to the self-attention mechanism in classical transformers. Experiments show that our unrolled networks achieve competitive traffic forecast performance as state-of-the-art prediction schemes, while reducing parameter counts drastically. Our code is available in https://github.com/SingularityUndefined/Unrolling-GSP-STForecast.</description>

      <title>Frequency-Dependent Power Consumption Modeling of CMOS Transmitters for WNoC Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wireless Network-on-Chip (WNoC) systems, which wirelessly interconnect the chips of a computing system, have been proposed as a complement to existing chip-to-chip wired links. However, their feasibility depends on the availability of custom-designed high-speed, tiny, ultra-efficient transceivers. This represents a challenge due to the tradeoffs between bandwidth, area, and energy efficiency that are found as frequency increases, which suggests that there is an optimal frequency region. To aid in the search for such an optimal design point, this paper presents a behavioral model that quantifies the expected power consumption of oscillators, mixers, and power amplifiers as a function of frequency. The model is built on extensive surveys of the respective sub-blocks, all based on experimental data. By putting together the models of the three sub-blocks, a comprehensive power model is obtained, which will aid in selecting the optimal operating frequency for WNoC systems.</description>

Abstract: The paper provides a characterization of the complex monopulse ratio in terms of autocorrelation and power spectral density of its fluctuations during satellite tracking, taking into account the presence of additive noise on sum and difference channels. The considered spectral structure and statistical distribution of the incoming signal is of interest for satellite missions. In particular it is assumed that the signal available at the monopulse processor after frequency down conversion contains a Gaussian term produced by low pass filtering of a constant envelope modulation, plus a monochromatic component representative of a possible residual carrier. The results can be used for optimizing the design of a monopulse tracking system.</description>

      <title>You Can Wash Hands Better: Accurate Daily Handwashing Assessment with a Smartwatch</title>

      <description>arXiv:2112.06657v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hand hygiene is among the most effective daily practices for preventing infectious diseases such as influenza, malaria, and skin infections. While professional guidelines emphasize proper handwashing to reduce the risk of viral infections, surveys reveal that adherence to these recommendations remains low. To address this gap, we propose UWash, a wearable solution leveraging smartwatches to evaluate handwashing procedures, aiming to raise awareness and cultivate high-quality handwashing habits. We frame the task of handwashing assessment as an action segmentation problem, similar to those in computer vision, and introduce a simple yet efficient two-stream UNet-like network to achieve this goal. Experiments involving 51 subjects demonstrate that UWash achieves 92.27% accuracy in handwashing gesture recognition, an error of &lt;0.5 seconds in onset/offset detection, and an error of &lt;5 points in gesture scoring under user-dependent settings. The system also performs robustly in user-independent and user-independent-location-independent evaluations. Remarkably, UWash maintains high performance in real-world tests, including evaluations with 10 random passersby at a hospital 9 months later and 10 passersby in an in-the-wild test conducted 2 years later. UWash is the first system to score handwashing quality based on gesture sequences, offering actionable guidance for improving daily hand hygiene. The code and dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/aiotgroup/UWash</description>

      <title>Timely Requesting for Time-Critical Content Users in Decentralized F-RANs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02930v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the rising demand for high-rate and timely communications, fog radio access networks (F-RANs) offer a promising solution. This work investigates age of information (AoI) performance in F-RANs, consisting of multiple content users (CUs), enhanced remote radio heads (eRRHs), and content providers (CPs). Time-critical CUs need rapid content updates from CPs but cannot communicate directly with them; instead, eRRHs act as intermediaries. CUs decide whether to request content from a CP and which eRRH to send the request to, while eRRHs decide whether to command CPs to update content or use cached content. We study two general classes of policies: (i) oblivious policies, where decision-making is independent of historical information, and (ii) non-oblivious policies, where decisions are influenced by historical information. First, we obtain closed-form expressions for the average AoI of eRRHs under both policy types. Due to the complexity of calculating closed-form expressions for CUs, we then derive general upper bounds for their average AoI. Next, we identify optimal policies for both types. Under both optimal policies, each CU requests content from each CP at an equal rate, consolidating all requests to a single eRRH when demand is low or resources are limited, and distributing requests evenly among eRRHs when demand is high and resources are ample. eRRHs command content from each CP at an equal rate under an optimal oblivious policy, while prioritize the CP with the highest age under an optimal non-oblivious policy. Our numerical results validate these theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Toward Mixed Analog-Digital Quantum Signal Processing: Quantum AD/DA Conversion and the Fourier Transform</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14729v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Signal processing stands as a pillar of classical computation and modern information technology, applicable to both analog and digital signals. Recently, advancements in quantum information science have suggested that quantum signal processing (QSP) can enable more powerful signal processing capabilities. However, the developments in QSP have primarily leveraged \emph{digital} quantum resources, such as discrete-variable (DV) systems like qubits, rather than \emph{analog} quantum resources, such as continuous-variable (CV) systems like quantum oscillators. Consequently, there remains a gap in understanding how signal processing can be performed on hybrid CV-DV quantum computers. Here we address this gap by developing a new paradigm of mixed analog-digital QSP. We demonstrate the utility of this paradigm by showcasing how it naturally enables analog-digital conversion of quantum signals -- specifically, the transfer of states between DV and CV quantum systems. We then show that such quantum analog-digital conversion enables new implementations of quantum algorithms on CV-DV hardware. This is exemplified by realizing the quantum Fourier transform of a state encoded on qubits via the free-evolution of a quantum oscillator, albeit with a runtime exponential in the number of qubits due to information theoretic arguments. Collectively, this work marks a significant step forward in hybrid CV-DV quantum computation, providing a foundation for scalable analog-digital signal processing on quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Performance Benchmarking of Psychomotor Skills Using Wearable Devices: An Application in Sport</title>

Abstract: Mastering psychomotor skills, such as those essential in sports, rehabilitation, and professional training, often requires a precise understanding of motion patterns and performance metrics. This study proposes a versatile framework for optimizing psychomotor learning through human motion analysis. Utilizing a wearable IMU sensor system, the motion trajectories of a given psychomotor task are acquired and then linked to points in a performance space using a predefined set of quality metrics specific to the psychomotor skill. This enables the identification of a benchmark cluster in the performance space, which represents a group of reference points that define optimal performance across multiple criteria, allowing correspondences to be established between the performance clusters and sets of trajectories in the motion space. As a result, common or specific deviations in the performance space can be identified, enabling remedial actions in the motion space to optimize performance. A thorough validation of the proposed framework is done in this paper using a Table Tennis forehand stroke as a case study. The resulting quantitative and visual representation of performance empowers individuals to optimize their skills and achieve peak performance.</description>

      <title>Near-Field ISAC: Synergy of Dual-Purpose Codebooks and Space-Time Adaptive Processing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08776v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has emerged as a transformative paradigm, enabling situationally aware and perceptive next-generation wireless networks through the co-design of shared network resources. With the adoption of millimeter-wave (mmWave) and terahertz (THz) frequency bands, ultra-massive MIMO (UM-MIMO) systems and holographic surfaces unlock the potential of near-field (NF) propagation, characterized by spherical wavefronts that facilitate beam manipulation in both angular and range domains. This paper presents a unified approach to near-field beam-training and sensing, introducing a dual-purpose codebook design that employs discrete Fourier transform (DFT)-based codebooks for coarse estimation of sensing parameters and polar codebooks for parameter refinement. Leveraging these range and angle estimates, a customized low-complexity space-time adaptive processing (STAP) technique is proposed for NF-ISAC to detect slow-moving targets and efficiently mitigate clutter. The interplay between codebooks and NF-STAP framework offers three key advantages: reduced communication beam training overhead, improved estimation accuracy, and minimal STAP computational complexity. Simulation results show that the proposed framework can reduce STAP complexity by three orders of magnitude, validating efficacy, and highlighting the potential of the proposed approach to seamlessly integrate NF communication and sensing functionalities in future wireless networks.</description>

      <title>STAR-RIS-Enabled Multi-Path Beam Routing with Passive Beam Splitting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14234v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) can be densely deployed in the environment to create multi-reflection line-of-sight (LoS) links for signal coverage enhancement. However, conventional reflection-only RISs can only achieve half-space reflection, which limits the LoS path diversity. In contrast, simultaneously transmitting and reflecting RISs (STAR-RISs) can achieve full-space reflection and transmission, thereby creating more LoS paths. Hence, in this paper, we study a new multi-STAR-RIS-aided communication system, where a multi-antenna base station (BS) transmits to multiple single-antenna users by exploiting the signal beam routing over a set of cascaded LoS paths each formed by multiple STAR-RISs. To reveal essential insights, we first consider a simplified single-user case, aiming to maximize its received signal power by jointly optimizing the active beamforming at the BS, the BS's power allocation over different paths, the number of selected beam-routing paths, the selected STAR-RISs for each path, as well as their amplitude and phase shifts for transmission/reflection. However, this problem is difficult to be optimally solved as different paths may be intricately coupled at their shared STAR-RISs. To tackle this difficulty, we first derive the optimal solution to this problem in closed-form for a given set of paths. The clique-based approach in graph theory is then applied to solve the remaining multi-path selection problem efficiently. Next, we extend the proposed clique-based method to the multi-user case to maximize the minimum received signal power among all users, subject to additional constraints on the disjointness of the selected paths for different users. Simulation results show that our proposed STAR-RIS-enabled beam routing outperforms the conventional beam routing with reflection-only RISs in both single- and multi-user cases.</description>

      <title>Vehicle occupancy estimation in Automated Guideway Transit via deep learning with Wi-Fi probe requests</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16644v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study contributes to the advancement of vehicle occupancy estimation in Automated Guideway Transit (AGT) systems using Wi-Fi probe requests and deep learning models. We propose a comprehensive framework for evaluating various approaches to occupancy estimation, particularly in the context of MAC address randomization. While many methods proposed in the literature claim effectiveness in simpler experimental settings, our research reveals that those methods are unreliable in the complex environment of AGT systems. Specifically, techniques for handling randomized MAC addresses and distinguishing between passenger and non-passenger data do not perform well in AGT systems. Despite challenges in tracking individual devices, our study demonstrates that accurate occupancy estimation using Wi-Fi probe requests remains feasible. A pilot study conducted on the Miami-Dade Metromover, an AGT system characterized by frequent stops, significant occupancy fluctuations, and absence of fare collection devices, provides a robust testing ground for the framework. Additionally, our findings show that deep learning models significantly outperform machine learning models in this context. The insights from this study can significantly enhance decision-making for transit agencies to optimize operations and elevate service quality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03736v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Learning the spatial topology of electroencephalogram (EEG) channels and their temporal dynamics is crucial for decoding attention states. This paper introduces EEG-PatchFormer, a transformer-based deep learning framework designed specifically for EEG attention classification in Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) applications. By integrating a Temporal CNN for frequency-based EEG feature extraction, a pointwise CNN for feature enhancement, and Spatial and Temporal Patching modules for organizing features into spatial-temporal patches, EEG-PatchFormer jointly learns spatial-temporal information from EEG data. Leveraging the global learning capabilities of the self-attention mechanism, it captures essential features across brain regions over time, thereby enhancing EEG data decoding performance. Demonstrating superior performance, EEG-PatchFormer surpasses existing benchmarks in accuracy, area under the ROC curve (AUC), and macro-F1 score on a public cognitive attention dataset.

      <description>arXiv:2503.23883v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sensing-assisted communication schemes have recently garnered significant research attention. In this work, we design a dual-function reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), integrating both active and passive elements, referred to as the reconfigurable intelligent sensing surface (RISS), to enhance communication. By leveraging sensing results from the active elements, we propose communication enhancement and robust interference suppression schemes for both near-field and far-field models, implemented through the passive elements. These schemes remove the need for base station (BS) feedback for RISS control, simplifying the communication process by replacing traditional channel state information (CSI) feedback with real-time sensing from the active elements. The proposed schemes are theoretically analyzed and then validated using software-defined radio (SDR). Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the sensing algorithms in real-world scenarios, such as direction of arrival (DOA) estimation and radio frequency (RF) identification recognition. Moreover, the RISS-assisted communication system shows strong performance in communication enhancement and interference suppression, particularly in near-field models.</description>

Abstract: This thesis delves into the forefront of wireless communication by exploring the synergistic integration of three transformative technologies: STAR-RIS, CoMP, and NOMA. Driven by the ever-increasing demand for higher data rates, improved spectral efficiency, and expanded coverage in the evolving landscape of 6G development, this research investigates the potential of these technologies to revolutionize future wireless networks.
  The thesis analyzes the performance gains achievable through strategic deployment of STAR-RIS, focusing on mitigating inter-cell interference, enhancing signal strength, and extending coverage to cell-edge users. Resource sharing strategies for STAR-RIS elements are explored, optimizing both transmission and reflection functionalities. Analytical frameworks are developed to quantify the benefits of STAR-RIS assisted CoMP-NOMA networks under realistic channel conditions, deriving key performance metrics such as ergodic rates and outage probabilities. Additionally, the research delves into energy-efficient design approaches for CoMP-NOMA networks incorporating RIS, proposing novel RIS configurations and optimization algorithms to achieve a balance between performance and energy consumption. Furthermore, the application of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) techniques for intelligent and adaptive optimization in aerial RIS-assisted CoMP-NOMA networks is explored, aiming to maximize network sum rate while meeting user quality of service requirements. Through a comprehensive investigation of these technologies and their synergistic potential, this thesis contributes valuable insights into the future of wireless communication, paving the way for the development of more efficient, reliable, and sustainable networks capable of meeting the demands of our increasingly connected world.</description>

      <title>Deep Reinforcement Learning for Wireless Scheduling in Distributed Networked Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2109.12562v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a joint uplink and downlink scheduling problem of a fully distributed wireless networked control system (WNCS) with a limited number of frequency channels. Using elements of stochastic systems theory, we derive a sufficient stability condition of the WNCS, which is stated in terms of both the control and communication system parameters. Once the condition is satisfied, there exists a stationary and deterministic scheduling policy that can stabilize all plants of the WNCS. By analyzing and representing the per-step cost function of the WNCS in terms of a finite-length countable vector state, we formulate the optimal transmission scheduling problem into a Markov decision process and develop a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based framework for solving it. To tackle the challenges of a large action space in DRL, we propose novel action space reduction and action embedding methods for the DRL framework that can be applied to various algorithms, including Deep Q-Network (DQN), Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG), and Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3). Numerical results show that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms benchmark policies.</description>

      <title>Learning The Likelihood Test With One-Class Classifiers for Physical Layer Authentication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.12494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.12494v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In physical layer authentication (PLA) mechanisms, a verifier decides whether a received message has been transmitted by a legitimate user or an intruder, according to some features of the physical channel over which the message traveled. To design the authentication check implemented at the verifier, typically either the statistics or a dataset of features are available for the channel from the legitimate user, while no information is available when under attack. When the statistics are known, a well-known good solution is the likelihood test (LT). When a dataset is available, the decision problem is one-class classification (OCC) and a good understanding of the machine learning (ML) techniques used for its solution is important to ensure security. Thus, in this paper, we aim at obtaining ML PLA verifiers that operate as the LT. We show how to do it with the neural network (NN) and the one-class least-squares support vector machine (OCLSSVM) models, trained as two-class classifiers on the single-class dataset and an artificial dataset. The artificial dataset for the negative class is obtained by generating channel feature (CF) vectors uniformly distributed over the domain of the legitimate class dataset. We also derive a modified stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm that trains a PLA verifier operating as LT without the need for the artificial dataset. Furthermore, we show that the one-class least-squares support vector machine with suitable kernels operates as the LT at convergence. Lastly, we show that the widely used autoencoder classifier generally does not provide the LT. Numerical results are provided considering PLA on both wireless and underwater acoustic channels.</description>

      <title>Sensing-Enhanced Channel Estimation for Near-Field XL-MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11809v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Future sixth-generation (6G) systems are expected to leverage extremely large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) technology, which significantly expands the range of the near-field region. The spherical wavefront characteristics in the near field introduce additional degrees of freedom (DoFs), namely distance and angle, into the channel model, which leads to unique challenges in channel estimation (CE). In this paper, we propose a new sensing-enhanced uplink CE scheme for near-field XL-MIMO, which notably reduces the required quantity of baseband samples and the dictionary size. In particular, we first propose a sensing method that can be accomplished in a single time slot. It employs power sensors embedded within the antenna elements to measure the received power pattern rather than baseband samples. A time inversion algorithm is then proposed to precisely estimate the locations of users and scatterers, which offers a substantially lower computational complexity. Based on the estimated locations from sensing, a novel dictionary is then proposed by considering the eigen-problem based on the near-field transmission model, which facilitates efficient near-field CE with less baseband sampling and a more lightweight dictionary. Moreover, we derive the general form of the eigenvectors associated with the near-field channel matrix, revealing their noteworthy connection to the discrete prolate spheroidal sequence (DPSS). Simulation results unveil that the proposed time inversion algorithm achieves accurate localization with power measurements only, and remarkably outperforms various widely-adopted algorithms in terms of computational complexity. Furthermore, the proposed eigen-dictionary considerably improves the accuracy in CE with a compact dictionary size and a drastic reduction in baseband samples by up to 66%.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00861v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ensuring sufficiently accurate models is crucial in target tracking systems. If the assumed models deviate too much from the truth, the tracking performance might be severely degraded. While the models are usually defined using multivariate conditions, the measures used to validate them are most often scalar-valued. In this paper, we propose matrix-valued measures for both offline and online assessment of target tracking systems. Recent results from Wishart statistics, and approximations thereof, are adapted and it is shown how these can be incorporated to infer statistical properties for the eigenvalues of the proposed measures. In addition, we relate these results to the statistics of the baseline measures. Finally, the applicability of the proposed measures are demonstrated using two important problems in target tracking: (i) distributed track fusion design; and (ii) filter model mismatch detection.</description>

      <title>Sensing Safety Analysis for Vehicular Networks with Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01688v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) emerged as a key feature of next-generation 6G wireless systems, allowing them to achieve high data rates and sensing accuracy. While prior research has primarily focused on addressing communication safety in ISAC systems, the equally critical issue of sensing safety remains largely ignored. In this paper, a novel threat to the sensing safety of ISAC vehicle networks is studied, whereby a malicious reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is deployed to compromise the sensing functionality of a roadside unit (RSU). Specifically, a malicious attacker dynamically adjusts the phase shifts of an RIS to spoof the sensing outcomes of a vehicular user (VU)'s echo delay, Doppler shift, and angle-of-departure (AoD). To achieve spoofing on Doppler shift estimation, a time-varying phase shift design on the RIS is proposed. Furthermore, the feasible spoofing frequency set with respect to the Doppler shift is analytical derived. Analytical results also demonstrate that the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) of the AoD can be significantly misled under spoofed Doppler shift estimation. Simulation results validate our theoretical findings, showing that the RIS can induce a spoofed velocity estimation from 0.1 m/s to 14.9 m/s for a VU with velocity of 10 m/s, and can cause an AoD estimation error of up to 65^{\circ} with only a 5^{\circ} beam misalignment.</description>

      <title>ArrayDPS: Unsupervised Blind Speech Separation with a Diffusion Prior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05657v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Blind Speech Separation (BSS) aims to separate multiple speech sources from audio mixtures recorded by a microphone array. The problem is challenging because it is a blind inverse problem, i.e., the microphone array geometry, the room impulse response (RIR), and the speech sources, are all unknown. We propose ArrayDPS to solve the BSS problem in an unsupervised, array-agnostic, and generative manner. The core idea builds on diffusion posterior sampling (DPS), but unlike DPS where the likelihood is tractable, ArrayDPS must approximate the likelihood by formulating a separate optimization problem. The solution to the optimization approximates room acoustics and the relative transfer functions between microphones. These approximations, along with the diffusion priors, iterate through the ArrayDPS sampling process and ultimately yield separated voice sources. We only need a simple single-speaker speech diffusion model as a prior along with the mixtures recorded at the microphones; no microphone array information is necessary. Evaluation results show that ArrayDPS outperforms all baseline unsupervised methods while being comparable to supervised methods in terms of SDR.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a dual-unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled secure communication and sensing (SCS) scheme for an air-to-ground integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system, in which a dual-functional source UAV and jamming UAV collaborate to enhance both the secure communication and target sensing performance. From a perspective of hybrid monostatitc-bistatic radar, the jamming UAV maneuvers to aid the source UAV to detect multiple ground targets by emitting artificial noise, meanwhile interfering with the ground eavesdropper. Residual interference is considered to reflect the effects of imperfect successive interference cancellation (SIC) on the receive signal-plus-interference-to-noise ratios, which results in a degraded system performance. To maximize the average secrecy rate (ASR), the dual-UAV trajectory and dual-UAV beamforming are jointly optimized subject to the transmit power budget, UAV maneuvering constraint, and sensing requirements. To tackle the highly complicated non-convex ASR maximization problem, the dual-UAV trajectory and dual-UAV beamforming are optimized for the secure communication (SC) purpose and the SCS purpose, sequentially. In the SC phase, a block coordinate descent algorithm is proposed to optimize the dual-UAV trajectory and dual-UAV beamforming iteratively, using the trust-region successive convex approximation (SCA) and semidefinite relaxation (SDR) techniques. Then, a weighted distance minimization problem is formulated to determine the dual-UAV maneuvering positions suitable for the SCS purpose, which is solved by a heuristic greedy algorithm, followed by the joint optimization of source beamforming and jamming beamforming.</description>

      <title>Topology-driven identification of repetitions in multi-variate time series</title>

Abstract: Many multi-variate time series obtained in the natural sciences and engineering possess a repetitive behavior, as for instance state-space trajectories of industrial machines in discrete automation. Recovering the times of recurrence from such a multi-variate time series is of a fundamental importance for many monitoring and control tasks. For a periodic time series this is equivalent to determining its period length. In this work we present a persistent homology framework to estimate recurrence times in multi-variate time series with different generalizations of cyclic behavior (periodic, repetitive, and recurring). To this end, we provide three specialized methods within our framework that are provably stable and validate them using real-world data, including a new benchmark dataset from an injection molding machine.</description>
