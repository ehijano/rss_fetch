      <title>Two Egyptian Kings, Shepseskaf and Userkaf, and a solar eclipse (2471 BC)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, arXiv published a work by G. Magli about the eclipse of 1 April 2471 BC and a supposed influence of it on the end of the fourth Egyptian dynasty and the beginning of the fifth one. In Magli's arXiv/2412.13640 paper, the eclipse is defined as the 'Shepseskaf eclipse'. Magli considers that this eclipse happened during the reign of the 'last ruler of the 4th dynasty, Shepseskaf'. Some literature is giving the name of further members of this dynasty. Therefore, here we add some references, besides those given in arXiv. We will show that, in this literature, the same eclipse of 2471 BC is linked to king Userkaf of the fifth dynasty. Some observations about chronological data proposed by Magli are also necessary. Since in arxiv/2412.13640 paper we find mentioned by Magli the Akhet Khufu and the symbol of the 'solarized' horizon, it is necessary to stress that Akhet (horizon) is written with the crested ibis, as clearly shown by the Wady el-Jarf papyri, which are contemporary to Khufu's reign. The use of the crested ibis for 'horizon' is attested also in a Pepi II letter to his vizier Herkhuf, then three centuries after Khufu.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic Idealism I: Reconceptualizing Reality Through Information and Experience</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Algorithmic idealism represents a transformative approach to understanding reality, emphasizing the informational structure of self-states and their algorithmic transitions over traditional notions of an external, objective universe. Rooted in algorithmic information theory, it redefines reality as a sequence of self-state transitions governed by principles such as Solomonoff induction. This framework offers a unified solution to longstanding challenges in quantum mechanics, cosmology, and metaphysics, addressing issues like the measurement problem, the Boltzmann brain paradox, and the simulation hypothesis. Algorithmic idealism shifts the focus from describing an independent external world to understanding first-person experiences, providing epistemic interpretations of physical theories and dissolving metaphysical divides between "real" and simulated realities. Beyond resolving these conceptual challenges, it raises profound ethical questions regarding the continuity, duplication, and termination of informational entities, reshaping discussions on identity, consciousness, and existence in the digital and quantum age. By offering a mathematically rigorous yet philosophically innovative framework, algorithmic idealism invites a rethinking of reality as an emergent property of informational dynamics rather than a static external construct.</description>

      <title>Re(l)ality: The View From Nowhere vs. The View From Everywhere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the fiber bundle framework, this work investigates the conceptual and mathematical foundations of reference frames in General Relativity by contrasting two paradigms. The View from Nowhere interprets frame representations as perspectives on an invariant equivalence class, while the View from Everywhere posits each frame representation as constituting reality itself. This conception of reality is termed Relality. The paper critically examines the philosophical and practical implications of these views, with a focus on reconciling theory with experimental practice. Central to the discussion is the challenge of providing a perspicuous characterisation of ontology. The View from Nowhere aligns with the so-called sophisticated approach on symmetries and it complicates the empirical grounding of theoretical constructs. In contrast, the View from Everywhere offers a relational ontology that avoids the abstraction of equivalence classes.</description>

      <title>From Quantum Cognition to Conceptuality Interpretation II: Unraveling the Quantum Mysteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An overview of the conceptuality interpretation of quantum mechanics is presented, along with an explanation of how it sheds light on key quantum and relativistic phenomena. In particular, we show how the interpretation clarifies Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, wave function-based and entanglement-based nonlocality, interference effects resulting from the superposition principle, delayed choice experiments, quantum measurements, the mechanism of quantization, the reason why entities can establish entanglement bonds, and the statistical behavior of indistinguishable entities. We further argue that the interpretation can also elucidate relativistic effects, focusing on time dilation. Finally, we suggest that it can provide a novel and challenging perspective on evolution. This article is the second in a two-part series devoted to exploring this promising approach to reality. The first part, which serves as a companion to this discussion, outlines the intellectual trajectory leading from the first applications of quantum notions to human cognition to the bold rethinking suggested by the conceptuality interpretation.</description>

      <title>From terrestrial weather to space weather through the history of scintillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent observations of interplanetary scintillation (IPS) at radio frequencies have proved to be a powerful tool for probing the solar environment from the ground. But how far back does this tradition really extend? Our survey of the literature to date has revealed a long history of scintillating observations, beginning with the oral traditions of Indigenous peoples from around the globe, encompassing the works of the Ancient Greeks and Renaissance scholars, and continuing right through into modern optics, astronomy and space science. We outline here the major steps that humanity has taken along this journey, using scintillation as a tool for predicting first terrestrial, and then space weather without ever having to leave the ground.</description>

      <title>A Model of Entropy Production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A key tenet of the Transactional Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics is the idea that photon absorption localizes the absorbing material system. In doing so, it measures the location of the absorber and hence reduces information entropy, which in turn needs to be balanced by appropriate entropy production, if there is a link between information entropy and thermodynamic entropy. Based on a critical analysis of the physics of information erasure, we clarify the link between information and thermodynamic entropy and develop a rigorous model of entropy production in photon absorption processes. Links to the intepretation of quantum probabilities and Maxwell's Demon are made.</description>

      <title>On a Seldom Oversight in Fermi's Calculations: Seventy Years Later</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.16676v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss an unfortunate mistake, for a Dirac free particle, in the last Fermi lecture notes on quantum mechanics, in a course given at the University of Chicago in winter and spring of 1954. As is demonstrated, the correct result can be obtained by a simple matrix multiplication. An attempt to collect a relevant bibliography is made.</description>

      <title>Boundaries, frames and the issue of physical covariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00993v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We focus on three distinct lines of recent developments: edge modes and boundary charges in gravitational physics, relational dynamics in classical and quantum gravity, and quantum reference frames. We argue that these research directions are in fact linked in multiple ways, and can be seen as different aspects of the same research programme. This research programme has two main physical goals and one general focus, as well as broader conceptual implications. The physical goals are to move beyond the two idealizations/approximations of asymptotic or closed boundary conditions in gravitational physics and of ideal reference frames (coded in coordinate frames or gauge fixings), thus achieving a more realistic modelling of (quantum) gravitational physical phenomena. These two goals combine to identify a key open issue: a proper characterization of physical covariance, i.e. covariance across fully physical (as opposed to idealized) reference frames. The broader conceptual implications concern the influence of observers in physics and possible physical limits to objectivity.</description>
