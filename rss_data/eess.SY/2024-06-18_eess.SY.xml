      <title>Physics-Informed Critic in an Actor-Critic Reinforcement Learning for Swimming in Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Turbulent diffusion causes particles placed in proximity to separate. We investigate the required swimming efforts to maintain a particle close to its passively advected counterpart. We explore optimally balancing these efforts with the intended goal by developing and comparing a novel Physics-Informed Reinforcement Learning (PIRL) strategy with prescribed control (PC) and standard physics-agnostic Reinforcement Learning strategies. Our PIRL scheme, coined the Actor-Physicist, is an adaptation of the Actor-Critic algorithm in which the Neural Network parameterized Critic is replaced with an analytically derived physical heuristic function (the physicist). This strategy is then compared with an analytically computed optimal PC policy derived from a stochastic optimal control formulation and standard physics-agnostic Actor-Critic type algorithms.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This chapter addresses the increasing vulnerability of coastal regions to typhoons and the consequent power outages, emphasizing the critical role of power transmission systems in disaster resilience. It introduces a framework for assessing and enhancing the resilience of these systems against typhoon impacts. The approach integrates a hybrid-driven model for system failure analysis and resilience assessment, employing both data-driven and model-driven techniques. It includes a unique method to identify system vulnerabilities and optimal strategies for resilience enhancement, considering cost-effectiveness. The efficacy of this method is demonstrated through simulations on the IEEE RTS-79 system under realistic typhoon scenarios, showcasing its potential to guide planners in making informed decisions for disaster resilience.</description>

      <title>Online Identification of Time-Varying Systems Using Excitation Sets and Change Point Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we first show that the problem of parameter identification is often ill-conditioned and lacks the persistence of excitation required for the convergence of online learning schemes. To tackle these challenges, we introduce the notion of optimal and greedy excitation sets which contain data points with sufficient richness to aid in the identification task. We then present the greedy excitation set-based recursive least squares algorithm to alleviate the problem of the lack of persistent excitation, and prove that the iterates generated by the proposed algorithm minimize an auxiliary weighted least squares cost function. When data points are generated from time-varying parameters, online estimators tend to underfit the true parameter trajectory, and their predictability deteriorates. To tackle this problem, we propose a memory resetting scheme leveraging change point detection techniques. Finally, we illustrate the performance of the proposed algorithms via several numerical case studies to learn the (time-varying) parameters of networked epidemic dynamics, and compare it with results obtained using conventional approaches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel state-space neural network with ordered variance (SSNNO) in which the state variables are ordered in decreasing variance. A systematic way of identifying the order of the model with SSNNO is proposed, which is further extended for model order reduction. Theoretical results on the existence of SSNNO with an arbitrarily small prediction error is presented. The effectiveness of the SSNNO in system identification and model order reduction is illustrated using simulation results.</description>

      <title>Multi-Objective Control Co-design Using Graph-Based Optimization for Offshore Wind Farm Grid Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Offshore wind farms have emerged as a popular renewable energy source that can generate substantial electric power with a low environmental impact. However, integrating these farms into the grid poses significant complexities. To address these issues, optimal-sized energy storage can provide potential solutions and help improve the reliability, efficiency, and flexibility of the grid. Nevertheless, limited studies have attempted to perform energy storage sizing while including design and operations (i.e., control co-design) for offshore wind farms. As a result, the present work develops a control co-design optimization formulation to optimize multiple objectives and identify Pareto optimal solutions. The graph-based optimization framework is proposed to address the complexity of the system, allowing the optimization problem to be decomposed for large power systems. The IEEE-9 bus system is treated as an onshore AC grid with two offshore wind farms connected via a multi-terminal DC grid for our use case. The developed methodology successfully identifies the Pareto front during the control co-design optimization, enabling decision-makers to select the best compromise solution for multiple objectives.</description>

      <title>An Adaptive Method for Non-Stationary Stochastic Multi-armed Bandits with Rewards Generated by a Linear Dynamical System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online decision-making can be formulated as the popular stochastic multi-armed bandit problem where a learner makes decisions (or takes actions) to maximize cumulative rewards collected from an unknown environment. A specific variant of the bandit problem is the non-stationary stochastic multi-armed bandit problem, where the reward distributions\textemdash which are unknown to the learner\textemdash change over time. This paper proposes to model non-stationary stochastic multi-armed bandits as an unknown stochastic linear dynamical system as many applications, such as bandits for dynamic pricing problems or hyperparameter selection for machine learning models, can benefit from this perspective. Following this approach, we can build a matrix representation of the system's steady-state Kalman filter that takes a set of previously collected observations from a time interval of length $s$ to predict the next reward that will be returned for each action. This paper proposes a solution in which the parameter $s$ is determined via an adaptive algorithm by analyzing the model uncertainty of the matrix representation. This algorithm helps the learner adaptively adjust its model size and its length of exploration based on the uncertainty of its environmental model. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is demonstrated through extensive numerical studies, revealing that the proposed scheme is capable of increasing the rate of collected cumulative rewards.</description>

      <title>Differentiable Predictive Control for Large-Scale Urban Road Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transportation is a major contributor to CO2 emissions, making it essential to optimize traffic networks to reduce energy-related emissions. This paper presents a novel approach to traffic network control using Differentiable Predictive Control (DPC), a physics-informed machine learning methodology. We base our model on the Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram (MFD) and the Networked Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram (NMFD), offering a simplified representation of citywide traffic networks. Our approach ensures compliance with system constraints by construction. In empirical comparisons with existing state-of-the-art Model Predictive Control (MPC) methods, our approach demonstrates a 4 order of magnitude reduction in computation time and an up to 37% improvement in traffic performance. Furthermore, we assess the robustness of our controller to scenario shifts and find that it adapts well to changes in traffic patterns. This work proposes more efficient traffic control methods, particularly in large-scale urban networks, and aims to mitigate emissions and alleviate congestion in the future.</description>

      <title>Risk-Aware Value-Oriented Net Demand Forecasting for Virtual Power Plants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a risk-aware net demand forecasting product for virtual power plants, which helps reduce the risk of high operation costs. At the training phase, a bilevel program for parameter estimation is formulated, where the upper level optimizes over the forecast model parameter to minimize the conditional value-at-risk (a risk metric) of operation costs. The lower level solves the operation problems given the forecast. Leveraging the specific structure of the operation problem, we show that the bilevel program is equivalent to a convex program when the forecast model is linear. Numerical results show that our approach effectively reduces the risk of high costs compared to the forecasting approach developed for risk-neutral decision makers.</description>

      <title>Fast Geometric Learning of MIMO Signal Detection over Grassmannian Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Domain or statistical distribution shifts are a key staple of the wireless communication channel, because of the dynamics of the environment. Deep learning (DL) models for detecting multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) signals in dynamic communication require large training samples (in the order of hundreds of thousands to millions) and online retraining to adapt to domain shift. Some dynamic networks, such as vehicular networks, cannot tolerate the waiting time associated with gathering a large number of training samples or online fine-tuning which incurs significant end-to-end delay. In this paper, a novel classification technique based on the concept of geodesic flow kernel (GFK) is proposed for MIMO signal detection. In particular, received MIMO signals are first represented as points on Grassmannian manifolds by formulating basis of subspaces spanned by the rows vectors of the received signal. Then, the domain shift is modeled using a geodesic flow kernel integrating the subspaces that lie on the geodesic to characterize changes in geometric and statistical properties of the received signals. The kernel derives low-dimensional representations of the received signals over the Grassman manifolds that are invariant to domain shift and is used in a geometric support vector machine (G-SVM) algorithm for MIMO signal detection in an unsupervised manner. Simulation results reveal that the proposed method achieves promising performance against the existing baselines like OAMPnet and MMNet with only 1,200 training samples and without online retraining.</description>

      <title>Intermittent Encryption Strategies for Anti-Eavesdropping Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, an anti-eavesdropping estimation problem is investigated. A linear encryption scheme is utilized, which first linearly transforms innovation via an encryption matrix and then encrypts some components of the transformed innovation. To reduce the computation and energy resources consumed by the linear encryption scheme, both stochastic and deterministic intermittent strategies which perform the linear encryption scheme only at partial moments are developed. When the system is stable, it is shown that the mean squared error (MSE) of the eavesdropper converges under any stochastic or deterministic intermittent strategy. Also, an analytical encryption matrix that maximizes the steady-state of the MSE is designed. When the system is unstable, the eavesdropper's MSE can be unbounded with arbitrary positive encryption probabilities and decision functions if encryption matrices are chosen appropriately. Then, the relationship between the aforementioned encryption parameters and the eavesdropper's MSE is analyzed. Moreover, a single intermittent strategy which only encrypts one message is discussed. This strategy can be unavailable for stable systems, but can make the eavesdropper's MSE unbounded in unstable systems for the encrypted message satisfies a linear matrix inequality (LMI) condition. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is verified in the simulation.</description>

      <title>Polynomial Chaos-based Stochastic Model Predictive Control: An Overview and Future Research Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article is devoted to providing a review of mathematical formulations in which Polynomial Chaos Theory (PCT) has been incorporated into stochastic model predictive control (SMPC). In the past decade, PCT has been shown to provide a computationally tractable way to perform complete and accurate uncertainty propagation through (smooth) nonlinear dynamic systems. As such, it represents a very useful computational tool for accelerating the computations needed in SMPC with time invariant uncertainties. It turns out that it can also be used to reduce complexity of chance constraints, which are an important component of SMPC. In this paper, we provide an overview of PCT and discuss how it can be applied in such time invariant settings.</description>

      <title>Reachability Analysis for Linear Systems with Uncertain Parameters using Polynomial Zonotopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In real world applications, uncertain parameters are the rule rather than the exception. We present a reachability algorithm for linear systems with uncertain parameters and inputs using set propagation of polynomial zonotopes. In contrast to previous methods, our approach is able to tightly capture the non-convexity of the reachable set. Building up on our main result, we show how our reachability algorithm can be extended to handle linear time-varying systems as well as linear systems with time-varying parameters. Moreover, our approach opens up new possibilities for reachability analysis of linear time-invariant systems, nonlinear systems, and hybrid systems. We compare our approach to other state of the art methods, with superior tightness on two benchmarks including a 9-dimensional vehicle platooning system. Moreover, as part of the journal extension, we investigate through a polynomial zonotope with special structure named multi-affine zonotopes and its optimization problem. We provide the corresponding optimization algorithm and experiment over the examples obatined from two benchmark systems, showing the efficiency and scalability comparing to the state of the art method for handling such type of set representation.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the design of algorithms based on systems of interacting particles to represent, approximate, and learn the optimal control law for reinforcement learning (RL). The primary contribution of the present paper is to show that convergence rates can be accelerated dramatically through careful design of interactions between particles. Theory focuses on the linear quadratic stochastic optimal control problem for which a complete and novel theory is presented. Apart from the new algorithm, sample complexity bounds are obtained, and it is shown that the mean square error scales as $1/N$ where $N$ is the number of particles. The theoretical results and algorithms are illustrated with numerical experiments and comparisons with other recent approaches, where the faster convergence of the proposed algorithm is numerically demonstrated.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate parametric resonance in oscillator networks subjected to periodically time-varying oscillations in the edge strengths. Such models are inspired by the well-known parametric resonance phenomena for single oscillators, as well as the potential rich phenomenology when such parametric excitations are present in a variety of applications like deep brain stimulation, AC power transmission networks, as well as vehicular flocking formations. We consider cases where a single edge, a subgraph, or the entire network is subjected to forcing, and in each case, we characterize an interesting interplay between the parametric resonance modes and the eigenvalues/vectors of the graph Laplacian. Our analysis is based on a novel treatment of multiple-scale perturbation analysis that we develop for the underlying high-dimensional dynamic equations.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Modeling and Control for an Offshore Semisubmersible Floating Wind Turbine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Floating wind turbines (FWTs) hold significant potential for the exploitation of offshore renewable energy resources. Nevertheless, prior to the construction of FWTs, it is imperative to tackle several critical challenges, especially the issue of performance degradation under combined wind and wave loads. This study initiates with the development of a simplified nonlinear dynamical model for a semi-submersible FWT. In particular, both the rotor dynamics and the finite rotations of the platform are considered in presented modeling approach, thereby effectively capturing the complex interplay between the platform, tower, nacelle, and rotor under combined wind and wave loads. Subsequently, based on the developed FWT model, a novel adaptive nonlinear pitch controller is formulated with the goal of striking a trade-off between regulating power generation and reducing platform motion. Notably, the proposed control strategy adopts a continuous control approach, strategically beneficial in circumventing the chattering phenomenon commonly associated with sliding mode control. Furthermore, the controller integrates an online approximator and a robust integral of the sign of the tracking error, facilitating real-time learning of system unknown dynamics while compensating for bounded disturbances. Finally, both the accuracy of the established nonlinear FWT model in predicting key dynamics and the superiority of the presented pitch controller are validated through comprehensive comparative studies.</description>

      <title>Low-probability of Intercept/Detect (LPI/LPD) Secure Communications Using Antenna Arrays Employing Rapid Sidelobe Time Modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an electronically-reconfigurable antenna array offering low probability of intercept/detect (LPI/LPD) and secure communications capabilities simultaneously at the physical layer. This antenna array is designed to provide rapidly time-varying sidelobes and a stationary main lobe. By performing rapid sidelobe time modulation (SLTM), the signal transmitted in the undesired directions (i.e., through sidelobes) undergoes spread-spectrum distortion making it more difficult to be detected, intercepted, and deciphered while the signal transmitted in the desired direction (i.e., through the main lobe) is unaffected. Therefore, the intended receiver would not need additional modifications (i.e. encryption keys) to detect and recover the signal. We describe the operating principles of this SLTM array and validate its spread-spectrum SLTM sequence generation in undesired directions through theory, simulations, and experiments. Using a fabricated SLTM prototype operating at X band, we conducted system-level measurements to demonstrate its LPI/LPD, secure communications, and jamming resilience capabilities. The presented method is a physical layer technique, which can bring LPI/LPD capabilities to existing communications systems by simply replacing their antennas with SLTM arrays. This technique can be used independently or in combination with additional coding and signal-processing techniques to achieve further enhancements in LPI/LPD and secure communications.</description>

Abstract: This paper aims to balance performance and cost in a two-hop wireless cooperative communication network where the source and relays have contradictory optimization goals and make decisions in a distributed manner. This differs from most existing works that have typically assumed that source and relay nodes follow a schedule created implicitly by a central controller. We propose that the relays form an alliance in an attempt to maximize the benefit of relaying while the source aims to increase the channel capacity cost-effectively. To this end, we establish the trade problem as a Stackelberg game, and prove the existence of its equilibrium. Another important aspect is that we use multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to approach the equilibrium in a situation where the instantaneous channel state information (CSI) is unavailable, and the source and relays do not have knowledge of each other's goal. A multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient-based framework is designed, where the relay alliance and the source act as agents. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can obtain an acceptable performance that is close to the game-theoretic equilibrium for all players under time-invariant environments, which considerably outperforms its potential alternatives and is only about 2.9% away from the optimal solution.</description>

      <title>Newton and Secant Methods for Iterative Remnant Control of Preisach Hysteresis Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the properties of remnant function, which is a function of output remnant versus amplitude of the input signal, of Preisach hysteresis operators. The remnant behavior (or the leftover memory when the input reaches zero) enables an energy-optimal application of piezoactuator systems where the applied electrical field can be removed when the desired strain/displacement has been attained. We show that when the underlying weight of Preisach operators is positive, the resulting remnant curve is monotonically increasing and accordingly a Newton and secant update laws for the iterative remnant control are proposed that allows faster convergence to the desired remnant value than the existing iterative remnant control algorithm in literature as validated by numerical simulation.</description>

      <title>Energy efficiency analysis of ammonia-fueled power systems for vehicles considering residual heat recovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ammonia, known as a good hydrogen carrier, shows great potential for use as a zero-carbon fuel for vehicles. However, both the internal combustion engine (ICE) and the proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC), the currently available engines used by the vehicle, require hydrogen decomposed from ammonia. On-board hydrogen production is an energy-intensive process that significantly reduces system efficiency. Therefore, energy recovery from the system's residual heat is essential to promote system efficiency. ICEs and FCs require different amounts of hydrogen, and they produce residual heat of different quality and quantity, so the system efficiency is not only determined by the engine operating point, but also by the measures and ratios of residual heat recovery. To thoroughly understand the relationships between system energy efficiency and system configuration as well as system parameters, this paper takes three typical power systems with different configurations as our objects. Models of three systems are set up for system energy efficiency analysis, and carry out simulations under different conditions to conduct system output power and energy efficiency. By analyzing the simulation results, the factors that most significantly impact the system efficiency are identified, the guidelines for system design and parameter optimization are proposed.</description>

      <title>LFPLM: A General and Flexible Load Forecasting Framework based on Pre-trained Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate load forecasting is essential for maintaining the power balance between generators and consumers, especially with the increasing integration of renewable energy sources, which introduce significant intermittent volatility. With the development of data-driven methods, machine learning and deep learning-based models have become the predominant approach for load forecasting tasks. In recent years, pre-trained language models (PLMs) have made significant advancements, demonstrating superior performance in various fields. This paper proposes a load forecasting method based on PLMs, which offers not only accurate predictive ability but also general and flexible applicability. Additionally, a data modeling method is proposed to effectively transform load sequence data into natural language for PLM training. Furthermore, we introduce a data enhancement strategy that eliminate the impact of PLM hallucinations on forecasting results. The effectiveness of the proposed method has been validated on two real-world datasets. Compared with existing methods, our approach shows state-of-the-art performance across all validation metrics.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Cooperative Connected Automated Vehicles for Mixed Traffic Safety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The introduction of connected and automated vehicles (CAV) is believed to reduce congestion, enhance safety, and improve traffic efficiency. Numerous research studies have focused on controlling pure CAV platoons in fully connected automated traffic, as well as single or multiple CAVs in mixed traffic with human-driven vehicles (HVs). CAV cruising control designs have been proposed to stabilize the car-following traffic dynamics, but few studies has considered their safety impact, particularly the trade-offs between stability and safety. In this paper, we study how cooperative control strategies for CAVs can be designed to enhance the safety and smoothness of mixed traffic under varying penetrations of connectivity and automation. Considering mixed traffic where a pair of CAVs travels amongst HVs, we design cooperative feedback controllers for the pair CAVs to stabilize traffic via cooperation and, possibly, by also leveraging connectivity with HVs. The real-time safety impact of the CAV controllers is investigated using control barrier functions (CBF). We construct CBF safety constraints, based on which we propose safety-critical control designs to guarantee CAV safety, HV safety and platoon safety. Both theoretical and numerical analyses have been conducted to explore the effect of CAV cooperation and HV connectivity on stability and safety. Our results show that the cooperation of CAVs helps to stabilize the mixed traffic while safety can be guaranteed with the safety filters. Moreover, connectivity between CAVs and HVs offers additional benefits: if an HV connects to an upstream CAV (i.e., the CAV looks ahead), it helps the CAV to stabilize the upstream traffic, while if an HV connects to a downstream CAV (i.e., the CAV looks behind), the safety of this connected HV can be enhanced.</description>

      <title>Unleashing OpenTitan's Potential: a Silicon-Ready Embedded Secure Element for Root of Trust and Cryptographic Offloading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid advancement and exploration of open-hardware RISC-V platforms are driving significant changes in sectors like autonomous vehicles, smart-city infrastructure, and medical devices. OpenTitan stands out as a groundbreaking open-source RISC-V design with a comprehensive security toolkit as a standalone system-on-chip (SoC). OpenTitan includes Earl Grey, a fully implemented and silicon-proven SoC, and Darjeeling, announced but not yet fully implemented. Earl Grey targets standalone SoC implementations, while Darjeeling is for integrable implementations. The literature lacks a silicon-ready embedded implementation of an open-source Root of Trust, despite lowRISC's efforts on Darjeeling. We address the limitations of existing implementations by optimizing data transfer latency between memory and cryptographic accelerators to prevent under-utilization and ensure efficient task acceleration. Our contributions include a comprehensive methodology for integrating custom extensions and IPs into the Earl Grey architecture, architectural enhancements for system-level integration, support for varied boot modes, and improved data movement across the platform. These advancements facilitate deploying OpenTitan in broader SoCs, even without specific technology-dependent IPs, providing a deployment-ready research vehicle for the community. We integrated the extended Earl Grey architecture into a reference architecture in a 22nm FDX technology node, benchmarking the enhanced architecture's performance. The results show significant improvements in cryptographic processing speed, achieving up to 2.7x speedup for SHA-256/HMAC and 1.6x for AES accelerators compared to the baseline Earl Grey architecture.</description>

      <title>Communication-Efficient MARL for Platoon Stability and Energy-efficiency Co-optimization in Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control of CAVs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) has been recognized as a fundamental function of autonomous driving, in which platoon stability and energy efficiency are outstanding challenges that are difficult to accommodate in real-world operations. This paper studied the CACC of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) based on the multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm (MARL) to optimize platoon stability and energy efficiency simultaneously. The optimal use of communication bandwidth is the key to guaranteeing learning performance in real-world driving, and thus this paper proposes a communication-efficient MARL by incorporating the quantified stochastic gradient descent (QSGD) and a binary differential consensus (BDC) method into a fully-decentralized MARL framework. We benchmarked the performance of our proposed BDC-MARL algorithm against several several non-communicative andcommunicative MARL algorithms, e.g., IA2C, FPrint, and DIAL, through the evaluation of platoon stability, fuel economy, and driving comfort. Our results show that BDC-MARL achieved the highest energy savings, improving by up to 5.8%, with an average velocity of 15.26 m/s and an inter-vehicle spacing of 20.76 m. In addition, we conducted different information-sharing analyses to assess communication efficacy, along with sensitivity analyses and scalability tests with varying platoon sizes. The practical effectiveness of our approach is further demonstrated using real-world scenarios sourced from open-sourced OpenACC.</description>

      <title>Robust positive model reduction via monotone matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work focuses on the problem of exact model reduction of positive linear systems, by leveraging minimal realization theory. While even determining the existence of a positive reachable realization remains an open problem, we are able to fully characterize the cases in which the new model is obtained with non-negative reduction matrices, and hence positivity of the reduced model is robust with respect to small perturbations of original system. The characterization is obtained by specializing monotone matrix theory to positive matrices. In addition, we provide positive reduction also when minimal ones are not available, by exploiting algebraic techniques.</description>

      <title>GridSweep Simulation: Measuring Subsynchronous Impedance Spectra of Distribution Feeder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Peaks and troughs in the subsynchronous impedance spectrum of a distribution feeder may be a useful indication of oscillation risk, or more importantly lack of oscillation risk, if inverter-based resource (IBR) deployments are increased on that feeder. GridSweep is a new instrument for measuring the subsynchronous impedance spectra of distribution feeders. It combines an active probing device that modulates a 120-volt 1-kW load sinusoidally at a user-selected GPS-phase locked frequency from 1.0 to 40.0 Hz, and with a recorder that takes ultra-high-precision continuous point-on-wave (CPOW) 120-volt synchrowaveforms at 4 kHz. This paper presents a computer simulation of GridSweep's probing and measurement capability. We construct an electromagnetic transient (EMT) simulation of a single-phase distribution feeder equipped with multiple inverter-based resources (IBRs). We include a model of the GridSweep probing device, then demonstrate the model's capability to measure the subsynchronous apparent impedance spectrum of the feeder. Peaks in that spectrum align with the system's dominant oscillation modes caused by IBRs.</description>

      <title>Run Time Assured Reinforcement Learning for Six Degree-of-Freedom Spacecraft Inspection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The trial and error approach of reinforcement learning (RL) results in high performance across many complex tasks, but it can also lead to unsafe behavior. Run time assurance (RTA) approaches can be used to assure safety of the agent during training, allowing it to safely explore the environment. This paper investigates the application of RTA during RL training for a 6-Degree-of-Freedom spacecraft inspection task, where the agent must control its translational motion and attitude to inspect a passive chief spacecraft. Several safety constraints are developed based on position, velocity, attitude, temperature, and power of the spacecraft, and are all enforced simultaneously during training through the use of control barrier functions. This paper also explores simulating the RL agent and RTA at different frequencies to best balance training performance and safety assurance. The agent is trained with and without RTA, and the performance is compared across several metrics including inspection percentage and fuel usage.</description>

      <title>Fast-Fading Channel and Power Optimization of the Magnetic Inductive Cellular Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The cellular network of magnetic Induction (MI) communication holds promise in long-distance underground environments. In the traditional MI communication, there is no fast-fading channel since the MI channel is treated as a quasi-static channel. However, for the vehicle (mobile) MI (VMI) communication, the unpredictable antenna vibration brings the remarkable fast-fading. As such fast-fading cannot be modeled by the central limit theorem, it differs radically from other wireless fast-fading channels. Unfortunately, few studies focus on this phenomenon. In this paper, using a novel space modeling based on the electromagnetic field theorem, we propose a 3-dimension model of the VMI antenna vibration. By proposing ``conjugate pseudo-piecewise functions'' and boundary $p(x)$ distribution, we derive the cumulative distribution function (CDF), probability density function (PDF) and the expectation of the VMI fast-fading channel. We also theoretically analyze the effects of the VMI fast-fading on the network throughput, including the VMI outage probability which can be ignored in the traditional MI channel study. We draw several intriguing conclusions different from those in wireless fast-fading studies. For instance, the fast-fading brings more uniformly distributed channel coefficients. Finally, we propose the power control algorithm using the non-cooperative game and multiagent Q-learning methods to optimize the throughput of the cellular VMI network. Simulations validate the derivation and the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>I Still See You: Why Existing IoT Traffic Reshaping Fails</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Internet traffic data produced by the Internet of Things (IoT) devices are collected by Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and device manufacturers, and often shared with their third parties to maintain and enhance user services. Unfortunately, on-path adversaries could infer and fingerprint users' sensitive privacy information such as occupancy and user activities by analyzing these network traffic traces. While there's a growing body of literature on defending against this side-channel attack-malicious IoT traffic analytics (TA), there's currently no systematic method to compare and evaluate the comprehensiveness of these existing studies. To address this problem, we design a new low-cost, open-source system framework-IoT Traffic Exposure Monitoring Toolkit (ITEMTK) that enables people to comprehensively examine and validate prior attack models and their defending approaches. In particular, we also design a novel image-based attack capable of inferring sensitive user information, even when users employ the most robust preventative measures in their smart homes. Researchers could leverage our new image-based attack to systematize and understand the existing literature on IoT traffic analysis attacks and preventing studies. Our results show that current defending approaches are not sufficient to protect IoT device user privacy. IoT devices are significantly vulnerable to our new image-based user privacy inference attacks, posing a grave threat to IoT device user privacy. We also highlight potential future improvements to enhance the defending approaches. ITEMTK's flexibility allows other researchers for easy expansion by integrating new TA attack models and prevention methods to benchmark their future work.</description>

      <title>HumanPlus: Humanoid Shadowing and Imitation from Humans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the key arguments for building robots that have similar form factors to human beings is that we can leverage the massive human data for training. Yet, doing so has remained challenging in practice due to the complexities in humanoid perception and control, lingering physical gaps between humanoids and humans in morphologies and actuation, and lack of a data pipeline for humanoids to learn autonomous skills from egocentric vision. In this paper, we introduce a full-stack system for humanoids to learn motion and autonomous skills from human data. We first train a low-level policy in simulation via reinforcement learning using existing 40-hour human motion datasets. This policy transfers to the real world and allows humanoid robots to follow human body and hand motion in real time using only a RGB camera, i.e. shadowing. Through shadowing, human operators can teleoperate humanoids to collect whole-body data for learning different tasks in the real world. Using the data collected, we then perform supervised behavior cloning to train skill policies using egocentric vision, allowing humanoids to complete different tasks autonomously by imitating human skills. We demonstrate the system on our customized 33-DoF 180cm humanoid, autonomously completing tasks such as wearing a shoe to stand up and walk, unloading objects from warehouse racks, folding a sweatshirt, rearranging objects, typing, and greeting another robot with 60-100% success rates using up to 40 demonstrations.

      <title>Inverse Kinematics with Vision-Based Constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces the Visual Inverse Kinematics problem (VIK) to fill the gap between robot Inverse Kinematics (IK) and visual servo control. Different from the IK problem, the VIK problem seeks to find robot configurations subject to vision-based constraints, in addition to kinematic constraints. In this work, we develop a formulation of the VIK problem with a Field of View (FoV) constraint, enforcing the visibility of an object from a camera on the robot. Our proposed solution is based on the idea of adding a virtual kinematic chain connecting the physical robot and the object; the FoV constraint is then equivalent to a joint angle kinematic constraint. Along the way, we introduce multiple vision-based cost functions to fulfill different objectives. We solve this formulation of the VIK problem using a method that involves a semidefinite program (SDP) constraint followed by a rank minimization algorithm. The performance of this method for solving the VIK problem is validated through simulations.</description>

      <title>LEO Satellite Networks Assisted Geo-distributed Data Processing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nowadays, the increasing deployment of edge clouds globally provides users with low-latency services. However, connecting an edge cloud to a core cloud via optic cables in terrestrial networks poses significant barriers due to the prohibitively expensive building cost of optic cables. Fortunately, emerging Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite networks (e.g., Starlink) offer a more cost-effective solution for increasing edge clouds, and hence large volumes of data in edge clouds can be transferred to a core cloud via those networks for time-sensitive big data tasks processing, such as attack detection. However, the state-of-the-art satellite selection algorithms bring poor performance for those processing via our measurements. Therefore, we propose a novel data volume aware satellite selection algorithm, named DVA, to support such big data processing tasks. DVA first takes into account both the data size in edge clouds and satellite capacity to finalize the selection, thereby preventing congestion in the access network and reducing transmitting duration. Extensive simulations validate that DVA has a significantly lower average access network duration than the state-of-the-art satellite selection algorithms in a LEO satellite emulation platform.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the most significant obstacles in bearing fault diagnosis is a lack of labeled data for various fault types. Also, sensor-acquired data frequently lack labels and have a large amount of missing data. This paper tackles these issues by presenting the PTPAI method, which uses a physics-informed deep learning-based technique to generate synthetic labeled data. Labeled synthetic data makes up the source domain, whereas unlabeled data with missing data is present in the target domain. Consequently, imbalanced class problems and partial-set fault diagnosis hurdles emerge. To address these challenges, the RF-Mixup approach is used to handle imbalanced classes. As domain adaptation strategies, the MK-MMSD and CDAN are employed to mitigate the disparity in distribution between synthetic and actual data. Furthermore, the partial-set challenge is tackled by applying weighting methods at the class and instance levels. Experimental outcomes on the CWRU and JNU datasets indicate that the proposed approach effectively addresses these problems.</description>

      <title>A Swift and Omnidirectional Formation Approach based on Hierarchical Reorganization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current formations commonly rely on invariant hierarchical structures, such as predetermined leaders or enumerated formation shapes. These structures could be unidirectional and sluggish, constraining their adaptability and agility when encountering cluttered environments. To surmount these constraints, this work proposes an omnidirectional affine formation approach with hierarchical reorganizations. We first delineate the critical conditions requisite for facilitating hierarchical reorganizations within formations, which informs the development of the omnidirectional affine criterion. Central to our approach is the fluid leadership and authority redistribution, for which we develop a minimum time-driven leadership evaluation algorithm and a power transition control algorithm. These algorithms facilitate autonomous leader selection and ensure smooth power transitions, enabling the swarm to adapt hierarchically in alignment with the external environment. Furthermore, we deploy a power-centric topology switching mechanism tailored for the dynamic reorganization of in-team connections. Finally, simulations and experiments demonstrate the performance of the proposed method. The formation successfully performs several hierarchical reorganizations, with the longest reorganization taking only 0.047s. This swift adaptability allows five aerial robots to carry out complex tasks, including executing swerving movements and navigating through hoops at velocities up to 1.9m/s.</description>

      <title>An Internal Model Principle For Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When designing a robot's internal system, one often makes assumptions about the structure of the intended environment of the robot. One may even assign meaning to various internal components of the robot in terms of expected environmental correlates. In this paper we want to make the distinction between robot's internal and external worlds clear-cut. Can the robot learn about its environment, relying only on internally available information, including the sensor data? Are there mathematical conditions on the internal robot system which can be internally verified and make the robot's internal system mirror the structure of the environment? We prove that sufficiency is such a mathematical principle, and mathematically describe the emergence of the robot's internal structure isomorphic or bisimulation equivalent to that of the environment. A connection to the free-energy principle is established, when sufficiency is interpreted as a limit case of surprise minimization. As such, we show that surprise minimization leads to having an internal model isomorphic to the environment. This also parallels the Good Regulator Principle which states that controlling a system sufficiently well means having a model of it. Unlike the mentioned theories, ours is discrete, and non-probabilistic.</description>

      <title>Joint Distributed Generation Maximization and Radial Distribution Network Reconfiguration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies an optimization problem for joint radial distribution system network reconfiguration and power dispatch for distributed generation (DG) maximization. We provide counterexamples to show that for DG maximization, standard techniques such as interior point method (as in Matpower), linear approximation and second order cone relaxation (e.g., by Jabr et.~al.~and by Farivar and Low) do not deliver the desired control. Instead, we propose a control decision model based on exact DistFlow equations bypassing relaxation and a solution approach based on spatial branch-and-bound algorithm. We justify our work with comparative studies and numerical demonstrations with benchmarks and a 533-bus real example, performing reconfiguration and power dispatch in a time scale relevant for control center applications.</description>

      <title>Control of Unknown Quadrotors from a Single Throw</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a method to recover quadrotor UAV from a throw, when no control parameters are known before the throw. We leverage the availability of high-frequency rotor speed feedback available in racing drone hardware and software to find control effectiveness values and fit a motor model using recursive least squares (RLS) estimation. Furthermore, we propose an excitation sequence that provides large actuation commands while guaranteeing to stay within gyroscope sensing limits. After 450ms of excitation, an INDI attitude controller uses the 52 fitted parameters to arrest rotational motion and recover an upright attitude. Finally, a NDI position controller drives the craft to a position setpoint. The proposed algorithm runs efficiently on microcontrollers found in common UAV flight controllers, and was shown to recover an agile quadrotor every time in 57 live experiments with as low as 3.5m throw height, demonstrating robustness against initial rotations and noise. We also demonstrate control of randomized quadrotors in simulated throws, where the parameter fitting RMS error is typically within 10% of the true value.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11774v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The primary goal of reinforcement learning is to develop decision-making policies that prioritize optimal performance without considering risk or safety. In contrast, safe reinforcement learning aims to mitigate or avoid unsafe states. This paper presents a risk-sensitive Q-learning algorithm that leverages optimal transport theory to enhance the agent safety. By integrating optimal transport into the Q-learning framework, our approach seeks to optimize the policy's expected return while minimizing the Wasserstein distance between the policy's stationary distribution and a predefined risk distribution, which encapsulates safety preferences from domain experts. We validate the proposed algorithm in a Gridworld environment. The results indicate that our method significantly reduces the frequency of visits to risky states and achieves faster convergence to a stable policy compared to the traditional Q-learning algorithm.</description>

      <title>Physics-Constrained Learning for PDE Systems with Uncertainty Quantified Port-Hamiltonian Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modeling the dynamics of flexible objects has become an emerging topic in the community as these objects become more present in many applications, e.g., soft robotics. Due to the properties of flexible materials, the movements of soft objects are often highly nonlinear and, thus, complex to predict. Data-driven approaches seem promising for modeling those complex dynamics but often neglect basic physical principles, which consequently makes them untrustworthy and limits generalization. To address this problem, we propose a physics-constrained learning method that combines powerful learning tools and reliable physical models. Our method leverages the data collected from observations by sending them into a Gaussian process that is physically constrained by a distributed Port-Hamiltonian model. Based on the Bayesian nature of the Gaussian process, we not only learn the dynamics of the system, but also enable uncertainty quantification. Furthermore, the proposed approach preserves the compositional nature of Port-Hamiltonian systems.</description>

      <title>Computationally Efficient RL under Linear Bellman Completeness for Deterministic Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study computationally and statistically efficient Reinforcement Learning algorithms for the linear Bellman Complete setting, a setting that uses linear function approximation to capture value functions and unifies existing models like linear Markov Decision Processes (MDP) and Linear Quadratic Regulators (LQR). While it is known from the prior works that this setting is statistically tractable, it remained open whether a computationally efficient algorithm exists. Our work provides a computationally efficient algorithm for the linear Bellman complete setting that works for MDPs with large action spaces, random initial states, and random rewards but relies on the underlying dynamics to be deterministic. Our approach is based on randomization: we inject random noise into least square regression problems to perform optimistic value iteration. Our key technical contribution is to carefully design the noise to only act in the null space of the training data to ensure optimism while circumventing a subtle error amplification issue.</description>

      <title>A New Computational Approach for Solving Linear Bilevel Programs Based on Parameter-Free Disjunctive Decomposition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2203.06069v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Linear bilevel programs (linear BLPs) have been widely used in computational mathematics and optimization in several applications. Single-level reformulation for linear BLPs replaces the lower-level linear program with its Karush-Kuhn-Tucker optimality conditions and linearizes the complementary slackness conditions using the big-M technique. Although the approach is straightforward, it requires finding the big-M whose computation is recently shown to be NP-hard. This paper presents a disjunctive-based decomposition algorithm which does not need finding the big-Ms whereas guaranteeing that obtained solution is optimal. Our experience shows promising performance of our algorithm.</description>

      <title>Online Feedback Droop Scheduling in Distribution Grids for Frequency and Local Voltage Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.02837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.02837v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for collective control of Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) in active Distribution Networks (DNs). The proposed approach unifies the commonly employed local (i.e., decentralized) voltage and frequency droop control schemes into a transfer matrix relating frequency and voltage magnitude measurements to active and reactive power injection adjustments. Furthermore, the transfer matrices of individual DER units are adaptively tuned in real-time via slow communication links using a novel online gain scheduling approach to enable primary frequency support provision to the transmission system and ensure that the DN voltages are kept within the allowable limits. A global asymptomatic stability condition of the analyzed droop-controlled DN is analytically established. The considered gain scheduling problem is solved by leveraging an online primal-dual gradient-based method and a suitable linearized power flow model. Additional ancillary service providers can be trivially incorporated into the proposed framework in a plug-and-play fashion. Numerical simulations of the 37-bus IEEE test system and a realistic Swedish 533-bus DN confirm the validity and the scalability of the approach and demonstrate numerous advantages of the proposed scheme over the state-of-the-art.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Mobile Robot Navigation Safety and Efficiency through NMPC with Relaxed CBF in Dynamic Environments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.11348v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, a safety-critical control strategy for a nonholonomic robot is developed to generate control signals that result in optimal, obstacle-free paths through dynamic environments. We formulate the control synthesis problem as an Optimal Control Problem (OCP) that enforces Control Lyapunov Function (CLF) constraints for system stability as well as safety-critical constraints using Control Barrier Function (CBF) with a relaxing decay rate of the barrier function. A Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) integrates with CLF and CBF to ensure system safety and facilitate optimal performance within a short prediction horizon, reducing the computational burden in real-time implementation. Additionally, we incorporate an obstacle avoidance constraint based on the Euclidean norm into the NMPC framework, showcasing the CBF approach's superiority in addressing mobile robotic systems' point stabilisation and trajectory tracking challenges. Through extensive simulations, the proposed controller demonstrates proficiency in static and dynamic obstacle avoidance under various scenarios. Experimental validations conducted using the Husky A200 robot align with simulation results, reinforcing the applicability of our proposed approach in real-world scenarios, notably improving the computational efficiency and safety in practical mobile robot applications.</description>

      <title>Event-Triggered Islanding in Inverter-Based Grids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.15454v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The decentralization of modern power systems challenges the hierarchical structure of the electric grid and necessitates automated schemes to manage adverse conditions. This work proposes an adaptive isolation methodology that can divide a grid into autonomous islands, ensuring stable and economical operation amid deliberate (e.g., cyberattacks) or unintentional abnormal events. The adaptive isolation logic is event-triggered to prevent false positives, enhance detection accuracy, and reduce computational overhead. A measurement-based stable kernel representation (SKR) triggering mechanism initially inspects distributed generation controllers for abnormal behavior. The SKR then alerts a machine learning (ML) ensemble classifier to assess whether the system behavior remains within acceptable operational limits. The event-triggered adaptive isolation framework is evaluated using the IEEE RTS-24 and 118-bus systems. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework detects anomalous behavior with 100% accuracy in real-time, i.e., within 22 msec. Supply-adequate partitions are identified outperforming traditional islanding detection and formation techniques while minimizing operating costs.</description>

Abstract: This tutorial serves as an introduction to recently developed non-asymptotic methods in the theory of -- mainly linear -- system identification. We emphasize tools we deem particularly useful for a range of problems in this domain, such as the covering technique, the Hanson-Wright Inequality and the method of self-normalized martingales. We then employ these tools to give streamlined proofs of the performance of various least-squares based estimators for identifying the parameters in autoregressive models. We conclude by sketching out how the ideas presented herein can be extended to certain nonlinear identification problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04718v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the efficiency of nonsingular fast terminal sliding mode and adaptive smooth control method for the distributed space telescope demonstration mission. The distributed space telescope has a flexible focal length that corresponds to the relative position of the formation flying concept. The precise formation flying technology by CubeSats enhances the utility of distributed space systems with low costs. The propulsion systems for CubeSats usually have restricted degrees of freedom. Since the scientific mission requires continuous orbit control, the attitude and orbit control system mutually affect the control performance. The nonsingular fast terminal sliding mode has the advantage of a fast convergence rate and is able to improve the control performance. The adaptive smooth controller designed for the SISO system is expanded and applied to the attitude and orbit control system. The simulation results verify the efficiency of the adaptive smooth controller based on the nonsingular fast terminal sliding mode.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03489v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Urban transit bus idling is a contributor to ecological stress, economic inefficiency, and medically hazardous health outcomes due to emissions. The global accumulation of this frequent pattern of undesirable driving behavior is enormous. In order to measure its scale, we propose GRD-TRT- BUF-4I (Ground Truth Buffer for Idling) an extensible, realtime detection system that records the geolocation and idling duration of urban transit bus fleets internationally. Using live vehicle locations from General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) Realtime, the system detects approximately 200,000 idling events per day from over 50 cities across North America, Europe, Oceania, and Asia. This realtime data was created to dynamically serve operational decision-making and fleet management to reduce the frequency and duration of idling events as they occur, as well as to capture its accumulative effects. Civil and Transportation Engineers, Urban Planners, Epidemiologists, Policymakers, and other stakeholders might find this useful for emissions modeling, traffic management, route planning, and other urban sustainability efforts at a variety of geographic and temporal scales.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08916v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper develops rollover prevention guarantees for mobile robots using control barrier function (CBF) theory, and demonstrates the method experimentally. We consider a safety measure based on a zero moment point condition through the lens of CBFs. However, these conditions depend on time-varying and noisy parameters. To address this issue, we present a differentiator-based safety-critical controller that estimates these parameters and pairs Input-to-State Stable (ISS) differentiator dynamics with CBFs to achieve rigorous safety guarantees. Additionally, to ensure safety in the presence of disturbances, we utilize a time-varying extension of Projection-to-State Safety (PSSf). The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated via experiments on a tracked robot with a rollover potential on steep slopes.</description>

Abstract: In this research, we address the complex task of developing versatile and agile quadrupedal gaits for robotic platforms, a domain predominantly governed by model-based trajectory optimization methods. We propose an innovative, reference-free reinforcement learning framework that exploits the intrinsic symmetries of dynamic systems to synthesize a broad array of naturalistic quadrupedal locomotion patterns. By capitalizing on distinct symmetry characteristics - namely temporal, morphological, and time-reversal - our approach efficiently facilitates the generation and transition among diverse gaits such as pronking, bounding half-bounding and galloping, across a spectrum of velocities, circumventing the necessity for expert-generated trajectories or complex reward structures. Implemented on the Petoi Bittle robotic model, our methodology illustrates robust and adaptable gait generation capabilities, significantly broadening the scope for robotic mobility and speed adaptability. This contribution not only advances our comprehension of quadrupedal locomotion mechanisms but also underscores the pivotal role of symmetry in the development of scalable and effective robotic gait strategies. Our findings hold substantial implications for robotic design and control, potentially enhancing operational versatility and efficiency across a variety of deployment environments.</description>

      <title>Toward Enhanced Reinforcement Learning-Based Resource Management via Digital Twin: Opportunities, Applications, and Challenges</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07857v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article presents a digital twin (DT)-enhanced reinforcement learning (RL) framework aimed at optimizing performance and reliability in network resource management, since the traditional RL methods face several unified challenges when applied to physical networks, including limited exploration efficiency, slow convergence, poor long-term performance, and safety concerns during the exploration phase. To deal with the above challenges, a comprehensive DT-based framework is proposed to enhance the convergence speed and performance for unified RL-based resource management. The proposed framework provides safe action exploration, more accurate estimates of long-term returns, faster training convergence, higher convergence performance, and real-time adaptation to varying network conditions. Then, two case studies on ultra-reliable and low-latency communication (URLLC) services and multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) network are presented, demonstrating improvements of the proposed framework in performance, convergence speed, and training cost reduction both on traditional RL and neural network based Deep RL (DRL). Finally, the article identifies and explores some of the research challenges and open issues in this rapidly evolving field.</description>

      <title>Green UAV-enabled Internet-of-Things Network with AI-assisted NOMA for Disaster Management</title>

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted communication is becoming a streamlined technology in providing improved coverage to the internet-of-things (IoT) based devices. Rapid deployment, portability, and flexibility are some of the fundamental characteristics of UAVs, which make them ideal for effectively managing emergency-based IoT applications. This paper studies a UAV-assisted wireless IoT network relying on non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) to facilitate uplink connectivity for devices spread over a disaster region. The UAV setup is capable of relaying the information to the cellular base station (BS) using decode and forward relay protocol. By jointly utilizing the concepts of unsupervised machine learning (ML) and solving the resulting non-convex problem, we can maximize the total energy efficiency (EE) of IoT devices spread over a disaster region. Our proposed approach uses a combination of k-medoids and Silhouette analysis to perform resource allocation, whereas, power optimization is performed using iterative methods. In comparison to the exhaustive search method, our proposed scheme solves the EE maximization problem with much lower complexity and at the same time improves the overall energy consumption of the IoT devices. Moreover, in comparison to a modified version of greedy algorithm, our proposed approach improves the total EE of the system by 19% for a fixed 50k target number of bits.</description>

Abstract: This study confronts the growing challenges of energy consumption and the depletion of energy resources, particularly in the context of smart buildings. As the demand for energy increases alongside the necessity for efficient building maintenance, it becomes imperative to explore innovative energy management solutions. We present a comprehensive review of Internet of Things (IoT)-based frameworks aimed at smart city energy management, highlighting the pivotal role of IoT devices in addressing these issues due to their compactness, sensing, measurement, and computing capabilities. Our review methodology encompasses a thorough analysis of existing literature on IoT architectures and frameworks for intelligent energy management applications. We focus on systems that not only collect and store data but also support intelligent analysis for monitoring, controlling, and enhancing system efficiency. Additionally, we examine the potential for these frameworks to serve as platforms for the development of third-party applications, thereby extending their utility and adaptability. The findings from our review indicate that IoT-based frameworks offer significant potential to reduce energy consumption and environmental impact in smart buildings. Through the adoption of intelligent mechanisms and solutions, these frameworks facilitate effective energy management, leading to improved system efficiency and sustainability. Considering these findings, we recommend further exploration and adoption of IoT-based wireless sensing systems in smart buildings as a strategic approach to energy management. Our review underscores the importance of incorporating intelligent analysis and enabling the development of third-party applications within the IoT framework to efficiently meet the evolving energy demands and maintenance challenges</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Constrained Reinforcement Learning with Formal Interpretability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.07084v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning can provide effective reasoning for sequential decision-making problems with variable dynamics. Such reasoning in practical implementation, however, poses a persistent challenge in interpreting the reward function and the corresponding optimal policy. Consequently, representing sequential decision-making problems as probabilistic inference can have considerable value, as, in principle, the inference offers diverse and powerful mathematical tools to infer the stochastic dynamics whilst suggesting a probabilistic interpretation of policy optimization. In this study, we propose a novel Adaptive Wasserstein Variational Optimization, namely AWaVO, to tackle these interpretability challenges. Our approach uses formal methods to achieve the interpretability for convergence guarantee, training transparency, and intrinsic decision-interpretation. To demonstrate its practicality, we showcase guaranteed interpretability with an optimal global convergence rate in simulation and in practical quadrotor tasks. In comparison with state-of-the-art benchmarks including TRPO-IPO, PCPO and CRPO, we empirically verify that AWaVO offers a reasonable trade-off between high performance and sufficient interpretability.</description>

      <title>A cutting-surface consensus approach for distributed robust optimization of multi-agent systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.03519v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A novel and fully distributed optimization method is proposed for the distributed robust convex program (DRCP) over a time-varying unbalanced directed network under the uniformly jointly strongly connected (UJSC) assumption. Firstly, a tractable approximated DRCP (ADRCP) is introduced by discretizing the semi-infinite constraints into a finite number of inequality constraints and restricting the right-hand side of the constraints with a positive parameter. This problem is iteratively solved by a distributed projected gradient algorithm proposed in this paper, which is based on epigraphic reformulation and subgradient projected algorithms. Secondly, a cutting-surface consensus approach is proposed for locating an approximately optimal consensus solution of the DRCP with guaranteed feasibility. This approach is based on iteratively approximating the DRCP by successively reducing the restriction parameter of the right-hand constraints and populating the cutting-surfaces into the existing finite set of constraints. Thirdly, to ensure finite-time termination of the distributed optimization, a distributed termination algorithm is developed based on consensus and zeroth-order stopping conditions under UJSC graphs. Fourthly, it is proved that the cutting-surface consensus approach terminates finitely and yields a feasible and approximate optimal solution for each agent. Finally, the effectiveness of the approach is illustrated through a numerical example.</description>

      <title>Structural Controllability of Bilinear Systems on $\mathbb{SE(n)}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.00589v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Structural controllability challenges arise from imprecise system modeling and system interconnections in large scale systems. In this paper, we study structural control of bilinear systems on the special Euclidean group. We employ graph theoretic methods to analyze the structural controllability problem for driftless bilinear systems and structural accessibility for bilinear systems with drift. This facilitates the identification of a sparsest pattern necessary for achieving structural controllability and discerning redundant connections. To obtain a graph theoretic characterization of structural controllability and accessibility on the special Euclidean group, we introduce a novel idea of solid and broken edges on graphs; subsequently, we use the notion of transitive closure of graphs.</description>

      <title>Towards Safe Multi-Task Bayesian Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.07281v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bayesian optimization has emerged as a highly effective tool for the safe online optimization of systems, due to its high sample efficiency and noise robustness. To further enhance its efficiency, reduced physical models of the system can be incorporated into the optimization process, accelerating it. These models are able to offer an approximation of the actual system, and evaluating them is significantly cheaper. The similarity between the model and reality is represented by additional hyperparameters, which are learned within the optimization process. Safety is a crucial criterion for online optimization methods such as Bayesian optimization, which has been addressed by recent works that provide safety guarantees under the assumption of known hyperparameters. In practice, however, this does not apply. Therefore, we extend the robust Gaussian process uniform error bounds to meet the multi-task setting, which involves the calculation of a confidence region from the hyperparameter posterior distribution utilizing Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. Subsequently, the robust safety bounds are employed to facilitate the safe optimization of the system, while incorporating measurements of the models. Simulation results indicate that the optimization can be significantly accelerated for expensive to evaluate functions in comparison to other state-of-the-art safe Bayesian optimization methods, contingent on the fidelity of the models.</description>

      <title>$H_{\infty}$-Optimal Estimator Synthesis for Coupled Linear 2D PDEs using Convex Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05061v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Any suitably well-posed PDE in two spatial dimensions can be represented as a Partial Integral Equation (PIE) -- with system dynamics parameterized using Partial Integral (PI) operators. Furthermore, $L_2$-gain analysis of PDEs with a PIE representation can be posed as a linear operator inequality, which can be solved using convex optimization. In this paper, these results are used to derive a convex-optimization-based test for constructing an $H_{\infty}$-optimal estimator for 2D PDEs. In particular, we first use PIEs to represent an arbitrary well-posed 2D PDE where sensor measurements occur along some boundary of the domain. An associated Luenberger-type estimator is then parameterized using a PI operator $\mathcal{L}$ as the observer gain. Examining the error dynamics of this estimator, it is proven that an upper bound on the $H_{\infty}$-norm of these error dynamics can be minimized by solving a linear operator inequality on PI operator variables. Finally, an analytical formula is proposed for inversion of a class of 2D PI operators, which is then used to reconstruct the Luenberger gain $\mathcal{L}$. Results are implemented in the PIETOOLS software suite -- applying the methodology and simulating the resulting observer for an unstable 2D heat equation with boundary observations.</description>

      <title>Auto-Encoding Bayesian Inverse Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08902v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When multiple agents interact in a common environment, each agent's actions impact others' future decisions, and noncooperative dynamic games naturally capture this coupling. In interactive motion planning, however, agents typically do not have access to a complete model of the game, e.g., due to unknown objectives of other players. Therefore, we consider the inverse game problem, in which some properties of the game are unknown a priori and must be inferred from observations. Existing maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) approaches to solve inverse games provide only point estimates of unknown parameters without quantifying uncertainty, and perform poorly when many parameter values explain the observed behavior. To address these limitations, we take a Bayesian perspective and construct posterior distributions of game parameters. To render inference tractable, we employ a variational autoencoder (VAE) with an embedded differentiable game solver. This structured VAE can be trained from an unlabeled dataset of observed interactions, naturally handles continuous, multi-modal distributions, and supports efficient sampling from the inferred posteriors without computing game solutions at runtime. Extensive evaluations in simulated driving scenarios demonstrate that the proposed approach successfully learns the prior and posterior game parameter distributions, provides more accurate objective estimates than MLE baselines, and facilitates safer and more efficient game-theoretic motion planning.</description>

      <title>Schr\"{o}dinger Bridge with Quadratic State Cost is Exactly Solvable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00503v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Schr\"odinger bridge is a diffusion process that steers a given distribution to another in a prescribed time while minimizing the effort to do so. It can be seen as the stochastic dynamical version of the optimal mass transport, and has growing applications in generative diffusion models and stochastic optimal control. In this work, we propose a regularized variant of the Schr\"odinger bridge with a quadratic state cost-to-go that incentivizes the optimal sample paths to stay close to a nominal level. Unlike the conventional Schr\"odinger bridge, the regularization induces a state-dependent rate of killing and creation of probability mass, and its solution requires determining the Markov kernel of a reaction-diffusion partial differential equation. We derive this Markov kernel in closed form. Our solution recovers the heat kernel in the vanishing regularization (i.e., diffusion without reaction) limit, thereby recovering the solution of the conventional Schr\"odinger bridge. Our results enable the use of dynamic Sinkhorn recursion for computing the Schr\"odinger bridge with a quadratic state cost-to-go, which would otherwise be challenging to use in this setting. We deduce properties of the new kernel and explain its connections with certain exactly solvable models in quantum mechanics.</description>
