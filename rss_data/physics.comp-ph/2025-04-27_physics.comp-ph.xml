      <title>Enhanced Sampling, Public Dataset and Generative Model for Drug-Protein Dissociation Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Drug-protein binding and dissociation dynamics are fundamental to understanding molecular interactions in biological systems. While many tools for drug-protein interaction studies have emerged, especially artificial intelligence (AI)-based generative models, predictive tools on binding/dissociation kinetics and dynamics are still limited. We propose a novel research paradigm that combines molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, enhanced sampling, and AI generative models to address this issue. We propose an enhanced sampling strategy to efficiently implement the drug-protein dissociation process in MD simulations and estimate the free energy surface (FES). We constructed a program pipeline of MD simulations based on this sampling strategy, thus generating a dataset including 26,612 drug-protein dissociation trajectories containing about 13 million frames. We named this dissociation dynamics dataset DD-13M and used it to train a deep equivariant generative model UnbindingFlow, which can generate collision-free dissociation trajectories. The DD-13M database and UnbindingFlow model represent a significant advancement in computational structural biology, and we anticipate its broad applicability in machine learning studies of drug-protein interactions. Our ongoing efforts focus on expanding this methodology to encompass a broader spectrum of drug-protein complexes and exploring novel applications in pathway prediction.</description>

      <title>Supporting Higher-Order Interactions in Practical Ising Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ising machines as hardware solvers of combinatorial optimization problems (COPs) can efficiently explore large solution spaces due to their inherent parallelism and physics-based dynamics. Many important COP classes such as satisfiability (SAT) assume arbitrary interactions between problem variables, while most Ising machines only support pairwise (second-order) interactions. This necessitates translation of higher-order interactions to pair-wise, which typically results in extra variables not corresponding to problem variables, and a larger problem for the Ising machine to solve than the original problem. This in turn can significantly increase time-to-solution and/or degrade solution accuracy. In this paper, considering a representative CMOS-compatible class of Ising machines, we propose a practical design to enable direct hardware support for higher order interactions. By minimizing the overhead of problem translation and mapping, our design leads to up to 4x lower time-to-solution without compromising solution accuracy.</description>

      <title>Statistical noise enhances quantumness benefits in spin-network quantum reservoir computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum reservoir computing offers a promising approach to the utilization of complex quantum dynamics in machine learning. Statistical noise inevitably arises in real settings of quantum reservoir computing (QRC) due to the practical necessity of taking a small to moderate number of measurements. We investigate the effect of statistical noise in spin-network QRC on the possible performance benefits conferred by quantumness. As our measures of quantumness, we employ both quantum entanglement, which we quantify by the partial transpose of the density matrix, and coherence, which we quantify as the sum of the absolute values of the off-diagonal elements of the density matrix. We find that reservoirs which enjoy a finite degree of quantum entanglement and coherence are more stable against the adverse effects of statistical noise on performance compared to their unentangled, incoherent counterparts. Our results indicate that the potential benefit reservoir computers may derive from quantumness depends on the number of measurements used for training and testing, and may indeed be enhanced by statistical noise. These findings not only emphasize the importance of incorporating realistic noise models, but also suggest that the search for quantum advantage may be aided rather than impeded by the practical constraints of implementation within existing machines.</description>

      <title>FlexPINN: Modeling Fluid Dynamics and Mass Transfer in 3D Micromixer Geometries Using a Flexible Physics-Informed Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17896v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, fluid flow and concentration distribution inside a 3D T-shaped micromixer with various fin shapes and configurations are investigated using a Flexible Physics-Informed Neural Network (FlexPINN), which includes modifications over the vanilla PINN architecture. Three types of fins (rectangular, elliptical, and triangular) are considered to evaluate the influence of fin geometry, along with four different fin configurations inside the 3D channel to examine the effect of placement. The simulations are conducted at four Reynolds numbers: 5, 20, 40, and 80, in both single-unit (four fins) and double-unit (eight fins) configurations. The goal is to assess pressure drop coefficient, mixing index, and mixing efficiency using the FlexPINN method. Given the challenges in simulating 3D problems with standard PINN, several improvements are introduced. The governing equations are injected into the network as first-order, dimensionless derivatives to enhance accuracy. Transfer learning is used to reduce computational cost, and adaptive loss weighting is applied to improve convergence compared to the vanilla PINN approach. These modifications enable a consistent and flexible architecture that can be used across numerous tested cases. Using the proposed FlexPINN method, the pressure drop coefficient and mixing index are predicted with maximum errors of 3.25% and 2.86%, respectively, compared to Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) results. Among all the tested cases, the rectangular fin with configuration C in the double-unit setup at Reynolds number 40 shows the highest mixing efficiency, reaching a value of 1.63. The FlexPINN framework demonstrates strong capabilities in simulating fluid flow and species transport in complex 3D geometries.</description>

      <title>A hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin method with transmission variables for time-harmonic acoustic problems in heterogeneous media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the finite element solution of time-harmonic wave propagation problems in heterogeneous media with hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) methods. In the case of homogeneous media, it has been observed that the iterative solution of the linear system can be accelerated by hybridizing with transmission variables instead of numerical traces, as performed in standard approaches. In this work, we extend the HDG method with transmission variables, which is called the CHDG method, to the heterogeneous case with piecewise constant physical coefficients. In particular, we consider formulations with standard upwind and general symmetric fluxes. The CHDG hybridized system can be written as a fixed-point problem, which can be solved with stationary iterative schemes for a class of symmetric fluxes. The standard HDG and CHDG methods are systematically studied with the different numerical fluxes by considering a series of 2D numerical benchmarks. The convergence of standard iterative schemes is always faster with the extended CHDG method than with the standard HDG methods, with upwind and scalar symmetric fluxes.</description>

      <title>Interface phonon modes governing the ideal limit of thermal transport across diamond/cubic boron nitride interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18473v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the ideal limit of interfacial thermal conductance (ITC) across semiconductor heterointerfaces is crucial for optimizing heat dissipation in practical applications. By employing a highly accurate and efficient machine-learned potential trained herein, we perform extensive non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the ITC of diamond/cubic boron nitride ($c$BN) interfaces. The ideal diamond/$c$BN interface exhibits an unprecedented ITC of 11.0 $\pm$ 0.1 GW m$^{-2}$ K$^{-1}$, setting a new upper bound for heterostructure interfaces. This exceptional conductance originates from extended phonon modes due to acoustic matching and localized C-atom modes that propagate through B-C bonds. However, atomic diffusion across the ideal interface creates mixing layers that disrupt these characteristic phonon modes, substantially suppressing the thermal transport from its ideal limit. Our findings reveal how interface phonon modes govern thermal transport across diamond/$c$BN interfaces, providing insights for thermal management in semiconductor devices.</description>

      <title>PODNO: Proper Orthogonal Decomposition Neural Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Proper Orthogonal Decomposition Neural Operators (PODNO) for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) dominated by high-frequency components. Building on the structure of Fourier Neural Operators (FNO), PODNO replaces the Fourier transform with (inverse) orthonormal transforms derived from the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) method to construct the integral kernel. Due to the optimality of POD basis, the PODNO has potential to outperform FNO in both accuracy and computational efficiency for high-frequency problems. From analysis point of view, we established the universality of a generalization of PODNO, termed as Generalized Spectral Operator (GSO). In addition, we evaluate PODNO's performance numerically on dispersive equations such as the Nonlinear Schrodinger (NLS) equation and the Kadomtsev-Petviashvili (KP) equation.</description>

      <title>EquiNO: A Physics-Informed Neural Operator for Multiscale Simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07976v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multiscale problems are ubiquitous in physics. Numerical simulations of such problems by solving partial differential equations (PDEs) at high resolution are computationally too expensive for many-query scenarios, e.g., uncertainty quantification, remeshing applications, topology optimization, and so forth. This limitation has motivated the application of data-driven surrogate models, where the microscale computations are $\textit{substituted}$ with a surrogate, usually acting as a black-box mapping between macroscale quantities. These models offer significant speedups but struggle with incorporating microscale physical constraints, such as the balance of linear momentum and constitutive models. In this contribution, we propose Equilibrium Neural Operator (EquiNO) as a $\textit{complementary}$ physics-informed PDE surrogate for predicting microscale physics and compare it with variational physics-informed neural and operator networks. Our framework, applicable to the so-called multiscale FE$^{\,2}\,$ computations, introduces the FE-OL approach by integrating the finite element (FE) method with operator learning (OL). We apply the proposed FE-OL approach to quasi-static problems of solid mechanics. The results demonstrate that FE-OL can yield accurate solutions even when confronted with a restricted dataset during model development. Our results show that EquiNO achieves speedup factors exceeding 8000-fold compared to traditional methods and offers an optimal balance between data-driven and physics-based strategies.</description>

      <title>A Data-Driven Based Concurrent Coupling Approach for Cryogenic Propellant Tank Long-term Pressure Control Predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08676v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The design and optimization of cryogenic propellant storage tanks for NASA's future space missions require fast and accurate predictions of long-term fluid behaviors. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) techniques are high-fidelity but computationally prohibitive. Coarse mesh nodal techniques are fast but heavily rely on empirical correlations to capture prominent three-dimensional phenomena. A data-driven based concurrent coupling (DCC) approach has been developed to integrate CFD with nodal techniques for efficient and accurate analysis. This concurrent coupling scheme generates case-specific correlations on the fly through a short period of co-solving CFD and nodal simulations, followed by a long-period nodal simulation with CFD-corrected solutions. This paper presents the approach development, stability analysis, and efficiency demonstration, specifically for modeling two-phase cryogenic propellant tank self-pressurization and periodic mixing phenomena. Linear regression is employed to derive the data-driven correlations. The self-pressurization experiments of Multipurpose Hydrogen Test Bed experiments and K-Site tank are used to validate the approach. The DCC approach accurately predicts temperature stratifications while reducing computational time by as much as 70% compared to pure CFD simulations. Additionally, the DCC approach mitigates the risks of numerical instability and correlation loss inherent in current domain decomposition or overlapping-based coupling methods, making it a flexible and user-friendly approach for integrated CFD and nodal analysis of cryogenic tank behaviors.</description>

Abstract: As fusion energy devices advance, plasma simulations are crucial for reactor design. Our work extends BIT1 hybrid parallelization by integrating MPI with OpenMP and OpenACC, focusing on asynchronous multi-GPU programming. Results show significant performance gains: 16 MPI ranks plus OpenMP threads reduced runtime by 53% on a petascale EuroHPC supercomputer, while OpenACC multicore achieved a 58% reduction. At 64 MPI ranks, OpenACC outperformed OpenMP, improving the particle mover function by 24%. On MareNostrum 5, OpenACC async(n) delivered strong performance, but OpenMP asynchronous multi-GPU approach proved more effective at extreme scaling, maintaining efficiency up to 400 GPUs. Speedup and parallel efficiency (PE) studies revealed OpenMP asynchronous multi-GPU achieving 8.77x speedup (54.81% PE), surpassing OpenACC (8.14x speedup, 50.87% PE). While PE declined at high node counts due to communication overhead, asynchronous execution mitigated scalability bottlenecks. OpenMP nowait and depend clauses improved GPU performance via efficient data transfer and task management. Using NVIDIA Nsight tools, we confirmed BIT1 efficiency for large-scale plasma simulations. OpenMP asynchronous multi-GPU implementation delivered exceptional performance in portability, high throughput, and GPU utilization, positioning BIT1 for exascale supercomputing and advancing fusion energy research. MareNostrum 5 brings us closer to achieving exascale performance.</description>

      <title>Pinning control of chimera states in systems with higher-order interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02658v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding and controlling the mechanisms behind synchronization phenomena is of paramount importance in nonlinear science. In particular, the emergence of chimera states, patterns in which order and disorder coexist simultaneously, continues to puzzle scholars, due to its elusive nature. Recently, it has been shown that higher-order (many-body) interactions greatly enhance the presence of chimera states, which are easier to be found and more persistent. In this work, we show that the higher-order framework is fertile not only for the emergence of chimera states, but also for its control. Via pinning control, a technique consisting in applying a forcing to a subset of the nodes, we are able to trigger the emergence of chimera states with only a small fraction of controlled nodes, at striking contrast with the case without higher-order interactions. We show that our setting is robust for different higher-order topologies and types of pinning control and, finally, we give a heuristic interpretation of the results via phase reduction theory. Our numerical and theoretical results provide further understanding on how higher-order interactions shape collective behaviors in nonlinear dynamics.</description>

      <title>Projection-based Reduced Order Modelling for Unsteady Parametrized Optimal Control Problems in 3D Cardiovascular Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20828v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a projection-based reduced order modelling (ROM) framework for unsteady parametrized optimal control problems (OCP$_{(\mu)}$s) arising from cardiovascular (CV) applications. In real-life scenarios, accurately defining outflow boundary conditions in patient-specific models poses significant challenges due to complex vascular morphologies, physiological conditions, and high computational demands. These challenges make it difficult to compute realistic and reliable CV hemodynamics by incorporating clinical data such as 4D magnetic resonance imaging. To address these challenges, we focus on controlling the outflow boundary conditions to optimize CV flow dynamics and minimize the discrepancy between target and computed flow velocity profiles. The fluid flow is governed by unsteady Navier--Stokes equations with physical parametric dependence, i.e. the Reynolds number. Numerical solutions of OCP$_{(\mu)}$s require substantial computational resources, highlighting the need for robust and efficient ROMs to perform real-time and many-query simulations. Here, we aim at investigating the performance of a projection-based reduction technique that relies on the offline-online paradigm, enabling significant computational cost savings. The Galerkin finite element method is used to compute the high-fidelity solutions in the offline phase. We implemented a nested-proper orthogonal decomposition (nested-POD) for fast simulation of OCP$_{(\mu)}$s that encompasses two stages: temporal compression for reducing dimensionality in time, followed by parametric-space compression on the precomputed POD modes. We tested the efficacy of the methodology on vascular models, namely an idealized bifurcation geometry and a patient-specific coronary artery bypass graft, incorporating stress control at the outflow boundary, observing consistent speed-up with respect to high-fidelity strategies.</description>

      <title>Influence of noise-induced modulations on the timing stability of passively mode-locked semiconductor laser subject to optical feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02049v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that passively mode-locked lasers subject to feedback from a single external cavity can exhibit large timing fluctuations on short time scales despite having a relatively small long-term timing jitter, meaning that the commonly used von Linde and K\'{e}f\'{e}lian techniques of experimentally estimating the timing jitter can lead to large errors in the estimation of the arrival time of pulses. We also show that adding a second feedback cavity of the appropriate length can significantly suppress noise-induced modulations that are present in the single feedback system. This reduces the short time scale fluctuations of the interspike interval time and at the same time improves the variance of the fluctuation of the pulse arrival times on long time scales.</description>

Abstract: The Fokker-Planck equation describing the transport of energetic particles interacting with turbulence is difficult to solve analytically. Numerical solutions are of course possible but they are not always useful for applications. In the past a subspace approximation was proposed which allows to compute important quantities such as the characteristic function as well as certain expectation values. This previous approach was applied to solve the one-dimensional Fokker-Planck equation which contains only a pitch-angle scattering term. In the current paper we extend this approach in order to solve the Fokker-Planck equation with a focusing term. We employ two- and three-dimensional subspace approximations to achieve a pure analytical description of particle transport. Additionally, we show that with higher dimensions, the subspace method can be used as a hybrid analytical-numerical method which produces an accurate approximation. Although the latter approach does not lead to analytical results, it is much faster compared to pure numerical solutions of the considered transport equation.</description>

      <title>Equi-Euler GraphNet: An Equivariant, Temporal-Dynamics Informed Graph Neural Network for Dual Force and Trajectory Prediction in Multi-Body Systems</title>

Abstract: Accurate real-time modeling of multi-body dynamical systems is essential for enabling digital twin applications across industries. While many data-driven approaches aim to learn system dynamics, jointly predicting internal loads and system trajectories remains a key challenge. This dual prediction is especially important for fault detection and predictive maintenance, where internal loads-such as contact forces-act as early indicators of faults, reflecting wear or misalignment before affecting motion. These forces also serve as inputs to degradation models (e.g., crack growth), enabling damage prediction and remaining useful life estimation. We propose Equi-Euler GraphNet, a physics-informed graph neural network (GNN) that simultaneously predicts internal forces and global trajectories in multi-body systems. In this mesh-free framework, nodes represent system components and edges encode interactions. Equi-Euler GraphNet introduces two inductive biases: (1) an equivariant message-passing scheme, interpreting edge messages as interaction forces consistent under Euclidean transformations; and (2) a temporal-aware iterative node update mechanism, based on Euler integration, to capture influence of distant interactions over time. Tailored for cylindrical roller bearings, it decouples ring dynamics from constrained motion of rolling elements. Trained on high-fidelity multiphysics simulations, Equi-Euler GraphNet generalizes beyond the training distribution, accurately predicting loads and trajectories under unseen speeds, loads, and configurations. It outperforms state-of-the-art GNNs focused on trajectory prediction, delivering stable rollouts over thousands of time steps with minimal error accumulation. Achieving up to a 200x speedup over conventional solvers while maintaining comparable accuracy, it serves as an efficient reduced-order model for digital twins, design, and maintenance.</description>
