      <title>PALMA: A Lightweight Tropical Algebra Library for ARM-Based Embedded Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tropical algebra, including max-plus, min-plus, and related idempotent semirings, provides a unifying framework in which many optimization problems that are nonlinear in classical algebra become linear. This property makes tropical methods particularly well suited for shortest paths, scheduling, throughput analysis, and discrete event systems. Despite their theoretical maturity and practical relevance, existing tropical algebra implementations primarily target desktop or server environments and remain largely inaccessible on resource-constrained embedded platforms, where such optimization problems are most acute. We present PALMA (Parallel Algebra Library for Max-plus Applications), a lightweight, dependency-free C library that brings tropical linear algebra to ARM-based embedded systems. PALMA implements a generic semiring abstraction with SIMD-accelerated kernels, enabling a single computational framework to support shortest paths, bottleneck paths, reachability, scheduling, and throughput analysis. The library supports five tropical semirings, dense and sparse (CSR) representations, tropical closure, and spectral analysis via maximum cycle mean computation. We evaluate PALMA on a Raspberry Pi 4 and demonstrate peak performance of 2,274 MOPS, speedups of up to 11.9 times over classical Bellman-Ford for single-source shortest paths, and sub-10 microsecond scheduling solves for real-time control workloads. Case studies in UAV control, IoT routing, and manufacturing systems show that tropical algebra enables efficient, predictable, and unified optimization directly on embedded hardware. PALMA is released as open-source software under the MIT license.</description>

      <title>Odd but Error-Free FastTwoSum: More General Conditions for FastTwoSum as an Error-Free Transformation for Faithful Rounding Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes sufficient, yet more general conditions for applying FastTwoSum as an error-free transformation (EFT) under all faithful rounding modes. Additionally, it also identifies guarantees tailored to round-to-odd for establishing FastTwoSum as an EFT. This paper also describes a floating-point splitting tailored for round-to-odd that is an EFT where the distribution of bits is configurable (i.e., ExtractScalar for round-to-odd). Our sufficient conditions are much more general than those previously known in the literature (i.e., it applies to a wider operand domain).</description>

      <title>An Efficient Batch Solver for the Singular Value Decomposition on GPUs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The singular value decomposition (SVD) is a powerful tool in modern numerical linear algebra, which underpins computational methods such as principal component analysis (PCA), low-rank approximations, and randomized algorithms. Many practical scenarios require solving numerous small SVD problems, a regime generally referred to as "batch SVD". Existing programming models can handle this efficiently on parallel CPU architectures, but high-performance solutions for GPUs remain immature. A GPU-oriented batch SVD solver is introduced. This solver exploits the one-sided Jacobi algorithm to exploit fine-grained parallelism, and a number of algorithmic and design optimizations achieve unmatched performance. Starting from a baseline solver, a sequence of optimizations is applied to obtain incremental performance gains. Numerical experiments show that the new solver is robust across problems with different numerical properties, matrix shapes, and arithmetic precisions. Performance benchmarks on both NVIDIA and AMD systems show significant performance speedups over vendor solutions as well as existing open-source solvers.</description>

      <title>High-Order Mesh r-Adaptivity with Tangential Relaxation and Guaranteed Mesh Validity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-order meshes are crucial for achieving optimal convergence rates in curvilinear domains, preserving symmetry, and aligning with key flow features in moving mesh simulations, but their quality is challenging to control. In prior work, we have developed techniques based on Target-Matrix Optimization Paradigm (TMOP) to adapt a given high-order mesh to the geometry and solution of the partial differential equation (PDE). Here, we extend this framework to address two key gaps in the literature for high-order mesh r-adaptivity. First, we introduce tangential relaxation on curved surfaces using solely the discrete mesh representation, eliminating the need for access to underlying geometry (e.g., CAD model). Second, we ensure a continuously positive Jacobian determinant throughout the domain. This determinant positivity is essential for using the high-order mesh resulting from r-adaptivity with arbitrary quadrature schemes in simulations. The proposed approach is demonstrated to be robust using a variety of numerical experiments.</description>
