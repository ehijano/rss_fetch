      <title>Two-dimensional Kripke Semantics II: Stability and Completeness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the duality between Kripke and algebraic semantics of intuitionistic and intuitionistic modal logic. We find that there is a certain mismatch between the two semantics, which means that not all algebraic models can be embedded into a Kripke model. This leads to an alternative proposal for a relational semantics, the stable semantics. Instead of an arbitrary partial order, the stable semantics requires a distributive lattice of worlds. We constructively show that the stable semantics is exactly as complete as the algebraic semantics. Categorifying these results leads to a 2-duality between two-dimensional stable semantics and categories of product-preserving presheaves, i.e. models of algebraic theories in the style of Lawvere.</description>

      <title>Shield Synthesis for LTL Modulo Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, Machine Learning (ML) models have achieved remarkable success in various domains. However, these models also tend to demonstrate unsafe behaviors, precluding their deployment in safety-critical systems. To cope with this issue, ample research focuses on developing methods that guarantee the safe behaviour of a given ML model. A prominent example is shielding which incorporates an external component (a "shield") that blocks unwanted behavior. Despite significant progress, shielding suffers from a main setback: it is currently geared towards properties encoded solely in propositional logics (e.g., LTL) and is unsuitable for richer logics. This, in turn, limits the widespread applicability of shielding in many real-world systems. In this work, we address this gap, and extend shielding to LTL modulo theories, by building upon recent advances in reactive synthesis modulo theories. This allowed us to develop a novel approach for generating shields conforming to complex safety specifications in these more expressive, logics. We evaluated our shields and demonstrate their ability to handle rich data with temporal dynamics. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach for synthesizing shields for such expressivity.</description>

      <title>Inductive Generalization in Reinforcement Learning from Specifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel inductive generalization framework for RL from logical specifications. Many interesting tasks in RL environments have a natural inductive structure. These inductive tasks have similar overarching goals but they differ inductively in low-level predicates and distributions. We present a generalization procedure that leverages this inductive relationship to learn a higher-order function, a policy generator, that generates appropriately adapted policies for instances of an inductive task in a zero-shot manner. An evaluation of the proposed approach on a set of challenging control benchmarks demonstrates the promise of our framework in generalizing to unseen policies for long-horizon tasks.</description>

      <title>Mechanized Analysis of Anselm's Modal Ontological Argument</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.08628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.08628v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use a mechanized verification system, PVS, to examine the argument from Anselm's Proslogion Chapter III, the so-called "Modal Ontological Argument." We consider several published formalizations for the argument and show they are all essentially similar. Furthermore, we show that the argument is trivial once the modal axioms are taken into account.
  This work is an illustration of computational philosophy and, in addition, shows how these methods can help detect and rectify errors in modal reasoning.
  This is a minor update with better typesetting and some small addenda to a paper published in the International Journal for Philosophy of Religion, vol. 89, pp. 135--152, April 2021.</description>

      <title>Nested Sequents for Intermediate Logics: The Case of G\"odel-Dummett Logics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.07550v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present nested sequent systems for propositional G\"odel-Dummett logic and its first-order extensions with non-constant and constant domains, built atop nested calculi for intuitionistic logics. To obtain nested systems for these G\"odel-Dummett logics, we introduce a new structural rule, called the "linearity rule," which (bottom-up) operates by linearizing branching structure in a given nested sequent. In addition, an interesting feature of our calculi is the inclusion of reachability rules, which are special logical rules that operate by propagating data and/or checking if data exists along certain paths within a nested sequent. Such rules require us to generalize our nested sequents to include signatures (i.e. finite collections of variables) in the first-order cases, thus giving rise to a generalization of the usual nested sequent formalism. Our calculi exhibit favorable properties, admitting the height-preserving invertibility of every logical rule and the (height-preserving) admissibility of a large collection of structural and reachability rules. We prove all of our systems sound and cut-free complete, and show that syntactic cut-elimination obtains for the intuitionistic systems. We conclude the paper by discussing possible extensions and modifications, putting forth an array of structural rules that could be used to provide a sizable class of intermediate logics with cut-free nested sequent systems.</description>

      <title>Satisfiability Modulo Exponential Integer Arithmetic</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.01501v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: SMT solvers use sophisticated techniques for polynomial (linear or non-linear) integer arithmetic. In contrast, non-polynomial integer arithmetic has mostly been neglected so far. However, in the context of program verification, polynomials are often insufficient to capture the behavior of the analyzed system without resorting to approximations. In the last years, incremental linearization has been applied successfully to satisfiability modulo real arithmetic with transcendental functions. We adapt this approach to an extension of polynomial integer arithmetic with exponential functions. Here, the key challenge is to compute suitable lemmas that eliminate the current model from the search space if it violates the semantics of exponentiation. An empirical evaluation of our implementation shows that our approach is highly effective in practice.</description>

      <title>The Undecidability of Quantified Announcements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15671v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper demonstrates the undecidability of a number of logics with quantification over public announcements: arbitrary public announcement logic (APAL), group announcement logic (GAL), and coalition announcement logic (CAL). In APAL we consider the informative consequences of any announcement, in GAL we consider the informative consequences of a group of agents (this group may be a proper subset of the set of all agents) all of which are simultaneously (and publicly) making known announcements. So this is more restrictive than APAL. Finally, CAL is as GAL except that we now quantify over anything the agents not in that group may announce simultaneously as well. The logic CAL therefore has some features of game logic and of ATL. We show that when there are multiple agents in the language, the satisfiability problem is undecidable for APAL, GAL, and CAL. In the single agent case, the satisfiability problem is decidable for all three logics. This paper corrects an error to the submitted version of Undecidability of Quantified Announcements, identified by Yuta Asami . The nature of the error was in the definition of the formula $cga(X)$ (see Subsection 5.2) which is corrected in this version.</description>

      <title>Verifiably Robust Conformal Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18942v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conformal Prediction (CP) is a popular uncertainty quantification method that provides distribution-free, statistically valid prediction sets, assuming that training and test data are exchangeable. In such a case, CP's prediction sets are guaranteed to cover the (unknown) true test output with a user-specified probability. Nevertheless, this guarantee is violated when the data is subjected to adversarial attacks, which often result in a significant loss of coverage. Recently, several approaches have been put forward to recover CP guarantees in this setting. These approaches leverage variations of randomised smoothing to produce conservative sets which account for the effect of the adversarial perturbations. They are, however, limited in that they only support $\ell^2$-bounded perturbations and classification tasks. This paper introduces VRCP (Verifiably Robust Conformal Prediction), a new framework that leverages recent neural network verification methods to recover coverage guarantees under adversarial attacks. Our VRCP method is the first to support perturbations bounded by arbitrary norms including $\ell^1$, $\ell^2$, and $\ell^\infty$, as well as regression tasks. We evaluate and compare our approach on image classification tasks (CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and TinyImageNet) and regression tasks for deep reinforcement learning environments. In every case, VRCP achieves above nominal coverage and yields significantly more efficient and informative prediction regions than the SotA.</description>

      <title>Characterizations of Monadic Second Order Definable Context-Free Sets of Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.04764v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a characterization of the sets of graphs that are both definable in Counting Monadic Second Order Logic (CMSO) and context-free, i.e., least solutions of Hyperedge-Replacement (HR) grammars introduced by Courcelle and Engelfriet. We prove the equivalence of these sets with: (a) recognizable sets (in the algebra of graphs with HR-operations) of bounded tree-width; we refine this condition further and show equivalence with recognizability in a finitely generated subalgebra of the HR-algebra of graphs; (b) parsable sets, for which there is an MSO-definable transduction from graphs to a set of derivation trees labelled by HR operations, such that the set of graphs is the image of the set of derivation trees under the canonical evaluation of the HR operations; (c) images of recognizable unranked sets of trees under an MSO-definable transduction, whose inverse is also MSO-definable. We rely on a novel connection between two seminal results, a logical characterization of context-free graph languages in terms of tree to graph MSO-definable transductions, by Courcelle and Engelfriet and a proof that an optimal-width tree decomposition of a graph can be built by an MSO-definable transduction, by Bojanczyk and Pilipczuk.</description>
