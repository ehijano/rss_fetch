      <title>Fundamental elements in the development of effective crowd control strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present typical challenges encountered when developing methods for controlling crowds of people (or animal swarms). We discuss which elements shall be considered and the role they play to achieve a robust control in a variety of conditions. In particular, four different studies are reviewed, each of them investigating in detail important elements encountered in crowd steering and control. More specifically synchronization, compliance, crowd (or swarm) density and human perception are studied showing the role they play in combination. Ultimately, the success of a control strategy is determined by carefully considering the effect each element has on individuals, but also on the interactions between them, leading to the creation of a collective behavior. We will also highlight the importance of psychological and cognitive factors when dealing with human crowds, hinting at the fact that automatic control systems may achieve optimal performance, but may be not necessarily well perceived by people in terms of comfort. The discussion aims at showing recent trends and potentialities of crowd control systems, but should also warn on the risk in choosing a solution prioritizing optimization toward people's safety or comfort.</description>

      <title>Synchronization in bus systems with partially overlapping routes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In an increasingly interconnected world, understanding congestion-related phenomena in transportation and their underlying mechanisms is crucial for improving efficiency. As the transportation system becomes denser, different modes of transportation have more opportunities to interact with each other, giving rise to emergent dynamics that simple models cannot explain. In this study, we investigate the synchronized motion of indirectly coupled transportation modes. We develop a numerical simulation model on a one-dimensional periodic lattice, where each point represents a bus station. In this system, two types of buses operate: multiple local buses with non-overlapping routes, each serving a specific zone, and a single global bus that partially overlaps with the routes of the local buses. We perform numerical simulations to examine how close the arrival times of these buses are to each other -- that is, how synchronized their motions are. When the number of zones is two, three, or five, robust synchronization occurs not only between the global bus and the local buses, but also among the local buses themselves. In contrast, no synchronization is found for other numbers of zones. We developed a mathematical model using self-consistent equations and found that two distinct arrival patterns at the terminals must be considered. A stability analysis reveals which pattern is ultimately realized in the simulations. Our results show that transportation modes can exhibit coherent motion even when sharing only partial or no direct route overlaps. This outcome highlights that emergent behavior depends not only on local interactions but is also strongly shaped by the system's overall structural configuration.</description>

      <title>Technical Overview of Recent Developments in Small Modular Reactors in the United States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Small modular reactors (SMRs) are a class of advanced nuclear fission reactors characterized by their compact core size (typically &lt;300 MWe) and passive safety systems. Their modular design enables on-site assembly, making them suitable for deployment in locations inaccessible to conventional large-scale reactors. With rising global energy demand, particularly driven by the growth of AI, SMRs have recently gained attention as a potential solution for powering data centers. This technical review aims to provide the public and relevant stakeholders with a foundational understanding of SMR technology. It begins with an overview of SMR concepts, historical context, and their current role in the U.S. energy mix. Detailed technical summaries of nine selected SMR designs are then presented, covering core design, fuel systems, reactivity control, and safety features. The report also outlines key regulatory frameworks, including 10 CFR Part 50, Part 52, and the technology-inclusive, risk-informed, and performance-based framework currently under development. Finally, major U.S. programs and legislative efforts supporting SMR deployment over the past decade are summarized.</description>

      <title>Cryptocurrency Time Series on the Binary Complexity-Entropy Plane: Ranking Efficiency from the Perspective of Complex Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the first application of a tailored Complexity-Entropy Plane designed for binary sequences and structures. We do so by considering the daily up/down price fluctuations of the largest cryptocurrencies in terms of capitalization (stable-coins excluded) that are worth $circa \,\, 90 \%$ of the total crypto market capitalization. With that, we focus on the basic elements of price motion that compare with the random walk backbone features associated with mathematical properties of the Efficient Market Hypothesis. From the location of each crypto on the Binary Complexity-Plane (BiCEP) we define an inefficiency score, $\mathcal I$, and rank them accordingly. The results based on the BiCEP analysis, which we substantiate with statistical testing, indicate that only Shiba Inu (SHIB) is significantly inefficient, whereas the largest stake of crypto trading is reckoned to operate in close-to-efficient conditions. Generically, our $\mathcal I$-based ranking hints the design and consensus architecture of a crypto is at least as relevant to efficiency as the features that are usually taken into account in the appraisal of the efficiency of financial instruments, namely canonical fiat money. Lastly, this set of results supports the validity of the binary complexity analysis.</description>

      <title>Quantum Key Distribution over Complex Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There exist several initiatives worldwide to deploy quantum key distribution (QKD) over existing fibre networks and achieve quantum-safe security at large scales. To understand the overall QKD network performance, it is required to transition from the analysis of individual links, as done so far, to the characterization of the network as a whole. In this work, we undertake this study by embedding QKD protocols on complex networks, which correctly model the existing fiber networks. We focus on networks with trusted nodes and on continuous-variable (CV) schemes, which have much higher key rates than their discrete-variable (DV) counterparts. In the effective CV network, however, many of the unique properties of complex networks, such as small-worldness and the presence of hubs, are lost due to the fast decay of the key rate with physical distance for CV systems. These properties can be restored when considering a hybrid network consisting of both CV and DV protocols, achieving at the same time high average rate and inter-connectivity. Our work opens the path to the study of QKD complex networks in existing infrastructures.</description>

      <title>A Behaviour and Disease Model of Testing and Isolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02488v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There has been interest in the interactions between infectious disease dynamics and behaviour for most of the history of mathematical epidemiology. This has included consideration of which mathematical models best capture each phenomenon, as well as their interaction, but typically in a manner that is agnostic to the exact behaviour in question. Here, we investigate interacting behaviour and disease dynamics specifically related to behaviours around testing and isolation. This epidemiological-behavioural interaction is of particular interest as, prospectively, it is well-placed to be informed by real-world data temporally monitoring test results and compliance with testing policy. To carry out our investigation we extend an existing "behaviour and disease" (BaD) model by incorporating the dynamics of symptomatic testing and isolation. We provide a dynamical systems analysis of the ordinary differential equations that define this model, providing theoretical results on its behaviour early in a new outbreak (particularly its basic reproduction number) and endemicity of the system (its steady states and associated stability criteria). We then supplement these findings with a numerical analysis to inform how temporal and cumulative outbreak metrics depend on the model parameter values for epidemic and endemic regimes. As the presented interdisciplinary modelling approach can accommodate further extensions (including, but not limited to, adding testing capacity, decay in behavioural effects and multiple pathogen variants), we hope that our work will encourage further modelling studies integrating specific measured behaviours and disease dynamics that may reduce the health and economic impacts of future epidemics.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Trade-off between Infections and Social Interactions Using a Compact Model of Endemic Infections on Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05327v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In many epidemiological and ecological contexts, there is a trade-off between infections and interactions. This arises because the links between individuals capable of spreading infections are also often associated with beneficial activities. Here, we consider how the presence of explicit network structure changes the optimal solution of a class of infection-interaction trade-offs. In order to do this, we develop and analyse a low-dimensional dynamical system approximating the network SIS epidemic. We find that network structure in the form of heterogeneous numbers of contacts can have a significant impact on the optimal number of contacts that comes out of a trade-off model.</description>

      <title>Emergence of network communities driven by local rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17042v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Natural systems are modeled by networks with nodes and links. Often the nodes are segregated into communities with different connectivity patterns. Node heterogeneity such as political affiliation in social networks or biological function in gene networks are highlighted as key factors driving the segregation of nodes into communities. Here I demonstrate that node heterogeneity is not a necessary requirement. To this end I introduce the Ramsey community number, $r_ \kappa$, the minimum graph size that warranties the emergence of network communities with almost certainty. Using the stochastic block model for community detection with correction for degree sequence, I show that networks generated by local rules have finite $r_ \kappa$ values while their randomized versions do not have emergent communities. I conclude that network communities are an emergent property of networks evolving with local rules.</description>

      <title>Fast nonparametric inference of network backbones for weighted graph sparsification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06417v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Network backbones provide useful sparse representations of weighted networks by keeping only their most important links, permitting a range of computational speedups and simplifying network visualizations. A key limitation of existing network backboning methods is that they either require the specification of a free parameter (e.g. significance level) that determines the number of edges to keep in the backbone, or impose specific restrictions on the topology of the backbone (e.g. that it is a spanning tree). Here we develop a completely nonparametric framework for inferring the backbone of a weighted network that overcomes these limitations and automatically selects the optimal set of edges to retain using the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle. We develop objective functions for global and local network backboning which evaluate the importance of an edge in the context of the whole network and individual node neighborhoods respectively and are generalizable to any weight distribution under canonical and microcanonical Bayesian model specifications. We then construct an efficient and provably optimal greedy algorithm to identify the backbone minimizing our objectives for a large class of weight distributions, whose runtime complexity is log-linear in the number of edges. We demonstrate our methods by comparing them with existing methods in a range of tasks on real and synthetic networks, finding that both the global and local backboning methods can preserve network connectivity, weight heterogeneity, and spreading dynamics while removing a substantial fraction of edges.</description>

      <title>Topological Components in a Community Currency Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13674v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transaction data from digital payment systems can be used to study economic processes in such detail that was not possible previously. Here, data from the Sarafu token network, a Community Inclusion Currency in Kenya, is analysed. During the COVID-19 emergency, Sarafu was distributed as part of a humanitarian aid project. In this work, the transactions are analysed using network science. A topological categorisation is defined to identify cyclic and acyclic components. Furthermore, temporal aspects of the circulation that takes place within these components are considered. The significant presence of different types of strongly connected components compared to randomised null models shows the importance of cycles in this economic network. Especially, indicating their key role in currency recirculation. In some acyclic components, the most significant triad suggests the presence of a group of users collecting currency from accounts that are active only once, hinting at a possible misuse of the system. In some other acyclic components, small isolated groups of users were active only once, suggesting the presence of users only interested in trying the system out. The methods used in this paper can answer specific questions related to user activities, currency design, and assessment of monetary interventions. The methodology provides a general quantitative tool to analyse the behaviour of users in a currency network.</description>

      <title>Agent-based modeling for realistic reproduction of human mobility and contact behavior to evaluate test and isolation strategies in epidemic infectious disease spread</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08050v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Agent-based models have proven to be useful tools in supporting decision-making processes in different application domains. The advent of modern computers and supercomputers has enabled these bottom-up approaches to realistically model human mobility and contact behavior. The COVID-19 pandemic showcased the urgent need for detailed and informative models that can answer research questions on transmission dynamics. We present a sophisticated agent-based model to simulate the spread of respiratory diseases. The model is highly modularized and can be used on various scales, from a small collection of buildings up to cities or countries. Although not being the focus of this paper, the model has undergone performance engineering on a single core and provides an efficient intra- and inter-simulation parallelization for time-critical decision-making processes.
  In order to allow answering research questions on individual level resolution, nonpharmaceutical intervention strategies such as face masks or venue closures can be implemented for particular locations or agents. In particular, we allow for sophisticated testing and isolation strategies to study the effects of minimal-invasive infectious disease mitigation. With realistic human mobility patterns for the region of Brunswick, Germany, we study the effects of different interventions between March 1st and May 30, 2021 in the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Our analyses suggest that symptom-independent testing has limited impact on the mitigation of disease dynamics if the dark figure in symptomatic cases is high. Furthermore, we found that quarantine length is more important than quarantine efficiency but that, with sufficient symptomatic control, also short quarantines can have a substantial effect.</description>
