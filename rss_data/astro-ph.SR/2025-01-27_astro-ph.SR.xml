      <title>A theoretical framework for BL Her stars IV. New period-luminosity relations in the Rubin-LSST filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present new theoretical light curves in the Rubin-LSST filters for a fine grid of BL Her models computed using MESA-RSP. We also derive new theoretical period-luminosity (PL) and period-Wesenheit (PW) relations in the Rubin-LSST filters with the goal to study the effect of convection parameters and metallicity on these relations. The grid of BL Her models was computed with the input stellar parameters: metallicity ($-2.0\; \mathrm{dex} \leq \mathrm{[Fe/H]} \leq 0.0\; \mathrm{dex}$), stellar mass ($0.5M_{\odot}-0.8M_{\odot}$), stellar luminosity ($50L_{\odot}-300L_{\odot}$), and effective temperature (across the full extent of the instability strip; in steps of 50K) and using four sets of convection parameters. Bolometric correction tables from MIST were used to transform the theoretical bolometric light curves of the BL Her models into the Rubin-LSST ugrizy filters. The PL relations of the BL Her models exhibit steeper slopes but smaller dispersion with increasing wavelengths in the Rubin-LSST filters. The PL and PW slopes for the complete set of BL Her models computed with radiative cooling (sets B and D) are statistically similar across the grizy filters. The BL Her models exhibit weak or negligible effect of metallicity on the PL relations for wavelengths longer than the g filter for both the cases of the complete set of models as well as the low-mass models. However, we find significant effect of metallicity on the PL relation in the u filter. Strong metallicity effects are observed in the PWZ relations involving the u filter and are found to have significant contribution from the high-metallicity BL Her models. Due to negligible metallicity effect for relations involving the Wesenheit indices $W(i,g-i)$, $W(z,i-z)$ and $W(y,g-y)$, we recommend these filter combinations for BL Her stars when observed with the Rubin-LSST to be used as reliable standard candles.</description>

      <title>Cataclysmic Variables in Triples: Formation Models and New Discoveries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formation of cataclysmic variables (CVs) has long been modeled as a product of common envelope evolution (CEE) in isolated binaries. However, a significant fraction of intermediate-mass stars -- the progenitors of the white dwarfs (WDs) in CVs -- are in triples. We therefore investigate the importance of triple star dynamics in CV formation. Using Gaia astrometry and existing CV catalogs, we construct a sample of $\sim50$ CVs in hierarchical triples within 1 kpc of the Sun, containing main-sequence (MS) and WD tertiaries at separations of 100 - 30,000 au. We infer that at least 10% of CVs host wide tertiaries. To interpret this discovery, we evolve a population of 2000 triples using detailed three-body simulations, 47 of which become CVs. We predict that 20% of CVs in triples form without ever experiencing CEE, where the WD and donor are brought together by the eccentric Kozai-Lidov (EKL) mechanism after the formation of the WD. These systems favor larger donor stars and longer birth orbital periods (8-20 hrs) than typical CVs. Among systems that do undergo CEE, about half would not have interacted without the presence of the tertiary. Triple formation channels both with and without CEE require initially wide inner orbits ($\gtrsim 1$ au), which in turn require larger tertiary separations to be stable. Consistent with this prediction, we find that the observed Gaia CV triples have wider separations on average than normal wide binaries selected in the same way. Our work underscores the importance of triples in shaping interacting binary populations including CVs, ultracompact binaries, and low-mass X-ray binaries.</description>

      <title>Life in the Slow Lane: A Search for Long Term Variability in ASAS-SN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We search a sample of 9,361,613 isolated sources with 13&lt;g&lt;14.5 mag for slowly varying sources. We select sources with brightness changes larger than ~ 0.03 mag/year over 10 years, removing false positives due to, for example, nearby bright stars or high proper motions. After a thorough visual inspection, we find 782 slowly varying systems. Of these systems, 433 are identified as variables for the first time and 349 are previously classified as variables. Previously classified systems were mostly identified as semi-regular variables (SR), slow irregular variables (L), spotted stars (ROT), or unknown (MISC or VAR), as long time scale variability does not fit into a standard class. The stellar sources are scattered across the CMD and can be placed into 5 groups that exhibit distinct behaviors. The largest groups are very red subgiants and lower main sequence stars. There are also a small number of AGN. There are 551 candidates (~70 percent) that also show shorter time scale periodic variability, mostly with periods longer than 10 days. The variability of 191 of these candidates may be related to dust.</description>

      <title>JWST 1.5 {\mu}m and 4.8 {\mu}m Photometry of Y Dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brown dwarfs lack nuclear fusion and cool with time; the coldest known have an effective temperature below 500 K, and are known as Y dwarfs. We present a James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) photometric dataset of Y dwarfs: twenty-three were imaged in wide-field mode, 20 using NIRCam with the F150W and F480M filters, and 3 using NIRISS with the F480M filter. We present an F480M vs. F150W $-$ F480M color-magnitude diagram for our sample, and other brown dwarfs with F150W and F480M colors synthesized from JWST spectra by Beiler et al. (2024). For one target, WISEA J083011.95$+$283716.0, its detection in the near-infrared confirms it as one of the reddest Y dwarfs known, with F150W $-$ F480M $= 9.62$ mag. We provide its updated parallax and proper motion. One of the Beiler et al. Y dwarfs, CWISEP J104756.81+545741.6, is unusually blue, consistent with strong CO absorption seen in its spectrum which the F480M filter is particularly sensitive to. The strong CO and the kinematics of the object suggest it may be very low-mass and young. We update the resolved photometry for the close binary system WISE J033605.05$-$014350.4 AB, and find that the secondary is almost as cold as WISE 085510.83$-$071442.5, with $T_{\rm eff} \lesssim 300$ K, however the F150W $-$ F480M color is significantly bluer, possibly suggesting the presence of water clouds. Astrometry is measured at the JWST epoch for the sample which is consistent with parallax and proper motion values reported by Kirkpatrick et al. (2021) and Marocco et al. (in prep).</description>

      <title>Comparative analysis of two episodes of strongly geoeffective CME events in November and December 2023</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In autumn 2023, a series of closely timed eruptive events were observed remotely and measured in situ. We studied analogous solar events, where several CMEs were launched partly from the same (active) regions near a CH. These events occurred in two episodes, separated by a full solar rotation, covering October 31-November 3 and November 27-28, 2023. Both episodes are linked to strong geomagnetic storms on November 4-5 and December 1-2, 2023. We aim to understand the complexity of these events and how the global magnetic field, solar wind conditions, and structural interactions relate to the observed geomagnetic effects. Using the GCS 3D reconstruction method, we derived each CME's motion direction and speed. These results were input into the DBM with enhanced latitudinal information (3D DBM), aiding in connecting in-situ measurements with solar surface structures for integrated interpretation. The first episode caused SAR arcs, with a three-step Dst index drop to -163 nT on November 5, 2023. Two CME-related shocks arrived close in time, separated by a SBC, followed by a short-duration flux rope-like structure. The second episode saw auroral lights and a two-step Dst index drop to -108 nT on December 1, 2023. A shock from one CME interacted with the magnetic structure of a preceding CME, again combined with an SBC. A clear flux rope structure from the shock-producing CME was detected. Both events showed distinct magnetic field 'ripples' and fluctuations in density and temperature following the SBC. This study compares two episodes of multiple eruptive events in November and December 2023. Interacting CME structures and SBC-related magnetic modulations contributed to the stronger geomagnetic impacts, particularly in the November 4-5, 2023 event. The highly tilted heliospheric current sheet may have further influenced the CMEs' impact at Earth.</description>

      <title>Two almost planetary mass survivors of common envelope evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: White dwarfs are often found in close binaries with stellar or even substellar companions. It is generally thought that these compact binaries form via common envelope evolution, triggered by the progenitor of the white dwarf expanding after it evolved off the main-sequence and engulfing its companion. To date, a handful of white dwarfs in compact binaries with substellar companions have been found, typically with masses greater than around 50 M$_\mathrm{Jup}$. Here we report the discovery of two eclipsing white dwarf plus brown dwarf binaries containing very low mass brown dwarfs. ZTF J1828+2308 consists of a hot ($15900\pm75$ K) $0.610\pm0.004$ M$_{\odot}$ white dwarf in a 2.7 hour binary with a $0.0186\pm0.0008$ M$_{\odot}$ ($19.5\pm0.8$ M$_\mathrm{Jup}$) brown dwarf. ZTF J1230$-$2655 contains a cool ($10000\pm110$ K) $0.65\pm0.02$ M$_{\odot}$ white dwarf in a 5.7 hour binary with a companion that has a mass of less than 0.0211 M$_{\odot}$ (22.1 M$_\mathrm{Jup}$). While the brown dwarf in ZTF J1828+2308 has a radius consistent with its mass and age, ZTF J1230$-$2655 contains a roughly 20 per cent overinflated brown dwarf for its age. We are only able to reconstruct the common envelope phase for either system if it occurred after the first thermal pulse, when the white dwarf progenitor had already lost a significant fraction of its original mass. This is true even for very high common envelope ejection efficiencies ($\alpha_\mathrm{CE}\sim 1$), unless both systems have extremely low metallicities. It may be that the lowest mass companions can only survive a common envelope phase if it occurs at this very late stage.</description>

      <title>The wide binary frequency of metal-poor stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study is aimed at identifying possible low-mass and sub-stellar companions to stars with well-determined metallicities. We investigate the multiplicity of metal-poor stars along with its impact on formation processes in the conditions of the early universe. Our goal is to look for wide common proper motion companions to metal-poor stars and study the binarity frequency at low metallicity with astrometry from large-scale catalogues (Gaia, VHS, and WISE). We used the stellar parameter determination from the latest release of Gaia to identify metal-poor stars over the entire sky. We combined the Gaia sample with other public catalogues and spectroscopic determinations for a given subsample to refine the stellar metallicities. We also considered other public catalogues of metal-poor stars to look for co-moving companions. We obtained our own high-resolution images of a subsample with the lucky imaging technique. We found a few bona fide co-moving systems among a sample of 610 metal-poor stars with metallicities below -1.5 dex in the full sky. We inferred a multiplicity rate below 3%, with 3sigma completeness for projected separations larger than 8 au, after taking into account incompleteness and any other limiting factors of our search. At closer separations, we found a minimum binary fraction of 20% that appears to be relatively independent of metallicity. We conclude that the multiplicity fraction of solar-type stars is relatively independent of metallicity for close-in companions with projected separations below ~8 au. Between 8 and 10000 au, the binary fraction of metal-poor stars drops significantly to a few percent and is significantly lower than the multiplicity derived for the solar-metallicity case. We interpret these similarities and differences as being due to the chemistry at work in molecular clouds as well as disruption effects attributed to the old age of subdwarfs.</description>

      <title>Identification of 30,000 White Dwarf-Main Sequence binaries candidates from Gaia DR3 BP/RP(XP) low-resolution spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: White dwarf-main sequence (WDMS) binary systems are essential probes for understanding binary stellar evolution and play a pivotal role in constraining theoretical models of various transient phenomena. In this study, we construct a catalog of WDMS binaries using Gaia DR3's low-resolution BP/RP (XP) spectra. Our approach integrates a model-independent neural network for spectral modelling with Gaussian Process Classification to accurately identify WDMS binaries among over 10 million stars within 1 kpc. This study identify approximately 30,000 WDMS binary candidates, including ~1,700 high-confidence systems confirmed through spectral fitting. Our technique is shown to be effective at detecting systems where the main-sequence star dominates the spectrum - cases that have historically challenged conventional methods. Validation using GALEX photometry reinforces the reliability of our classifications: 70\% of candidates with an absolute magnitude $M_{G} &gt; 7$ exhibit UV excess, a characteristic signature of white dwarf companions. Our all-sky catalog of WDMS binaries expands the available dataset for studying binary evolution and white dwarf physics and sheds light on the formation of WDMS.</description>

      <title>Improving 1D stellar atmosphere models with insights from multi-dimensional simulations I. 1D vs 2D stratifications and spectral comparison for O stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compare current 1D and multi-dimensional atmosphere modelling approaches for massive stars to understand their strengths and shortcomings. We calculate averaged stratifications from selected 2D calculations for O stars -- corresponding to the spectral types O8, O4, and O2 -- to approximate them with 1D stellar atmosphere models using the PoWR model atmosphere code and assuming a fixed $\beta-$law for the wind regime. We then study the effects of our approximations and assumptions on current spectral diagnostics. In particular, we focus on the impact of an additional turbulent pressure in the subsonic layers of the 1D models. To match the 2D averages, the 1D stellar atmosphere models need to account for turbulent pressure in the hydrostatic equation. Moreover, an adjustment of the connection point between the (quasi-)hydrostatic regime and the wind regime is required. The improvement between the density stratification of 1D model and 2D average can be further increased if the mass-loss rate of the 1D model is not identical to those of the 2D simulation, but typically $\sim0.2\,$dex higher. Especially for the early type star, this implies a significantly more extended envelope with a lower effective temperature. Already the inclusion of a constant turbulence term in the solution of the hydrostatic equation sufficiently reproduces the 2D-averaged model density stratifications. The addition of a significant turbulent motion also smoothens the slope of the radiative acceleration term in the (quasi-)hydrostatic domain, with several potential implications on the total mass-loss rate inferred from 1D modelling. Concerning the spectral synthesis, the addition of a turbulence term in the hydrostatic equation mimics the effect of a lower surface gravity, potentially presenting a solution to the ``mass discrepancy problem'' between the evolutionary and spectroscopy mass determinations.</description>

      <title>Molecular inventory of a young eruptive star's environment -- Case study of the classical FU Orionis star V1057 Cyg</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studying accretion-driven episodic outbursts in YSOs is key to understanding the later stages of star and planet formation. FU Orionis-type objects form a YSO subclass, distinguished by rapid, multi-magnitude increases in brightness at optical and near-infrared wavelengths. These outbursts may significantly impact the chemistry and molecular composition around eruptive stars. However, no comprehensive millimeter-wavelength line survey exists for more evolved (Class II) sources, unlike optical and near-infrared coverage. We conducted the first wideband millimeter spectral line survey of V1057 Cyg, a low-mass eruptive FUor with the highest observed peak accretion rate in its class. Using the IRAM 30-m telescope, we surveyed the 72-263 GHz range and complemented this with targeted spectra at 219, 227, 291, and 344 GHz with the APEX 12-m telescope. We conducted radiative transfer and population diagram analyses to get first estimates of the excitation temperatures and column densities. Several molecular species trace large-scale structures, and the position-velocity diagram of $^{12}$CO suggest episodic outburst activity, with outflow dynamical timescales on the order of tens of thousands of years. We identified simple molecules (C-, N-, O-, and S-bearing), deuterated species, molecular ions, and complex organic molecules. With over 30 molecular species (including isotopologues) detected, V1057 Cyg demonstrates rich chemistry for its evolutionary state, compared to other younger (Class 0/I) FUors. V1057 Cyg is a good candidate for future interferometric studies to resolve emission structures, to possibly constrain molecular freeze-out, and detect water and complex organic molecules. Our results highlight the importance of millimeter line surveys in complementing optical/near-infrared studies, improving statistics on molecular inventories in eruptive stars and their environments.</description>

      <title>Artificial Intelligence Could Have Predicted All Space Weather Events Associated with the May 2024 Superstorm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Space weather, driven by solar flares and Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs), poses significant risks to technological systems. Accurately forecasting these events and their impact on Earth's magnetosphere remains a challenge because of the complexity of solar-terrestrial interactions. This study applied artificial intelligence (AI) to predict the chain of events associated with the May $2024$ superstorm, including solar flares from NOAA active region 13644, Earth-directed CMEs, and a violent geomagnetic storm. Using magnetogram cut-outs, a Vision Transformer was able to classify the evolution of the active region morphologies, and a video-based deep learning method predicted the occurrence of solar flares; a physics-driven model improved the precision of CME travel-time prediction using coronal observations and solar wind measurements; and a data-driven method exploited these in situ measurements to sound alerts of the geomagnetic storm unrolled over time. The results showed unprecedented accuracy in predicting CME arrival with uncertainty as small as one minute. Moreover, these AI models outperformed traditional methods in predicting solar flares occurrences, onset, and recovery phases of the geomagnetic storm. These findings highlight the impressive potential of AI for space weather forecasting and as a tool to mitigate the impact of extreme solar events on critical infrastructure.</description>

      <title>Probing the Limits of Habitability: A Catalog of Rocky Exoplanets in the Habitable Zone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Several ground- and space-based searches have increased the number of known exoplanets to nearly 6000. While most are highly unlike our planet, the first rocky worlds in the Habitable Zone (HZ) provide the most intriguing targets for the search for life in the cosmos. As the detections increase, it is critical to probe the HZ as well as its limits empirically using known exoplanets. However, there is not yet a list of rocky worlds that observers can use to probe the limits of surface habitability. We analyze all known exoplanets and identify 67 rocky worlds in the empirical HZ and 38 in a narrower 3D-model HZ. We compare their demographics with the full catalog of exoplanets, analyze their characteristics, give HZ limits for each system, and prioritize targets for observation. We address another critical dimension to this exploration and compile missing stellar age estimates for these candidates.
  To probe the limits of habitability, we identify several transiting and non-transiting rocky planets that can provide constraints on the inner and outer edge of the HZ, explore how eccentricity influences habitability, and identify the oldest HZ worlds as well as exoplanets with similar flux to modern Earth's. The resulting list of rocky exoplanet targets in the HZ will allow observers to shape and optimize their search strategies with space- and ground-based telescopes -- such as the James Webb Space Telescope, the Extremely Large Telescope, the Habitable Worlds Observatory, and LIFE -- and to design new observing strategies and instruments to explore these intriguing worlds, addressing the question of the limits of surface habitability on exoplanets.</description>

      <title>MINCE III. Detailed chemical analysis of the UVES sample</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. The MINCE (Measuring at Intermediate Metallicity Neutron-Capture Elements) project aims to provide high quality neutron-capture abundances measurements in several hundred stars at intermediate metallicity,-2.5 &lt; [Fe/H] &lt; -1.5. This project will shed light on the origin of the neutron-capture elements and the chemical enrichment of the Milky Way. Aims. The goal of this work is to chemically characterize the second sample of the MINCE project and compare the abundances with the galactic chemical evolution model at our disposal. Methods. We performed a standard abundance analysis based on 1D LTE model atmospheres on high-resolution and high-signal-to-noise-ratio UVES spectra. Results. We provide the kinematic classification (i.e., thin disk, thick disk, thin-to-thick disk, halo, Gaia Sausage Enceladus, Sequoia) of 99 stars and the atmospheric parameters for almost all stars. We derive the abundances for light elements (from Na to Zn) and neutron-capture elements (Rb, Sr, Y, Zr, Ba, La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu) in a subsample of 32 stars in the metallicity range -2.5 &lt; Fe/H] &lt; -1.00. In the subsample of 32 stars, we identify 8 active stars exhibiting (inverse) P-Cygni profile and one Li-rich star, CD 28-11039. We find a general agreement between the chemical abundances and the stochastic model computed for the chemical evolution of the Milky Way halo for the elements Mg, Ca, Si, Ti, Sc, Mn, Co, Ni, Zn, Rb, Sr, Y, Zr, Ba, La, and Eu . Conclusions. The MINCE project has already significantly increased the number of neutron-capture elements measurements in the intermediate metallicity range. The results from this sample are in perfect agreement with the previous MINCE sample. The good agreement between the chemical abundances and the chemical evolution model of the Galaxy supports the nucleosynthetic processes adopted to describe the origin of the n-capture elements.</description>

      <title>ngVLA Synthetic Observations of Ionized Gas in Massive Protostars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14711v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Massive star formation involves significant ionization in the innermost regions near the central object, such as gravitationally trapped H II regions, jets, ionized disks, or winds. Resolved observations of the associated continuum and recombination line emission are crucial for guiding theory. The next-generation Very Large Array (ngVLA) will enable unprecedented observations of thermal emission with 1 mas resolution, providing a new perspective on massive star formation at scales down to a few astronomical units at kiloparsec distances. This work presents synthetic interferometric ngVLA observations of the free-free continuum (93-GHz band), $\mathrm{H41\alpha}$, and $\mathrm{H38\alpha}$ recombination lines from ionized jets and disks around massive protostars. Using the sf3dmodels Python package, we generate gas distributions based on analytical models, which are then processed through the RADMC-3D radiative transfer code. Our results indicate that the ngVLA can easily resolve, both spatially and spectrally, the ionized jet from a 15 $\mathrm{M_\odot}$ protostar at 700 pc, distinguishing between collimated jets and wide-angle winds, and resolving their launching radii, widths, and any substructure down to a few astronomical units. Detailed studies of radio jets launched by massive protostars will be feasible up to distances of $\sim 2$ kpc. Furthermore, ngVLA will be able to study in detail the ionized disks around massive ($&gt; 10~\mathrm{M_\odot}$) protostars up to distances from 4 to 12 kpc, resolving their kinematics and enabling the measurement of their central masses across the Galaxy. These observations can be conducted with on-source integrations of only a few hours.</description>

      <title>Evolution of MHD turbulence in the expanding solar wind: residual energy and intermittency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.12376v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We conduct 3D magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of decaying turbulence in the solar wind context. To account for the spherical expansion of the solar wind, we implement the expanding box model. The initial turbulence comprises uncorrelated counter-propagating Alfv\'en waves and exhibits an isotropic power spectrum. Our findings reveal the consistent generation of negative residual energy whenever nonlinear interactions are present, independent of the normalized cross helicity $\sigma_c$ and compressibility. The spherical expansion facilitates this process. The resulting residual energy is primarily distributed in the perpendicular direction, with $[S_2(\mathbf{b})-S_2(\mathbf{u})] \propto l_\perp$ or equivalently $-E_r \propto k_\perp^{-2}$. Here $S_2(\mathbf{b})$ and $S_2(\mathbf{u})$ are second-order structure functions of magnetic field and velocity respectively. In most runs, $S_2(\mathbf{b})$ develops a scaling relation $S_2(\mathbf{b}) \propto l_\perp^{1/2}$ ($E_b \propto k_\perp^{-3/2}$). In contrast, $S_2(\mathbf{u})$ is consistently shallower than $S_2(\mathbf{b})$, which aligns with in-situ observations of the solar wind. We observe that the higher-order statistics of the turbulence, which act as a proxy for intermittency, depend on the initial $\sigma_c$ and are strongly affected by the expansion effect. Generally, the intermittency is more pronounced when the expansion effect is present. Finally, we find that in our simulations although the negative residual energy and intermittency grow simultaneously as the turbulence evolves, the causal relation between them seems to be weak, possibly because they are generated on different scales.</description>

      <title>Equatorial Enhancement in the Dustiest OH/IR Stars in the Galactic Bulge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02722v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have detected the 10 um silicate feature and the 11.3 um crystalline forsterite feature in absorption in 21 oxygen-rich AGB stars in the Galactic Bulge. The depths of the 10 um feature indicate highly-obscured circumstellar environments. The additional crystalline features may suggest either an extended envelope or dust formation in a high-density environment. We have also modeled the Spectral Energy Distributions of the sample using radiative transfer models, and compared the results to wind speeds measured using 1612 MHz circumstellar OH masers, as well as previous estimates of circumstellar properties. The sixteen sources with measured pulsation periods appear on sequence D of the mid-infrared Period-Luminosity relation, associated with the Long Secondary Period. We suspect that all of these sources are in fact fundamental mode pulsators. At least two sources appear on the fundamental mode sequence when accounting for the dust content. For the remainder, these sources are also likely fundamental mode pulsators with extended envelopes. Taken as a whole, the high optical depths, crystalline features, discrepancies between observed and modeled wind speeds, pulsation periods longer than other fundamental mode pulsators, and SED and pulsation properties similar to those with known equatorially-enhanced circumstellar envelopes (e.g. OH 26.5+0.6 and OH 30.1-0.7) lead us to believe that these sources are likely to be equatorially-enhanced.</description>

      <title>Atmospheric Mass Loss from TOI-1259 A b, a Gas Giant Planet With a White Dwarf Companion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08736v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The lack of close-in Neptune-mass exoplanets evident in transit surveys has largely been attributed either to photoevaporative mass loss or high-eccentricity migration. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we investigate the origins of TOI-1259 A b, a Saturn-mass (0.4 M$_J$, 1.0 R$_J$) exoplanet lying along the upper edge of the Neptune desert. TOI-1259 A b's close-in ($P$ = 3.48 days) orbit and low bulk density make the planet particularly vulnerable to photoevaporation. Using transits observed in the 1083 nm metastable helium line, we probe the upper atmosphere of TOI-1259 A b with the Hale Telescope at Palomar Observatory and the Near-Infrared Spectrograph on Keck II. We report an excess absorption of $0.395\pm{0.072}\%$ with Palomar and a blueshifted absorption of $2.4\pm0.52\%$ with Keck, consistent with an extended escaping atmosphere. Fitting this signal with a Parker wind model, we determine a corresponding atmospheric mass loss rate of log($\dot{M}$) = $10.33\pm 0.13$ g/s for a thermosphere temperature of $8400^{+1200}_{-1000}$ K based on the Palomar absorption and log($\dot{M}$) = $10.0\pm 0.1$ g/s for a thermosphere temperature of $8200^{+1000}_{-900}$ K based on the Keck absorption. This relatively low rate suggests that this planet would not have been significantly altered by mass loss even if it formed in-situ. However, the presence of a white dwarf companion, TOI-1259 B, hints that this planet may not have formed close-in, but rather migrated inward relatively late. Given the estimated parameters of the proto-white dwarf companion, we find that high-eccentricity migration is possible for the system.</description>

      <title>Revealing asymmetry on midplane of proto-planetary disc through modelling of axisymmetric emission: methodology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14006v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study proposes an analytical framework for deriving the surface brightness profile and geometry of a geometrically-thin axisymmetric disc from interferometric observation of continuum emission. Such precise modelling facilitates the exploration of faint non-axisymmetric structures, such as spirals and circumplanetary discs. As a demonstration, we simulate interferometric observations of geometrically-thin axisymmetric discs. The proposed method can reasonably recover the injected axisymmetric structures, whereas Gaussian fitting of the same data yielded larger errors in disc orientation estimation. To further test the applicability of the method, it was applied to the mock data for $m=1,2$ spirals and a point source, which are embedded in a bright axisymmetric structure. The injected non-axisymmetric structures were reasonably recovered except for the innermost parts, and the disc geometric parameter estimations were better than Gasussian fitting. The method was then applied to the real data of Elias 20 and AS 209, and it adequately subtracted the axisymmetric component, notably in Elias 20, where substantial residuals remained without our method. We also applied our method to continuum data of PDS 70 to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method. We successfully recovered emission from PDS 70 c consistently with previous studies, and also tentatively discovered new substructures. The current formulation can be applied to any data for disc continuum emission, and aids in the search of spirals and circumplanetary discs, whose detection is still limited.</description>

      <title>Waste Heat and Habitability: Constraints from Technological Energy Consumption</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06737v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Waste heat production represents an inevitable consequence of energy conversion as per the laws of thermodynamics. Based on this fact, by using simple theoretical models, we analyze constraints on the habitability of Earth-like terrestrial planets hosting putative technological species and technospheres characterized by persistent exponential growth of energy consumption and waste heat generation. In particular, we quantify the deleterious effects of rising surface temperature on biospheric processes and the eventual loss of liquid water. Irrespective of whether these sources of energy are ultimately stellar or planetary (e.g., nuclear, fossil fuels) in nature, we demonstrate that the loss of habitable conditions on such terrestrial planets may be expected to occur on timescales of $\lesssim 1000$ years, as measured from the start of the exponential phase, provided that the annual growth rate of energy consumption is of order $1\%$. We conclude with a discussion of the types of evolutionary trajectories that might be feasible for industrialized technological species, and we sketch the ensuing implications for technosignature searches.</description>

      <title>Recovering Injected Astrophysics from the LISA Galactic Double White Dwarf Binaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15230v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the successful recovery of common envelope ejection efficiency assumed in a simulated population of double white dwarf binaries like those which may be observed by the future LISA mission. We simulate the formation of double white dwarf binaries by using the COSMIC population synthesis code to sample binary formation conditions such as initial mass function, metallicity of star formation, initial orbital period, and initial eccentricity. These binaries are placed in the m12i synthetic Milky-Way-like galaxy, and their signal-to-noise ratio for the LISA instrument is estimated, considering a galactic gravitational wave foreground informed by the population. Through the use of Fisher estimates, we construct a likelihood function for the measurement error of the LISA-bright DWD binaries (&gt; 20 SNR, fGW &gt; 5mHz), in their gravitational wave frequency (fGW) and chirp mass. By repeating this process for different assumptions of the common envelope ejection efficiency, we apply Bayesian hierarchical inference to find the best match to an injected astrophysical assumption for a fiducial population model. We conclude that the impact of common envelope ejection efficiency on the mass transfer processes involved in double white dwarf formation may be statistically relevant in the future observed LISA population, and that constraints on binary formation may be found by comparing simulated populations to a future observed population.</description>

      <title>Explanation of the exceptionally strong timing noise of PSR J0337+1715 by a circum-ternary planet and consequences for gravity tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10066v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Context: Timing of pulsar PSR J0337+1715 provides a unique opportunity to test the strong equivalence principle (SEP) with a strongly self-gravitating object. This is due to its unique situation in a triple stellar system with two white dwarfs.    Aims: Our previous study suggested the presence of a strong low-frequency signal in the timing residuals. We set out to model it on a longer dataset in order to determine its nature and improve accuracy.    Methods: Three models are considered: chromatic or achromatic red-noise, and a small planet in a hierarchical orbit with the triple stellar system. These models are implemented in our numerical timing model. We perform Bayesian inference of posterior distributions. Best fits are compared using information-theoretic criteria.     Results: Chromatic red noise from dispersion-measure variations is ruled out. Achromatic red noise  or a planet in keplerian orbit provide the best fits. If it is red noise then it appears exceptionally strong. Assuming the presence of a planet, we obtain a marginal detection of mutual interactions which allows us to constrain its mass to $\sim 0.5 M_{\rm Moon}$ as well as its inclination. The latter is intriguingly coincident with a Kozai resonance. We show that a longer observation span will ultimately lead to a clear signature of the planet model due to its mutual interactions with the triple system. We produce new limits on SEP violation: $|\Delta| &lt; 1.5\cdot 10^{-6}$ or $|\Delta| &lt; 2.3\cdot 10^{-6}$ at 95% confidence level under the planet or red-noise hypothesis, respectively. This model dependence emphasises the need for additional data and model selection. As a by-product, we estimate a rather low supernova kick velocity of $\sim 110-125 \rm km/s$, strengthening the idea that it is a necessary condition for the formation of pulsar triple systems.</description>
