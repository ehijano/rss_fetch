      <title>Classifying acoustic cavitation with machine learning trained on multiple physical models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Acoustic cavitation refers to the formation and oscillation of microbubbles in a liquid exposed to acoustic waves. Depending on the properties of the liquid and the parameters of the acoustic waves, bubbles behave differently. The two main regimes of bubble dynamics are transient cavitation, where a bubble collapses violently, and stable cavitation, where a bubble undergoes periodic oscillations. Predicting these regimes under specific sonication conditions is important in biomedical ultrasound and sonochemistry. For these predictions to be helpful in practical settings, they must be precise and computationally efficient. In this study, we have used machine learning techniques to predict the cavitation regimes of air bubble nuclei in a liquid. The supervised machine learning was trained by solving three differential equations for bubble dynamics, namely the Rayleigh-Plesset, Keller-Miksis, and Gilmore equations. These equations were solved for a range of initial parameters, including temperature, bubble radius, acoustic pressure, and frequency. Four different classifiers were developed to label each simulation as either stable or transient cavitation. Subsequently, four different machine-learning strategies were designed to analyze the likelihood of transient or stable cavitation for a given set of acoustic and material parameters. Cross-validation on held-out test data shows a high accuracy of the machine learning predictions. The results indicate that machine learning models trained on physics-based simulations can reliably predict cavitation behavior across a wide range of conditions relevant to real-world applications. This approach can be employed to optimize device settings and protocols used in imaging, therapeutic ultrasound, and sonochemistry.</description>

      <title>The Importance of Learning without Constraints: Reevaluating Benchmarks for Invariant and Equivariant Features of Machine Learning Potentials in Generating Free Energy Landscapes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine-learned interatomic potentials (MILPs) are rapidly gaining interest for molecular modeling, as they provide a balance between quantum-mechanical level descriptions of atomic interactions and reasonable computational efficiency. However, questions remain regarding the stability of simulations using these potentials, as well as the extent to which the learned potential energy function can be extrapolated safely. Past studies have reported challenges encountered when MILPs are applied to classical benchmark systems. In this work, we show that some of these challenges are related to the characteristics of the training datasets, particularly the inclusion of rigid constraints. We demonstrate that long stability in simulations with MILPs can be achieved by generating unconstrained datasets using unbiased classical simulations if the fast modes are correctly sampled. Additionally, we emphasize that in order to achieve precise energy predictions, it is important to resort to enhanced sampling techniques for dataset generation, and we demonstrate that safe extrapolation of MILPs depends on judicious choices related to the system's underlying free energy landscape and the symmetry features embedded within the machine learning models.</description>

      <title>Studies of the Fermi-Hubbard Model Using Quantum Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of quantum computers to calculate the ground state (lowest) energies of a spin lattice of electrons described by the Fermi-Hubbard model of great importance in condensed matter physics has been studied. The ability of quantum bits (qubits) to be in a superposition state allows quantum computers to perform certain calculations that are not possible with even the most powerful classical (digital) computers. This work has established a method for calculating the ground state energies of small lattices which should be scalable to larger lattices that cannot be calculated by classical computers. Half-filled lattices of sizes 1x4, 2x2, 2x4, and 3x4 were studied. The calculated energies for the 1x4 and 2x2 lattices without Coulomb repulsion between the electrons and for the 1x4 lattice with Coulomb repulsion agrees with the true energies to within 0.60%, while for the 2x2 lattice with Coulomb repulsion the agreement is within 1.50% For the 2x4 lattice, the true energy without Coulomb repulsion was found to agree within 0.18%.</description>

      <title>PyFR v2.0.3: Towards Industrial Adoption of Scale-Resolving Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: PyFR is an open-source cross-platform computational fluid dynamics framework based on the high-order Flux Reconstruction approach, specifically designed for undertaking high-accuracy scale-resolving simulations in the vicinity of complex engineering geometries. Since the initial release of PyFR v0.1.0 in 2013, a range of new capabilities have been added to the framework, with a view to enabling industrial adoption of the capability. This paper provides details of those enhancements as released in PyFR v2.0.3, explains efforts to grow an engaged developer and user community, and provides latest performance and scaling results on up to 1024 AMD Instinct MI250X accelerators of Frontier at ORNL (each with two GCDs), and up to 2048 NVIDIA GH200 GPUs on Alps at CSCS.</description>

      <title>Automated computational workflows for muon spin spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Positive muon spin rotation and relaxation spectroscopy is a well established experimental technique for studying materials. It provides a local probe that generally complements scattering techniques in the study of magnetic systems and represents a valuable alternative for materials that display strong incoherent scattering or neutron absorption. Computational methods can effectively quantify the microscopic interactions underlying the experimentally observed signal, thus substantially boosting the predictive power of this technique. Here, we present an efficient set of algorithms and workflows devoted to the automation of this task. In particular, we adopt the so-called DFT+{\mu} procedure, where the system is characterised in the density functional theory (DFT) framework with the muon modeled as a hydrogen impurity. We devise an automated strategy to obtain candidate muon stopping sites, their dipolar interaction with the nuclei, and hyperfine interactions with the electronic ground state. We validate the implementation on well-studied compounds, showing the effectiveness of our protocol in terms of accuracy and simplicity of use</description>

      <title>Group Conductivity and Nonadiabatic Born Effective Charges of Disordered Metals, Warm Dense Matter and Hot Dense Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The average ionization state is a critical parameter in plasma models for charged particle transport, equation of state, and optical response. The dynamical or nonadiabatic Born effective charge (NBEC), calculated via first principles time-dependent density functional theory, provides exact ionic partitioning of bulk electron response for both metallic and insulating materials. The NBEC can be trivially transformed into a ''group conductivity", that is, the electron conductivity ascribed to a subset of ions. We show that for disordered metallic systems, such as warm dense matter (WDM) and hot dense plasma, the static limit of the NBEC is different from the average ionization state, but that the ionization state can be extracted from the group conductivity even in mixed systems. We demonstrate this approach using a set of archetypical examples, including cold and warm aluminium, low- and high- density WDM carbon, and a WDM carbon-beryllium-hydrogen mixture.</description>

      <title>Estimation Enhancing in Optoelectronic Property: A Novel Approach Using Orbital Interaction Parameters and Tight-Binding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper advocates for an innovative approach designed for estimating optoelectronic properties of quantum structures utilizing Tight-Binding (TB) theory. Predicated on the comparative analysis between estimated and actual properties, the study strives to validate the efficacy of this proposed technique; focusing notably on the computation of bandgap energy. It is observed that preceding methodologies offered a restricted accuracy when predicting complex structures like super-lattices and quantum wells. To address this gap, we propose a methodology involving three distinct phases using orbital interaction parameters (OIPs) and the TB theory. The research employed Aluminium Arsenide (AlAs) and Gallium Arsenide (GaAs) as the primary bulk materials. Our novel approach introduces a computation framework that first focuses on bulk computation, subsequently expanding to super-lattice structures. The findings of this research demonstrate promising results regarding the accuracy of predicated optoelectronic properties, particularly the cut-off wavelength. This study paves the way for future research, potentially enhancing the precision of the proposed methodology and its application scope within the field of quantum optoelectronics.</description>

      <title>Fourier Spectral Physics Informed Neural Network: An Efficient and Low-Memory PINN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With growing investigations into solving partial differential equations by physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), more accurate and efficient PINNs are required to meet the practical demands of scientific computing. One bottleneck of current PINNs is computing the high-order derivatives via automatic differentiation which often necessitates substantial computing resources. In this paper, we focus on removing the automatic differentiation of the spatial derivatives and propose a spectral-based neural network that substitutes the differential operator with a multiplication. Compared to the PINNs, our approach requires lower memory and shorter training time. Thanks to the exponential convergence of the spectral basis, our approach is more accurate. Moreover, to handle the different situations between physics domain and spectral domain, we provide two strategies to train networks by their spectral information. Through a series of comprehensive experiments, We validate the aforementioned merits of our proposed network.</description>

      <title>A Novel Interpolation-Based Method for Solving the One-Dimensional Wave Equation on a Domain with a Moving Boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the problem of solving the one-dimensional wave equation on a domain with moving boundary. In J.Math.Phys.11, 2679 (1970), Moore introduced an interesting method to do so. As only in rare cases, a closed analytical solution is possible, one must turn to perturbative expansions of Moore's method. We investigate the then made minimal assumption for convergence of the perturbation series, namely that the boundary position should be an analytic function of time. Though, we prove here that the latter requirement is not a sufficient condition for Moore's method to converge. We then introduce a novel numerical approach based on interpolation which also works for fast boundary dynamics. In comparison with other state-of-the-art numerical methods, our method offers greater speed if the wave solution needs to be evaluated at many points in time or space, whilst preserving accuracy. We discuss two variants of our method, either based on a conformal coordinate transformation or on the method of characteristics, together with interpolation.</description>

      <title>Diffusive transport of a 2-D magnetized dusty plasma cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dusty plasma medium turns out to be an ideal system for studying the strongly coupled behavior of matter. The large size and slow response make their dynamics suitable to be captured through simple diagnostic tools. Furthermore, as the charge on individual particles is significantly higher than the electronic charge, the interaction amongst them can be in a strong coupling regime even at room temperatures and normal densities. Such charged dust particles are often present in several industrial plasma-based processes and can have a detrimental influence. For instance, in magnetrons, the sputtering phenomena may be affected by the accumulation of charged impurity clusters. The objective here is to understand the transport behavior of these particles in the presence of an externally applied magnetic field. For this purpose, Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations are performed using an open-source large-scale atomic/molecular massively parallel simulator (LAMMPS). The dependence of the transport coefficient on the applied magnetic field and prevalent collisional processes has been discerned through simulations in detail.</description>

      <title>Persistence of the N = 50 shell closure over the isotopic chains of Sc, Ti, V and Cr nuclei using relativistic energy density functional</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16588v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The analytical expression of the density-dependent binding energy per nucleon for the relativistic mean field (RMF), also known as the relativistic energy density functional (Relativistic-EDF), is used to obtain the isospin-dependent symmetry energy and its components for the isotopic chain of Sc, Ti, V, and Cr nuclei. The procedure of the coherent density fluctuation model is employed to formulate the Relativistic-EDF and Brueckner energy density functional (Brueckner-EDF) at local density. A few signatures of shell and/or sub-shell closure are observed in the symmetry energy and its components, i.e., surface and volume symmetry energy, far from the beta-stable region for odd-A Sc and V, and even-even Ti and Cr nuclei with non-linear NL3 and G3 parameter sets. A comparison is made with the results obtained from Relativistic-EDF and Brueckner-EDF with both NL3 and G3 for the considered isotopic chains. We find Relativistic-EDF outperforms the Brueckner-EDF in predicting the shell and/or sub-shell closure of neutron-rich isotopes at N = 50 for these atomic nuclei. Moreover, a relative comparison has been made for the results obtained with the non-linear NL3 and G3 parameter sets.</description>

      <title>Reconciling Kubo and Keldysh Approaches to Fermi-Sea-Dependent Nonequilibrium Observables: Application to Spin Hall Current and Spin-Orbit Torque in Spintronics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum transport studies of spin-dependent phenomena in solids commonly employ the Kubo or Keldysh formulas for the steady-state density matrix in the linear-response regime. Its trace with operators of interest -- such as, spin density, spin current density or spin torque -- gives expectation values of experimentally accessible observables. For such local quantities, these formulas require summing over the manifolds of {\em both} Fermi-surface and Fermi-sea quantum states. However, debates have been raging in the literature about vastly different physics the two formulations can apparently produce, even when applied to the same system. Here, we revisit this problem using a testbed of infinite-size graphene with proximity-induced spin-orbit and magnetic exchange effects. By splitting this system into semi-infinite leads and central active region, in the spirit of Landauer two-terminal setup for quantum transport, we prove the {\em numerically exact equivalence} of the Kubo and Keldysh approaches via the computation of spin Hall current density and spin-orbit torque in both clean and disordered limits. The key to reconciling the two approaches are the numerical frameworks we develop for: ({\em i}) evaluation of Kubo(-Bastin) formula for a system attached to semi-infinite leads, which ensure continuous energy spectrum and evade the need for phenomenological broadening in prior calculations; and ({\em ii}) proper evaluation of Fermi-sea term in the Keldysh approach, which {\em must} include the voltage drop across the central active region even if it is disorder free.</description>

      <title>Towards Efficient Modelling of String Dynamics: A Comparison of State Space and Koopman based Deep Learning Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an examination of State Space Models (SSM) and Koopman-based deep learning methods for modelling the dynamics of both linear and non-linear stiff strings. Through experiments with datasets generated under different initial conditions and sample rates, we assess the capacity of these models to accurately model the complex behaviours observed in string dynamics. Our findings indicate that our proposed Koopman-based model performs as well as or better than other existing approaches in non-linear cases for long-sequence modelling.
  We inform the design of these architectures with the structure of the problems at hand. Although challenges remain in extending model predictions beyond the training horizon (i.e., extrapolation), the focus of our investigation lies in the models' ability to generalise across different initial conditions within the training time interval. This research contributes insights into the physical modelling of dynamical systems (in particular those addressing musical acoustics) by offering a comparative overview of these and previous methods and introducing innovative strategies for model improvement. Our results highlight the efficacy of these models in simulating non-linear dynamics and emphasise their wide-ranging applicability in accurately modelling dynamical systems over extended sequences.</description>

Abstract: Accurate Gibbs free energies of Fe clusters are required for predictive modeling of Fe cluster growth during condensation of a cooling vapor. We present a straightforward method of calculating free energies of cluster formation using the data provided by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We apply this method to calculate free energies of Fe clusters having from 2 to 100 atoms. The free energies are verified by comparing to an MD-simulated equilibrium cluster size distribution in a sub-saturated vapor. We show that these free energies differ significantly from those obtained with a commonly used spherical cluster approximation - which relies on a surface tension coefficient of a flat surface. The spherical cluster approximation can be improved by using a cluster size-dependent Tolman correction for the surface tension. The values for the Tolman length and effective surface tension were derived, which differ from the commonly used experimentally measured surface tension based on the potential energy. This improved approximation does not account for geometric magic number effects responsible for spikes and troughs in densities of neighbor cluster sizes. Nonetheless, it allows to model cluster formation from a cooling vapor and accurately reproduce the condensation timeline, overall shape of the cluster size distribution, average cluster size, and the distribution width. Using a constant surface tension coefficient resulted in distorted condensation dynamics and inaccurate cluster size distributions. The analytical expression for cluster nucleation rate from classical nucleation theory (CNT) was updated to account for the size-dependence of cluster surface tension.</description>

      <title>SympGNNs: Symplectic Graph Neural Networks for identifiying high-dimensional Hamiltonian systems and node classification</title>

Abstract: Existing neural network models to learn Hamiltonian systems, such as SympNets, although accurate in low-dimensions, struggle to learn the correct dynamics for high-dimensional many-body systems. Herein, we introduce Symplectic Graph Neural Networks (SympGNNs) that can effectively handle system identification in high-dimensional Hamiltonian systems, as well as node classification. SympGNNs combines symplectic maps with permutation equivariance, a property of graph neural networks. Specifically, we propose two variants of SympGNNs: i) G-SympGNN and ii) LA-SympGNN, arising from different parameterizations of the kinetic and potential energy. We demonstrate the capabilities of SympGNN on two physical examples: a 40-particle coupled Harmonic oscillator, and a 2000-particle molecular dynamics simulation in a two-dimensional Lennard-Jones potential. Furthermore, we demonstrate the performance of SympGNN in the node classification task, achieving accuracy comparable to the state-of-the-art. We also empirically show that SympGNN can overcome the oversmoothing and heterophily problems, two key challenges in the field of graph neural networks.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear refractive index changes and absorption coefficients in mesoscopic ring induced by variable effective mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study explores the linear and nonlinear optical absorption coefficients (OAC) and refractive index changes (RIC) in quantum dot and quantum antidot systems with a position-dependent variable effective mass. Significant contributions to both linear and nonlinear OAC and RIC are observed. Our findings reveal that variations of the mass parameter modify the intersubband dipole matrix elements and energy intervals, leading to noticeable shifts in optical properties. The results show that higher {\gamma} values shift resonance peaks towards higher energies, while changes in the oscillator frequency result in abrupt shifts and peak diminutions. These insights provide a deeper understanding of the optical behaviors in the quantum systems under consideration, paving the way for designing devices with optimal efficiency</description>

Abstract: Fluid flow simulations marshal our most powerful computational resources. In many cases, even this is not enough. Quantum computers provide an opportunity to speed up traditional algorithms for flow simulations. We show that lattice-based mesoscale numerical methods can be executed as efficient quantum algorithms due to their statistical features. This approach revises a quantum algorithm for lattice gas automata to reduce classical computations and state preparation at every time step. For this, the algorithm approximates the qubit relative phases and subtracts them at the end of each time step. Phases are evaluated using the iterative phase estimation algorithm and subtracted using single-qubit rotation phase gates. This method optimizes the quantum resource required and makes it more appropriate for near-term quantum hardware. We also demonstrate how the checkerboard deficiency that the D1Q2 scheme presents can be resolved using the D1Q3 scheme. The algorithm is validated by simulating two canonical PDEs: the diffusion and Burgers' equations on different quantum simulators. We find good agreement between quantum simulations and classical solutions for the presented algorithm.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning in Viscoelastic Fluids via Energy-Based Kernel Embedding</title>

Abstract: The ability to measure differences in collected data is of fundamental importance for quantitative science and machine learning, motivating the establishment of metrics grounded in physical principles. In this study, we focus on the development of such metrics for viscoelastic fluid flows governed by a large class of linear and nonlinear stress models. To do this, we introduce a kernel function corresponding to a given viscoelastic stress model that implicitly embeds flowfield snapshots into a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) whose squared norm equals the total mechanical energy. Working implicitly with lifted representations in the RKHS via the kernel function provides natural and unambiguous metrics for distances and angles between flowfields without the need for hyperparameter tuning. Additionally, we present a solution to the preimage problem for our kernels, enabling accurate reconstruction of flowfields from their RKHS representations. Through numerical experiments on an unsteady viscoelastic lid-driven cavity flow, we demonstrate the utility of our kernels for extracting energetically-dominant coherent structures in viscoelastic flows across a range of Reynolds and Weissenberg numbers. Specifically, the features extracted by Kernel Principal Component Analysis (KPCA) of flowfield snapshots using our kernel functions yield reconstructions with superior accuracy in terms of mechanical energy compared to conventional methods such as ordinary Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with na\"ively-defined state vectors or KPCA with ad-hoc choices of kernel functions. Our findings underscore the importance of principled choices of metrics in both scientific and machine learning investigations of complex fluid systems.</description>

      <title>Force-Guided Bridge Matching for Full-Atom Time-Coarsened Dynamics of Peptides</title>

Abstract: Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations are irreplaceable and ubiquitous in fields of materials science, chemistry, pharmacology just to name a few. Conventional MD simulations are plagued by numerical stability as well as long equilibration time issues, which limits broader applications of MD simulations. Recently, a surge of deep learning approaches have been devised for time-coarsened dynamics, which learns the state transition mechanism over much larger time scales to overcome these limitations. However, only a few methods target the underlying Boltzmann distribution by resampling techniques, where proposals are rarely accepted as new states with low efficiency. In this work, we propose a force-guided bridge matching model, FBM, a novel framework that first incorporates physical priors into bridge matching for full-atom time-coarsened dynamics. With the guidance of our well-designed intermediate force field, FBM is feasible to target the Boltzmann-like distribution by direct inference without extra steps. Experiments on small peptides verify our superiority in terms of comprehensive metrics and demonstrate transferability to unseen peptide systems.</description>
