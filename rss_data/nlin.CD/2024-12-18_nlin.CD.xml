      <title>Reservoir Computing Generalized</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A physical neural network (PNN) has both the strong potential to solve machine learning tasks and intrinsic physical properties, such as high-speed computation and energy efficiency. Reservoir computing (RC) is an excellent framework for implementing an information processing system with a dynamical system by attaching a trained readout, thus accelerating the wide use of unconventional materials for a PNN. However, RC requires the dynamics to reproducibly respond to input sequence, which limits the type of substance available for building information processors. Here we propose a novel framework called generalized reservoir computing (GRC) by turning this requirement on its head, making conventional RC a special case. Using substances that do not respond the same to identical inputs (e.g., a real spin-torque oscillator), we propose mechanisms aimed at obtaining a reliable output and show that processed inputs in the unconventional substance are retrievable. Finally, we demonstrate that, based on our framework, spatiotemporal chaos, which is thought to be unusable as a computational resource, can be used to emulate complex nonlinear dynamics, including large scale spatiotemporal chaos. Overall, our framework removes the limitation to building an information processing device and opens a path to constructing a computational system using a wider variety of physical dynamics.</description>

      <title>Chaotic dynamics and fractal geometry in ring lattice systems of non-chaotic Rulkov neurons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the complex dynamics and fractal attractors that emerge from 60-dimensional ring lattice systems of electrically coupled non-chaotic Rulkov neurons. Although networks of chaotic Rulkov neurons are well-studied, systems of non-chaotic Rulkov neurons have not been extensively explored due to the piecewise complexity of the non-chaotic Rulkov map. We find rich dynamics emerge from the electrical coupling of regular spiking Rulkov neurons, including chaotic spiking, chaotic bursting, and complete chaos. We also discover general trends in the maximal Lyapunov exponent among different ring lattice systems as the electrical coupling strength between neurons is varied. By means of the Kaplan-Yorke conjecture, we also examine the fractal geometry of the chaotic attractors of the ring systems and find various correlations and differences between the fractal dimensions of the attractors and the chaotic dynamics on them.</description>

      <title>Extending Chaos Theory: The Role of Nonlinearity in Multiple Mappings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work redefines the framework of chaos in dynamical systems by extending Devaney's definition to multiple mappings, emphasizing the pivotal role of nonlinearity. We propose a novel theorem demonstrating how nonlinear dynamics within a single mapping can induce chaos across a collective system, even when other components lack sensitivity. To validate these insights, we introduce advanced computational algorithms implemented in MATLAB, capable of detecting and visualizing key chaotic features such as transitivity, sensitivity, and periodic points. The results unveil new behaviors in higherdimensional systems, bridging theoretical advances with practical applications in physics, biology, and economics. By uniting rigorous mathematics with computational innovation, this study lays a foundation for future exploration of nonlinear dynamics in complex systems, offering transformative insights into the interplay between structure and chaos. Keywords: Nonlinearity, Chaos Theory, Multiple Mappings, Devaney Chaos, Computational Algorithms, Dynamical Systems.</description>

      <title>Brickwall One-Loop Determinant: Spectral Statistics &amp; Krylov Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate quantum chaotic features of the brickwall model, which is obtained by introducing a stretched horizon -- a Dirichlet wall placed outside the event horizon -- within the BTZ geometry. This simple yet effective model has been shown to capture key properties of quantum black holes and is motivated by the stringy fuzzball proposal. We analyze the dynamics of both scalar and fermionic probe fields, deriving their normal mode spectra with Gaussian-distributed boundary conditions on the stretched horizon. By interpreting these normal modes as energy eigenvalues, we examine spectral statistics, including level spacing distributions, the spectral form factor, and Krylov state complexity as diagnostics for quantum chaos. Our results show that the brickwall model exhibits features consistent with random matrix theory across various ensembles as the standard deviation of the Gaussian distribution is varied. Specifically, we observe Wigner-Dyson distributions, a linear ramp in the spectral form factor, and a characteristic peak in Krylov complexity, all without the need for a classical interior geometry. We also demonstrate that non-vanishing spectral rigidity alone is sufficient to produce a peak in Krylov complexity, without requiring Wigner-Dyson level repulsion. Finally, we identify signatures of integrability at extreme values of the Dirichlet boundary condition parameter.</description>

      <title>Effect of local flow geometry on particle pair dispersion angle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We combine experiments in a von K\'arm\'an flow with numerical simulations of Taylor-Green and homogeneous and isotropic turbulence to study the effect of the local flow geometry on particle pair dispersion. To characterize particle dispersion we use the pair dispersion angle, defined as the angle between the relative position and relative velocity of particle pairs. This angle was recently introduced as a means to more effectively identify the different dispersion regimes in finite-Reynolds-number flows. Our results show that, at a global scale, all flows considered show similar dispersion properties in terms of this metric, characterized by ballistic, super-diffusive, and diffusive regimes. Locally, however, these systems exhibit distinct behaviors, with anisotropies and local geometric features significantly influencing dispersion in both the von K\'arm\'an and Taylor-Green flows.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Diffusion in the Square Soft Lorentz Gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14965v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate and analyze anomalous diffusion properties of point-like particles in a two-dimensional system with circular scatterers arranged in a square lattice and governed by smooth potentials, referred to as the square soft Lorentz gas. Our numerical simulations reveal a rich interplay of normal and anomalous diffusion depending on the system parameters. To describe diffusion in normal regimes, we develop a unit cell hopping model that, in the single-hop limit, recovers the Machta-Zwanzig approximation and converges toward the numerical diffusion coefficient as the number of hops increases. Anomalous diffusion is characterized by quasiballistic orbits forming Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser islands in phase space, alongside a complex tongue structure in parameter space defined by the interscatterer distance and potential softness. The distributions of the particle displacement vector show notable similarities to both analytical and numerical results for a hard-wall square Lorentz gas, exhibiting Gaussian behavior in normal diffusion and long tails due to quasiballistic orbits in anomalous regimes. Our work thus provides a catalog of key dynamical system properties that characterize the intricate changes in diffusion when transitioning from hard billiards to soft potentials.</description>

      <title>Quantum trails and memory effects in the phase space of chaotic quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04310v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The eigenstates of a chaotic system can be enhanced along underlying unstable periodic orbits in so-called quantum scars, making it more likely for a particle launched along one such orbits to be found still there at long times. Unstable periodic orbits are however a negligible part of the phase space, and a question arises regarding the structure of the wavefunction elsewhere. Here, we address this question and show that a weakly-dispersing dynamics of a localized wavepacket in phase space leaves a "quantum trail" on the eigenstates, that is, makes them vary slowly when moving along a trajectories in phase space, even if not periodic. The quantum trails underpin a remarkable dynamical effect: for a system initialized in a localized wavepacket, the long-time phase-space distribution is enhanced along the short-time trajectory, which can result in ergodicity breaking. We provide the general intuition for these effects and prove them in the stadium billiard, for which an unwarping procedure allows to visualize the phase space on the two-dimensional space of the page.</description>
