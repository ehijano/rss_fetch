      <title>Standardized Evaluation of Fetal Phonocardiography Processing Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivation. Phonocardiography can give access to the fetal heart rate as well as direct heart sound data, and is entirely passive, using no radiation of any kind. Approach. We discuss the currently available methods for fetal heart sound detection and heart rate estimation and compare them using a common benchmarking platform and a pre-selected testing dataset. Compared to previous reviews, we evaluated the discussed methods in a standardized manner for a fair comparison. Our tests included tolerance-based detection accuracy, error rates for label insertions, deletions, and substitutions, and statistical measures for heart rate mean square error. Results. Based on our results, there is no definite best method that can achieve the highest scores in all of the tests, and simpler methods could perform comparably to more complex ones. The best model for first heart sound detection achieved 97.6% F1-score, 97.4% positive predictive value, and 12.2+-8.0 ms mean absolute error. In terms of second heart sound detection the best model had 91.4% F1-score, 91.3% positive predictive value, and 17.3+-12.2 ms mean absolute error. For fetal heart rate a 0.644 mean square error was achieved by the best method. Significance. Our main conclusion is that further standardization is required in fetal heart rate and heart sound detection method evaluation. The tests and algorithm implementations are openly available at: https://github.com/mulkr/standard-fpcg-evaluation.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Transfer Learning for Data-Driven Sound Source Reconstruction in Near-Field Acoustic Holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a transfer learning framework for sound source reconstruction in Near-field Acoustic Holography (NAH), which adapts a well-trained data-driven model from one type of sound source to another using a physics-informed procedure. The framework comprises two stages: (1) supervised pre-training of a complex-valued convolutional neural network (CV-CNN) on a large dataset, and (2) purely physics-informed fine-tuning on a single data sample based on the Kirchhoff-Helmholtz integral. This method follows the principles of transfer learning by enabling generalization across different datasets through physics-informed adaptation. The effectiveness of the approach is validated by transferring a pre-trained model from a rectangular plate dataset to a violin top plate dataset, where it shows improved reconstruction accuracy compared to the pre-trained model and delivers performance comparable to that of Compressive-Equivalent Source Method (C-ESM). Furthermore, for successful modes, the fine-tuned model outperforms both the pre-trained model and C-ESM in accuracy.</description>

      <title>Array-Aware Ambisonics and HRTF Encoding for Binaural Reproduction With Wearable Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces a novel method for binaural reproduction from arbitrary microphone arrays, based on array-aware optimization of Ambisonics encoding through Head-Related Transfer Function (HRTF) pre-processing. The proposed approach integrates array-specific information into the HRTF processing pipeline, leading to improved spatial accuracy in binaural rendering. Objective evaluations demonstrate superior performance under simulated wearable-array and head rotations compared to conventional Ambisonics encoding method. A listening experiment further confirms that the method achieves significantly higher perceptual ratings in both timbre and spatial quality. Fully compatible with standard Ambisonics, the proposed method offers a practical solution for spatial audio rendering in applications such as virtual reality, augmented reality, and wearable audio capture.</description>

      <title>P.808 Multilingual Speech Enhancement Testing: Approach and Results of URGENT 2025 Challenge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In speech quality estimation for speech enhancement (SE) systems, subjective listening tests so far are considered as the gold standard. This should be even more true considering the large influx of new generative or hybrid methods into the field, revealing issues of some objective metrics. Efforts such as the Interspeech 2025 URGENT Speech Enhancement Challenge also involving non-English datasets add the aspect of multilinguality to the testing procedure. In this paper, we provide a brief recap of the ITU-T P.808 crowdsourced subjective listening test method. A first novel contribution is our proposed process of localizing both text and audio components of Naderi and Cutler's implementation of crowdsourced subjective absolute category rating (ACR) listening tests involving text-to-speech (TTS). Further, we provide surprising analyses of and insights into URGENT Challenge results, tackling the reliability of (P.808) ACR subjective testing as gold standard in the age of generative AI. Particularly, it seems that for generative SE methods, subjective (ACR MOS) and objective (DNSMOS, NISQA) reference-free metrics should be accompanied by objective phone fidelity metrics to reliably detect hallucinations. Finally, in the accepted version, we will release our localization scripts and methods for easy deployment for new multilingual speech enhancement subjective evaluations according to ITU-T P.808.</description>

      <title>Towards Reliable Objective Evaluation Metrics for Generative Singing Voice Separation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional Blind Source Separation Evaluation (BSS-Eval) metrics were originally designed to evaluate linear audio source separation models based on methods such as time-frequency masking. However, recent generative models may introduce nonlinear relationships between the separated and reference signals, limiting the reliability of these metrics for objective evaluation. To address this issue, we conduct a Degradation Category Rating listening test and analyze correlations between the obtained degradation mean opinion scores (DMOS) and a set of objective audio quality metrics for the task of singing voice separation. We evaluate three state-of-the-art discriminative models and two new competitive generative models. For both discriminative and generative models, intrusive embedding-based metrics show higher correlations with DMOS than conventional intrusive metrics such as BSS-Eval. For discriminative models, the highest correlation is achieved by the MSE computed on Music2Latent embeddings. When it comes to the evaluation of generative models, the strongest correlations are evident for the multi-resolution STFT loss and the MSE calculated on MERT-L12 embeddings, with the latter also providing the most balanced correlation across both model types. Our results highlight the limitations of BSS-Eval metrics for evaluating generative singing voice separation models and emphasize the need for careful selection and validation of alternative evaluation metrics for the task of singing voice separation.</description>

      <title>Grammatical Structure and Grammatical Variations in Non-Metric Iranian Classical Music</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study we introduce a symbolic dataset composed of non-metric Iranian classical music, and algorithms for structural parsing of this music, and generation of variations. The corpus comprises MIDI files and data sheets of Dastgah Shour from Radif Mirza Abdollah, the foundational repertoire of Iranian classical music. Furthermore, we apply our previously-introduced algorithm for parsing melodic structure (Kanani et al., 2023b)to the dataset. Unlike much Western music, this type of non-metric music does not follow bar-centric organisation. The non-metric organisation can be captured well by our parsing algorithm. We parse each tune (Gusheh) into a grammar to identify motifs and phrases. These grammar representations can be useful for educational and ethnomusicological purposes. We also further develop a previously-introduced method of creating melodic variations (Kanani et al., 2023b). After parsing an existing tune to produce a grammar, by applying mutations to this grammar, we generate a new grammar. Expanding this new version yields a variation of the original tune. Variations are assessed by a domain-expert listener. Additionally, we conduct a statistical analysis of mutation with different representation setups for our parsing and generation algorithms. The overarching conclusion is that the system successfully produces acceptable variations post-mutation. While our case study focuses on Iranian classical music, the methodology can be adapted for Arabic or Turkish classical music.</description>

      <title>Parsing Musical Structure to Enable Meaningful Variations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel rule-based approach for generating music by varying existing tunes. We parse each tune to find the Pathway Assembly (PA) [ 1], that is a structure representing all repetitions in the tune. The Sequitur algorithm [2 ] is used for this. The result is a grammar. We then carry out mutation on the grammar, rather than on a tune directly. There are potentially 19 types of mutations such as adding, removing, swapping or reversing parts of the grammar that can be applied to the grammars. The system employs one of the mutations randomly in this step to automatically manipulate the grammar. Following the mutation, we need to expand the grammar which returns a new tune. The output after 1 or more mutations will be a new tune related to the original tune. Our study examines how tunes change gradually over the course of multiple mutations. Edit distances, structural complexity and length of the tunes are used to show how a tune is changed after multiple mutations. In addition, the size of effect of each mutation type is analyzed. As a final point, we review the musical aspect of the output tunes. It should be noted that the study only focused on generating new pitch sequences. The study is based on an Irish traditional tune dataset and a list of integers has been used to represent each tune's pitch values.</description>

      <title>Pronunciation Deviation Analysis Through Voice Cloning and Acoustic Comparison</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for detecting mispronunciations by analyzing deviations between a user's original speech and their voice-cloned counterpart with corrected pronunciation. We hypothesize that regions with maximal acoustic deviation between the original and cloned utterances indicate potential mispronunciations. Our method leverages recent advances in voice cloning to generate a synthetic version of the user's voice with proper pronunciation, then performs frame-by-frame comparisons to identify problematic segments. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in pinpointing specific pronunciation errors without requiring predefined phonetic rules or extensive training data for each target language.</description>

      <title>FasTUSS: Faster Task-Aware Unified Source Separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time-Frequency (TF) dual-path models are currently among the best performing audio source separation network architectures, achieving state-of-the-art performance in speech enhancement, music source separation, and cinematic audio source separation. While they are characterized by a relatively low parameter count, they still require a considerable number of operations, implying a higher execution time. This problem is exacerbated by the trend towards bigger models trained on large amounts of data to solve more general tasks, such as the recently introduced task-aware unified source separation (TUSS) model. TUSS, which aims to solve audio source separation tasks using a single, conditional model, is built upon TF-Locoformer, a TF dual-path model combining convolution and attention layers. The task definition comes in the form of a sequence of prompts that specify the number and type of sources to be extracted. In this paper, we analyze the design choices of TUSS with the goal of optimizing its performance-complexity trade-off. We derive two more efficient models, FasTUSS-8.3G and FasTUSS-11.7G that reduce the original model's operations by 81\% and 73\% with minor performance drops of 1.2~dB and 0.4~dB averaged over all benchmarks, respectively. Additionally, we investigate the impact of prompt conditioning to derive a causal TUSS model.</description>

      <title>A Survey on Speech Deepfake Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13914v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The availability of smart devices leads to an exponential increase in multimedia content. However, advancements in deep learning have also enabled the creation of highly sophisticated Deepfake content, including speech Deepfakes, which pose a serious threat by generating realistic voices and spreading misinformation. To combat this, numerous challenges have been organized to advance speech Deepfake detection techniques. In this survey, we systematically analyze more than 200 papers published up to March 2024. We provide a comprehensive review of each component in the detection pipeline, including model architectures, optimization techniques, generalizability, evaluation metrics, performance comparisons, available datasets, and open source availability. For each aspect, we assess recent progress and discuss ongoing challenges. In addition, we explore emerging topics such as partial Deepfake detection, cross-dataset evaluation, and defences against adversarial attacks, while suggesting promising research directions. This survey not only identifies the current state of the art to establish strong baselines for future experiments but also offers clear guidance for researchers aiming to enhance speech Deepfake detection systems.</description>

      <title>ReverbMiipher: Generative Speech Restoration meets Reverberation Characteristics Controllability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05077v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reverberation encodes spatial information regarding the acoustic source environment, yet traditional Speech Restoration (SR) usually completely removes reverberation. We propose ReverbMiipher, an SR model extending parametric resynthesis framework, designed to denoise speech while preserving and enabling control over reverberation. ReverbMiipher incorporates a dedicated ReverbEncoder to extract a reverb feature vector from noisy input. This feature conditions a vocoder to reconstruct the speech signal, removing noise while retaining the original reverberation characteristics. A stochastic zero-vector replacement strategy during training ensures the feature specifically encodes reverberation, disentangling it from other speech attributes. This learned representation facilitates reverberation control via techniques such as interpolation between features, replacement with features from other utterances, or sampling from a latent space. Objective and subjective evaluations confirm ReverbMiipher effectively preserves reverberation, removes other artifacts, and outperforms the conventional two-stage SR and convolving simulated room impulse response approach. We further demonstrate its ability to generate novel reverberation effects through feature manipulation.</description>

      <title>Mixture of LoRA Experts with Multi-Modal and Multi-Granularity LLM Generative Error Correction for Accented Speech Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09116v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite substantial improvements in ASR, performance tends to degrade when faced with adverse conditions such as speaker accents. Generative error correction (GER) leverages the rich linguistic knowledge and exceptional reasoning ability of LLMs, significantly outperforming typical LM methods. However, it lacks specificity in accented speech scenarios. In this study, we leverage GER to improve the accuracy of transcription predictions by addressing the two primary features of accented speech recognition. To fully leverage pronunciation information, we propose the multi-modal GER, which integrates pronunciation information from the speech modality, and the multi-granularity GER, which incorporates fine-grained phoneme-level information related to pronunciation. These two methods enable the LLM to utilize the pronunciation information of accented speech and the semantic information from word-level hypotheses for accurate transcription predictions through LoRA fine-tuning. On the one hand, we employ a three-stage training strategy to train separate multi-modal GER models for each accent to obtain mono-accent LoRA experts. By adopting our proposed HDMoLE method, which incorporates hierarchical routing and dynamic thresholds within the mixture of LoRA experts, we effectively merge multiple mono-accent LoRA experts within a single multi-modal GER to overcome the challenges posed by accent diversity. On the other hand, multi-granularity GER leverages the N-best word-level and phoneme-level hypotheses generated by the HDMoLE model to predict the final accented speech transcriptions. Experimental results on the multi-accent English dataset demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed methods. Our methods achieve a remarkable relative WER reduction of 67.35% compared to the Whisper-large-v3 baseline.</description>
