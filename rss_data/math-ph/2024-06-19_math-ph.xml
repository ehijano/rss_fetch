      <title>Reflection Positivity and Chern-Simons Functional Integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that a mathematical version of the formal Chern-Simons functional integral of Witten for manifolds equipped with a reflection may be constructed in terms of a reflection positive functional, associated to the quadratic term in the Chern-Simons Lagrangian, on an algebra of functions on a Banach space ${\bf A}$ of connections on the underlying 3-manifold. This construction yields a Hilbert space associated to a surface preserved by the reflection. A version of the cubic Bosonic interaction term in the Chern-Simons Lagrangian gives a self-adjoint operator on this Hilbert space, and by exponentiation, a unitary one parameter subgroup of operators. The vacuum expectation value of this one parameter subgroup is combined with an additional term associated to the ghost fields and their interaction, and an appropriate weak limit gives a partition function for the quantum field theory. This construction is nonperturbative. The theory is finite and does not require renormalization, as may be expected from perturbation theory. It is natural to ask whether the resulting partition function is related to the manifold invariants of Witten and Reshetikhin-Turaev, or whether a more elaborate construction may be needed.</description>

      <title>Pluriharmonic solutions to Yang-Mills equations: a $C^*$-algebras approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This partially expository paper provides a view of Yang-Mills equations from the perspective of complex variables, operator theory, and $C^{*}$-algebras. Through operator-valued pluriharmonic and skew-Hermitian differential forms, it constructs a new class of instanton solutions. Furthermore, it provides a complex variable version of the Yang-Mills Lagrangian and the Belavin-Polyakov-Schwartz-Tyupkin instanton.</description>

      <title>Scaling limit of the ground state Bethe roots for the inhomogeneous XXZ spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known that for the Heisenberg XXZ spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ chain in the critical regime, the scaling limit of the vacuum Bethe roots yields an infinite set of numbers that coincide with the energy spectrum of the quantum mechanical 3D anharmonic oscillator. The discovery of this curious relation, among others, gave rise to the approach referred to as the ODE/IQFT (or ODE/IM) correspondence. Here we consider a multiparametric generalization of the Heisenberg spin chain, which is associated with the inhomogeneous six-vertex model. When quasi-periodic boundary conditions are imposed the lattice system may be explored within the Bethe Ansatz technique. We argue that for the critical spin chain, with a properly formulated scaling limit, the scaled Bethe roots for the ground state are described by second order differential equations, which are multi-parametric generalizations of the Schr\"{o}dinger equation for the anharmonic oscillator.</description>

      <title>Classical and quantum KMS states on spin lattice systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the classical and quantum KMS conditions within the context of spin lattice systems. Specifically, we define a strict deformation quantization (SDQ) for a $\mathbb{S}^2$-valued spin lattice system over $\mathbb{Z}^d$ generalizing the renown Berezin SDQ for a single sphere. This allows to promote a classical dynamics on the algebra of classical observables to a quantum dynamics on the algebra of quantum observables. We then compare the notion of classical and quantum thermal equilibrium by showing that any weak*-limit point of a sequence of quantum KMS states fulfils the classical KMS condition. In short, this proves that the semiclassical limit of quantum thermal states describes classical thermal equilibrium, strenghtening the physical interpretation of the classical KMS condition. Finally we provide two sufficient conditions ensuring uniqueness of classical and quantum KMS states: The latter are based on an version of the Kirkwood-Salzburg equations adapted to the system of interest. As a consequence we identify a mild condition which ensures uniqueness of classical KMS states and of quantum KMS states for the quantized dynamics for a common sufficiently high temperature.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic behaviour of determinants through the expansion of the Moyal star product</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We work out a generalization of the Szeg\"o limit theorems on the determinant of large matrices. We focus on matrices with nonzero leading principal minors and elements that decay to zero exponentially fast with the distance from the main diagonal, but we relax the constraint of the Toeplitz structure. We obtain an expression for the asymptotic behaviour of the determinant written in terms of the factors of a left and right Wiener-Hopf type factorization of an appropriately defined symbol. For matrices with elements varying slowly along the diagonals (e.g., in locally Toeplitz sequences), we propose to apply the analogue of the semiclassical expansion of the Moyal star product in phase-space quantum mechanics. This is a systematic method that provides approximations up to any order in the typical scale of the inhomogeneity and allows us to obtain explicit asymptotic formulas.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a compact connected Riemann surface, and let ${\mathcal Q}(r,d)$ denote the quot scheme parametrizing the torsion quotients of ${\mathcal O}^{\oplus r}_X$ of degree $d$. Given a projective structure $P$ on $X$, we show that the cotangent bundle $T^*{\mathcal U}$ of a certain nonempty Zariski open subset ${\mathcal U}\, \subset\, {\mathcal Q}(r,d)$, equipped with the natural Liouville symplectic form, admits a canonical deformation quantization. When $r\,=\,1\,=\, d$, then ${\mathcal Q}(r,d)\,=\, X$; this case was addressed earlier in \cite{BB}.</description>

      <title>Analytical approximations closed as desired to special functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a method for constructing global analytical expressions that approximate a function over its entire range. These approximations not only mirror the original function as accurately as desired, but are purposefully created to possess features that the original function lacks. This is particularly useful for functions that lack closed form and are defined by integrals or infinite series. Replacing these definitions with simple analytical expressions enables in-depth qualitative analysis and replaces the current methods of evaluation. We demonstrate this procedure by providing replacements for a variety of pivotal functions in physics and cosmology including the pressure and density of quantum gas, the one-loop correction in thermal field theory, common polylog functions, and the error function.</description>

      <title>Edge Spin fractionalization in one-dimensional spin-$S$ quantum antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We argue that the anisotropic quantum spin chain with spin $S$ (XXZ$-S$) exhibits exponentially localized fractional $\pm \frac{S}{2}$ edge modes in the gapped antiferromagnetic phase of the model. Moreover, we claim that this phenomenon is very general and exists in any $U(1)$ symmetric spin chain in its gapped antiferromagnetic regime with explicitly or spontaneously broken $\mathbb Z_2$ symmetry. We examine our argument for integrable and non integrable chains. By using the Bethe Ansatz method, we show that $XXZ-\frac{1}{2}$ and a $XXZ-1$ integrable chains have $\pm \frac{S}{2}$ fractionalized edge modes. Employing the density matrix renormalization group technique, we extend this analysis to {\it generic} XXZ-$S$ chains with $S\leq 3$ and demonstrate that these fractional spins emerge as robust quantum observables, substantiated by the observation of a variance of the associated fractional spin operators that is consistent with a vanishing functional form in the thermodynamic limit. Moreover, we find that the edge modes are robust to disorder that couples to the N\'eel order parameter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12040v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note, we study the low temperature $(2+1)$D SOS interface above a hard floor with critical pinning potential $\lambda_w= \log (\frac{1}{1-e^{-4\beta}})$. At $\lambda&lt;\lambda_w$ entropic repulsion causes the surface to delocalize and be rigid at height $\frac1{4\beta}\log n+O(1)$; at $\lambda&gt;\lambda_w$ it is localized at some $O(1)$ height. We show that at $\lambda=\lambda_w$, there is delocalization, with rigidity now at height $\lfloor \frac1{6\beta}\log n+\frac13\rfloor$, confirming a conjecture of Lacoin.</description>

      <title>Many-Body Quantum Geometric Dipole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collective excitations of many-body electron systems can carry internal structure, tied to the quantum geometry of the Hilbert space in which they are embedded. This has been shown explicitly for particle-hole-like excitations, which carry a ``quantum geometric dipole'' (QGD) that is essentially an electric dipole moment associated with the state. We demonstrate in this work that this property can be formulated in a generic way, which does not require wavefunctions expressed in terms of single particle-hole states. Our formulation exploits the density matrix associated with a branch of excitations that evolves continuously with its momentum ${\bf K}$, from which one may extract single-particle states allowing a construction of the QGD. We demonstrate the formulation using the single-mode approximation for excited states of two quantum Hall systems: the first for an integrally filled Landau level, and the second for a fractional quantum Hall state at filling factor $\nu=1/m$, with $m$ an odd integer. In both cases we obtain the same result for the QGD, which can be attributed to the translational invariance assumed of the system. Our study demonstrates that the QGD is an intrinsic property of collective modes which is valid beyond approximations one might make for their wavefunctions.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Stability of Relative Equilibria in Planar $N$-Vortex Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a sufficient condition for nonlinear stability of relative equilibria in the planar $N$-vortex problem. This result builds on our previous work on the Hamiltonian formulation of its relative dynamics as a Lie--Poisson system. The relative dynamics recasts the stability of relative equilibria of the $N$-vortex problem as that of the corresponding fixed points in the relative dynamics. We analyze the stability of such fixed points by exploiting the Hamiltonian formulation as well as invariants and constraints that naturally arise in the relative dynamics. The stability condition is essentially an Energy--Casimir method, except that we also incorporate the constraints in an effective manner. We apply the method to two types of relative equilibria: (i) three identical vortices at the vertices of an equilateral triangle along with another one at its center and (ii) four identical vortices at the vertices of a square with another one its center, where the circulation of the vortex at the center is arbitrary in both cases. We show that they are stable/unstable depending on the circulation of the vortex at the center.</description>

      <title>Exploring $G$-ality defects in 2-dim QFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Tambara-Yamagami (TY) fusion category symmetry $\text{TY}(\mathbb{A},\chi,\epsilon)$ describes the enhanced non-invertible self-duality symmetry of a $2$-dim QFT under gauging a finite Abelian group $\mathbb{A}$. We generalize the enhanced non-invertible symmetries by considering twisted gauging which allows stacking $\mathbb{A}$-SPT before and after the gauging. Such non-invertible symmetries correspond to invertible anyon permutation symmetries of the $3$-dim SymTFT. Consider a finite group $G$ formed by (un)twisted gaugings of $\mathbb{A}$, a $2$-dim QFT invariant under topological manipulations in $G$ admits non-invertible $\textit{$G$-ality defects}$. We study the classification and the physical implication of the $G$-ality defects using SymTFT and the group-theoretical fusion categories, with three concrete examples. 1) Triality with $\mathbb{A} = \mathbb{Z}_N \times \mathbb{Z}_N$ where $N$ is coprime with $3$. The classification is acquired previously by Jordan and Larson where the data is similar to the $\text{TY}$ fusion categories, and we determine the anomaly of these fusion categories. 2) $p$-ality with $\mathbb{A} = \mathbb{Z}_p \times \mathbb{Z}_p$ where $p$ is an odd prime. We consider two such categories $\mathcal{P}_{\pm,m}$ which are distinguished by different choices of the symmetry fractionalization, a new data that does not appear in the TY classification, and show that they have distinct anomaly structures and spin selection rules. 3) $S_3$-ality with $\mathbb{A} = \mathbb{Z}_N \times \mathbb{Z}_N$. We study their classification explicitly for $N &lt; 20$ via SymTFT, and provide a group-theoretical construction for certain $N$. We find $N=5$ is the minimal $N$ to admit an $S_3$-ality and $N=11$ is the minimal $N$ to admit a group-theoretical $S_3$-ality.</description>

      <title>Double dimers on planar hyperbolic graphs via circle packings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article we study the double dimer model on hyperbolic Temperleyan graphs via circle packings. We prove that on such graphs, the weak limit of the dimer model exists if and only if the removed black vertex from the boundary of the exhaustion converges to a point on the unit circle in the circle packing representation of the graph. One of our main results is that for such measures, we prove that the double dimer model has no bi-infinite path almost surely. Along the way we prove that the height function of the dimer model has double exponential tail and faces of height larger than k do not percolate for large enough k. The proof uses the connection between winding of uniform spanning trees and dimer heights, the notion of stationary random graphs, and the boundary theory of random walk on circle packings.</description>

      <title>An Alternative to Homotopy Transfer for $A_\infty$-Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel approach to the homotopy transfer procedure starting from a set of homotopy data such that the first differential complex is a differential graded module over the second one. We show that the module structure may be used to induce an $A_\infty$-algebra on the second differential complex, constructed in a similar fashion to the homotopy transfer $A_\infty$-algebra. We prove that, under certain conditions, the $A_\infty$-algebras obtained with this procedure are quasi-isomorphic to the homotopy transfer one. On the other hand, when the side conditions do not hold, we find that there are cases where the existence of an $A_\infty$-quasi-isomorphism with the homotopy transfer $A_\infty$-algebra is obstructed. In other words, we obtain a new $A_\infty$-algebra on the second complex, inequivalent to the homotopy transfer one. Lastly, we prove that these $A_\infty$-algebras are not infinitesimal Hochschild deformations of the homotopy transfer $A_\infty$-algebra.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we classify 1-cocycles of the Witt algebra with coefficients in the tensor product of two arbitrary tensor density modules. In a special case, we recover a theorem originally established by Ng and Taft in \cite{NT}. Furthermore, by these 1-cocycles, we determine Lie bialgebra structures over certain infinite-dimensional Lie algebras containing the Witt algebra.</description>

      <title>Integrability of open boundary driven quantum circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of Yang-Baxter integrability of doubled quantum circuit of qubits (spins 1/2) with open boundary conditions where the two circuit replicas are only coupled at the left or right boundary. We investigate the cases where the bulk is given by elementary six vertex unitary gates of either the free fermionic XX type or interacting XXZ type. By using the Sklyanin's construction of reflection algebra, we obtain the most general solutions of the boundary Yang-Baxter equation for such a setup. We use this solution to build, from the transfer matrix formalism, integrable circuits with two step discrete time Floquet (aka brickwork) dynamics. We prove that, only if the bulk is a free-model, the boundary matrices are in general non-factorizable, and for particular choice of free parameters yield non-trivial unitary dynamics with boundary interaction between the two chains. Then, we consider the limit of continuous time evolution and we give the interpretation of a restricted set of the boundary terms in the Lindbladian setting. Specifically, for a particular choice of free parameters, the solutions correspond to an open quantum system dynamics with the source terms representing injecting or removing particles from the boundary of the spin chain.</description>

      <title>A new spin on Hurwitz theory and ELSV via theta characteristics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2104.05697v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study spin Hurwitz numbers, which count ramified covers of the Riemann sphere with a sign coming from a theta characteristic. These numbers are known to be related to Gromov-Witten theory of K\"ahler surfaces and to representation theory of the Sergeev group, and are generated by BKP tau-functions. We use the latter interpretation to give polynomiality properties of these numbers and we derive a spectral curve which we conjecture computes spin Hurwitz numbers via a new type of topological recursion. We prove that this conjectural topological recursion is equivalent to an ELSV-type formula, expressing spin Hurwitz numbers in terms of the Chiodo class twisted by the $2$-spin Witten class.</description>

      <title>The Fermionic Entanglement Entropy and Area Law for the Relativistic Dirac Vacuum State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.03493v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the fermionic entanglement entropy for the free Dirac field in a bounded spatial region of Minkowski spacetime. In order to make the system ultraviolet finite, a regularization is introduced. An area law is proven in the limiting cases where the volume tends to infinity and/or the regularization length tends to zero. The technical core of the paper is to generalize a theorem of Harold Widom to pseudo-differential operators whose principal symbols develop a specific discontinuity at a single point.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03373v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Riemann-Hilbert approach, in conjunction with the canonical Wiener-Hopf factorisation of certain matrix functions called monodromy matrices, enables one to obtain explicit solutions to the non-linear field equations of some gravitational theories. These solutions are encoded in the elements of a matrix $M$ depending on the Weyl coordinates $\rho$ and $v$, determined by that factorisation. We address here, for the first time, the underlying question of what happens when a canonical Wiener-Hopf factorisation does not exist, using the close connection of Wiener-Hopf factorisation with Toeplitz operators to study this question. For the case of rational monodromy matrices, we prove that the non-existence of a canonical Wiener-Hopf factorisation determines curves in the $(\rho,v)$ plane on which some elements of $M(\rho,v)$ tend to infinity, but where the space-time metric may still be well behaved. In the case of uncharged rotating black holes in four space-time dimensions and, for certain choices of coordinates, in five space-time dimensions, we show that these curves correspond to their ergosurfaces.</description>

Abstract: We consider the two dimensional surface quasi-geostrophic equations with super-critical dissipation. For large initial data in critical Sobolev and Besov spaces, we prove optimal Gevrey regularity with the same decay exponent as the linear part. This settles several open problems in \cite{Bis14, BMS15}.</description>

      <title>$L^p$-boundedness of wave operators for bi-Schr\"odinger operators on the line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.04758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.04758v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to establishing several types of $L^p$-boundedness of wave operators $W_\pm=W_\pm(H, \Delta^2)$ associated with the bi-Schr\"odinger operators $H=\Delta^{2}+V(x)$ on the line $\mathbb{R}$. Given suitable decay potentials $V$, we firstly prove that the wave and dual wave operators are bounded on $L^p(\mathbb{R})$ for all $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$: $$ \|W_\pm f\|_{L^p(\mathbb{R})}+\|W_\pm^* f\|_{L^p(\mathbb{R})}\lesssim \|f\|_{L^p(\mathbb{R})},$$ which are further extended to the $L^p$-boundedness on the weighted spaces $L^p(\mathbb{R},w)$ with general even $A_p$-weights $w$ and to the boundedness on the Sobolev spaces $W^{s,p}(\mathbb{R})$. For the limiting case, we prove that $W_\pm$ are bounded from $L^1(\R)$ to $L^{1,\infty}(\R)$ as well as bounded from the Hardy space $\H^1(\R)$ to $L^1(\R)$. These results especially hold whatever the zero energy is a regular point or a resonance of $H$. We also obtain that $W_\pm$ are bounded from $L^\infty(\R)$ to $\BMO(\R)$ if zero is a regular point or a first kind resonance of $H$. Next, we show that $W_\pm$ are neither bounded on $L^1(\mathbb{R})$ nor on $L^\infty(\mathbb{R})$ even if zero is a regular point of $H$. Moreover, if zero is a second kind resonance of $H$, then $W_\pm$ are shown to be even not bounded from $L^\infty(\R)$ to $\BMO(\R)$ in general. In particular, we remark that our results give a complete picture of the validity of $L^p$-boundedness of the wave operators for all $1\le p\le \infty$ in the regular case. Finally, as applications, we deduce the $L^p$-$L^q$ decay estimates for the propagator $e^{-itH}P_{\mathrm{ac}}(H)$ with pairs $(1/p,1/q)$ belonging to a certain region of $\mathbb{R}^2$, as well as establish the H\"ormander-type $L^p$-boundedness theorem for the spectral multiplier $f(H)$.</description>

      <title>Construction and classification of crystalline topological superconductor and insulators in three-dimensional interacting fermion systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2204.13558v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The natural existence of crystalline symmetry in real materials manifests the importance of understanding crystalline symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases, especially for interacting systems. In this paper, we systematically construct and classify all the crystalline topological superconductors and insulators in three-dimensional (3D) interacting fermion systems using the novel concept of topological crystal. The corresponding higher-order topological surface theory can also be systematically studied via higher-order bulk-boundary correspondence. In particular, we discover an intriguing fact that almost all topological crystals with nontrivial 2D block states are intrinsically interacting topological phases that cannot be realized in any free-fermion systems. Moreover, the crystalline equivalence principle for 3D interacting fermionic systems is also verified, with an additional subtle "twist" on the spin of fermions.</description>

      <title>Entropy Constraints for Ground Energy Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.06855v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the use of von Neumann entropy constraints for obtaining lower bounds on the ground energy of quantum many-body systems. Known methods for obtaining certificates on the ground energy typically use consistency of local observables and are expressed as semidefinite programming relaxations. The local marginals defined by such a relaxation do not necessarily satisfy entropy inequalities that follow from the existence of a global state. Here, we propose to add such entropy constraints that lead to tighter convex relaxations for the ground energy problem. We give analytical and numerical results illustrating the advantages of such entropy constraints. We also show limitations of the entropy constraints we construct: they are implied by doubling the number of sites in the relaxation and as a result they can at best lead to a quadratic improvement in terms of the matrix sizes of the variables. We explain the relation to a method for approximating the free energy known as the Markov Entropy Decomposition method.</description>

      <title>On the relation between quantum walks and absolute zeta functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.14625v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantum walk is a quantum counterpart of the classical random walk. On the other hand, the absolute zeta function can be considered as a zeta function over F_1. This paper presents a connection between the quantum walk and the absolute zeta function. First we deal with a zeta function determined by a time evolution matrix of the Grover walk on a graph. The Grover walk is a typical model of the quantum walk. Then we prove that the zeta function given by the quantum walk is an absolute automorphic form of weight depending on the number of edges of the graph. Furthermore we consider an absolute zeta function for the zeta function based on a quantum walk. As an example, we compute an absolute zeta function for the cycle graph and show that it is expressed as the multiple gamma function of order 2.</description>

      <title>Buffon-Laplace Needle Problem with objects of arbitrary size in two and three dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06670v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Buffon-Laplace Needle Problem considers a needle of a length $l$ randomly dropped on a large plane with vertically parallel lines with distances $a$ and $b$ ($a \geqslant b$), respectively. As a classical problem in stochastic probability, it serves as a mathematical basis of various physical literature. Yet its potential application is limited by previous focus on its original form of the `short' needle case of $l &lt; b$. Here, rather than a `short' two-dimensional needle, we analytically solve the problems with two- and three-dimensional needles and spherocylinders of arbitrary length and radius dropped on a grid with any rectangular shape. We further confirm our analytical theory with Monte Carlo simulation. Our framework here helps to extend the analytical power of the needle problem into unexplored parameter regions for various physical problems involving stochastic processes.</description>

      <title>Integrable deformations of Rikitake systems, Lie bialgebras and bi-Hamiltonian structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01073v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Integrable deformations of a class of Rikitake dynamical systems are constructed by deforming their underlying Lie-Poisson Hamiltonian structures, which are considered linearizations of Poisson--Lie structures on certain (dual) Lie groups. By taking into account that there exists a one-to one correspondence between Poisson--Lie groups and Lie bialgebra structures, a number of deformed Poisson coalgebras can be obtained, which allow the construction of integrable deformations of coupled Rikitake systems. Moreover, the integrals of the motion for these coupled systems can be explicitly obtained by means of the deformed coproduct map. The same procedure can be also applied when the initial system is bi-Hamiltonian with respect to two different Lie-Poisson algebras. In this case, to preserve a bi-Hamiltonian structure under deformation, a common Lie bialgebra structure for the two Lie-Poisson structures has to be found. Coupled dynamical systems arising from this bi-Hamiltonian deformation scheme are also presented, and the use of collective `cluster variables', turns out to be enlightening in order to analyse their dynamical behaviour. As a general feature, the approach here presented provides a novel connection between Lie bialgebras and integrable dynamical systems.</description>

Abstract: Symplectic eigenvalues are known to satisfy analogs of several classic eigenvalue inequalities. Of these is a set of weak supermajorization relations concerning symplectic eigenvalues that are weaker analogs of some majorization relations corresponding to eigenvalues. The aim of this letter is to establish necessary and sufficient conditions for the saturation of the symplectic weak supermajorization relations by majorization.</description>

      <title>Fermionic quantum criticality through the lens of topological holography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09611v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We utilize the topological holographic framework to characterize and gain insights into the nature of quantum critical points and gapless phases in fermionic quantum systems. Topological holography is a general framework that describes the generalized global symmetry and the symmetry charges of a local quantum system in terms of a slab of a topological order, termed as the symmetry topological field theory (SymTFT), in one higher dimension. In this work, we consider a generalization of the topological holographic picture for $(1+1)d$ fermionic quantum phases of matter. We discuss how spin structures are encoded in the SymTFT and establish the connection between the formal fermionization formula in quantum field theory and the choice of fermionic gapped boundary conditions of the SymTFT. We demonstrate the identification and the characterization of the fermionic gapped phases and phase transitions through detailed analysis of various examples, including the fermionic systems with $\mathbb{Z}_{2}^{F}$, $\mathbb{Z}_{2} \times \mathbb{Z}_{2}^{F}$, $\mathbb{Z}_{4}^{F}$, and the fermionic version of the non-invertible $\text{Rep}(S_{3})$ symmetry. Our work uncovers many exotic fermionic quantum critical points and gapless phases, including two kinds of fermionic symmetry enriched quantum critical points, a fermionic gapless symmetry protected topological (SPT) phase, and a fermionic gapless spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) phase that breaks the fermionic non-invertible symmetry.</description>

      <title>Boundary-field formulation for transient electromagnetic scattering by dielectric scatterers and coated conductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05367v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine the transient scattered and transmitted fields generated when an incident electromagnetic wave impinges on a dielectric scatterer or a coated conductor embedded in an infinite space. By applying a boundary-field equation method, we reformulate the problem in the Laplace domain using the electric field equation inside the scatterer and a system of boundary integral equations for the scattered electric field in free space. To analyze this nonlocal boundary problem, we replace it by an equivalent boundary value problem. Existence, uniqueness and stability of the weak solution to the equivalent BVP are established in appropriate function spaces in terms of the Laplace transformed variable. The stability bounds are translated into time-domain estimates which determine the regularity of the solution in terms of the regularity of the problem data. These estimates can be easily converted into error estimates for a numerical discretization on the convolution quadrature for time evolution.</description>
