      <title>FedRBE -- a decentralized privacy-preserving federated batch effect correction tool for omics data based on limma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Batch effects in omics data obscure true biological signals and constitute a major challenge for privacy-preserving analyses of distributed patient data. Existing batch effect correction methods either require data centralization, which may easily conflict with privacy requirements, or lack support for missing values and automated workflows. To bridge this gap, we developed fedRBE, a federated implementation of limma's removeBatchEffect method. We implemented it as an app for the FeatureCloud platform. Unlike its existing analogs, fedRBE effectively handles data with missing values and offers an automated, user-friendly online user interface (https://featurecloud.ai/app/fedrbe). Leveraging secure multi-party computation provides enhanced security guarantees over classical federated learning approaches. We evaluated our fedRBE algorithm on simulated and real omics data, achieving performance comparable to the centralized method with negligible differences (no greater than 3.6E-13). By enabling collaborative correction without data sharing, fedRBE facilitates large-scale omics studies where batch effect correction is crucial.</description>

      <title>Timing consistency of T cell receptor activation in a stochastic model combining kinetic segregation and proofreading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: T cell receptor signaling must operate reliably under tight time constraints. While assuming quite different mechanisms, two prominent models of T cell receptor activation, kinetic segregation and kinetic proofreading, both introduce a distinct time scale. However, a clear understanding of whether and how those characteristic times give rise to a consistent timing of T cell receptor activation in the presence of stochastic fluctuations has been lacking so far. Here, using a simulation approach capable of modeling molecular interactions between adjacent cell membranes, we explore a stochastic model that combines elements of kinetic segregation and proofreading. Our simulations suggest that the two mechanisms interoperate, thereby rendering the corresponding stochastic times biologically functional. Receptor activation relies on rare molecular events that are not well characterized by the mean of the underlying probability density function. Yet, a consistent timing of receptor activation can be ensured by a modest number of proofreading steps.</description>

      <title>Different factors determining Motor Execution and Motor Imagery performance in a serial reaction time task with intrinsic variability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motor imagery corresponds to the mental practice of simulating visual and kinesthetic aspects of a given motor task. This practice shares a similar neural substrate and correlated temporal scale with motor execution. Besides that, it can lead to performance improvements in the actual execution of the imagined task. Therefore it is important to understand functional differences and equivalences between motor imagery and motor execution. To tackle that we employed a finger-tapping serial reaction time task in two groups of participants, a Motor Execution (n=10) and a Motor imagery (n=10). The sequence of stimuli defining the task had 750 items composed of three distinct auditory stimuli. Also, this sequence had some intrinsic variability making some of the next items unpredictable. Each auditory stimulus was mapped to a single right hand finger in the Motor Imagery group. The Motor imagery group indicated the end of the imagination with a single response using the left hand. The results show improvement in performance of the Motor Imagery group throughout the task and that the duration of the motor imagery, indirectly measured by reaction times, are influenced by distinct factors than those of Motor Execution.</description>

      <title>Order-disorder phase transition of cell membrane induced by THz irradiation studied via fluorescence recovery after photobleaching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To elucidate the mechanism by which THz radiation non-thermally affects living organisms, the lateral diffusion constants of lipid molecules in the cell membranes of HeLa cells were measured using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching under THz wave irradiation (THz-FRAP) at frequencies of 0.10, 0.29, and 0.48 THz, with power densities ranging from 20 to 89 mW/cm2. The potential heating effects of the THz irradiation were eliminated through temperature calibration using an ultrathin thermocouple, allowing for the investigation of the non-thermal effects of THz radiation. Irradiation at 0.10 and 0.29 THz induced an increase in diffusion constants at temperatures lower than the cell growth temperature. This suggests that THz irradiation induces the order-disorder phase transition of the cell membrane lipids by affecting the dynamics of bound water molecules. Our findings have important implications for the establishment of safety standards for THz radiation and for the potential development of new methods for cell manipulation using THz irradiation in the future</description>

      <title>An inferential measure of dependence between two systems using Bayesian model comparison</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06478v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose to quantify dependence between two systems $X$ and $Y$ in a dataset $D$ based on the Bayesian comparison of two models: one, $H_0$, of statistical independence and another one, $H_1$, of dependence. In this framework, dependence between $X$ and $Y$ in $D$, denoted $B(X,Y|D)$, is quantified as $P(H_1|D)$, the posterior probability for the model of dependence given $D$, or any strictly increasing function thereof. It is therefore a measure of the evidence for dependence between $X$ and $Y$ as modeled by $H_1$ and observed in $D$. We review several statistical models and reconsider standard results in the light of $B(X,Y|D)$ as a measure of dependence. Using simulations, we focus on two specific issues: the effect of noise and the behavior of $B(X,Y|D)$ when $H_1$ has a parameter coding for the intensity of dependence. We then derive some general properties of $B(X,Y|D)$, showing that it quantifies the information contained in $D$ in favor of $H_1$ versus $H_0$. While some of these properties are typical of what is expected from a valid measure of dependence, others are novel and naturally appear as desired features for specific measures of dependence, which we call inferential. We finally put these results in perspective; in particular, we discuss the consequences of using the Bayesian framework as well as the similarities and differences between $B(X,Y|D)$ and mutual information.</description>

      <title>Argentine ants regulate traffic flow with stopped individuals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigated the emerging traffic patterns of Argentine ants (Linepithema humile) as they navigated a narrow bridge between their nest and a food source. By tracking ant movements in experiments with varying bridge widths and colony sizes and analyzing the resulting trajectories, we discovered that a small subset of ants stopped for long periods of time, acting as obstacles and affecting traffic flow. Interestingly, the fraction of these stopped ants increased with wider bridges, suggesting a mechanism to reduce traffic flow to a narrower section of the bridge. To quantify transport efficiency, we measured the average speed of the ants on the bridge as a function of the pressure of ants arriving at the bridge, finding this relationship to be an increasing but saturating function of the pressure. We developed an agent-based model for ant movement and interactions to better understand these dynamics. Including stopped agents in the model was crucial to explaining the experimental observations. We further validated our hypothesis by introducing artificial obstacles on the bridges and found that our simulations accurately mirrored the experimental data when these obstacles were included. These findings provide new insights into how Argentine ants self-organize to manage traffic, highlighting a unique form of dynamic obstruction that enhances traffic flow in high-density conditions. This study advances our understanding of self-regulation in biological traffic systems and suggests potential applications for managing human traffic in congested environments.</description>

      <title>xTrimoPGLM: Unified 100B-Scale Pre-trained Transformer for Deciphering the Language of Protein</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06199v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Protein language models have shown remarkable success in learning biological information from protein sequences. However, most existing models are limited by either autoencoding or autoregressive pre-training objectives, which makes them struggle to handle protein understanding and generation tasks concurrently. We propose a unified protein language model, xTrimoPGLM, to address these two types of tasks simultaneously through an innovative pre-training framework. Our key technical contribution is an exploration of the compatibility and the potential for joint optimization of the two types of objectives, which has led to a strategy for training xTrimoPGLM at an unprecedented scale of 100 billion parameters and 1 trillion training tokens. Our extensive experiments reveal that 1) xTrimoPGLM significantly outperforms other advanced baselines in 18 protein understanding benchmarks across four categories. The model also facilitates an atomic-resolution view of protein structures, leading to an advanced 3D structural prediction model that surpasses existing language model-based tools. 2) xTrimoPGLM not only can generate de novo protein sequences following the principles of natural ones, but also can perform programmable generation after supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on curated sequences. These results highlight the substantial capability and versatility of xTrimoPGLM in understanding and generating protein sequences, contributing to the evolving landscape of foundation models in protein science.</description>

      <title>A statistical framework for detecting therapy-induced resistance from drug screens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18879v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Resistance to therapy remains a significant challenge in cancer treatment, often due to the presence of a stem-like cell population that drives tumor recurrence post-treatment. Moreover, many anticancer therapies induce plasticity, converting initially drug-sensitive cells to a more resistant state, e.g. through epigenetic processes and de-differentiation programs. Understanding the balance between therapeutic anti-tumor effects and induced resistance is critical for identifying treatment strategies. In this study, we introduce a robust statistical framework, based on multi-type branching process models of the evolutionary dynamics of tumor cell populations, to detect and quantify therapy-induced resistance phenomena from high throughput drug screening data. Through comprehensive in silico experiments, we show the efficacy of our framework in estimating parameters governing population dynamics and drug responses in a heterogeneous tumor population where cell state transitions are influenced by the drug. Finally, using recent in vitro data from multiple sources, we demonstrate that our framework is effective for analyzing real-world data and generating meaningful predictions.</description>

      <title>Generative Humanization for Therapeutic Antibodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04737v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Antibody therapies have been employed to address some of today's most challenging diseases, but must meet many criteria during drug development before reaching a patient. Humanization is a sequence optimization strategy that addresses one critical risk called immunogenicity - a patient's immune response to the drug - by making an antibody more "human-like" in the absence of a predictive lab-based test for immunogenicity. However, existing humanization strategies generally yield very few humanized candidates, which may have degraded biophysical properties or decreased drug efficacy. Here, we re-frame humanization as a conditional generative modeling task, where humanizing mutations are sampled from a language model trained on human antibody data. We describe a sampling process that incorporates models of therapeutic attributes, such as antigen binding affinity, to obtain candidate sequences that have both reduced immunogenicity risk and maintained or improved therapeutic properties, allowing this algorithm to be readily embedded into an iterative antibody optimization campaign. We demonstrate in silico and in lab validation that in real therapeutic programs our generative humanization method produces diverse sets of antibodies that are both (1) highly-human and (2) have favorable therapeutic properties, such as improved binding to target antigens.</description>
