      <title>Numerically Discovered Inherent States are Always Protocol Dependent in Jammed Packings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The energy landscape for soft sphere packings exists in a high-dimensional space and plays host to an astronomical number of local minima in a hierarchical and ultrametric arrangement. Each point in the landscape is a configuration that can be unambiguously mapped to its inherent state, defined as the local minimum that the configuration will flow to under perfectly overdamped continuous dynamics. Typically, discrete in time dynamics are used to computationally find local minima, but it is not known whether these algorithms are capable of reliably finding inherent states. Here, we use steepest descent dynamics to find the distribution of the largest time step, $\delta_\textrm{best}$, which finds the inherent state. We find that for systems of $N$ particles, $\delta_\textrm{best}$ is approximately proportional to $N^{-3}$, and weakly dependent on d and $\varphi$. We argue that the proportionality is due to saddle points in the energy landscape. Our results suggest that it is impossible, in practice, to reliably find inherent states for systems of about 64 particles or more.</description>

      <title>Rigidity paradox of kirigami arches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The geometry of bending-active kirigami arches, decorated by cuts and holes, is strongly influenced by the location and geometry of the perforations. This study demonstrates that, in some instances, the geometric stiffening induced by additional cuts can outweigh the weakening effect of material removal, leading to a counterintuitive increase in structural rigidity under a given concentrated load. We present multiple parametric cut patterns to show that rigidity can be increased both under symmetric and asymmetric loads. While the preferred cut location is often near the point of action of the load, asymmetric loading can shift this optimum elsewhere. Moreover, the distance between the supports also plays a crucial role, namely, the rigidity gain vanishes when the supports are too far apart. We found that the rigidity can be increased for both non-perforated and perforated sheets, and there is a non-monotonic relationship between the global porosity and the rigidity of the structure. Numerical predictions are validated against experimental measurements.</description>

      <title>Dimensional analysis for clogging of grains in two and three dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conduct standard dimensional analysis (Vaschy--Buckingham $\Pi$-theorem) for the mean avalanche size $\langle s \rangle$ when particles flow through, and clog at, a small orifice on the base of a flat-bottomed silo. We consider the effect of particle diameter $d$, orifice diameter $D$, particle density $\rho$, particle Young's modulus $E$ and acceleration of gravity $g$. We both perform discrete element method simulations and compile available data in the literature in order to sample the parameter space. We find that our simulations and data across many experiments and simulations of frictional grains are consistent with the scaling equation $\ln (\langle s \rangle+1) = A_\alpha (D/d-1)^{\alpha} + B_\alpha \sqrt{\rho g d / E}$, where $A_\alpha$ and $B_\alpha$ are empirical constants and $\alpha$ is the dimensionality of the system ($\alpha=2$ and $\alpha=3$ for 2D and 3D, respectively). This expression successfully synthesizes the clogging behavior of a number of related clogging systems and motivates future extensions to more complex configurations involving, for example, very low friction particles or external vibrations.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Nonlinear Rheology of Composite Hydrogels: A New Paradigm for LAOS Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate composite biopolymer networks composed of co-polymerized fibrin and gelatin networks and perform rheological measurements over a broad parameter space including strain amplitudes that go beyond the linear response regime. One goal of the work presented here is to provide a prototypical biocomposite material with highly separable polymerization times and controlled nonlinear rheological characteristics. We then extend the Sequence of Physical Processes (SPP)\cite{Rogers2017} into a statistical and geometrical framework that fingerprints the nonlinear rheological response of biopolymer composite gels. Our analysis is based on the changes in the shape of the time-dependent Cole-Cole plots that allow to reduce the time resolved analysis of the SPP method into the transition between linear and nonlinear behavior as the rheological parameters are varied. While the results clearly highlight how the mechanical responses of individual constituents are not simply additive, our extended SPP analysis provides a robust and intuitive classification scheme for comparing the nonlinear response of composite materials subjected to large oscillatory strain.</description>

      <title>Pressure in active matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the last decade, the study of pressure in active matter has attracted growing attention due to its fundamental relevance to nonequilibrium statistical physics. Active matter systems are composed of particles that consume energy to sustain persistent motion, which are inherently far from equilibrium. These particles can exhibit complex behaviors, including motility-induced phase separation, density-dependent clustering, and anomalous stress distributions, motivating the introduction of active swim stress and swim pressure. Unlike in passive fluids, pressure in active systems emerges from momentum flux originated from swim force rather than equilibrium conservative interactions, offering a distinct perspective for understanding their mechanical response. Simple models of active Brownian particles (ABPs) have been employed in theoretical and simulation studies across both dilute and dense regimes, revealing that pressure is a state function and exhibits a nontrivial dependence on density. Together with nonequilibrium statistical concepts such as effective temperature and effective adhesion, pressure offers important insight for understanding behaviors in active matter such as sedimentation equilibrium and motility induced phase separation. Extensions of ABPs models beyond their simplest form have underscored the fragility of pressure-based equation of state, which can break down under factors such as density-dependent velocity, torque, complex boundary geometries and interactions. Building on these developments, this review provides a comprehensive survey of theoretical and experimental advances, with particular emphasis on the microscopic origins of active pressure and the mechanisms underlying the breakdown of the equation of state.</description>

      <title>Self-propulsion via non-transitive phase coexistence in chemically active mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase separation drives the formation of biomolecular condensates in cells, which comprise many components and sometimes possess multiple phases. The equilibrium physics of phase separation is well understood, but many components in condensates undergo active reactions. We demonstrate that such reactions affect phase separation by altering the chemical potential balance and by introducing an osmotic pressure difference at interfaces. However, the system does not permit a pseudo-pressure balance, and bulk compositions depend on which phases are in contact. Moreover, phase coexistence is no longer transitive, which enables self-propelled phases and more complex dynamics.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of phase separation in non-local elastic networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase separation of a liquid mixture embedded within an elastic network is relevant to a wide range of natural and industrial systems, including biomolecular condensates interacting with the cytoskeleton, structural colouring in bird feathers, and gas bubbles forming within soft sediments. Recent experiments in synthetic polymer gels have demonstrated that when the size of phase-separated domains is comparable to the characteristic pore size of the network, a patterned phase with a well-defined length scale may emerge. Theoretical works based on an equilibrium approach have attributed this pattern formation to non-local elastic effects arising from heterogeneity of the underlying network. Here, we extend these ideas by developing a dynamic theory in which phase separation is coupled to non-local elasticity via the framework of large-deformation poroelasticity. We study our model via both linear stability analysis and numerical simulation, identifying the parameter space in which phase separation occurs, and investigating the impact of different elasticity models. We find that although local elasticity can inhibit phase separation and affect domain count, it is unable to completely suppress coarsening. In contrast, non-local elasticity arrests coarsening to form patterned domains with a well-defined length scale that decreases with increasing stiffness. Our modelling framework thus paves the way for quantitative comparisons between simulations and experiments, for example by considering a strain-stiffening network rheology.</description>

      <title>Binary Mixtures in Linear Convection Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We numerically investigated the dynamics of a mixture of finite-size active and passive particles in a linear array of convection rolls. The interplay of advection and steric interactions produces a number of interesting effects, like the stirring of a passive colloidal fluid by a small fraction of slow active particles, or the separation of the mixture active and passive colloidal fractions by increasing the motility of the active one, which eventually clusters in stagnation areas along the array walls. These mechanisms are quantitatively characterized by studying the dependence of the diffusion constants of the active and passive particles on the parameters of the active mixture fraction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We formulate a kinetic theory of two species of hard spheres which can undergo collisions converting chemical energy into kinetic energy. As the two species represent birds and air, this reactive collision mimics birds flapping their wings, allowing for their propulsion. We demand microscopic reversibility of the reactive collisions. We then introduce a chemostat to drive the system out of equilibrium. When the chemostat is sufficiently turned on and one restricts to grazing interspecies collisions, the momentum damping term can turn into a momentum growth term, hinting at a flocking transition.</description>

      <title>Ratchet effect and jamming in dense mixtures of active and passive colloids in narrow pores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the framework of generalized exclusion processes we study mixtures of passive and active particles interacting by steric repulsion. The particles move in a pore with periodically modulated aperture, which is modeled by a quasi-one-dimensional channel with periodic tooth-shaped profile. Internal driving of the active particles induces a ratchet current of these particles. In the current-density diagram, we observe three main regimes: of free flow; of thermally activated processes; of spinodal decomposition. When the density of particles is increased, we observe a transition to jammed state, where the ratchet current is substantially reduced. In time evolution, the transition to jammed state is seen as sudden drop of current at certain time. The probability distribution of these jamming times follows an exponential law. The average jamming time depends itself exponentially on the density of active particles. The coefficient in this exponential is nearly independent of the switching rate of the active particles as well as on the presence or absence of passive particles. Due to the interaction, the current of active particles imposes a drag on the passive particles. In the limit of both large systems and long times, the current of passive particles has always the same direction as the ratchet current of active particles. However, during the evolution of the system we observe very slow (logarithmic in time) approach to the asymptotic value, sometimes accompanied by current reversal, i.e. current of active and passive particles may go in opposite direction.</description>

      <title>Energetics-based model for a diffusiophoretic motion of a deformable droplet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a mathematical model for a diffusiophoretic motion of a deformable droplet, which is floating at a liquid surface and is driven by the surface tension gradient originating from the surface concentration field of the chemicals that are emitted from the droplet. We define the free energy of the system by including the surface and line energies. From the calculation of the functional of the free energy, we obtain a mathematical model for the diffusiophoretic motion with deformation. By only considering the deformation of the second mode, we explicitly derived the time-evolution equations for the translational motion and the elliptic deformation. We found three stable states: an immobile circular droplet, an immobile elliptically deformed droplet, and a moving droplet with the elliptic deformation in which the minor axis meets the motion direction, and discussed the transition between these three stable states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The system of driven dense colloid mixtures is studied in one-, two- and three-dimensional geometries. We calculate the diffusion coefficients and mobilities for each particle type, including cross-terms, in a hydrodynamic limit, using a mean-field-type approximation. The set of non-linear diffusion equations are then solved. In one dimension, analytical results are possible. We show that in mixtures, the ``Brazil nut'' phenomenon, or depletion of larger particles by force of smaller ones, appears quite generically. We calculate the ratchet current and quantify the capability of sorting particles according to their size. We also indicate that the ``Brazil nut'' effect lies behind the possibility of perfect separation, where large and big particles travel in strictly opposite direction.</description>

      <title>Short-range and long-range correlations in driven dense colloidal mixtures in narrow pores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09718v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The system of driven dense colloid mixture in a tube with diameter comparable with particle size is modeled by a generalization of asymmetric simple exclusion (ASEP) model. The generalization goes in two directions: relaxing the exclusion constraint by allowing several (but few) particles on a site, and by considering two species of particles, which differ by size and transport coefficients. We calculate the nearest-neighbor correlations using a variant of Kirkwood approximation and show by comparison with numerical simulations that the approximation provides quite accurate results. However, for long-range correlations, we show that the Kirkwood approximation is useless, as it predicts exponential decay of the density-density correlation function with distance, while simulation data indicate that the decay is algebraic. For one-component system, we show that the decay is governed by a power law with universal exponent close to 2. In two-component system, the correlation function behaves in more complicated manner; its sign oscillates but the envelope decays again very slowly and the decay is compatible with power-law with exponent somewhat lower than 2. Therefore, our generalization of ASEP belongs to different universality class than the ensemble of generalized ASEP models which are mappable to zero-range processes.</description>

      <title>Ultrastable jammed sphere packings with a wide range of particle dispersities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16521v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that for a standard continuously-polydisperse model with particle-diameter distribution $P(\sigma) \propto \sigma^{-3}$ and polydispersity index $\Delta$, employing a combination of standard SWAP moves and transient degree of freedom (TDOF) moves during a Lubachevsky-Stillinger-like particle-growth process dramatically increases the generated packings' jamming densities $\phi_{\rm J}(\Delta)$ and coordination numbers $Z_{\rm J}(\Delta)$, for a wide range of $\Delta$. The fractional increase in $\phi_{\rm J}(\Delta)$ obtained by employing these moves first increases rapidly with $\Delta$, then plateaus at $6-7\%$ over the range $0.10 \lesssim \Delta \leq 50$; the obtained $\phi_{\rm J}$ are as high as $0.747$ (for $\Delta = 0.50$). These density increases are achieved without producing clearly-noticeable crystallization or increased fractionation, despite the fact that the packings are quite hyperstatic for all $\Delta &gt; 0$. SWAP and TDOF moves also reduce packings' rattler populations by as much as 99% and increase their bulk moduli by as much as 80%.</description>

      <title>Emergence of a Boundary-Sensitive Phase in Hyperbolic Ising Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21044v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Physical systems defined on hyperbolic lattices may exhibit phases of matter that only emerge due to negative curvature. We focus on the case of the Ising model under open boundary conditions and show that an ``intermediate'' phase emerges in addition to standard (high-temperature) paramagnetic and (low-temperature) ferromagnetic phases. When performing the Kramers-Wannier duality the fact that it alters boundary conditions becomes crucial, since a finite fraction of lattice sites lie on the boundary. We propose to characterize this ``intermediate'' phase by its sensitivity to boundary conditions, wherein bulk ordering is not spontaneous but rather induced by boundary effects, setting it apart from the Landau paradigm of spontaneous symmetry breaking. By developing a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry restricted extension of the Corner Transfer Matrix Renormalization Group method, we provide numerical evidence for the existence of all three distinct phases and their corresponding two-stage phase transitions, thereby establishing the complete phase diagram. We also establish how the (spontaneous) intermediate-to-ferromagnetic and the (induced) paramagnetic-to-intermediate transition points are related by the Kramers-Wannier duality relation. We discuss a holographic correspondence between boundary and bulk behaviors and derive exact expressions for boundary correlation functions on Cayley trees.</description>
