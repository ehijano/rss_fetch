      <title>Evolution of self-gravitating spherical dark-matter halos with and without new physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an efficient numerical algorithm for evolving self-gravitating systems of dark-matter particles that leverages the assumption of spherical symmetry to reduce the nominally six-dimensional phase space to three dimensions. It can be used to quickly determine numerically the evolution of an initially static stable self-consistent self-gravitating system if there is some additional or new physics. We illustrate here with four examples: (1) the effects of the growth of a supermassive black hole at the center; (2) the effects of stripping of the outer layers of the halo (a toy model for the effects of tidal stripping of galaxies); (3) the response of a self-gravitating system to dark matter that decays to a slightly less massive state; and (4) the effects of a slow change to Newton's constant. The approach can be extended to study dark matter with elastic and inelastic self-interactions and to study the process of virialization in spherical collapse. We describe some aspects of a code NSphere that implements this approach which we are making available.</description>

      <title>Probing the Kinematics of Multiple- and Single-Protostar Systems in Perseus with N2H+</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the dense gas kinematics in two Class 0/I protostellar cores, Per 30 and NGC 1333 IRAS 7, in the Perseus molecular cloud to determine whether their velocity structures are indicative of rotation. We examine the hyperfine structure of the N2H+ J=1-0 transition by combining 3" (900 AU) Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) measurements with 9" (2700 AU) measurements from the Green Bank Telescope (GBT). We use the CASA Feather method to combine these data in order to maximize our sensitivity across spatial scales. We fit the N2H+ spectra to constrain the centroid velocity of the gas at each pixel and use these values to calculate the linear velocity gradient and specific angular momentum within apertures centered on each protostar with radii ranging from 5-60". Our results indicate that the velocity structure probed by the N2H+ emission is likely not a result of core rotation. These findings are consistent with other studies in the literature which indicate rotation is often not evident on scales less than 1000 AU. We instead suggest that the velocity structure we see is a result of torques caused by irregular density distributions in these protostellar systems.</description>

      <title>Spatially resolved [CII]-gas conversion factor in early galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Determining how efficiently gas collapses into stars at high-redshift is key to understanding galaxy evolution in the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). Globally, this process is quantified by the gas depletion time ($t_{dep}$); on resolved scales, by the slope and normalization of the Kennicutt-Schmidt (KS) relation. This work explores the global ($\alpha_{[CII]}$) and spatially resolved ($W_{[CII]}$) [CII]-to-gas conversion factors at high-$z$ and their role in inferring reliable gas masses, surface densities, and $t_{dep}$ in the EoR. We select galaxies at 4&lt;z&lt;9 from the SERRA cosmological zoom-in simulation, that features on-the-fly radiative transfer and resolves interstellar medium properties down to $\approx$30 pc. The [CII] emission modelling from photodissociation regions allow us to derive global $\alpha_{ [CII]}$, and maps of $W_{[CII]}$. We study their dependence on gas metallicity (Z), density (n), Mach number (M), and burstiness parameter ($k_s$), and provide best fit relations. The $\alpha_{[CII]}$ decreases with increasing $Z$ and galaxy compactness, while the resolved $W_{[CII]}$ shows two regimes: at $Z&lt; 0.2 Z_\odot$, it anticorrelates with n and Z, but not with $k_s$; above this threshold, it also depends on $k_s$, with more bursty regions showing lower conversion factors. This implies $W_{[CII]}\propto \Sigma_{[CII]}^{-0.5}$, as dense, metal-rich, and bursty regions exhibit higher [CII] surface brightness. Applying a constant $\alpha_{[CII]}$ overestimates $\Sigma_{gas}$ in bright $\Sigma_{[CII]}$ patches, thus flattening the KS slope and overestimating $t_{dep}$ by a factor of $\approx$4.</description>

      <title>Brightness and colour variability in NLSy1s versus BLSy1s and QSOs using the ZTF survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), with its extensive optical monitoring capabilities, has provided an unprecedented opportunity to study the long-term variability of active galactic nuclei (AGNs). In this work, we present a comparative analysis of optical colour and brightness variability for $\mathrm{log(L_{Bol})}-z$ matched samples, consisting of 2095 Narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies similar to Broad-line Seyfert 1s (NLSy1_A) and 538 NLSy1_B galaxies matched with quasars (QSOs). The corresponding respective control samples of consist of 2380 Broad-line Seyfert 1 (BLSy1) galaxies and 741 QSOs. Using over six years of r-band and g-band light curves from the ZTF Data Release 22 (DR22), we characterize flux variability, fractional flux variability, and amplitude of temporal variability for each source in the samples. Our results indicate that BLSy1 galaxies exhibit significantly stronger variability compared to NLSy1_As, and similarly, QSOs show more variability than do NLSy1_Bs. To probe colour variability, we utilize quasi-simultaneous light curves, with half-hour epoch differences between $g$- and $r$-band measurements where colour index was evaluated using linear regression in magnitude-magnitude space. We find that large majorities of these sources -- 96% of NLSy1_A, 95% of BLSy1, 94% of NLSy1_B, and 91% of QSOs -- exhibit a clear "bluer-when-brighter" (BWB) trend. Furthermore, rest-frame structure function analysis reveals that BLSy1 galaxies are $1.42\pm0.06$ times more variable than NLSy1_A, while QSOs are $1.41\pm0.01$ times more variable than NLSy1_B. These results can provide valuable insights into the variability properties of AGN subclasses and their underlying physical drivers.</description>

      <title>Long-term multiwavelength observations of 1ES 1218+304: physical implications of the flux and spectral variability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the results of a detailed timing and spectral analysis of the TeV-detected blazar 1ES 1218+304, focused on the observations performed with the different instruments onboard the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory in the period 2005-2024. The source showed various strengths of X-ray flaring activity and 0.3-10\,keV states differing by a factor up to 20 in brightness, exceeding a level of 2.7$\times$10$^{-10}$erg cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ and representing the 3rd brightest blazar during the strongest flare. We detected tens of intraday variability instances, the majority of which occurred on sub-hour timescales and were consistent with the shock-in-jet scenario. The spectral properties were strongly and fastly variable, characterized by a frequent occurrence of very hard photon indices in the 0.3-10 keV and Fermi 0.3-300 GeV bands. The source exhibited very fast transitions of logparabolic-to-powerlaw spectra or conversely, possibly caused by changes of magnetic field properties over small spatial scales or by turbulence-driven relativistic magnetic reconnection. We detected various spectral features, which demonstrate the importance of the first-order Fermi mechanism operating by the magnetic field of changing confinement efficiencies and by the electron populations with different initial energy distributions, stochastic acceleration and cooling processes. In some periods, the source showed a softening at higher GeV-band energies, possibly due to the inverse-Compton upscatter of X-ray photons in the Klein-Nishina regime reflected in the positive correlation between X-ray and high-energy emissions.</description>

      <title>The LUNIS-AGN Catalog: Trends of emission line velocity dispersion and surface brightness within the circumnuclear regions of Seyfert galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a catalog of Local Universe Near-Infrared Seyfert (LUNIS) \textit{K-}band integral field unit (IFU) data of 88 nearby Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), curated from SINFONI/VLT and OSIRIS/Keck archival datasets. This catalog includes both type 1 and 2 Seyfert AGN probed down to scales of tens of parsecs with z $&lt;$ 0.02 and spanning over five orders of magnitude in L$_{14-195keV}$ AGN luminosity. As part of this catalog we make publicly available for all galaxies the processed datacubes, a central 200 pc integrated spectrum, and two-dimensional maps of flux, velocity, and velocity dispersion for H$_2$ 1-0 S(1) 2.1218 $\mu$m, [Si VI] 1.9641 $\mu$m, and Br-$\gamma$ 2.1655 $\mu$m. The morphology and geometry of [Si VI], a tracer of AGN outflows, are reported for the 66$\%$ of galaxies with extended emission. We utilize this large sample to probe the behavior of molecular and ionized gas, identifying trends in the properties of the circumnuclear gas (surface brightness and velocity dispersion) with fundamental AGN properties (obscuration and X-ray luminosity). While there is significant variation in circumnuclear gas characteristics across the sample, we find molecular hydrogen to be less centrally concentrated and exhibit lower velocity dispersion relative to ionized gas. In addition, we find elevated molecular hydrogen surface brightness and decreased [Si VI] velocity dispersion in obscured relative to unobscured AGN. The [Si VI] and Br-$\gamma$ emission scale with L$_{14-195keV}$ X-ray luminosity, which, along with the elevated velocity dispersion compared to the molecular gas, verifies an association with AGN outflow processes.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Classification of Young Stellar Objects and Evolved Stars in the Magellanic Clouds Using the Probabilistic Random Forest Classifier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Magellanic Clouds (MCs) are excellent locations to study stellar dust emission and its contribution to galaxy evolution. Through spectral and photometric classification, MCs can serve as a unique environment for studying stellar evolution and galaxies enriched by dusty stellar point sources. We applied machine learning classifiers to spectroscopically labeled data from the Surveying the Agents of Galaxy Evolution (SAGE) project, which involved 12 multiwavelength filters and 618 stellar objects at the MCs. We classified stars into five categories: young stellar objects (YSOs), carbon-rich asymptotic giant branch (CAGB) stars, oxygen-rich AGB (OAGB) stars, red supergiants (RSG), and post-AGB (PAGB) stars. Following this, we augmented the distribution of imbalanced classes using the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE). Therefore, the Probabilistic Random Forest (PRF) classifier achieved the highest overall accuracy, reaching ${89\%}$ based on the recall metric, in categorizing dusty stellar sources before and after data augmentation. In this study, SMOTE did not impact the classification accuracy for the CAGB, PAGB, and RSG categories but led to changes in the performance of the OAGB and YSO classes.</description>

      <title>Dusty stellar sources classification by implementing machine learning methods based on spectroscopic observations in the Magellanic Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dusty stellar point sources are a significant stage in stellar evolution and contribute to the metal enrichment of galaxies. These objects can be classified using photometric and spectroscopic observations with color-magnitude diagrams (CMD) and infrared excesses in spectral energy distributions (SED). We employed supervised machine learning spectral classification to categorize dusty stellar sources, including young stellar objects (YSOs) and evolved stars (oxygen- and carbon-rich asymptotic giant branch stars, AGBs), red supergiants (RSGs), and post-AGB (PAGB) stars in the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds, based on spectroscopic labeled data from the Surveying the Agents of Galaxy Evolution (SAGE) project, which used 12 multiwavelength filters and 618 stellar objects. Despite missing values and uncertainties in the SAGE spectral datasets, we achieved accurate classifications. To address small and imbalanced spectral catalogs, we used the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) to generate synthetic data points. Among models applied before and after data augmentation, the Probabilistic Random Forest (PRF), a tuned Random Forest (RF), achieved the highest total accuracy, reaching $\mathbf{89\%}$ based on recall in categorizing dusty stellar sources. Using SMOTE does not improve the best model's accuracy for the CAGB, PAGB, and RSG classes; it remains $\mathbf{100\%}$, $\mathbf{100\%}$, and $\mathbf{88\%}$, respectively, but shows variations for OAGB and YSO classes. We also collected photometric labeled data similar to the training dataset, classifying them using the top four PRF models with over $\mathbf{87\%}$ accuracy. Multiwavelength data from several studies were classified using a consensus model integrating four top models to present common labels as final predictions.</description>

      <title>Search for the possible members of the open cluster NGC 3532 with poor astrometric solutions of Gaia DR3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We performed star counts in the region of the open cluster NGC 3532. The ranges of trigonometric parallaxes and proper motions containing all the stars of the cluster were determined using the stars with 5- and 6-parameter Gaia DR3 solutions. The estimated radius of the cluster was R_c=178+-3 arcminutes and the number of cluster stars was N_c=2200+-40. We estimate the number of stars with poor astrometric solutions that may be members of the cluster. For this purpose, we analyze the surface density distribution of stars with two-parameter Gaia DR3 solutions, stars with the parameter RUWE&gt;1.4, and stars with large relative errors of trigonometric parallaxes in the vicinity of the cluster. We are looking for stars that fall within the area of the color-magnitude diagram occupied by probable members of the NGC 3532 cluster from the Hant&amp;Reffert sample. The radial surface density profile plotted with such stars shows the concentration of stars toward the cluster center. An analysis of the profile yields an estimate of 2150+-230 stars that may be cluster members. Thus, nearly one half of cluster members can be lost when the probable members are selected only by exact astrometric data of Gaia DR3. Among these lost stars, there may be a significant number of unresolved binary and multiple systems.</description>

      <title>Extreme Neutral Outflow in an Inactive Quenching Galaxy at z$\sim$1.3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have discovered a substantial sodium doublet (Na D $\lambda\lambda$5890, 5896\AA)-traced neutral outflow in a quenching galaxy JADES-GS-206183 at $z=1.317$ in GOODS-S field. Its JWST NIRSpec/MSA spectrum shows a significantly blueshifted and deep Na D absorption, revealing a neutral outflow with a velocity of $v_{\rm out}=828^{+79}_{-49}\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$ and a mass outflow rate of $\log(\dot{M}_{\rm out}/\mathrm{M_{\odot}\,yr^{-1}})=2.40^{+0.11}_{-0.16}$. The mass outflow rate of this outflow is higher than any of the neutral outflows identified previously beyond $z\sim1$ by the same line diagnostic and is comparable with those in local galaxies with extremely strong star formation activities or luminous AGN. Nonetheless, the best-fit SED modeling of JADES-GS-206183, based on its multi-band photometry from HST/ACS to JWST/NIRCam, suggests that the host galaxy now is quenched, and the Paschen $\alpha$ (Pa$\alpha$) emission in the FRESCO NIRCam grism spectrum confirms its current low star formation rate ($10.78\pm 0.55\,\mathrm{M_{\odot}\,yr^{-1}}$). More surprisingly, optical line ratio diagnostics indicate that the current AGN activity of JADES-GS-206183, if present, is weak. Even though we tentatively detect a broad component of the H$\alpha$ line, it is more likely tracing the ionized outflow than an AGN. The results demonstrate that the Na D outflow in JADES-GS-206183 is highly unlikely to be driven by current star formation or nuclear activity. Instead, we propose that the outflow that we are witnessing in JADES-GS-206183 may be a long-lasting fossil outflow, powered by previous AGN activity that has recently shut down.</description>

      <title>Systematic search for blue hyper-velocity stars from LAMOST survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hypervelocity stars (HVSs) represent a unique class of objects capable of escaping the gravitational pull of the Milky Way due to extreme acceleration events, such as close encounters with the supermassive black hole at the Galactic center (GC), supernova explosions in binary systems, or multi-body dynamical interactions. Finding and studying HVSs are crucial to exploring these ejection mechanisms, characterizing central black holes, probing the GC environment, and revealing the distribution of dark matter in our galaxy. The Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) spectroscopic surveys have so far identified four B-type unbound HVSs. To expand this sample with the second-phase LAMOST survey that started in 2018, we conducted a systematic search for early-type HVSs using the LAMOST Data Release 10. We identified 125 early-type high-velocity candidates with total velocities exceeding 300 km\,s$^{-1}$. Among them, we report ten new unbound B- and A-type hypervelocity star (HVS) candidates (designated LAMOST-HVS5 through LAMOST-HVS14), tripling the number of unbound HVSs previously identified by LAMOST. Kinematic analyses suggest that these newly discovered HVS candidates likely originated either from the Galactic Center or via dynamical interactions. Future high-resolution follow-up observations promise to refine the stellar parameters, distances, and elemental abundances of these candidates, thereby providing deeper insights into their origins and broadening their potential applications across astrophysics.</description>

Observations of the NH3(1,1) and (2,2) inversion transitions were obtained using the Nanshan 26 m radio telescope, while HCO+ (1-0), 12CO, 13CO, and C18O(1-0) transitions from the Purple Mountain Observatory Delingha 14 m telescope. Archival data are also included. We identified key observational signatures of CCC, including complementary spatial distributions, U-shaped structures, bridge features, and V-shaped velocity distributions. The position-velocity diagrams (P-V) reveal clear indications of gas interaction between two velocity components, suggesting an ongoing collision at an estimated angle of approximately 45 degree to the line of sight. The estimated collision timescale is 0.35-1.03 Myr, aligned with the inferred ages of young stellar objects (YSOs) in the region, supporting the hypothesis of collision-induced star formation. Hub-filament system (HFS) are identified in the compressed gas region, where filaments converge toward a dense hub, suggesting the CCC as a potential driver of HFS formation and massive star formation. The high column density suggests favorable conditions for the formation of massive stars. Although alternative kinematic drivers such as longitudinal collapse and shear motion are considered, CCC remains the most plausible explanation for the observed features. Our findings contribute to our understanding of the mechanisms of cloud dynamics and massive star formation in turbulent molecular environments.</description>

      <title>Ultra-diffuse galaxies in the EAGLE simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14973v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the highest-resolution EAGLE simulation, Recal-L025N0752, to study the properties and formation of ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs). We identify 181 UDGs and find their properties closely match observations. The total masses of EAGLE UDGs range from ${\sim}5\times 10^{8}~M_{\odot}$ to ${\sim}2\times 10^{11}~M_{\odot}$, indicating that they are dwarf galaxies rather than failed $L_\star$ galaxies. EAGLE UDGs are not a distinct population, but rather a subset of dwarf galaxies, as their properties generally form a continuous distribution with those of normal dwarf galaxies. Unlike the situations in previous studies, the extended sizes of field UDGs in EAGLE are not driven by high halos spin or by supernova-induced stellar expansion, but instead largely arise from high spins in their star-forming gas and thus the newly formed stars at large radii. This might be attributed to galactic fountains, by which star-forming gas are launched to large halo-centric distances and acquire additional angular momentum through interactions with the circumgalactic medium. For satellite UDGs, ${\sim} 60 \%$ of them were already UDGs before falling into the host galaxy, while the remaining ${\sim} 40\%$ were normal galaxies prior to infall and subsequently transformed into UDGs due to tidal effects after infall.</description>

      <title>Dust-obscured Galaxies with Broken Power-law Spectral Energy Distributions Discovered by UNIONS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of infrared-bright dust-obscured galaxies (DOGs) with $(i - [22])_{\rm AB} \geq 7.0$. Using photometry from the deep and wide Ultraviolet Near-Infrared Optical Northern Survey, combined with near-IR and mid-IR data from the UKIRT Infrared Deep Sky Survey and the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, we successfully identified 382 DOGs in $\sim$ 170 deg$^2$. Among them, the vast majority (376 DOGs) were classified into two subclasses: bump DOGs (132/376) and power-law (PL) DOGs (244/376), which are dominated by star formation and active galactic nucleus (AGN), respectively. Through the SED analysis, we found that roughly half (120/244) of the PL DOGs show ``broken'' power-law SEDs. The significant red slope from optical to near-IR in the SEDs of these ``broken power-law DOGs'' (BPL DOGs) probably reflects their large amount of dust extinction. In other words, BPL DOGs are more heavily obscured AGNs, compared to PL DOGs with non-broken power-law SEDs.</description>

      <title>Potential Vibrational Modes Tied to Diffuse Interstellar Bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Potential vibrational modes associated with diffuse interstellar bands (DIBs) could be discerned by examining energy differences between correlated DIBs. Consequently, $\approx 10^3$ higher correlated DIB pairs ($r-\sigma_r \ge 0.8$, $\ge 12$ sightlines) were extracted from the Apache Point Observatory DIB catalog, and their energy spacings computed. In this first macro exploratory step, a histogram possibly reveals chemical bond signatures of C$\equiv$C, C$\equiv$N, S$-$H, C$-$O, C$=$O, Si$-$H, N$-$H, C$-$H (aliphatic), C$\mathbf{^{\underline{...}}}$C (in-ring), and aromatics (C$-$H stretch, C$\mathbf{^{\underline{...}}}$C in-ring, oop C$-$H bending, and overtones). Continued research is required to (in)validate the histogram approach, mitigate noise, scrutinize maxima, break degeneracies, and converge upon an optimal framework.</description>

      <title>Coronal Gas in Magellanic-Analog Dwarfs: Insights from the \textsc{HESTIA} Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterize the warm circumgalactic medium (CGM) of a dwarf galaxy pair with properties similar to the Magellanic Clouds in the \textsc{Hestia} cosmological simulations. The system consists of a massive dwarf ($M_{\rm halo} \sim 10^{11.5} M_{\odot}$) and a lower-mass companion ($M_{\rm halo} \sim 10^{10} M_{\odot}$), dynamically evolving in isolation before infall into a Milky Way-mass halo. The massive dwarf hosts a warm coronal gas envelope with a temperature of $T \sim 3 \times 10^5$ K, consistent with expectations for virialized CGM in dwarf halos. Tidal interactions produce a neutral gas stream that extends over $\sim 150$ kpc, with an \ion{H}{1} mass of $M_{\rm HI} \sim 10^8 M_{\odot}$, similar to the Magellanic Stream. Furthermore, in the \textsc{Hestia} simulation suite, we find that coronal gas is ubiquitous in all halos with $M_{\rm halo} &gt; 10^{11} M_{\odot}$, implying that massive dwarfs generically develop extended gaseous envelopes prior to accretion. This result has significant implications for the survival of neutral tidal structures, and suggests that current and future high-ion UV absorption-line observations are indicative of warm coronae surrounding LMC-mass dwarfs, independent of their environment.</description>

      <title>Searching for Compact Obscured Nuclei in Compton Thick AGN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15248v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compact Obscured Nuclei (CONs) are heavily obscured infrared cores that have been found in local (ultra)luminous infrared galaxies (U/LIRGs). They show bright emission from vibrationally excited rotational transitions of HCN, known as HCN-vib, and are thought to harbor Compton Thick (CT, $N_{\text{H}} \geq 10^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$) active galactic nuclei (AGN) or extreme compact starbursts. We explore the potential evolutionary link between CONs and CT AGN by searching for CONs in hard X-ray-confirmed CT AGN from the Great Observatories All-sky LIRG Survey (GOALS). Here, we present new Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array Band 6 observations that targeted HCN-vib emission in four hard X-ray-confirmed CT AGN. We analyze these objects together with literature HCN-vib measurements of five additional hard X-ray-confirmed CT AGN from the GOALS sample. We do not detect any CONs in this combined sample of nine CT AGN. We then explore a proposed evolutionary sequence in which CONs evolve into X-ray-detectable CT AGN once outflows and feedback reduce the column densities of the enshrouding gas. We find, however, no evidence of well-developed dense molecular outflows in the observed CT AGN. While this could suggest that CT AGN are not universally linked to CONs, it could also be explained by a short duty cycle for molecular outflows.</description>

      <title>Population Models for Star Formation Timescales in Early Galaxies: The First Step Towards Solving Outshining in Star Formation History Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: JWST have revealed temporarily-quenched and ultraviolet-luminous galaxies in the early universe, suggesting enhanced star formation stochasticity. Verifying this hypothesis is critical, yet challenging; outshining, wherein light from young stars dominates the spectral energy distribution, represents perhaps the greatest challenge in inferring the formation histories of unresolved galaxies. In this paper, we take a simple model of burstiness and show that state-of-the-art inference methods with flexible star formation histories (SFHs) and neutral priors, while recovering average star formation rates (SFRs; $\sim0.1$ dex median offset), fail to recover the complexities of fluctuations on tens of Myr timescales, and typically underestimate masses in bursty systems ($\sim0.15$ dex). Surprisingly, detailed SFH recovery is still sensitive to priors even when data quality is optimal, e.g., including high signal-to-noise ($\rm20~pixel^{-1}$) spectroscopy with wide coverage (rest-frame $0.12-1.06~\mu$m). Crucially, however, refitting the same data with a prior correctly encoding the bursty expectation eliminates these biases: median offsets in mass and SFRs decrease to $\sim 0.04$ dex and $\sim 0.05$ dex, respectively. Under the assumption that current population burstiness predicts past SFH, the solution to outshining in modeling statistical samples is empirically measuring recent galaxy SFHs with population modeling. A prototype is H$\alpha$/UV: while helpful, it is insufficient to constrain the expected complex burstiness. To this end, we introduce a more complete, quantitative population-level approach and demonstrate that it promises to recover the typical amplitude, timescale, and slope of the recent SFH to high accuracy. This approach thus has the strong potential to solve outshining using observations from JWST.</description>

      <title>Simultaneously Modelling Dusty Star Forming Galaxies and Massive Quiescents: A Calibration Framework for Galaxy Formation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxy formation models, particularly semi-analytic models (SAMs), rely on differential equations with free parameters to describe the physical mechanisms governing galaxy formation and evolution. Traditionally, most SAMs calibrate these parameters manually to match observational data. However, this approach fails to fully explore the multidimensional parameter space, resulting in limited robustness and inconsistency with some observations. In contrast, the L-Galaxies SAM features a unique Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) mode, enabling robust model calibration. Using this functionality, we address a long-standing tension in galaxy formation models: simultaneously reproducing the number densities of dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) and high-redshift massive quiescent galaxies (MQs). We test nine combinations of observational constraints - including stellar mass functions, quiescent fractions, neutral hydrogen mass functions, and DSFG number densities - across different redshifts. We then analyze the resulting galaxy property predictions and discuss the underlying physical mechanisms. Our results identify a model that reasonably matches the number density of DSFGs while remaining consistent with observationally-derived lower limits on the number density of high-redshift MQs. This model requires high star formation efficiencies in mergers and a null dependency of supermassive black hole (SMBH) cold gas accretion on halo mass, facilitating rapid stellar mass and SMBH growth. Additionally, our findings highlight the importance of robust calibration procedures to address the significant degeneracies inherent to multidimensional galaxy formation models.</description>

      <title>Multidimensional half-moment multigroup radiative transfer. Improving moment-based thermal models of circumstellar disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Common radiative transfer methods, such as flux-limited diffusion (FLD) and the M1 closure, suffer from artificial interactions between crossing beams. In protoplanetary disks, this leads to an overestimation of the midplane temperature due to the merging of vertical inward and outward fluxes. Methods that avoid these artifacts typically require angular discretization, which can be computationally expensive. In the spirit of the two-stream approximation, we aim to remove the interaction between beams in a fixed spatial direction by introducing a half-moment (HM) closure, which integrates the radiative intensity over hemispheres. We derive a multidimensional HM closure via entropy maximization and replace it with an approximate expression that closely matches it, coinciding in the diffusion and free-streaming regimes while remaining expressible through simple operations. We implement the HM and M1 closures via implicit-explicit (IMEX) schemes, including multiple frequency groups. We test these methods in numerical benchmarks, including computing the temperature in an irradiated disk around a T Tauri star, comparing the results with Monte Carlo (MC) radiative transfer simulations. The resulting HM closure tends to the correct limit in the diffusion regime and prevents interactions between crossing fluxes in a chosen spatial direction. In disk simulations with 22 frequency groups, the M1 closure disagrees with the MC midplane temperature by up to 21%, while HM reduces this discrepancy to 6%. Even with just 3 frequency groups, HM significantly outperforms M1, with maximum departures of 8% compared to M1's 23%.</description>

      <title>Modeling transport in weakly collisional plasmas using thermodynamic forcing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How momentum, energy, and magnetic fields are transported in the presence of macroscopic gradients is a fundamental question in plasma physics. Answering this question is especially challenging for weakly collisional, magnetized plasmas, where macroscopic gradients influence the plasma's microphysical structure. In this paper, we introduce thermodynamic forcing, a new method for systematically modeling how macroscopic gradients in magnetized or unmagnetized plasmas shape the distribution functions of constituent particles. In this method, we propose to apply an anomalous force to those particles inducing the anisotropy that would naturally emerge due to macroscopic gradients in weakly collisional plasmas. We implement thermodynamic forcing in particle-in-cell (TF-PIC) simulations using a modified Vay particle pusher and validate it against analytic solutions of the equations of motion. We then carry out a series of simulations of electron-proton plasmas with periodic boundary conditions using TF-PIC. First, we confirm that the properties of two electron-scale kinetic instabilities -- one driven by a temperature gradient and the other by pressure anisotropy -- are consistent with previous results. Then, we demonstrate that in the presence of multiple macroscopic gradients, the saturated state can differ significantly from current expectations. This work enables, for the first time, systematic and self-consistent transport modeling in weakly collisional plasmas, with broad applications in astrophysics, laser-plasma physics, and inertial confinement fusion.</description>

      <title>H2S ice sublimation dynamics: experimentally constrained binding energies, entrapment efficiencies, and snowlines</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is thought to be an important sulfur reservoir in interstellar ices. It serves as a key precursor to complex sulfur-bearing organics, and has been proposed to play a significant role in the origin of life. Although models and observations both suggest H2S to be present in ices in non-negligible amounts, its sublimation dynamics remain poorly constrained. In this work, we present a comprehensive experimental characterization of the sublimation behavior of H2S ice under astrophysically-relevant conditions. The sublimation behavior of H2S was monitored with a quadrupole mass spectrometer (QMS) during temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) experiments. These experiments are used to determine binding energies and entrapment efficiencies of H2S, which are then employed to estimate its snowline positions in a protoplanetary disk midplane. We derive mean binding energies of 3159\pm46 K for pure H2S ice and 3392\pm56 K for submonolayer H2S desorbing from a compact amorphous solid water (cASW) surface. These values correspond to sublimation temperatures of around 64 K and 69 K in the disk midplane, placing its sublimation fronts at radii just interior to the CO2 snowline. We also investigate the entrapment of H2S in water ice and find it to be highly efficient, with ~75-85% of H2S remaining trapped past its sublimation temperature for H2O:H2S mixing ratios of ~5-17:1. We discuss potential mechanisms behind this efficient entrapment. Our findings imply that, in protoplanetary disks, H2S will mostly be retained in the ice phase until water crystallizes, at radii near the water snowline, if it forms mixed into water ice. This has significant implications for the possibility of H2S being incorporated into icy planetesimals and its potential delivery to terrestrial planets, which we discuss in detail.</description>

      <title>Ice sublimation in the dynamic HD 100453 disk reveals a rich reservoir of inherited complex organics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Protoplanetary disks around luminous young A-type stars are prime observational laboratories to determine the abundances of complex organic molecules (COMs) present during planet formation. In contrast to their lower stellar mass counterparts, these warmer disks contain the sublimation fronts of complex molecules such as CH3OH on spatial scales accessible with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). We present ALMA observations of the Herbig Ae disk HD 100453 that uncover a rich reservoir of COMs sublimating from the dust cavity edge. In addition to CH3OH, we detect 13CH3OH for the first time in a Class II disk, revealing a factor of three enhancement of 13C in the disk large organics. A tentative detection of CH2DOH is also reported, resulting in a D/H of 1-2%, which is consistent with the expected deuterium enhancement from the low temperature CH3OH formation in molecular clouds and with the deuteration of CH3OH measured in comets. The detection of methyl-formate (CH3OCHO), at only a few percent level of CH3OH is an order of magnitude lower compared to claims towards other organic-rich Herbig Ae disks but is more in line with organic abundance patterns towards the earlier stages of star formation. Together these data provide multiple lines of evidence that disks, and therefore the planet and comet-forming materials, contain inherited interstellar ices and perhaps the strongest evidence to date that much of the interstellar organic ice composition survives the early stages of planet formation.</description>

      <title>Inferring Dense Confined Circumstellar Medium around Supernova Progenitors via Long-term Hydrodynamical Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Circumstellar interaction of supernova (SN) ejecta is an essential process in its evolution and observations of SNe have found the signature of circumstellar interaction both in the early and late evolutionary phase of SNe. In this Letter, we show that if the SN forward shock plunges into tenuous stellar wind from dense circumstellar medium (CSM) in the vicinity of the progenitor (i.e., confined CSM), the subsequent time evolutions of the SN-CSM interaction system deviates from the prediction of self-similar solution. In this case, after all of the confined CSM is swept up by the SN forward shock (roughly $10$ days after the explosion), the propagation of the shocked shell will be driven by the freely expanding ram pressure of the confined CSM component, instead of the SN ejecta. Meanwhile, the forward shock decelerates faster than the prediction of thin-shell approximation once the confined CSM component reaches homologous expansion. This lasts until the reverse shock in the confined CSM component reaches the head of the SN ejecta, leading to the restoration of the system into the evolutionary model without confined CSM, where the SN ejecta drives the expansion of the system. We also show that this peculiar evolution will be reflected in observational signatures originating from SN-CSM interaction, taking rapid decline and rebrightening of radio emission as examples. Our results shed light on the importance of taking into account the effect of initial SN-CSM interaction even when we focus on observational properties of SNe a few years after the explosion.</description>

      <title>Evidence for non-cold dark matter from DESI DR2 measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate potential deviations from cold dark matter (CDM) using the latest Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) measurements from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). Analyzing DESI data alone constrains the dark matter equation of state parameter $w_{\mathrm{dm}} = -0.042^{+0.047}_{-0.024}$, revealing a mild preference for non-cold dark matter. This preference strengthens significantly in combined analyses, but reveals a striking tension in the inferred $w_{\mathrm{dm}}$ values from observations of different nature. The DESI+DESY5 combination yields $w_{\mathrm{dm}} = -0.084 \pm 0.035$, excluding CDM ($w_{\mathrm{dm}}=0$) at 2.4$\sigma$ significance. In contrast, Planck+DESI gives $w_{\mathrm{dm}} = 0.00077\pm0.00038$, differing from concordance model at 2$\sigma$ significance. The non-vanishing $w_{\mathrm{dm}}$ preference is particularly driven by low-redshift BAO measurements ($z&lt;1.1$), while higher redshift data remain consistent with $\Lambda$CDM. The evidence for non-cold dark matter is more pronounced in DESI compared to the previous BAO surveys. All dataset combinations show significant improvement over the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm, providing compelling evidence for non-cold dark matter scenario.</description>

      <title>The fate of the progenitors of Luminous Red Novae: Infrared detection of LRNe years after the outburst</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present late-time optical and infrared (IR) observations of a sample of nine extragalactic Luminous Red Novae (LRNe) discovered in the last three decades. In all these cases, the LRN survivors fade below the pre-outburst luminosity of the progenitors in the optical region. Instead, they remain visible in the near-IR (NIR), and bright in the mid-IR (MIR) domains for years. We recover AT 1997bs in $Spitzer$ images from 2004, and a residual source is visible in HST and $JWST$ NIR images 27 years after the outburst. Its spectral energy distribution (SED) is consistent with that of a red supergiant star with a photospheric temperature of 3200 K and a radius of 220 $R_{\odot}$, without a significant circumstellar dust attenuation, as the source is not detected at 4.5 $\mu$m. Another LRN, AT 2011kp, is detected by $JWST$ 12.5 years after the outburst. From its SED, we find evidence for three black-body components: a warm/hot stellar component, a colder component from cool dust at 425 K, emitting between 3 and 6 $\mu$m, and a third even colder component responsible for the excess at 8 $\mu$m, possibly due to an IR echo. We construct the $[3.6]-[4.5]$ colour curves extending up to +7 years for six LRNe, which show a similar evolution: the MIR colour is $\sim0$ before the optical maximum light, it becomes bluer ($\sim-0.5$ mag) at around +1 year, then it gradually turns to redder colours ($\sim+0.5$ mag) in the following years, before reaching $[3.6]-[4.5]\sim+1.5$ mag 7 years after the outburst. Finally, we also estimate the masses and the temperatures of newly-formed dust years after the LRN onset for different chemical compositions (silicates or graphite) and grain sizes (0.1 or 1.0 $\mu$m). We find that LRNe produce dust masses of the order of (0.1-30)$\times10^{-6}$ $M_{\odot}$ between 3.6 and 13 years after the outbursts, with temperatures in the range from 350 to 770 K.</description>

      <title>The galaxy bias profile of cosmic voids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmic voids are underdense regions within the large-scale structure of the Universe, spanning a wide range of physical scales - from a few megaparsecs (Mpc) to the largest observable structures. Their distinctive properties make them valuable cosmological probes and unique laboratories for galaxy formation studies. A key aspect to investigate in this context is the galaxy bias, $b$, within voids - that is, how galaxies in these underdense regions trace the underlying dark-matter density field. We want to measure the dependence of the large-scale galaxy bias on the distance to the void center, and to evaluate whether this bias profile varies with the void properties and identification procedure. We apply a void identification scheme based on spherical overdensities to galaxy data from the IllustrisTNG magnetohydrodynamical simulation. For the clustering measurement, we use an object-by-object estimate of large-scale galaxy bias, which offers significant advantages over the standard method based on ratios of correlation functions or power spectra. We find that the average large-scale bias of galaxies inside voids tends to increase with void-centric distance when normalized by the void radius. For the entire galaxy population within voids, the average bias rises with the density of the surrounding environment and, consequently, decreases with increasing void size. Due to this environmental dependence, the average galaxy bias inside S-type voids - embedded in large-scale overdense regions - is significantly higher ($\langle b\rangle_{\rm in} &gt; 0$) at all distances compared to R-type voids, which are surrounded by underdense regions ($\langle b\rangle_{\rm in} &lt; 0$). The bias profile for S-type voids is also slightly steeper. Since both types of voids host halo populations of similar mass, the measured difference in bias can be interpreted as a secondary bias effect.</description>

      <title>Black Hole Survival Guide: Searching for Stars in the Galactic Center That Endure Partial Tidal Disruption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Once per 10,000-100,000 years, an unlucky star may experience a close encounter with a supermassive black hole (SMBH), partially or fully tearing apart the star in an exceedingly brief, bright interaction called a tidal disruption event (TDE). Remnants of partial TDEs are expected to be plentiful in our Galactic Center, where at least six unexplained, diffuse, star-like "G objects" have already been detected which may have formed via interactions between stars and the SMBH. Using numerical simulations, this work aims to identify the characteristics of TDE remnants. We take 3D hydrodynamic FLASH models of partially disrupted stars and map them into the 1D stellar evolution code MESA to examine the properties of these remnants from tens to billions of years after the TDE. The remnants initially exhibit a brief, highly luminous phase, followed by an extended cooling period as they return to stable hydrogen burning. During the initial stage (&lt; 10,000 yr) their luminosities increase by orders of magnitude, making them intriguing candidates to explain a fraction of the mysterious G objects. Notably, mild TDEs are the most common and result in the brightest remnants during this initial phase. However, most remnants exist in a long-lived stage where they are only modestly offset in temperature and luminosity compared to main-sequence stars of equivalent mass. Nonetheless, our results indicate remnants will sustain abnormal, metal-enriched envelopes that may be discernible through spectroscopic analysis. Identifying TDE survivors within the Milky Way could further illuminate some of the most gravitationally intense encounters in the Universe.</description>

      <title>A local, topology-independent parameterization of quasar IGM damping wings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lyman-$\alpha$ damping wings towards quasars provide a unique probe of reionization because their strength correlates strongly with the global volume-averaged neutral hydrogen (HI) fraction of the intergalactic medium (IGM). Cosmic variance in the IGM, however, is a major source of stochasticity since the local neutral environment around a quasar varies significantly even at fixed global neutral fraction. We show that the IGM damping wing carries additional information about this local ionization topology, unexploited by current analysis frameworks. We introduce a set of two new physically motivated summary statistics encoding the local information about the HI distribution in the IGM before it is altered by ionization radiation from the quasar, encompassing 1) the HI column density, weighted by a Lorentzian profile mimicking the frequency dependence of the Lyman-$\alpha$ cross section, and 2) the distance from the quasar to the first neutral patch. This description, when combined with the quasar's lifetime as a third parameter, reduces the IGM transmission scatter in the damping wing region of the spectrum to $\lesssim 1\,\%$ across the full range of physical parameter space. We introduce a simple procedure for generating synthetic HI sightlines around quasars and demonstrate that the resulting damping wing profiles are statistically indistinguishable from a realistic reionization topology. This opens the door for optimally extracting the salient local information encoded in the imprint in a model-independent fashion. In the context of a specific reionization model, measurements of these local parameters can be translated into constraints on the global timing of reionization, but in addition, they provide information about the reionization topology, hitherto unused. A marginally modified version of our framework can also be employed in the context of damping wings towards galaxies.</description>

      <title>K-DRIFT Preparation: Experimental Verification of an Observation Strategy for Accurate Dark-Sky Flats</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14914v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite its scientific importance, the low-surface-brightness universe has yet to be fully explored due to various systematic uncertainties that affect the achievable surface-brightness limit. Reducing these uncertainties requires very accurate data processing. The dark-sky flat is a widely used calibration frame for accurate flat-field correction, generated by combining the sky background from science images. However, the night sky will likely contain complex local fluctuations, thus may still lead to photometric errors in data calibrated with dark-sky flats. To address this concern, we conduct mock observations with semi-realistic sky simulation data and evaluate observation strategies to mitigate the impact of the fluctuating sky background. Our experiments consider two representative sky conditions (clear and dirty) and perform intensive comparative analysis on two observation methods (offset and rolling). Our findings suggest that the rolling dithering method, which incorporates the operation of camera rotation into conventional dithering, can provide more accurate dark-sky flats. Finally, we discuss the broader implications of this method through additional experiments examining several factors that may affect the imaging quality of observational data.</description>

      <title>Effects of angular scattering and H+p, H+H collisions on the properties of interstellar atoms in the heliosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interstellar hydrogen atoms (H atoms) penetrate into the heliosphere through the region of the solar wind interaction with the interstellar plasma due to their large mean free path. Resonant charge exchange of H atoms with protons has been considered as the main interaction process between the components. In the majority of models, other processes like elastic H-H and H-p collisions are not included. Moreover, it has been assumed that the velocities of the colliding particles remain unchanged during charge exchange. This corresponds to the scattering on the angle of $\pi$ in the centre mass rest frame.
  The goal of this paper is to explore effects of the elastic H-H and H-p collisions as well as the angular scattering during charge exchange on the distribution of the interstellar atoms in the heliosphere and at its boundary.
  We present results of simple (and therefore, easily repeatable) kinetic model of the interstellar atom penetration through the region of the solar and interstellar winds interaction into the heliosphere. As a result of the model we compute the distribution function of the interstellar atoms at different heliospheric distances. Further, this distribution function is used to compute its moments and potentially observable features such as absorption and backscattered spectra in the Lyman-alpha line.
  Results show that there are differences in the behavior of the distribution function when considering elastic collisions and the changes in the moments of the distribution achieve 10%. Therefore, in cases where precise calculation of H atom parameters is essential, such as in the modeling of backscattered Lyman-$\alpha$ emission, elastic collisions must be considered.</description>

      <title>Period-luminosity and period-luminosity-metallicity relation for $\delta$ Scuti Stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: $\delta$ Scuti ($\delta$ Sct) stars are potential distance tracers for studying the Milky Way structure. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of the period-luminosity (PL) and period-luminosity-metallicity (PLZ) relation for $\delta$ Sct stars, integrating data from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST), Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE), and Gaia. To mitigate the impact of the Gaia parallax zero point offset, we applied a correction method, determining the optimal zero point value to be $zp_\varpi = 35 \pm 2 \, \mu\text{as}$. Using the three best bands, by varying the parallax error threshold, we found that the total error of the PLR zero point was minimized to 0.9\% at a parallax error threshold of 6\%. With this threshold, we derived the PL and PLZ relation for nine bands (from optical to mid-infrared) and five Wesenheit bands. Through our analysis, we conclude that the influence of metallicity on the PLR of $\delta$ Sct stars is not significant, and the differences across various bands are minimal.</description>

      <title>A Short History of (Orbital) Decay: Roman's Prospects for Detecting Dying Planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15277v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Roman Space Telescope Galactic Bulge Time Domain Survey (GBTDS) is expected to detect ~10^5 transiting planets. Many of these planets will have short orbital periods and are thus susceptible to tidal decay. We use a catalog of simulated transiting planet detections to predict the yield of orbital decay detections in the Roman GBTDS. Assuming a constant stellar tidal dissipation factor, Q^{'}_{*}, of 10^6, we predict ~ 5 - 10 detections. We additionally consider an empirical period-dependent parameterization of Q^{'}_{*} \propto P^{-3} and find a substantially suppressed yield. We conclude that Roman will provide constraints on the rate of planet engulfment in the Galaxy and probe the physics of tidal dissipation in stars.</description>

      <title>Cluster candidates with massive quiescent galaxies at $z\sim2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02849v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Galaxy clusters are crucial to understanding role of the environment in galaxy evolution. However, due to their rarity, only a limited number of clusters have been identified at $z\gtrsim2$. In this paper, we report a discovery of seven cluster candidates with massive quiescent galaxies at $z\sim2$ in the $3.5\,\mathrm{deg}^{2}$ area of the XMM-LSS field, roughly doubling the known cluster sample at this frontier redshift if confirmed. We construct a photometric redshift catalog based on deep ($i\sim26$, $K_\mathrm{s}\sim24$) multi-wavelength photometry from $u^*$-band to $K$-band gathered from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program and other collaborative/public surveys. We adopt a Gaussian kernel density estimate with two different spatial scales (10" and 60") to draw a density map of massive ($\log(M_{*}/M_{\odot})&gt;10.5$) and quiescent ($\log(\mathrm{sSFR\, [\mathrm{yr^{-1}}]})&lt;-10$) galaxies at $z\sim2$. Then, We identify seven prominent overdensities. These candidates show clear red sequences in color-magnitude diagrams ($z-H$ vs. $H$). Moreover, one of them shows an extended X-ray emission with $L_\mathrm{X}=(1.46\pm0.35)\times10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$, suggesting its virialized nature. There is no clear evidence of enhancement nor suppression of the star formation rate of the main sequence galaxies in the clusters. We find that cluster galaxies have a higher fraction of transition population with $-10.5&lt;\log(\mathrm{sSFR\, [\mathrm{yr^{-1}}]})&lt;-10$ ($12\%$) than the field ($2\%$), which implies the ongoing star formation quenching. The quiescent fraction in the cluster candidates also exceeds that in the field. We confirm that the excess of a quiescent fraction is larger for higher-mass galaxies. This is the first statistical evidence for the mass-dependent environmental quenching at work in clusters even at $z\sim2$.</description>

      <title>Unravelling the role of merger histories in the population of In situ stars: linking IllustrisTNG cosmological simulation to H3 survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07169v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We undertake a comprehensive investigation into the distribution of in~situ stars within Milky Way-like galaxies, leveraging TNG50 simulations and comparing their predictions with data from the H3 survey. Our analysis reveals that 28% of galaxies demonstrate reasonable agreement with H3, while only 12% exhibit excellent alignment in their profiles, regardless of the specific spatial cut employed to define in~situ stars. To uncover the underlying factors contributing to deviations between TNG50 and H3 distributions, we scrutinise correlation coefficients among internal drivers(e.g., virial radius, star formation rate [SFR]) and merger-related parameters (such as the effective mass-ratio, mean distance, average redshift, total number of mergers, average spin-ratio and maximum spin alignment between merging galaxies). Notably, we identify significant correlations between deviations from observational data and key parameters such as the median slope of virial radius, mean SFR values, and the rate of SFR change across different redshift scans. Furthermore, positive correlations emerge between deviations from observational data and parameters related to galaxy mergers. We validate these correlations using the Random Forest Regression method. Our findings underscore the invaluable insights provided by the H3 survey in unravelling the cosmic history of galaxies akin to the Milky Way, thereby advancing our understanding of galactic evolution and shedding light on the formation and evolution of Milky Way-like galaxies in cosmological simulations.</description>

      <title>Simulating Binary Primordial Black Hole Mergers in Dark Matter Halos</title>

Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs), possibly constituting a non-negligible fraction of dark matter (DM), might be responsible for a number of gravitational wave events detected by LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA. In this paper, we simulate the evolution of PBH binaries in DM halos and calculate their merger rate up to redshift of 10. We assume that DM halos are made entirely by a combination of single PBHs and PBH binaries. We present the resulting merger rates from the two main channels that lead to merging PBH binaries: two-body captures and binary-single interactions. We account for alternative assumptions on the dark matter halo mass-concentration relationship versus redshift. We also study what impact the PBH mass distribution, centered in the stellar-mass range, has on the PBH merger rate that the ground-based gravitational-wave observatories can probe. We find that under reasonable assumptions on the abundance of PBH binaries relative to single PBHs, the binary-single interaction rates can be dominant over the two-body capture channel. Our work studies in detail the dynamics of PBHs inside DM halos, advancing our understanding on how the current gravitational-wave events constrain the properties of PBHs. Moreover, we make predictions in a redshift range to be probed by future observatories.</description>

      <title>Finding massive double-exponential disk galaxies with extended low surface brightness stellar disk -- an IllustrisTNG exploration</title>

Abstract: We study massive disk galaxies (stellar mass $&gt;=10^{11}\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$) at z=0 from IllustrisTNG simulation to detect galaxies that contain two exponential stellar disks - a central high surface brightness (HSB) disk surrounded by an extended low surface brightness (LSB) envelope. This is motivated by the observation of several giant LSB galaxies (Malin 1, UGC 1378, UGC 1382 etc), reported in the literature, showing such complex morphology. Studying such systems can help us to understand the mass assembly process and growth of stellar disks in massive galaxies and thus can shed light on massive galaxy formation and evolution scenarios. We use the high-resolution IllustrisTNG50 data and perform Sersic plus exponential profile modeling on the idealized, synthetic SDSS g, r-band images of the massive disk galaxies using GALFIT. We identify 7 disk galaxies (12% of the parent sample of disk galaxies) that are best represented by a central S\'{e}rsic plus a central HSB disk surrounded by an extended LSB disk. The radial scale lengths of the LSB disk lie in the range of $\sim$ 9.7-31.7 kpc, in agreement with that found in the literature. We study the star formation properties of these simulated double-disk galaxies to understand the distribution of these from blue star-forming to red-quenched region. Some of these double-disk galaxies display a characteristic minima in their (g-r) color radial profiles. The double-disk galaxies are found to lie within $\sim$ 1.5-$\mathrm{\sigma}$ region of the Baryonic Tully-Fisher relation from observation.</description>

      <title>Spin-Polarized Electrons from Magnetically Aligned Grains and Chiral Symmetry Breaking: Effects of Cosmic Rays in Protostellar Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02291v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low-energy spin-polarized electrons (SPEs) are thought to cause symmetry breaking and could explain the origin of homochirality of prebiotic molecules such as amino acids and sugars. Here we study the effect of cosmic rays (CRs) on the emission of SPEs from aligned grains in dense protostellar environments and explore their effects on chiral asymmetry of prebiotic molecules. We first show that icy grains in protostellar environments can align with magnetic fields due to magnetically enhanced radiative torque mechanism. We then study the production of thermal electrons by CR ionization of H$_2$ and the CR-induced UV radiation using the attenuated CR spectra in dense cores obtained from a continuous slowing down model. Next, we show that thermal electrons with initial random spins captured by aligned grains will become spin-polarized due to the Barnett effect, converting unpolarized electrons into SPEs. We calculate the rate of photoemission of such SPEs by CRs-induced UV radiation and secondary electron emission from aligned grains and find that the photoemission by CRs-induced UV radiation is dominant. Finally, we calculate the total production rate of SPEs inside aligned dust grains by CRs. We estimate the alignment degree of SPEs from superparmagnetic (SPM) grains and find that it is only significant for SPM grains having large iron clusters and fast rotation. We suggest that low-energy secondary SPEs from aligned superparamagnetic grains with large iron inclusions induced by CRs might cause the chiral asymmetry of chiral prebiotic molecules formed in the ice mantle of aligned grains, in analogous to UV circularly polarized light.</description>

      <title>On the origin of the Hercules group: II. the Trojan quasi-periodic identity on the orbital level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19097v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Hercules kinematic group is a stellar anomaly structure observed in the solar neighbourhood (SNd). In the previous paper, we analysed chemical signatures and related the origin of this stellar population to the outer bar. Next to consider is how this alien population migrate out into the SNd. Often, this kinematic structure is associated with bar resonances. In this paper, We consider the driving mechanism of Hercules on the orbital level. We construct a simple Milky Way-like potential model with a slowly rotating long bar and explore some of the stellar orbit families and their stability. With this model, our numerical solutions of the equations of motion show that quasi-periodic orbits trapped around fast-rotating periodic Trojan orbits around the L4 Lagrange point of the bar minor axis can pass through the SNd. When observed in the SNd, they populate the Hercules structure in the $L_Z$-$V_R$ kinematics space. Moreover, the variation in radial coverage in the galactic plane with the SNd kinematics shows good agreement with chemical signatures found in Paper I. Furthermore, the effective potential shows the topology of a volcano, the rim of which limits most orbits to stay inside or outside. Trojan orbits are a stable orbit family that can transport inner Galactic stars out to the SNd. They can explain the stellar kinematics of Hercules, and provide a straightforward basis for its chemical properties. We support that Trojan orbits associated with the slowly rotating Galactic bar explain the Hercules structure observed in the SNd.</description>

      <title>Pz Cats: Photometric redshift catalogs based on DES Y3 BAO sample</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04118v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Over the years, photometric redshift estimation (photo-z) has advanced through various methods. This study evaluates four distinct photo-z estimators-ANNz2, BPZ, ENF, and DNF-using the Dark Energy Survey Y3 BAO Sample. Unlike most studies, we explore selecting optimal galaxies based on their redshift Probability Distribution Function (PDF) by either reducing noise or identifying those approximating a Gaussian distribution. We cross-matched 25,760 galaxies drawn from four spectroscopic surveys with the photo-z sample to comprehend redshift bias and its 68th percentile $\sigma_{68}$. The lowest $\sigma$ for all estimators was found in the range $0.79&lt;z_p&lt;0.85$. Among the estimators, DMF exhibited the greatest bias, while ENF, ANNz2, and BPZ showed decreased precision outside 0.7 to 0.9 redshift range. To select galaxies with minimal bias, ANNz2 emerged as the most reliable algorithm across all criteria. PDFs selection significantly improves colour representation over the spectroscopic sample, underscoring the role of magnitude space in selection. While ANNz2 achieved superior precision, ENF poorly selected Gaussian PDFs, leaving few galaxies for LSS evaluation. Despite smooth PDFs, catastrophic redshift errors were present. Though DNF had the poorest precision, it offered enough galaxies for cosmological use. Subsampling galaxies with secondary peaks less than 30\% of the main peak height, termed Small Peaks, showed ANNz2 excelled. The catalogs produced have been published as Pz Cats within the ZENODO repository.</description>

      <title>A High-Caliber View of the Bullet Cluster Through JWST Strong and Weak Lensing Analyses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21870v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Bullet Cluster (1E 0657-56) is a key astrophysical laboratory for studying dark matter, galaxy cluster mergers, and shock propagation in extreme environments. Using new JWST imaging, we present the highest-resolution mass reconstruction to date, combining 146 strong lensing constraints from 37 systems with high-density (398 sources arcmin$^{-2}$) weak lensing data, without assuming that light traces mass. The main cluster's mass distribution is highly elongated (NW-SE) and consists of at least three subclumps aligned with the brightest cluster galaxies. The subcluster is more compact but elongated along the E-W direction, with a single dominant peak. We also detect a possible mass and ICL trail extending from the subcluster's eastern side toward the main cluster. Notably, these detailed features are closely traced by the intracluster light, with a modified Hausdorff distance of $19.80 \pm 12.46$ kpc. Together with multi-wavelength data, the complex mass distribution suggests that the merger history of the Bullet Cluster may be more complex than previous binary cluster merger scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02908v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Aims: The presence of a Yukawa-like correction to Newtonian gravity is investigated at the Galactic Center, leading to a new upper limit for the intensity of such a correction. Methods: We perform a Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis using the astrometric and spectroscopic data of star S$2$ collected at the Very Large Telescope by GRAVITY, NACO and SINFONI instruments, covering the period from $1992$ to $2022$. Results: The precision of the GRAVITY instrument allows us to derive the most stringent upper limit at the Galactic Center for the intensity of the Yukawa contribution ($\propto \, \alpha e^{- \lambda r}$) to be $|\alpha| &lt; 0.003$ for a scale length $\lambda = 3 \cdot 10^{13}\, \rm m\, (\sim 200 \, \rm AU)$. This improves by roughly one order of magnitude all estimates obtained in previous works.</description>

      <title>The relation of galaxies and dark matter haloes to the filamentary cosmic web</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03438v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use the Millennium Simulation to study the relation of galaxies and dark matter haloes to the cosmic web. We define the web as the unique, fully connected, percolating object with (unsmoothed) matter density everywhere exceeding 5.25 times the cosmic mean. This object contains 35\% of all cosmic mass but occupies only 0.62\% of all cosmic volume. It contains 26\% of dark matter haloes of mass $10^{11}M_\odot$, rising to 50\% at $10^{12.7}M_\odot$, and to $&gt;90\%$ above $10^{14}M_\odot$. In contrast, it contains 45\% of all galaxies of stellar mass $10^{8.5}M_\odot$, rising to 50\% at $10^{10}M_\odot$, to 60\% at $10^{11}M_\odot$ and to 90\% at $10^{11.5}M_\odot$. This difference arises because a large fraction of all satellite and backsplash galaxies are part of the cosmic web. Indeed, more than 50\% of web galaxies are satellites for stellar masses below that of the Milky Way, rising to about 70\% below $10^{10}M_\odot$, whereas centrals substantially outnumber satellites in the non-web population at all stellar masses. As a result, web galaxies have systematically lower specific star-formation rates (sSFR's) than non-web galaxies. For the latter, the distributions of stellar mass and sSFR are almost independent of web distance. Furthermore, for both central and satellite galaxies, the sSFR distributions at given stellar mass are very similar in and outside the web, once differences in backsplash fraction are accounted for. For the galaxy formation model considered here, differences between web and non-web galaxy populations are almost entirely due to the difference in halo mass distribution between the two environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06891v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A remarkable feature of dark matter consisting of ultralight bosonic particles is the emergence of superfluid Bose-Einstein condensate structures on galactic scales. We investigate the oscillations of the solitonic dark matter structure in the central galactic region by numerically solving the Bogoliubov-de Gennes problem, accounting for perturbations in the gravitational potential and local self-interactions. Our findings reveal that the central solitonic core, formed by the balance of gravitational attraction, quantum pressure, and repulsive interactions, exhibits significant oscillatory behaviour. These oscillations, characterized by distinct eigenmodes, provide insights into the dynamical properties of solitonic dark matter structures and their observational implications and contributions to galactic structure formation and evolution.</description>

      <title>Hyperluminous Supersoft X-Ray Sources in the Chandra Catalog</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00097v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hyperluminous supersoft X-ray sources, such as bright extragalactic sources characterized by particularly soft X-ray spectra, offer a unique opportunity to study accretion onto supermassive black holes in extreme conditions. Examples of hyperluminous supersoft sources are tidal disruption events, systems exhibiting quasi-periodic eruptions, changing-look AGN, and anomalous nuclear transients. Although these objects are rare phenomena amongst the population of X-ray sources, we developed an efficient algorithm to identify promising candidates exploiting archival observations. In this work, we present the results of a search for hyperluminous supersoft X-ray sources in the recently released Chandra catalog of serendipitous X-ray sources. This archival search has been performed via both a manual implementation of the algorithm we developed and a novel machine-learning-based approach. This search identified a new tidal disruption event, which might have occurred in an intermediate-mass black hole. This event occurred between 2001 and 2002, making it one of the first tidal disruption events ever observed by Chandra.</description>

      <title>Galaxy and Halo Root Systems: Fingerprints of Mass Assembly</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21015v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss what we call halo or galaxy root systems, collections of particle pathlines that show the infall of matter from the initial uniform distribution into a collapsed structure. The matter clumps as it falls in; projected through time, it produces filamentary density enhancements analogous to tree roots and branches, blood vessels, or even human transportation infrastructure in cities and regions. This relates to the larger-scale cosmic web, but is defined locally about one of its nodes: a physical, geometric version of a merger tree. We find dark-matter-halo root systems on average to exhibit more roots and root branches for the largest cluster haloes than in small haloes. This may relate to the `cosmic-web detachment' mechanism that likely contributes to star-formation quenching in galaxy groups and clusters. We also find that high spin manifests in these root systems as curvier roots.</description>

      <title>JWST Discovery of a High-Redshift Tidal Disruption Event Candidate in COSMOS-Web</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13248v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rates and properties of tidal disruption events (TDEs) provide valuable insights into their host galaxy central stellar densities and the demographics of their central supermassive black holes (SMBHs). TDEs have been observed only at low redshifts ($z \lesssim 1$), due to the difficulty in conducting deep time-domain surveys. In this work, we present the discovery of a high-redshift TDE candidate, HZTDE-1, in the COSMOS-Web survey with JWST's NIRCam, using a novel selection technique based on color and morphology. We first outline a methodology for identifying high-z TDEs in deep infrared imaging surveys, leveraging their unique spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and morphologies of these transients. We apply this technique to COSMOS-Web in filters F115W, F150W, F277W, and F444W, and identify HZTDE-1, a transient point source relative to archival UltraVISTA infrared observations. If we assume it is a TDE, we estimate its photometric redshift to be $z=5.02^{+1.32}_{-1.11}$. HZTDE-1 cannot be explained by reasonable supernova or AGN models. However, we cannot rule out a superluminous supernova at $z\gtrsim3$. If confirmed with follow-up observations, HZTDE-1 would represent the highest-redshift TDE discovery to date, and would suggest an enhancement of the TDE rate in the high-redshift universe. Our method, which can be applied to future deep surveys with JWST and Roman, offers a pathway to identify TDEs at $z&gt;4$ and probe black hole demographics at early cosmic times.</description>
