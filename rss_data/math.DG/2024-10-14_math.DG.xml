      <title>Best Lipschitz maps and Earthquakes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is the third paper in a series in which we prove Thurston's conjectural duality between best Lipschitz maps and transverse measures. In the second paper we found a special class of best Lipschitz maps between hyperbolic surfaces (infinity harmonic maps), which induce dual Lie algebra valued transverse measures with support on Thurston's canonical lamination. The present paper examines these Lie algebra valued measures in greater detail. For any measured lamination we are led to define a Lie algebra valued measure and conversely every Lie algebra valued transverse measure arrises from this process. Furthermore, we show that such measures are infinitesimal earthquakes. This construction provides a natural correspondence between best Lipschitz maps and earthquakes.</description>

      <title>Curve Shortening Flow of Space Curves with Convex Projections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that under Space Curve Shortening flow any closed immersed curve in $\mathbb R^n$ whose projection onto $\mathbb{R}^2\times\{\vec{0}\}$ is convex remains smooth until it shrinks to a point. Throughout its evolution, the projection of the curve onto $\mathbb{R}^2\times\{\vec{0}\}$ remains convex.
  As an application, we show that any closed immersed curve in $\mathbb R^n$ can be perturbed to an immersed curve in $\mathbb R^{n+2}$ whose evolution by Space Curve Shortening shrinks to a point.</description>

      <title>Spectral forms and de-Rham Hodge operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the trilinear functional of differential one-forms, spectral triple and spectral torsion for the Hodge-Dirac operator, we introduce a multilinear functional of differential one-forms for a finitely summable regular spectral triple with a noncommutative residue, which generalize the spectral torsion defined by Dabrowski-Sitarz-Zalecki. The main results of this paper recover two forms, torsion of the linear connection and four forms by the noncommutative residue and perturbed de-Rham Hodge operators, and provides an explicit computation of generalized spectral torsion associated with the perturbed de-Rham Hodge Dirac triple.</description>

      <title>Shannon entropy for harmonic metrics on cyclic Higgs bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a Riemann surface and $K_X \rightarrow X$ the canonical bundle. For each integer $r \geq 2$, each $q \in H^0(K_X^r)$, and each choice of the square root $K_X^{1/2}$ of the canonical bundle, we canonically obtain a Higgs bundle, which is called a cyclic Higgs bundle. A diagonal harmonic metric $h = (h_1, \dots, h_r)$ on a cyclic Higgs bundle yields $r-1$-Hermitian metrics $H_1, \dots, H_{r-1}$ on $K_X^{-1} \rightarrow X$, defined as $H_j=h_j^{-1} \otimes h_{j+1}$ for each $j=1,\dots, r-1$, while $h_1$, $h_r$, and $q$ yield a degenerate Hermitian metric $H_r$ on $K_X^{-1} \rightarrow X$. In this paper, we introduce a function, which we call entropy, that quantifies the degree of mutual misalignment of the Hermitian metrics $H_1,\dots, H_r$. By applying the estimate established by Dai-Li and Li-Mochizuki, we provide a strict upper bound for the entropy, a lower bound in the cases $r=2,3$, and a lower bound at the zero set of $q$ in the cases $r=4,5$. The $r$-differential $q$ induces a subharmonic weight $\phi_q$ on $K_X\rightarrow X$, and the diagonal harmonic metric depends solely on this weight $\phi_q$. We further generalize the concept of entropy to any subharmonic weight $\varphi$ on $K_X\rightarrow X$. By extending the estimate established by Dai-Li and Li-Mochizuki to any subharmonic weight under a certain regularity assumption, we generalize the estimate for the entropy for usual cyclic Higgs bundles to more general weights. Additionally, we compute the limit of the entropy as $r\to\infty$ for the Fuchsian case.</description>

      <title>Non-collapsing, non-inflating and convergence results for solutions to Ricci flow with $L^{p}$ bounded scalar curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study $n$-dimensional Ricci flows $(M^n,g(t))_{t\in [0,T)},$ where $T&lt; \infty$ is a potentially singular time, and for which the spatial $L^p$ norm, $p&gt;\frac n 2$, of the scalar curvature is uniformly bounded on $[0,T).$
  In the case that $M$ is closed, we show that non-collapsing and non-inflating estimates hold. If we further assume that $n=4$ or that $M^n$ is K\"ahler, we explain how these non-inflating/non-collapsing estimates can be combined with integral bounds on the Ricci and full curvature tensor of the prequel paper arXiv:2406.02351 to obtain an improved space time integral bound of the Ricci curvature.
  As an application of these estimates, we show that if we further restrict to $n=4$, then the solution convergences to an orbifold as $t \to T$ and that the flow can be extended using the Orbifold Ricci flow to the time interval $ [0,T+\sigma)$ for some $\sigma&gt;0.$
  We also prove local versions of many of the results mentioned above.</description>

      <title>Bounding the A-hat genus using scalar curvature lower bounds and isoperimetric constants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove an upper bound on the $\widehat{A}$ genus of a smooth, closed, spin Riemannian manifold using its scalar curvature lower bound, Neumann isoperimetric constant, and volume. The proof of this result relies on spectral analysis of the Dirac operator. We also construct an example to show that the Neumann isoperimetric constant in this bound is necessary. Our result partially answers a question of Gromov on bounding characteristic numbers using scalar curvature lower bound.</description>

      <title>Constant mean curvature surfaces from ring patterns: Geometry from combinatorics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define discrete constant mean curvature (cmc) surfaces in the three-dimensional Euclidean and Lorentz spaces in terms of sphere packings with orthogonally intersecting circles. These discrete cmc surfaces can be constructed from orthogonal ring patterns in the two-sphere and the hyperbolic plane. We present a variational principle that allows us to solve boundary value problems and to construct discrete analogues of some classical cmc surfaces. The data used for the construction is purely combinatorial - the combinatorics of the curvature line pattern. In the limit of orthogonal circle patterns we recover the theory of discrete minimal surfaces associated to Koebe polyhedra all edges of which touch a sphere. These are generalized to two-sphere Koebe nets, i.e., nets with planar quadrilateral faces and edges that alternately touch two concentric spheres.</description>

      <title>Local moduli in the special 2-flags of length 5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A number of key issues concerning distributions generating 1-flags(most often called Goursat flags) has been settled over the past 30 years. Presently similar questions are being discussed as regards distributions generating multi-flags. (More precisely, only so-called special multi-flags,to avoid functional moduli in local classifications.) In particular, special 2-flags of small lengths are a natural ground for the search of generalizations of theorems established earlier for Goursat structures. This includes the search for the first appearing modulus (or moduli) in the classification up to local diffeomorphisms of special 2-flags. (For Goursat flags the first modulus of the local classification appears in length 8.) It has been known in this respect that up to length 4 that classification is finite, and that in length 7 at least one numerical modulus exists. In the last fully classified length 4 possible are precisely 34 local geometries (local models) of special 2-flags. We now demonstrate that in the length 5 single numerical moduli show up in exactly three out of altogether 41 singularity classes existing in that length.</description>

      <title>Curve shortening flows on surfaces that are not convex at infinity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The behavior of the curve shortening flow has been extensively studied. Gage, Hamilton, and Grayson proved that, under the curve shortening flow, an embedded closed curve in the Euclidean plane becomes convex after a finite time and then shrinks to a point while remaining convex. Moreover, Grayson extended these results to surfaces that are convex at infinity and proved results similar to those for plane curves. In this paper, we study the curve shortening flow on surfaces that are not convex at infinity. Specifically, we consider a warped product of a unit circle and an open interval with a strictly increasing warping function. In this setting, we can define a graph property for curves within these warped products. It is known that this graph property is preserved along the curve shortening flow. Similarly to the behavior of the curve shortening flow in the plane, we prove that the curve becomes a graph after a finite time under the curve shortening flow.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Mabuchi functional associated to a big cohomology class. We define an invariant associated to transcendental Fujita approximations, whose vanishing is related to the Yau-Tian Donaldson conjecture. Assuming vanishing (finiteness) of this invariant we establish (almost) convexity along weak geodesics. As an application, we give an explicit expression of the distance $d_p$ in the big setting for finite entropy potentials.</description>

      <title>The structure of the token space for large language models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models encode the correlational structure present in natural language by fitting segments of utterances (tokens) into a high dimensional ambient latent space upon which the models then operate. We assert that in order to develop a foundational, first-principles understanding of the behavior and limitations of large language models, it is crucial to understand the topological and geometric structure of this token subspace. In this article, we present estimators for the dimension and Ricci scalar curvature of the token subspace, and apply it to three open source large language models of moderate size: GPT2, LLEMMA7B, and MISTRAL7B. In all three models, using these measurements, we find that the token subspace is not a manifold, but is instead a stratified manifold, where on each of the individual strata, the Ricci curvature is significantly negative. We additionally find that the dimension and curvature correlate with generative fluency of the models, which suggest that these findings have implications for model behavior.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The magnetic Dirichlet-to-Neumann map encodes the voltage-to-current measurements under the influence of a magnetic field. In the case of surfaces, we provide precise spectral asymptotics expansion (up to arbitrary polynomial power) for the eigenvalues of this map. Moreover, we consider the inverse spectral problem and from the expansion we show that the spectrum of the magnetic Dirichlet-to-Neumann map, in favourable situations, uniquely determines the number and the length of boundary components, the parallel transport and the magnetic flux along boundary components. In general, we show that the situation complicates compared to the case when there is no magnetic field. For instance, there are plenty of examples where the expansion does $\textit{not}$ detect the number of boundary components, and this phenomenon is thoroughly studied in the paper.</description>

Abstract: Near a singular point of a surface or a curve, geometric invariants diverge in general, and the orders of diverge, in particular the boundedness about these invariants represent geometry of the surface and the curve. In this paper, we study boundedness and orders of several geometric invariants near a singular point of a surface which is a suspension of a singular curve in the plane and those of curves passing through the singular point. We evaluates the orders of Gaussian and mean curvatures and them of geodesic, normal curvatures and geodesic torsion for the curve.</description>

      <title>Metrics of Positive Ricci Curvature on Simply-Connected Manifolds of Dimension $6k$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.15610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.15610v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A consequence of the surgery theorem of Gromov and Lawson is that every closed, simply-connected 6-manifold admits a Riemannian metric of positive scalar curvature. For metrics of positive Ricci curvature it is widely open whether a similar result holds; there are no obstructions known for those manifolds to admit a metric of positive Ricci curvature, while the number of examples known is limited. In this article we introduce a new description of certain $6k$-dimensional manifolds via labeled bipartite graphs and use an earlier result of the author to construct metrics of positive Ricci curvature on these manifolds. In this way we obtain many new examples, both spin and non-spin, of $6k$-dimensional manifolds with a metric of positive Ricci curvature.</description>

      <title>Subcomplexes on filtered Riemannian manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.02342v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a general construction to extract subcomplexes from two distinct complexes on filtered Riemannian manifolds. The first subcomplex computes the de Rham cohomology of the underlying manifold. On regular subRiemannian manifold equipped with a compatible Riemannian metric, it aligns locally with the so-called Rumin complex. The second complex instead generalises the Chevalley-Eilenberg complex computing Lie algebra cohomology of a nilpotent Lie group. Our approach offers key insights on the role of the Riemannian metric when extracting subcomplexes, opening up potential new applications in more general geometric settings, such as singular subRiemannian manifolds.</description>

      <title>Strengthened injectivity radius bounds for manifolds with positive scalar curvature</title>

Abstract: Green's inequality shows that a compact    Riemannian manifold with scalar curvature at least $n(n-1)$ has    injectivity radius at most $\pi$, and that equality is achieved    only for the radius 1 sphere. In this work we show how extra    topological assumptions can lead to stronger upper bounds. The    topologies we consider are    $\mathbb{S}^2\times\mathbb{T}^{n-k-2}\times\mathbb{R}^k$ for    $n\leq 7$ and $0\leq k\leq 2$ and 3-manifolds with positive scalar    curvature except lens spaces $L(p,q)$ with $p$ odd. We also prove    a strengthened inequality for $3$-manifolds with positive scalar    curvature and large diameter. Our proof uses    previous results of Gromov and Zhu.</description>

Abstract: We show that $\Theta$-positive Anosov representations $\rho:\Gamma\to{\sf PO}(p,q)$ of a surface group $\Gamma$ satisfy root versus weight collar lemmas for all the Anosov roots, and are positively ratioed with respect to all such roots. We deduce from this, using a result of Beyrer-Pozzetti (2024), that $\Theta$-positive Anosov representations $\rho:\Gamma\to{\sf PO}(p,q)$ form connected components of character varieties.</description>

      <title>Topological twists of massive SQCD, Part II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11616v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This is the second and final part of ``Topological twists of massive SQCD''. Part I is available at arXiv:2206.08943. In this second part, we evaluate the contribution of the Coulomb branch to topological path integrals for $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric QCD with $N_f\leq 3$ massive hypermultiplets on compact four-manifolds. Our analysis includes the decoupling of hypermultiplets, the massless limit and the merging of mutually non-local singularities at the Argyres-Douglas points. We give explicit mass expansions for the four-manifolds $\mathbb{P}^2$ and $K3$. For $\mathbb{P}^2$, we find that the correlation functions are polynomial as function of the masses, while infinite series and (potential) singularities occur for $K3$. The mass dependence corresponds mathematically to the integration of the equivariant Chern class of the matter bundle over the moduli space of $Q$-fixed equations. We demonstrate that the physical partition functions agree with mathematical results on Segre numbers of instanton moduli spaces.</description>

      <title>Minimal Elements of the Causal Boundary with Applications to Spacetime Splitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07782v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 1972, Geroch, Kronheimer, and Penrose introduced what is now called the causal boundary of a spacetime. This boundary is constructed out of Terminal Indecomposable Past sets (TIPs) and their future analogues (TIFs), which are the pasts and futures of inextendible causal curves. The causal boundary is a key tool to understand the global structure of a spacetime. In this paper, we show that in a spacetime with compact Cauchy surfaces, there is always at least one minimal TIP and one minimal TIF, minimal meaning that it does not contain another TIP (resp.\ TIF) as a proper subset. We then study the implications of the minimal TIP and TIF meeting each other. This condition generalizes some of the "no observer horizon" conditions that have been used in the literature to obtain partial solutions of the Bartnik splitting conjecture. We also show that such a no observer horizons condition is satisfied when the spacetime has a (possibly discrete) timelike conformal symmetry, generalizing a result of Costa e Silva, Flores, and Herrera about conformal Killing vector fields.</description>

      <title>Spherical and hyperbolic orthogonal ring patterns: integrability and variational principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06573v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce orthogonal ring patterns in the 2-sphere and in the hyperbolic plane, consisting of pairs of concentric circles, which generalize circle patterns. We show that their radii are described by a discrete integrable system. This is a special case of the master integrable equation Q4. The variational description is given in terms of elliptic generalizations of the dilogarithm function. They have the same convexity principles as their circle-pattern counterparts. This allows us to prove existence and uniqueness results for the Dirichlet and Neumann boundary value problems. Some examples are computed numerically. In the limit of small smoothly varying rings, one obtains harmonic maps to the sphere and to the hyperbolic plane. A close relation to discrete surfaces with constant mean curvature is explained.</description>

      <title>Local superconformal algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08176v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a supermanifold equipped with an odd distribution of maximal dimension and constant symbol, we construct the formal moduli problem of deformations of the distribution. This moduli problem is described by a local super dg Lie algebra that provides both a resolution of the structure-preserving vector fields on superspace and a derived enhancement of superconformal symmetry. Applying our construction in standard physical examples returns the conformal supergravity multiplet in every known example, in any dimension and with any amount of supersymmetry$\unicode{x2014}$whether or not a superconformal algebra exists. We discuss new examples related to twisted supergravity, higher Virasoro algebras, and exceptional super Lie algebras. The compatibility of our techniques with twisting also leads to a computation of every twist of the stress tensor multiplet of a superconformal theory, including universal operator product expansions. Our approach uses a derived model for the space of functions constant along the distribution, which is applicable even when the distribution is non-involutive; we construct other natural multiplets, such as K\"ahler differentials, that appear naturally through this lens on superspace geometry.</description>
