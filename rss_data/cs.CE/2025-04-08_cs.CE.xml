      <title>LATTE: Lightweight Attention-based Traffic Accident Anticipation Engine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately predicting traffic accidents in real-time is a critical challenge in autonomous driving, particularly in resource-constrained environments. Existing solutions often suffer from high computational overhead or fail to adequately address the uncertainty of evolving traffic scenarios. This paper introduces LATTE, a Lightweight Attention-based Traffic Accident Anticipation Engine, which integrates computational efficiency with state-of-the-art performance. LATTE employs Efficient Multiscale Spatial Aggregation (EMSA) to capture spatial features across scales, Memory Attention Aggregation (MAA) to enhance temporal modeling, and Auxiliary Self-Attention Aggregation (AAA) to extract latent dependencies over extended sequences. Additionally, LATTE incorporates the Flamingo Alert-Assisted System (FAA), leveraging a vision-language model to provide real-time, cognitively accessible verbal hazard alerts, improving passenger situational awareness. Evaluations on benchmark datasets (DAD, CCD, A3D) demonstrate LATTE's superior predictive capabilities and computational efficiency. LATTE achieves state-of-the-art 89.74% Average Precision (AP) on DAD benchmark, with 5.4% higher mean Time-To-Accident (mTTA) than the second-best model, and maintains competitive mTTA at a Recall of 80% (TTA@R80) (4.04s) while demonstrating robust accident anticipation across diverse driving conditions. Its lightweight design delivers a 93.14% reduction in floating-point operations (FLOPs) and a 31.58% decrease in parameter count (Params), enabling real-time operation on resource-limited hardware without compromising performance. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of LATTE's architectural components, while visualizations and failure case analyses highlight its practical applicability and areas for enhancement.

      <title>Iterative Random Weight EC-TOPSIS Method for Ranking Companies on Social Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study aims to present a new hybrid method for weighting criteria. The methodological project combines the ENTROPY and CRITIC methods with the TOPSIS method to create EC-TOPSIS. The difference lies in the use of a weight range per criterion. Each weight range has a lower limit and an upper limit, which are combined to generate random numbers, producing t sets of weights per criterion, allowing t final rankings to be obtained. The final ranking is obtained by applying the MODE statistical measure to the set of t positions of each alternative. The method was validated by ranking the companies based on social media metrics consisting of user-generated content (UGC). The result was compared with the original modeling using the CRITIC-ARAS and CRITIC-COPRAS methods, and the results were consistent and balanced, with few changes. The practical implication of the method is in reducing the uncertainties surrounding the final classification due to the random weighting process and the number of interactions sent.</description>

      <title>From Coarse to Fine: A Physics-Informed Self-Guided Flow Diffusion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning methods are widely explored as a promising way to reconstruct high-fidelity computational fluid dynamics (CFD) data from faster-to-compute low-fidelity input. Diffusion models have achieved great success as they can reconstruct high-fidelity data from low-fidelity inputs at arbitrary resolution without re-training. However, most existing approaches assume that low-fidelity data is generated artificially via downsampling high-fidelity data. In reality, low-fidelity data is produced by numerical solvers that use a coarser resolution from the start, leading to substantial differences compared to high-fidelity data, especially in the long-range. Solver-generated low-fidelity data usually sacrifices fine-grained details, such as small-scale vortices compared to high-fidelity ones. To bridge this gap, we propose \model, a novel diffusion model for reconstruction, where both low- and high-fidelity data are straight from numerical solvers. Our findings show that state-of-the-art models struggle to generate fine-scale details when faced with solver-generated low-fidelity inputs. To address this challenge, we propose an \textit{Importance Weight} strategy during training that serves as a form of self-guidance, along with a training-free \textit{Residual Correction} approach during inference that embeds physical insights into the model. Together, these techniques steer the diffusion model toward more accurate reconstructions. Experimental results on four 2D turbulent flow datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed method.</description>

      <title>Robust and scalable nonlinear solvers for finite element discretizations of biological transportation networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop robust and scalable fully implicit nonlinear finite element solvers for the simulations of biological transportation networks driven by the gradient flow minimization of a non-convex energy cost functional. Our approach employs a discontinuous space for the conductivity tensor that allows us to guarantee the preservation of its positive semi-definiteness throughout the entire minimization procedure arising from the time integration of the gradient flow dynamics using a backward Euler scheme. Extensive tests in two and three dimensions demonstrate the robustness and performance of the solver, highlight the sensitivity of the emergent network structures to mesh resolution and topology, and validate the resilience of the linear preconditioner to the ill-conditioning of the model. The implementation achieves near-optimal parallel scaling on large-scale, high-performance computing platforms. To the best of our knowledge, the network formation system has never been simulated in three dimensions before. Consequently, our three-dimensional results are the first of their kind.</description>

      <title>A model agnostic eXplainable AI based fuzzy framework for sensor constrained Aerospace maintenance applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine Learning methods have extensively evolved to support industrial big data methods and their corresponding need in gas turbine maintenance and prognostics. However, most unsupervised methods need extensively labeled data to perform predictions across many dimensions. The cutting edge of small and medium applications do not necessarily maintain operational sensors and data acquisition with rising costs and diminishing profits. We propose a framework to make sensor maintenance priority decisions using a combination of SHAP, UMAP, Fuzzy C-means clustering. An aerospace jet engine dataset is used as a case study.</description>

      <title>A hydro-geomechanical porous-media model to study effects of engineered carbonate precipitation in faults</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydro-geomechanical models are required to predict or understand the impact of subsurface engineering applications as, for example, in gas storage in geological formations. This study puts a focus on engineered carbonate precipitation through biomineralization in a fault zone of a cap-rock to reduce gas leakage from a reservoir. Besides hydraulic properties like porosity and permeability, precipitated carbonates also change the mechanical properties of the rock. We present a conceptual modeling approach implemented into the open-source simulator Dumux and, after verification examples, at hand of a CO2-storage scenario, we discuss impacts of biomineralization on the stress distribution in the rock and potentially altered risks of fault reactivations and induced seismic events.
  The generic study shows the tendency towards increased stiffness due to precipitated carbonate, which may cause shear failure events to occur earlier than in an untreated setup, while the magnitude of the seismicity is smaller.</description>

      <title>cfdSCOPE: A Fluid-Dynamics Proxy App for Teaching Performance Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Teaching performance engineering in high-performance computing (HPC) requires example codes that demonstrate bottlenecks and enable hands-on optimization. However, existing HPC applications and proxy apps often lack the balance of simplicity, transparency, and optimization potential needed for effective teaching. To address this, we developed cfdSCOPE, a compact, open-source computational fluid dynamics (CFD) proxy app specifically designed for educational purposes. cfdSCOPE simulates flow in a 3D volume using sparse linear algebra, a common HPC workload, and comprises fewer than 1,100 lines of code. Its minimal dependencies and transparent design ensure students can fully control and optimize performance-critical aspects, while its naive OpenMP parallelization provides significant optimization opportunities, thus making it an ideal tool for teaching performance engineering.</description>

      <title>Scalable heliostat surface predictions from focal spots: Sim-to-Real transfer of inverse Deep Learning Raytracing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Concentrating Solar Power (CSP) plants are a key technology in the transition toward sustainable energy. A critical factor for their safe and efficient operation is the distribution of concentrated solar flux on the receiver. However, flux distributions from individual heliostats are sensitive to surface imperfections. Measuring these surfaces across many heliostats remains impractical in real-world deployments. As a result, control systems often assume idealized heliostat surfaces, leading to suboptimal performance and potential safety risks. To address this, inverse Deep Learning Raytracing (iDLR) has been introduced as a novel method for inferring heliostat surface profiles from target images recorded during standard calibration procedures. In this work, we present the first successful Sim-to-Real transfer of iDLR, enabling accurate surface predictions directly from real-world target images. We evaluate our method on 63 heliostats under real operational conditions. iDLR surface predictions achieve a median mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.17 mm and show good agreement with deflectometry ground truth in 84% of cases. When used in raytracing simulations, it enables flux density predictions with a mean accuracy of 90% compared to deflectometry over our dataset, and outperforms the commonly used ideal heliostat surface assumption by 26%. We tested this approach in a challenging double-extrapolation scenario-involving unseen sun positions and receiver projection-and found that iDLR maintains high predictive accuracy, highlighting its generalization capabilities. Our results demonstrate that iDLR is a scalable, automated, and cost-effective solution for integrating realistic heliostat surface models into digital twins. This opens the door to improved flux control, more precise performance modeling, and ultimately, enhanced efficiency and safety in future CSP plants.</description>

      <title>RLDBF: Enhancing LLMs Via Reinforcement Learning With DataBase FeedBack</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While current large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable linguistic capabilities through training on massive unstructured text corpora, they remain inadequate in leveraging structured scientific data (e.g., chemical molecular properties in databases) that encapsulate centuries of accumulated scientific expertise. These structured datasets hold strategic significance for advancing AI for Science yet current approaches merely treat them as auxiliary supplements to unstructured text. This study pioneers a systematic investigation into enhancing LLMs with structured scientific data, using chemical molecular science as a testbed. We investigate the impact of incorporating molecular property data on LLM across distinct training phases, including continual pre-training, supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning. Notably, to address the inherent limitation of numerical insensitivity in large models, we propose an innovative methodology termed "Reinforcement Learning with Database Feedback" (RLDBF). Experimental evaluations demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach, with the model exhibiting remarkable generalization capabilities on previously unseen data and other chemical tasks. The results substantiate the potential of our method in advancing the field of structured scientific data processing within LLMs.</description>

      <title>Detecting Plant VOC Traces Using Indoor Air Quality Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the era of growing interest in healthy buildings and smart homes, the importance of sustainable, health conscious indoor environments is paramount. Smart tools, especially VOC sensors, are crucial for monitoring indoor air quality, yet interpreting signals from various VOC sources remains challenging. A promising approach involves understanding how indoor plants respond to environmental conditions. Plants produce terpenes, a type of VOC, when exposed to abiotic and biotic stressors - including pathogens, predators, light, and temperature - offering a novel pathway for monitoring indoor air quality. While prior work often relies on specialized laboratory sensors, our research leverages readily available commercial sensors to detect and classify plant emitted VOCs that signify changes in indoor conditions. We quantified the sensitivity of these sensors by measuring 16 terpenes in controlled experiments, then identified and tested the most promising terpenes in realistic environments. We also examined physics based models to map VOC responses but found them lacking for real world complexity. Consequently, we trained machine learning models to classify terpenes using commercial sensors and identified optimal sensor placement. To validate this approach, we analyzed emissions from a living basil plant, successfully detecting terpene output. Our findings establish a foundation for overcoming challenges in plant VOC detection, paving the way for advanced plant based sensors to enhance indoor environmental quality in future smart buildings.</description>

      <title>Exploring Various Sequential Learning Methods for Deformation History Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current neural network (NN) models can learn patterns from data points with historical dependence. Specifically, in natural language processing (NLP), sequential learning has transitioned from recurrence-based architectures to transformer-based architectures. However, it is unknown which NN architectures will perform the best on datasets containing deformation history due to mechanical loading. Thus, this study ascertains the appropriateness of 1D-convolutional, recurrent, and transformer-based architectures for predicting deformation localization based on the earlier states in the form of deformation history. Following this investigation, the crucial incompatibility issues between the mathematical computation of the prediction process in the best-performing NN architectures and the actual values derived from the natural physical properties of the deformation paths are examined in detail.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools in the field of finance, particularly for risk management across different asset classes. In this work, we introduce a Cross-Asset Risk Management framework that utilizes LLMs to facilitate real-time monitoring of equity, fixed income, and currency markets. This innovative approach enables dynamic risk assessment by aggregating diverse data sources, ultimately enhancing decision-making processes. Our model effectively synthesizes and analyzes market signals to identify potential risks and opportunities while providing a holistic view of asset classes. By employing advanced analytics, we leverage LLMs to interpret financial texts, news articles, and market reports, ensuring that risks are contextualized within broader market narratives. Extensive backtesting and real-time simulations validate the framework, showing increased accuracy in predicting market shifts compared to conventional methods. The focus on real-time data integration enhances responsiveness, allowing financial institutions to manage risks adeptly under varying market conditions and promoting financial stability through the advanced application of LLMs in risk analysis.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Hedging Strategies in Derivatives Markets with LLM-Driven Sentiment and News Analytics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamic hedging strategies are essential for effective risk management in derivatives markets, where volatility and market sentiment can greatly impact performance. This paper introduces a novel framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) for sentiment analysis and news analytics to inform hedging decisions. By analyzing textual data from diverse sources like news articles, social media, and financial reports, our approach captures critical sentiment indicators that reflect current market conditions. The framework allows for real-time adjustments to hedging strategies, adapting positions based on continuous sentiment signals. Backtesting results on historical derivatives data reveal that our dynamic hedging strategies achieve superior risk-adjusted returns compared to conventional static approaches. The incorporation of LLM-driven sentiment analysis into hedging practices presents a significant advancement in decision-making processes within derivatives trading. This research showcases how sentiment-informed dynamic hedging can enhance portfolio management and effectively mitigate associated risks.</description>

      <title>Scaling Graph Neural Networks for Particle Track Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Particle track reconstruction is an important problem in high-energy physics (HEP), necessary to study properties of subatomic particles. Traditional track reconstruction algorithms scale poorly with the number of particles within the accelerator. The Exa.TrkX project, to alleviate this computational burden, introduces a pipeline that reduces particle track reconstruction to edge classification on a graph, and uses graph neural networks (GNNs) to produce particle tracks. However, this GNN-based approach is memory-prohibitive and skips graphs that would exceed GPU memory. We introduce improvements to the Exa.TrkX pipeline to train on samples of input particle graphs, and show that these improvements generalize to higher precision and recall. In addition, we adapt performance optimizations, introduced for GNN training, to fit our augmented Exa.TrkX pipeline. These optimizations provide a $2\times$ speedup over our baseline implementation in PyTorch Geometric.</description>

      <title>Projection-based model-order reduction via graph autoencoders suited for unstructured meshes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13669v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents the development of a graph autoencoder architecture capable of performing projection-based model-order reduction (PMOR) using a nonlinear manifold least-squares Petrov-Galerkin projection scheme. The architecture is particularly useful for advection-dominated flows, as it captures the underlying geometry of the modeled domain to provide a robust nonlinear mapping that can be leveraged in a PMOR setting. The presented graph autoencoder is constructed with a two-part process that consists of (1) generating a hierarchy of reduced graphs to emulate the compressive abilities of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and (2) training a message passing operation at each step in the hierarchy of reduced graphs to emulate the filtering process of a CNN. The resulting framework provides improved flexibility over traditional CNN-based autoencoders because it is extendable to unstructured meshes. To highlight the capabilities of the proposed framework, which is named geometric deep least-squares Petrov-Galerkin (GD-LSPG), we benchmark the method on a one-dimensional Burgers' model with a structured mesh and demonstrate the flexibility of GD-LSPG by deploying it on two test cases for two-dimensional Euler equations that use an unstructured mesh. The proposed framework is more flexible than using a traditional CNN-based autoencoder and provides considerable improvement in accuracy for very low-dimensional latent spaces in comparison with traditional affine projections.</description>

      <title>Parameter estimation of structural dynamics with neural operators enabled surrogate modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11712v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Parameter estimation in structural dynamics generally involves inferring the values of physical, geometric, or even customized parameters based on first principles or expert knowledge, which is challenging for complex structural systems. In this work, we present a unified deep learning-based framework for parameterization, forward modeling, and inverse modeling of structural dynamics. The parameterization is flexible and can be user-defined, including physical and/or non-physical (customized) parameters. In the forward modeling, we train a neural operator for response prediction -- forming a surrogate model, which leverages the defined system parameters and excitation forces as inputs to the model. The inverse modeling focuses on estimating system parameters. In particular, the learned forward surrogate model (which is differentiable) is utilized for preliminary parameter estimation via gradient-based optimization; to further boost the parameter estimation, we introduce a neural refinement method to mitigate ill-posed problems, which often occur in the former. The framework's effectiveness is verified numerically and experimentally, in both interpolation and extrapolation cases, indicating its capability to capture intrinsic dynamics of structural systems from both forward and inverse perspectives. Moreover, the framework's flexibility is expected to support a wide range of applications, including surrogate modeling, structural identification, damage detection, and inverse design of structural systems.</description>

      <title>Leveraging LLMS for Top-Down Sector Allocation In Automated Trading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09647v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a methodology leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for sector-level portfolio allocation through systematic analysis of macroeconomic conditions and market sentiment. Our framework emphasizes top-down sector allocation by processing multiple data streams simultaneously, including policy documents, economic indicators, and sentiment patterns. Empirical results demonstrate superior risk-adjusted returns compared to traditional cross momentum strategies, achieving a Sharpe ratio of 2.51 and portfolio return of 8.79% versus -0.61 and -1.39% respectively. These results suggest that LLM-based systematic macro analysis presents a viable approach for enhancing automated portfolio allocation decisions at the sector level.</description>

      <title>Technical Note: Continuum Theory of Mixture for Three-phase Thermomechanical Model of Fiber-reinforced Aerogel Composites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20713v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a thermodynamically consistent three-phase model for the coupled thermal transport and mechanical deformation of ceramic aerogel porous composite materials, which is formulated via continuum mixture theory. The composite comprises a solid silica skeleton, a gaseous fluid phase, and dispersed solid fibers. The thermal transport model incorporates the effects of meso- and macro-pore size variations due to the Knudsen effect, achieved by upscaling phonon transport relations to derive constitutive equations for the fluid thermal conductivity. The mechanical model captures solid-solid and solid-fluid interactions through momentum exchange between phases. A mixed finite element formulation is employed to solve the multiphase model, and numerical studies are conducted to analyze key features of the computational model.</description>

      <title>Towards Domain Adaptive Neural Contextual Bandits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09564v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Contextual bandit algorithms are essential for solving real-world decision making problems. In practice, collecting a contextual bandit's feedback from different domains may involve different costs. For example, measuring drug reaction from mice (as a source domain) and humans (as a target domain). Unfortunately, adapting a contextual bandit algorithm from a source domain to a target domain with distribution shift still remains a major challenge and largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce the first general domain adaptation method for contextual bandits. Our approach learns a bandit model for the target domain by collecting feedback from the source domain. Our theoretical analysis shows that our algorithm maintains a sub-linear regret bound even adapting across domains. Empirical results show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art contextual bandit algorithms on real-world datasets.</description>
