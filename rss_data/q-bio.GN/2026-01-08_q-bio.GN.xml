      <title>MetagenBERT: a Transformer-based Architecture using Foundational genomic Large Language Models for novel Metagenome Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metagenomic disease prediction commonly relies on species abundance tables derived from large, incomplete reference catalogs, constraining resolution and discarding valuable information contained in DNA reads. To overcome these limitations, we introduce MetagenBERT, a Transformer based framework that produces end to end metagenome embeddings directly from raw DNA sequences, without taxonomic or functional annotations. Reads are embedded using foundational genomic language models (DNABERT2 and the microbiome specialized DNABERTMS), then aggregated through a scalable clustering strategy based on FAISS accelerated KMeans. Each metagenome is represented as a cluster abundance vector summarizing the distribution of its embedded reads. We evaluate this approach on five benchmark gut microbiome datasets (Cirrhosis, T2D, Obesity, IBD, CRC). MetagenBERT achieves competitive or superior AUC performance relative to species abundance baselines across most tasks. Concatenating both representations further improves prediction, demonstrating complementarity between taxonomic and embedding derived signals. Clustering remains robust when applied to as little as 10% of reads, highlighting substantial redundancy in metagenomes and enabling major computational gains. We additionally introduce MetagenBERT Glob Mcardis, a cross cohort variant trained on the large, phenotypically diverse MetaCardis cohort and transferred to other datasets, retaining predictive signal including for unseen phenotypes, indicating the feasibility of a foundation model for metagenome representation. Robustness analyses (PERMANOVA, PERMDISP, entropy) show consistent separation of different states across subsamples. Overall, MetagenBERT provides a scalable, annotation free representation of metagenomes pointing toward future phenotype aware generalization across heterogeneous cohorts and sequencing technologies.</description>

      <title>Tool Choice Matters: Evaluating edgeR vs. DESeq2 for Sensitivity, Robustness, and Cross-Study Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Differential gene expression (DGE) analysis is foundational to transcriptomic research, yet tool selection can substantially influence results. This study presents a comprehensive comparison of two widely used DGE tools, edgeR and DESeq2, using real and semi-simulated bulk RNA-Seq datasets spanning viral, bacterial, and fibrotic conditions. We evaluated tool performance across three key dimensions: (1) sensitivity to sample size and robustness to outliers; (2) classification performance of uniquely identified gene sets within the discovery dataset; and (3) generalizability of tool-specific gene sets across independent studies. First, both tools showed similar responses to simulated outliers, with Jaccard similarity between the DEG sets from perturbed and original (unperturbed) data decreasing as more outliers were added. Second, classification models trained on tool-specific genes showed that edgeR achieved higher F1 scores in 9 of 13 contrasts and more frequently reached perfect or near-perfect precision. Dolan-More performance profiles further indicated that edgeR maintained performance closer to optimal across a greater proportion of datasets. Third, in cross-study validation using four independent SARS-CoV-2 datasets, gene sets uniquely identified by edgeR yielded higher AUC, precision, and recall in classifying samples from held-out datasets. This pattern was consistent across folds, with some test cases achieving perfect separation using edgeR-specific genes. In contrast, DESeq2-specific genes showed lower and more variable performance across studies. Overall, our findings highlight that while DESeq2 may identify more DEGs even under stringent significance conditions, edgeR yields more robust and generalizable gene sets for downstream classification and cross-study replication, which underscores key trade-offs in tool selection for transcriptomic analyses.</description>
