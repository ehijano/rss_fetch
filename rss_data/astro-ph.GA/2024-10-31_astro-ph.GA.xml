      <title>How the Cookie Crumbles: A Model for Star-forming Clumps in High-redshift Disk Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a simple model for the number distribution of maximally star-forming clumps in rotating disk galaxies, at high-$z$ with high gas surface densities. By combining assumptions surrounding marginal stability of disks against gravitational fragmentation and collapse (i.e., Toomre's $Q\approx 1$), star cluster formation efficiency scaling with local gas surface density, and star formation rates being tied to the relevant local dynamical/free-fall times, we find a star-forming clump distribution of $N_c(&gt; \dot M_\star) \propto \dot M_\star^{-4/3}$ when assuming a power-law form for the gas surface density profile, and a numerically integrable relation for arbitrary gas disk profiles. We compare this model with recent high-redshift observations of lensed clumpy star-forming rotation-dominated galaxies, and find good agreement with the distribution of clump star formation rates and number of clumps. Moreover, we argue that any rotation-supported galaxy should have a significantly higher number of identifiable star-forming clumps relative to dispersion supported objects at a similar mass as $N_c \sim (V_c/\sigma)^2$.</description>

      <title>Capturing Turbulence with Numerical Dissipation: a Simple Dynamical Model for Unresolved Turbulence in Hydrodynamic Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling unresolved turbulence in astrophysical gasdynamic simulations can improve the modeling of other subgrid processes dependent on the turbulent structure of gas: from flame propagation in the interiors of combusting white dwarfs to star formation and chemical reaction rates in the interstellar medium, and non-thermal pressure support of circum- and intergalactic gas. We present a simple method for modeling unresolved turbulence in hydrodynamic simulations via tracking its sourcing by local numerical dissipation and modeling its decay into heat. This method is physically justified by the generic property of turbulent flows that they dissipate kinetic energy at a rate set by the energy cascade rate from large scales, which is independent of fluid viscosity regardless of its nature, be it physical or numerical. We calibrate and test our model against decaying supersonic turbulence simulations. Despite its simplicity, the model quantitatively reproduces multiple non-trivial features of the high-resolution turbulence run: the temporal evolution of the average small-scale turbulence, its dependence on spatial scale, and the slope and scatter of the local correlation between subgrid turbulent velocities, gas densities, and local compression rates. As an example of practical applications, we use our model in isolated galactic disk simulations to model locally variable star formation efficiency at the subresolution scale. In the supersonic, star-forming gas, the new model performs comparably to a more sophisticated model where the turbulent cascade is described by explicit subgrid terms. Our new model is straightforward to implement in many hydrodynamic codes used in galaxy simulations as it utilizes already existing infrastructure to implicitly track the numerical dissipation in such codes.</description>

      <title>Towards Understanding the Milky Way's Typicality: Assessing the Chemodynamics of M31's Bulge &amp; Bar, Thick &amp; Thin Discs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe a novel framework to model galaxy spectra with two cospatial stellar populations, such as may represent a bulge &amp; bar or thick &amp; thin disc, and apply it to APOGEE spectra in the inner $\sim$2 kpc of M31, as well as to stacked spectra representative of the northern and southern parts of M31's disc ($R\sim4-7$ kpc). We use a custom M31 photometric decomposition and A-LIST spectral templates to derive the radial velocity, velocity dispersion, metallicity, and $\alpha$ abundance for both components in each spectrum. In the bulge, one component exhibits little net rotation, high velocity dispersion ($\sim$170 km s$^{-1}$), near-solar metallicity, and high $\alpha$ abundance ([$\alpha$/M] = 0.28), while the second component shows structured rotation, lower velocity dispersion ($\sim$121 km s$^{-1}$), and slightly higher abundances ([M/H] = 0.09, [$\alpha$/M] = 0.3). We tentatively associate the first component with the classical bulge and the second with the bar. In the north disc we identify two distinct components: the first with hotter kinematics, lower metallicity, and higher $\alpha$ abundance than the second ([M/H] = 0.1 and 0.39, [$\alpha$/M] = 0.29 and 0.07). These discs appear comparable to the Milky Way's ''thick'' and ''thin'' discs, providing the first evidence that M31's inner disc has a similar chemodynamical structure. We do not identify two distinct components in the south, potentially due to effects from recent interactions. Such multi-population analysis is crucial to constrain galaxy evolution models that strive to recreate the complex stellar populations found in the Milky Way.</description>

      <title>The SRG/eROSITA diffuse soft X-ray background. I. The local hot bubble in the western Galactic hemisphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The SRG/eROSITA All-Sky Surveys (eRASSs) combine the advantages of complete sky coverage and the energy resolution provided by the charge couple device and offer the most holistic and detailed view of the diffuse soft X-ray background (SXRB) to date. The first eRASS (eRASS1) was completed at solar minimum, when solar wind charge exchange emission was minimal, providing the clearest view of the SXRB. We aim to extract spatial and spectral information from each constituent of the SXRB in the western Galactic hemisphere, focusing on the local hot bubble (LHB). We extracted and analysed eRASS1 spectra from almost all directions in the western Galactic hemisphere by dividing the sky into equal signal-to-noise bins. We fitted all bins with fixed spectral templates of known background constituents. We find the temperature of the LHB exhibits a north-south dichotomy at high latitudes ($|b|&gt;30^{\circ}$), with the south being hotter, with a mean temperature at $kT=121.8\pm0.6\,$eV and the north at $kT=100.8\pm0.5\,$eV. At low latitudes, the LHB temperature increases towards the Galactic plane, especially towards the inner Galaxy. The LHB emission measure (${\rm EM_{LHB}}$) enhances approximately towards the Galactic poles. The ${\rm EM_{LHB}}$ map shows clear anti-correlation with the local dust column density. In particular, we found tunnels of dust cavities filled with hot plasma, potentially forming a wider network of hot interstellar medium. We also constructed a three-dimensional LHB model from ${\rm EM_{LHB}}$, assuming constant density. The average thermal pressure of the LHB is $P_{\rm thermal}/k=10100^{+1200}_{-1500}\,{\rm cm^{-3}\,K}$, a lower value than typical supernova remnants and wind-blown bubbles. This could be an indication of the LHB being open towards high Galactic latitudes.</description>

      <title>ASURA-FDPS-ML: Star-by-star Galaxy Simulations Accelerated by Surrogate Modeling for Supernova Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce new high-resolution galaxy simulations accelerated by a surrogate model that reduces the computation cost by approximately 75 percent. Massive stars with a Zero Age Main Sequence mass of about 8 solar masses and above explode as core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe), which play a critical role in galaxy formation. The energy released by CCSNe is essential for regulating star formation and driving feedback processes in the interstellar medium (ISM). However, the short integration timesteps required for SNe feedback present significant bottlenecks in star-by-star galaxy simulations that aim to capture individual stellar dynamics and the inhomogeneous shell expansion of SNe within the turbulent ISM. Our new framework combines direct numerical simulations and surrogate modeling, including machine learning and Gibbs sampling. The star formation history and the time evolution of outflow rates in the galaxy match those obtained from resolved direct numerical simulations. Our new approach achieves high-resolution fidelity while reducing computational costs, effectively bridging the physical scale gap and enabling multi-scale simulations.</description>

      <title>NGDEEP: The Star Formation and Ionization Properties of Galaxies at $1.7 &lt; z &lt; 3.4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use JWST/NIRISS slitless spectroscopy from the Next Generation Deep Extragalactic Exploratory Public (NGDEEP) Survey to investigate the physical condition of star-forming galaxies at $1.7 &lt; z &lt; 3.4$. At these redshifts, the deep NGDEEP NIRISS slitless spectroscopy covers the [O II]$\lambda\lambda$3726,3729, [O III]$\lambda\lambda$4959,5007, H$\beta$ and H$\alpha$ emission features for galaxies with stellar masses $\log(\mathrm{M_\ast/M_\odot}) \gtrsim 7$, nearly a factor of a hundred lower than previous studies. We focus on the [O III]/[O II] (O$_{32}$) ratio which is primarily sensitive to the ionization state and with a secondary dependence on the gas-phase metallicity of the interstellar medium. We find significant ($\gtrsim5\sigma$) correlations between the O$_{32}$ ratio and galaxy properties as O$_{32}$ increases with decreasing stellar mass, decreasing star formation rate (SFR), increasing specific SFR (sSFR$\equiv \mathrm{SFR}/M_*$), and increasing equivalent width (EW) of H$\beta$ and H$\alpha$. These trends suggest a tight connection between the ionization parameter and these galaxy properties. Galaxies at $z\sim2-3$ exhibit a higher O$_{32}$ than local normal galaxies with the same stellar masses and SFRs, indicating that they have a higher ionization parameter and lower metallicity than local normal galaxies. In addition, we observe an evolutionary trend in the O$_{32}$ -- EW(H$\beta$) relation from $z\sim0$ and $z\gtrsim5$, such that higher redshift galaxies have higher EW(H$\beta$) and higher O$_{32}$ at fixed EW. We argue that both the enhanced recent star formation activity and the higher star formation surface density may contribute to the increase in O$_{32}$ and the ionization parameter.</description>

      <title>The SOFIA Massive (SOMA) Star Formation Q-band Follow-up. I. -Carbon-Chain Chemistry of Intermediate-Mass Protostars-</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evidence for similar chemical characteristics around low- and high-mass protostars has been found: in particular, a variety of carbon-chain species and complex organic molecules (COMs) are formed around them. On the other hand, the chemical compositions around intermediate-mass (IM; $2 M_{\odot} &lt; m_* &lt;8 M_{\odot}$) protostars have not been studied with large samples. In particular, it is unclear the extent to which carbon-chain species are formed around them. We aim to obtain the chemical compositions, particularly focusing on carbon-chain species, towards a sample of IM protostars. We have conducted Q-band (31.5-50 GHz) line survey observations towards eleven mainly intermediate-mass protostars with the Yebes 40 m radio telescope. The target protostars were selected from a sub-sample of the source list of the SOFIA Massive (SOMA) Star Formation project. Nine carbon-chain species (HC$_3$N, HC$_5$N, C$_3$H, C$_4$H, $linear-$H$_2$CCC, $cyclic-$C$_3$H$_2$, CCS, C$_3$S, and CH$_3$CCH), three COMs (CH$_3$OH, CH$_3$CHO, and CH$_3$CN), H$_2$CCO, HNCO, and four simple sulfur (S)-bearing species ($^{13}$CS, C$^{34}$S, HCS$^+$, H$_2$CS) have been detected. The rotational temperatures of HC$_5$N are derived to be $\sim20-30$ K in three IM protostars and they are very similar compared to those around low- and high-mass protostars. These results indicate that carbon-chain molecules are formed in lukewarm ($\sim20-30$ K) gas around the IM protostars by the Warm Carbon-Chain Chemistry (WCCC) process. Carbon-chain formation occurs ubiquitously in the warm gas around protostars across a wide range of stellar masses. Carbon-chain molecules and COMs coexist around most of the target IM protostars, which is similar to the situation in low- and high-mass protostars. The chemical characteristics around protostars are common in the low-, intermediate- and high-mass regimes.</description>

      <title>Exploring Galactic open clusters with Gaia II. Mass Segregation and Mass Function in Fifteen Nearby Open Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Mass is the most critical physical parameter in the evolution of a star. Since stars form in clusters their Initial Mass Function (IMF) is decisive in their evolution. Aims. Use Gaia DR3-based stellar masses_mass flame and the stellar members found for fifteen nearby open clusters from Paper I, to estimate their mass segregation and distribution. Methods. For each cluster, the single stars' main sequence was fitted with a moving straight line weighted fit to the Color-Magnitude Diagram, stars brighter than the residuals dispersion were taken as binaries. Single stars masses were obtained from a cubic spline fit to the mass_flame vs. G magnitude data. For binary stars, the individual masses of each component were estimated using simulated-based inference. We used the minimum spanning tree concept to measure the mass segregation of each cluster. From the stellar mass distribution, an estimate of the power-law coefficient that best describes it was used to characterize the IMF. Results. Mass segregation is visible in all the clusters, the older ones have about 50% of their most massive stars segregated, while younger ones extend from about 30% to 55%. The IMF of the studied clusters is well described by a power-law of index 2.09. Conclusions. Significant mass segregation, from one-third to one-half of its most massive population is present in open clusters as young as &gt; 10 Myr. Mass segregation may be strong for only a few of the most massive stars or less intense but extended to a larger fraction of those, it may start as early as 0.20 of the relaxation time of the cluster and progress over time by increasing both the number of the most massive stars affected and their amount of segregation. Older open clusters show evidence of binary disruption as time progresses.</description>

      <title>The Microlensing Event Rate and Optical Depth from MOA-II 9 year Survey toward the Galactic Bulge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present measurements of the microlensing optical depth and event rate toward the Galactic bulge using the dataset from the 2006--2014 MOA-II survey, which covers 22 bulge fields spanning ~42 deg^2 between -5 deg &lt; l &lt; 10 deg and -7 deg &lt; b &lt; -1 deg. In the central region with |l|&lt;5 deg, we estimate an optical depth of {\tau} = [1.75+-0.04]*10^-6exp[(0.34+-0.02)(3 deg-|b|)] and an event rate of {\Gamma} = [16.08+-0.28]*10^-6exp[(0.44+-0.02)(3 deg-|b|)] star^-1 year^-1 using a sample consisting of 3525 microlensing events, with Einstein radius crossing times of tE &lt; 760 days and source star magnitude of IsWe confirm our results are consistent with the latest measurements from OGLE-IV 8 year dataset (Mr\'oz et al. 2019). We find our result is inconsistent with a prediction based on Galactic models, especially in the central region with |b|&lt;3 deg. These results can be used to improve the Galactic bulge model, and more central regions can be further elucidated by future microlensing experiments, such as The PRime-focus Infrared Microlensing Experiment (PRIME) and Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope.</description>

      <title>A model for the emission line galaxy luminosity function and flux ratios at high-redshifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present $[OIII]/H_{\rm \beta}$ emision line flux ratio predictions for galaxies at $z \sim 7-9$ using the MAPPINGS V v5.2.0 photoionization modelling code combined with an analytic galaxy formation model. Properties such as pressure and ionization parameter that determine emission line properties are thought to evolve towards high redshift. In order to determine the range of expected interstellar conditions we extend previous modelling of the Star Formation Rate Density (SFRD) function to calculate the metallicity and ionization parameter, and incorporate the potential impact of turbulence on the density of the ISM. To validate our emission line predictions we calculate the [OIII] line luminosity and its dependence on UV luminosity, as well as the flux ratio $[OIII]/H_{\rm \beta}$ and its variation with the line luminosity, finding that both reproduce recent JWST observations from the FRESCO survey. We also use our model to predict the number counts of emission line galaxies across a range of redshift as well as the dependence of $[OIII]/H_{\rm \beta}$ on ionization parameter and metallicity. Finally, we show that the dependence of flux ratio on luminosity may provide a diagnostic of turbulent motion in galactic discs.</description>

      <title>Exploring the evolution of red and blue galaxies in different cosmic web environments using IllustrisTNG simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the evolution of red and blue galaxies in different cosmic web environments from redshift $z=3$ to $z=0$ using the IllustrisTNG simulation. We use Otsu's method to classify the red or blue galaxies at each redshift and determine their geometric environments from the eigenvalues of the deformation tensor. Our analysis shows that initially, blue galaxies are more common in clusters followed by filaments, sheets and voids. However, this trend reverses at lower redshifts, with red fractions rising earlier in denser environments. At $z&lt;1$, most massive galaxies ($\log(\frac{M_{*}}{M_{\odot}})&gt;10.5$) are quenched across all environments. In contrast, low-mass galaxies ( $\log(\frac{M_{*}}{M_{\odot}})&lt;10.5$) are more influenced by their environment, with clusters hosting the highest red galaxy fractions at low redshifts. We observe a slower mass growth for low-mass galaxies in clusters at $z&lt;1$. Filaments show relative red fractions (RRF) comparable to clusters at low masses, but host nearly $60\%$ of low-mass blue galaxies, representing a diverse galaxy population. It implies that less intense environmental quenching in filaments allows galaxies to experience a broader range of evolutionary stages. Despite being the densest environment, clusters display the highest relative blue fraction (RBF) for high-mass galaxies, likely due to interactions or mergers that can temporarily rejuvenate star formation in some of them. The $(u-r)$ colour distribution transitions from unimodal to bimodal by redshift $z=2$ across all environments. At $z&lt;1$, clusters exhibit the highest median colour and lowest median specific star formation rate (sSFR), with stellar mass being the primary driver of colour evolution in massive galaxies. Our study suggests that stellar mass governs quenching in high-mass galaxies, while a complex interplay of mass and environment shapes the evolution of low-mass galaxies.</description>

      <title>CEERS: Forging the First Dust -- Transition from Stellar to ISM Grain Growth in the Early Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the coevolution of metals and dust for 173 galaxies at 4.0&lt;z&lt;11.4 observed with JWST/NIRSpec. We use the code CIGALE that integrates photometric and spectroscopic data. Our analysis reveals a critical transition at Mstar = 10^8.5 MSun, from galaxies dominated by supernovae and AGB stardust, to those dominated by grain growth. This implies a two-mode building of dust mass, supported by model predictions. The detection of stardust galaxies provides a natural and inherent explanation to the excess of UV-bright galaxies at z&gt;10 by JWST. Besides, we observe that the metallicity of galaxies at z&gt;8 presents a metal-to-stellar mass ratio larger than a few 10^-3, above a floor. This suggests a very fast rise of metals at high redshift, impacting the tentative detections of population III objects.</description>

      <title>Cross-correlation of Luminous Red Galaxies with ML-selected AGN in HSC-SSP II: AGN classification and clustering with DESI spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An unresolved question in studies of active galactic nuclei (AGN) is whether their different classes probe different evolutionary stages of black hole--host galaxy interaction. We present the projected two-point cross-correlation function between a sample of Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI)-matched AGN selected from Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC-SSP) optical + Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer ($WISE$) mid-IR photometry, and DESI-designated luminous red galaxies, for $z\in 0.5-1.0$. The total overlap area is 43.4 deg$^2$, including $\sim27,000$ spectroscopic LRGs in our redshift range. We visually classified 1,991 matched HSC-DESI objects in our redshift range, spectroscopically confirming that 1,517 ($76\%$) of them are AGN. Of these 1,517 objects, $73\%$ are broad-line AGN, $27\%$ are obscured AGN. We infer that the parent HSC+$WISE$ AGN catalog has a number density of at least $\sim 240$ deg$^{-2}$, confirming it is one of the most complete optical/infrared AGN catalog to date. We investigate the AGN clustering as a function of the spectroscopic classification and infer the halo mass for each sample. The inferred average mass of the halos $\langle M_h\rangle$ that host unobscured broad-line AGN ($M_h \approx 10^{13.4}h^{-1}M_\odot$) is $\sim 5.5\times$ larger than the halos that host obscured AGN ($M_h \approx 10^{12.6}\, h^{-1}M_\odot$), at $2.8\sigma$ significance, in the same sense as our prior work based on photometric redshifts. This suggests that we may relax our concerns about systematic shifts in the inferred redshift distribution producing this halo mass difference. While we do not yet find statistically significant spectroscopic evidence that unobscured AGN reside in more massive halos than their obscured counterparts, further analyses are necessary to distinguish if more complex evolutionary histories are needed to model these AGN populations.</description>

      <title>Deep Chandra Observations of NGC 5728. III: Probing the High-Resolution X-ray Morphology and Multiphase ISM Interactions in the Circumnuclear Region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detailed imaging analysis of 260 ks of sub-arcsecond resolution Chandra Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer (ACIS-S) observations of the nearby Seyfert 2 galaxy NGC 5728. Our study focuses on the bright and diffuse soft X-ray emission within the galaxy's inner ~1 kpc. By comparing the X-ray emission across different energy bands, we identify localized variations in the absorbing column and emission processes. We observe more X-ray absorption in the direction perpendicular to the bicone, which is co-located with an inner warped CO disk in the galaxy. The innermost region, which shows the strongest excess of hard X-ray emission, is spatially coincident with the CO(2-1) emission from ALMA and dusty spirals observed in a Hubble Space Telescope V-H color map. We detect soft extended emission associated with the circumnuclear star-forming ring at ~1 kpc, suggestive of hot gas with kT=0.44 keV. We derive measurements for the hot gas mass, M=7.9x10^5 solar masses, pressure, p=2.0x10^-10 dyne per square cm, and cooling times, t=193.2 Myr. In the vicinity of the star-forming ring, we detect two X-ray point sources with soft X-ray spectra and 0.3-7 keV luminosities L~8x10^38 erg per second. These properties suggest X-ray binaries.</description>

      <title>Simulation-based inference of the 2D ex-situ stellar mass fraction distribution of galaxies using variational autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxies grow through star formation (in-situ) and accretion (ex-situ) of other galaxies. Reconstructing the relative contribution of these two growth channels is crucial for constraining the processes of galaxy formation in a cosmological context. In this on-going work, we utilize a conditional variational autoencoder along with a normalizing flow - trained on a state-of-the-art cosmological simulation - in an attempt to infer the posterior distribution of the 2D ex-situ stellar mass distribution of galaxies solely from observable two-dimensional maps of their stellar mass, kinematics, age and metallicity. Such maps are typically obtained from large Integral Field Unit Surveys such as MaNGA. We find that the average posterior provides an estimate of the resolved accretion histories of galaxies with a mean ~10% error per pixel. We show that the use of a normalizing flow to conditionally sample the latent space results in a smaller reconstruction error. Due to the probabilistic nature of our architecture, the uncertainty of our predictions can also be quantified. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to infer the 2D ex-situ fraction maps from observable maps.</description>

      <title>First Light and Reionisation Epoch Simulations (FLARES) XVII: Learning the galaxy-halo connection at high redshifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the galaxy-halo relationship is not only key for elucidating the interplay between baryonic and dark matter, it is essential for creating large mock galaxy catalogues from N-body simulations. High-resolution hydrodynamical simulations are limited to small volumes by their large computational demands, hindering their use for comparisons with wide-field observational surveys. We overcome this limitation by using the First Light and Reionisation Epoch Simulations (FLARES), a suite of high-resolution (M_gas = 1.8 x 10^6 M_Sun) zoom simulations drawn from a large, (3.2 cGpc)^3 box. We use an extremely randomised trees machine learning approach to model the relationship between galaxies and their subhaloes in a wide range of environments. This allows us to build mock catalogues with dynamic ranges that surpass those obtainable through periodic simulations. The low cost of the zoom simulations facilitates multiple runs of the same regions, differing only in the random number seed of the subgrid models; changing this seed introduces a butterfly effect, leading to random differences in the properties of matching galaxies. This randomness cannot be learnt by a deterministic machine learning model, but by sampling the noise and adding it post-facto to our predictions, we are able to recover the distributions of the galaxy properties we predict (stellar mass, star formation rate, metallicity, and size) remarkably well. We also explore the resolution-dependence of our models' performances and find minimal depreciation down to particle resolutions of order M_DM ~ 10^8 M_Sun, enabling the future application of our models to large dark matter-only boxes.</description>

      <title>Minute time scale variability in $\gamma$-ray flare of BL Lacertae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In October 2024, The object BL Lac experienced a brightest flaring event in gamma-ray ($&gt;$100 MeV) with a historical $\gamma$-ray flux of $\sim$10$^{-5}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. Soon after the event was followed across the waveband and in X-ray (0.3-10 keV) it was also found to be flaring with the maximum flux achieved during this event as 8.30$\times$10$^{-11}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. The high gamma-ray significance enables us to probe the shortest time scale variability possible and for that, we produced the orbital binned light curve, 5 minutes binned light curve, and the 2 minutes binned light curve. A clear variation is seen in the 5-minute light curve and is fitted with the sum of exponentials to derive the rise and decay time scale which ranges between 3 to 12 minutes. The fastest variability time is also estimated to be an order of 1 minute from 2 minute. The estimated size of the emission region is very small (10$^{13}$ cm) compared to the size of the black hole event horizon. The location of the emission region is estimated to be very close to the supermassive black hole (10$^{14}$ cm) and much inside the BLR (0.1 pc). We discussed the possible way to explain this fast-flux variability in BL Lac.</description>

      <title>What is the origin of the JWST SMBHs?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new semi-analytical model for the evolution of galaxies and supermassive black holes (SMBHs) that is based on the extended Press-Schechter formalism and phenomenological modelling of star formation. The model yields BH mass-stellar mass relations that reproduce both the JWST and pre-JWST observations. If the efficiency for BH mergers is high the JWST data prefer light seeds while the pre-JWST data prefers heavy seeds. The fit improves for a smaller merger efficiency, $O(0.1)$, for which both data prefer heavy seeds, while also accommodating the PTA GW background data.</description>

      <title>CAVITY: Calar Alto Void Integral-field Treasury surveY. I. First public data release</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08265v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Calar Alto Void Integral-field Treasury surveY (CAVITY) is a legacy project aimed at characterising the population of galaxies inhabiting voids, which are the most under-dense regions of the cosmic web, located in the Local Universe. This paper describes the first public data release (DR1) of CAVITY, comprising science-grade optical data cubes for the initial 100 out of a total of $\sim$300 galaxies in the Local Universe ($0.005 &lt; z &lt; 0.050$). These data were acquired using the integral-field spectrograph PMAS/PPak mounted on the 3.5m telescope at the Calar Alto observatory. The DR1 galaxy sample encompasses diverse characteristics in the color-magnitude space, morphological type, stellar mass, and gas ionisation conditions, providing a rich resource for addressing key questions in galaxy evolution through spatially resolved spectroscopy. The galaxies in this study were observed with the low-resolution V500 set-up, spanning the wavelength range 3745-7500 \AA, with a spectral resolution of 6.0 \AA\ (FWHM). Here, we describe the data reduction and characteristics and data structure of the CAVITY datasets essential for their scientific utilisation, highlighting such concerns as vignetting effects, as well as the identification of bad pixels and management of spatially correlated noise. We also provide instructions for accessing the CAVITY datasets and associated ancillary data through the project's dedicated database.</description>

      <title>Extreme mass ratio inspirals in galaxies with dark matter halos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.05088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.05088v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using an analytic, static, and spherically symmetric metric for a Schwarzschild black hole immersed in a dark matter (DM) halo with the Hernquist-type profile, we derive analytic expressions for the orbital period and precession of eccentric extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs) surrounded by DM halos, and we show how the precession rates decrease and even undergo a prograde-to-retrograde precession transition if the density of DM halo is large enough. The presence of local DM halos also retards the decrease of the semi-latus rectum and the eccentricity. The orbital evolution of EMRIs immersed in DM halos is then calculated numerically by considering the combined effects of gravitational radiation reaction, dynamical friction, and accretion. Comparing the number of orbital cycles accumulated over a one-year evolution for EMRIs with and without DM halos, we find that DM halos with compactness as small as $10^{-5}$ can be detected. From the mismatch between gravitational waveforms of EMRIs with and without DM halos, we show that EMRIs in galaxies can be used to probe the existence of DM halos and detect the compactness of DM halos as small as $10^{-5}$. Employing the Fisher information matrix method, we find that larger compactness and density values of DM halos help to reduce the estimation error of parameters and further break the degeneracy between the parameters.</description>

Abstract: Dark Matter (DM) properties at small scales remain uncertain. Recent theoretical and observational advances have provided the tools to narrow them down. Here, we show for the first time that the correlation between internal velocities and sizes of dwarf galaxies is a sharp probe of small-scale DM properties. We study modified DM power spectra, motivated by DM production during inflation. Using semi-analytic models and scaling relations, we show that such models can change the kinematics and structure of dwarf galaxies without strongly affecting their total abundance. We analyze data from Milky Way classical satellite galaxies and those discovered with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), finding that the DM power spectrum at comoving scales ${4\, \mathrm{Mpc}^{-1} &lt; k &lt; 37\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}}$ cannot deviate by more than a factor of $\sim 2.5$ from scale invariance. Our results are robust against baryonic uncertainties such as the stellar mass-halo mass relation, halo occupation fraction, and subhalo tidal disruption; allowing us to independently constrain them. This work thus opens a window to probe both dwarf galaxy formation models and small-scale DM properties.</description>

      <title>How do Primordial Black Holes change the Halo Mass Function and Structure?</title>

Abstract: We examine the effects of massive primordial black holes (PBHs) on cosmic structure formation, employing both a semi-analytical approach and cosmological simulations. Our simulations incorporate PBHs with a monochromatic mass distribution centered around $10^6 \ \rm M_{\odot}$, constituting a fraction of $10^{-2}$ to $10^{-4}$ of the dark matter (DM) in the universe, with the remainder being collision-less particle dark matter (PDM). Additionally, we conduct a $\Lambda$CDM simulation for comparative analysis with runs that include PBHs. At smaller scales, halos containing PBHs exhibit similar density and velocity dispersion profiles to those without PBHs. Conversely, at larger scales, PBHs can expedite the formation of massive halos and reside at their centers due to the `seed effect'. To analyze the relative distribution of PBH host halos compared to non-PBH halos, we apply nearest-neighbor (NN) statistics. Our results suggest that PBH host halos, through gravitational influence, significantly impact the structure formation process, compared to the $\Lambda$CDM case, by attracting and engulfing nearby newly-formed minihalos. Should PBHs constitute a fraction of DM significantly larger than $\sim$$10^{-3}$, almost all newly-formed halos will be absorbed by PBH-seeded halos. Consequently, our simulations predict a bimodal feature in the halo mass function, with most of the massive halos containing at least one PBH at their core and the rest being less massive non-PBH halos.</description>
