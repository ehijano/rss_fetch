      <title>Identification and estimation of treatment effects in a linear factor model with fixed number of time periods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper provides a new approach for identifying and estimating the Average Treatment Effect on the Treated under a linear factor model that allows for multiple time-varying unobservables. Unlike the majority of the literature on treatment effects in linear factor models, our approach does not require the number of pre-treatment periods to go to infinity to obtain a valid estimator. Our identification approach employs a certain nonlinear transformations of the time invariant observed covariates that are sufficiently correlated with the unobserved variables. This relevance condition can be checked with the available data on pre-treatment periods by validating the correlation of the transformed covariates and the pre-treatment outcomes. Based on our identification approach, we provide an asymptotically unbiased estimator of the effect of participating in the treatment when there is only one treated unit and the number of control units is large.</description>

      <title>A Powerful Bootstrap Test of Independence in High Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a nonparametric test of independence of one random variable from a large pool of other random variables. The test statistic is the maximum of several Chatterjee's rank correlations and critical values are computed via a block multiplier bootstrap. The test is shown to asymptotically control size uniformly over a large class of data-generating processes, even when the number of variables is much larger than sample size. The test is consistent against any fixed alternative. It can be combined with a stepwise procedure for selecting those variables from the pool that violate independence, while controlling the family-wise error rate. All formal results leave the dependence among variables in the pool completely unrestricted. In simulations, we find that our test is very powerful, outperforming existing tests in most scenarios considered, particularly in high dimensions and/or when the variables in the pool are dependent.</description>

      <title>Cross-Sectional Dynamics Under Network Structure: Theory and Macroeconomic Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.13610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.13610v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many environments in economics involve units linked by bilateral ties. I develop an econometric framework that rationalizes the dynamics of cross-sectional variables as the innovation transmission along fixed bilateral links and that can accommodate rich patterns of how network effects of higher order accumulate over time. The proposed Network-VAR (NVAR) can be used to estimate dynamic network effects, with the network given or inferred from dynamic cross-correlations in the data. In the latter case, it also offers a dimensionality-reduction technique for modeling high-dimensional (cross-sectional) processes, owing to networks' ability to summarize complex relations among variables (units) by relatively few bilateral links. In a first application, I show that sectoral output growth in an RBC economy with lagged input-output conversion follows an NVAR. I characterize impulse-responses to TFP shocks in this environment, and I estimate that the lagged transmission of productivity shocks along supply chains can account for a third of the persistence in aggregate output growth. The remainder is due to persistence in the aggregate TFP process, leaving a negligible role for persistence in sectoral TFP. In a second application, I forecast macroeconomic aggregates across OECD countries by assuming and estimating a network that underlies the dynamics. In line with an equivalence result I provide, this reduces out-of-sample mean squared errors relative to a dynamic factor model. The reductions range from -12% for quarterly real GDP growth to -68% for monthly CPI inflation.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Regression Discontinuity: An Event-Study Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.14203v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I propose a novel argument to identify economically interpretable intertemporal treatment effects in dynamic regression discontinuity designs (RDDs). Specifically, I develop a dynamic potential outcomes model and reformulate two assumptions from the difference-in-differences literature, no anticipation and common trends, to attain point identification of cutoff-specific impulse responses. The estimand of each target parameter can be expressed as the sum of two static RDD contrasts, thereby allowing for nonparametric estimation and inference with standard local polynomial methods. I also propose a nonparametric approach to aggregate treatment effects across calendar time and treatment paths, leveraging a limited path independence restriction to reduce the dimensionality of the parameter space. I apply this method to estimate the dynamic effects of school district expenditure authorizations on housing prices in Wisconsin.</description>

      <title>DisSim-FinBERT: Text Simplification for Core Message Extraction in Complex Financial Texts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04959v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study proposes DisSim-FinBERT, a novel framework that integrates Discourse Simplification (DisSim) with Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) to enhance sentiment prediction in complex financial texts. By simplifying intricate documents such as Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) minutes, DisSim improves the precision of aspect identification, resulting in sentiment predictions that align more closely with economic events. The model preserves the original informational content and captures the inherent volatility of financial language, offering a more nuanced and accurate interpretation of long-form financial communications. This approach provides a practical tool for policymakers and analysts aiming to extract actionable insights from central bank narratives and other detailed economic documents.</description>

      <title>Philip G. Wright, directed acyclic graphs, and instrumental variables</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16395v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wright (1928) deals with demand and supply of oils and butter. In Appendix B of this book, Philip Wright made several fundamental contributions to causal inference. He introduced a structural equation model of supply and demand, established the identification of supply and demand elasticities via the method of moments and directed acyclical graphs, developed empirical methods for estimating demand elasticities using weather conditions as instruments, and proposed methods for counterfactual analysis of the welfare effect of imposing tariffs and taxes. Moreover, he took all of these methods to data. These ideas were far ahead, and much more profound than, any contemporary theoretical and empirical developments on causal inference in statistics or econometrics. This editorial aims to present P. Wright's work in a more modern framework, in a lecture note format that can be useful for teaching and linking to contemporary research.</description>

      <title>Inferring Treatment Effects in Large Panels by Uncovering Latent Similarities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20769v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The presence of unobserved confounders is one of the main challenges in identifying treatment effects. In this paper, we propose a new approach to causal inference using panel data with large large $N$ and $T$. Our approach imputes the untreated potential outcomes for treated units using the outcomes for untreated individuals with similar values of the latent confounders. In order to find units with similar latent characteristics, we utilize long pre-treatment histories of the outcomes. Our analysis is based on a nonparametric, nonlinear, and nonseparable factor model for untreated potential outcomes and treatments. The model satisfies minimal smoothness requirements. We impute both missing counterfactual outcomes and propensity scores using kernel smoothing based on the constructed measure of latent similarity between units, and demonstrate that our estimates can achieve the optimal nonparametric rate of convergence up to log terms. Using these estimates, we construct a doubly robust estimator of the period-specifc average treatment effect on the treated (ATT), and provide conditions, under which this estimator is $\sqrt{N}$-consistent, and asymptotically normal and unbiased. Our simulation study demonstrates that our method provides accurate inference for a wide range of data generating processes.</description>

      <title>The Risk-Neutral Equivalent Pricing of Model-Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13744v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing approaches to asset-pricing under model-uncertainty adapt classical utility-maximisation frameworks and seek theoretical comprehensiveness. We move toward practice by considering binary model-uncertainties and by switching attention from 'preference' to 'constraints'. Economic asset-pricing in this setting is found to decompose into the viable pricing of model-risk and of non-model risk separately such that the former has a unique and intuitive risk-neutral equivalent formulation with convenient properties. Its parameter, a dynamically conserved constant of model-risk inference, allows an integrated representation of ex-ante risk-pricing and bias, such that their ex-post price-effects can be disentangled, through well-known price anomalies such as Momentum and Low-Risk.</description>
