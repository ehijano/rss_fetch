      <title>Macroeconomic Forecasting with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a comparative analysis evaluating the accuracy of Large Language Models (LLMs) against traditional macro time series forecasting approaches. In recent times, LLMs have surged in popularity for forecasting due to their ability to capture intricate patterns in data and quickly adapt across very different domains. However, their effectiveness in forecasting macroeconomic time series data compared to conventional methods remains an area of interest. To address this, we conduct a rigorous evaluation of LLMs against traditional macro forecasting methods, using as common ground the FRED-MD database. Our findings provide valuable insights into the strengths and limitations of LLMs in forecasting macroeconomic time series, shedding light on their applicability in real-world scenarios</description>

      <title>Binary response model with many weak instruments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.04811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.04811v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper considers an endogenous binary response model with many weak instruments. We employ a control function approach and a regularization scheme to obtain better estimation results for the endogenous binary response model in the presence of many weak instruments. Two consistent and asymptotically normally distributed estimators are provided, each of which is called a regularized conditional maximum likelihood estimator (RCMLE) and a regularized nonlinear least squares estimator (RNLSE). Monte Carlo simulations show that the proposed estimators outperform the existing ones when there are many weak instruments. We use the proposed estimation method to examine the effect of family income on college completion.</description>

      <title>Correcting Selection Bias in Standardized Test Scores Comparisons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.10642v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the issue of sample selection bias when comparing countries using International assessments like PISA (Program for International Student Assessment). Despite its widespread use, PISA rankings may be biased due to different attrition patterns in different countries, leading to inaccurate comparisons. This study proposes a methodology to correct for sample selection bias using a quantile selection model. Applying the method to PISA 2018 data, I find that correcting for selection bias significantly changes the rankings (based on the mean) of countries' educational performances. My results highlight the importance of accounting for sample selection bias in international educational comparisons.</description>

      <title>Analyzing the Reporting Error of Public Transport Trips in the Danish National Travel Survey Using Smart Card Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.01198v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Household travel surveys have been used for decades to collect individuals and households' travel behavior. However, self-reported surveys are subject to recall bias, as respondents might struggle to recall and report their activities accurately. This study examines the time reporting error of public transit users in a nationwide household travel survey by matching, at the individual level, five consecutive years of data from two sources, namely the Danish National Travel Survey (TU) and the Danish Smart Card system (Rejsekort). Survey respondents are matched with travel cards from the Rejsekort data solely based on the respondents' declared spatiotemporal travel behavior. Approximately, 70% of the respondents were successfully matched with Rejsekort travel cards. The findings reveal a median time reporting error of 11.34 minutes, with an Interquartile Range of 28.14 minutes. Furthermore, a statistical analysis was performed to explore the relationships between the survey respondents' reporting error and their socio-economic and demographic characteristics. The results indicate that females and respondents with a fixed schedule are in general more accurate than males and respondents with a flexible schedule in reporting their times of travel. Moreover, trips reported during weekdays or via the internet displayed higher accuracies compared to trips reported during weekends and holidays or via telephone interviews. This disaggregated analysis provides valuable insights that could help in improving the design and analysis of travel surveys, as well accounting for reporting errors/biases in travel survey-based applications. Furthermore, it offers valuable insights underlying the psychology of travel recall by survey respondents.</description>

      <title>Entrywise Inference for Missing Panel Data: A Simple and Instance-Optimal Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13665v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Longitudinal or panel data can be represented as a matrix with rows indexed by units and columns indexed by time. We consider inferential questions associated with the missing data version of panel data induced by staggered adoption. We propose a computationally efficient procedure for estimation, involving only simple matrix algebra and singular value decomposition, and prove non-asymptotic and high-probability bounds on its error in estimating each missing entry. By controlling proximity to a suitably scaled Gaussian variable, we develop and analyze a data-driven procedure for constructing entrywise confidence intervals with pre-specified coverage. Despite its simplicity, our procedure turns out to be instance-optimal: we prove that the width of our confidence intervals match a non-asymptotic instance-wise lower bound derived via a Bayesian Cram\'{e}r-Rao argument. We illustrate the sharpness of our theoretical characterization on a variety of numerical examples. Our analysis is based on a general inferential toolbox for SVD-based algorithm applied to the matrix denoising model, which might be of independent interest.</description>
