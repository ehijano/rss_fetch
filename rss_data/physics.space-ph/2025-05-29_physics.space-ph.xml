      <title>Origin of compact exoplanetary systems during disk infall</title>

Abstract: Exoplanetary systems that contain multiple planets on short-period orbits appear to be prevalent in the current observed exoplanetary population, yet the processes that give rise to such configurations remain poorly understood. A common prior assumption is that planetary accretion commences after the infall of gas and solids to the circumstellar disk ended. However, observational evidence indicates that accretion may begin earlier. We propose that compact systems are surviving remnants of planet accretion that occurred during the final phases of infall. In regions of the disk experiencing ongoing infall, the planetary mass is set by the balance between accretion of infalling solids and the increasingly rapid inward migration driven by the surrounding gas as the planet grows. This balance selects for similarly-sized planets whose mass is a function of infall and disk conditions. We show that infall-produced planets can survive until the gas disk disperses and migration ends, and that across a broad range of conditions, the mass of surviving systems is regulated to a few 10^{-5} to 10^{-4} times the host star's mass. This provides an explanation for the similar mass ratios of known compact systems.</description>

      <title>Electron scale magnetic holes generation driven by Whistler-to-Bernstein mode conversion in fully kinetic plasma turbulence</title>

Abstract: Magnetic holes (MHs) are coherent structures characterized by a strong and localized magnetic field amplitude dip, commonly observed in the solar wind and planetary magnetosheaths. These structures come in different sizes, from magnetohydrodynamic to kinetic scales. Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) observations have revealed electron scale MHs to be ubiquitous in the turbulent Earth's magnetosheath, potentially playing an important role in the energy cascade and dissipation. Despite abundant observations, the origin of electron scale MHs is still unclear and debated. In this work, we use fully kinetic simulations to investigate the role of plasma turbulence in generating electron scale MHs. We perform a fully kinetic simulation of freely decaying plasma turbulence, initialized with typical Earth's magnetosheath parameters. We find that electron scale MHs can be generated by turbulence via the following mechanism: first, large-scale turbulent velocity shears produce regions with high electron temperature anisotropy; these localized regions become unstable, generating oblique electron scale whistler waves; as they propagate over the inhomogeneous turbulent background, whistler fluctuations develop an electrostatic component, turning into Bernstein-like modes; the strong electrostatic fluctuations produce current filaments that merge into an electron scale current vortex; the resulting electron vortex locally reduces the magnetic field amplitude, finally evolving into an electron scale MH. We show that MHs generated by this mechanism have properties consistent with MMS observations and nontrivial kinetic features. We provide numerical evidence of a new electron scale MH generation mechanism, driven by turbulence. Our results have potential implications for understanding the formation and occurrence of electron scale MHs in turbulent environments, such as the Earth's magnetosheath.</description>
