      <title>Computing excited eigenstates using inexact Lanczos methods and tree tensor network states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Excited eigenstates are crucial to understand the dynamics of quantum many-body systems. Tensor network states are one of the workhorses to compute ground states of many-body systems, yet the accurate computation of excited eigenstates is still challenging. Here, we develop a combination of the inexact Lanczos method, which aims at efficiently computing excited states, to tree tensor network states (TTNSs). We demonstrate our approach by computing excited vibrational states for three challenging problems: (1) 84 states in different energy intervals of acetonitrile (12-dimensional), (2) Fermi resonance states of the fluxional Zundel ion (15-dimensional), and (3) selected excited states of the fluxional and very correlated Eigen ion (33-dimensional). The proposed TTNS inexact Lanczos method is directly applicable to other quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>A Comparison of Relativistic Coupled Cluster and Equation of Motion Coupled Cluster Quadratic Response Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the implementation of relativistic coupled cluster quadratic response theory (QR-CC), following our development of relativistic equation of motion coupled cluster quadratic response theory (QR-EOMCC) [X. Yuan et al., J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2023, 19, 9248]. These codes, which can be used in combination with relativistic (2- and 4-component based) as well as non-relativistic Hamiltonians, are capable of treating both static and dynamic perturbations for electric and magnetic operators. We have employed this new implementation to revisit the calculation of static and frequency-dependent first hyperpolarizabilities of hydrogen halides (HX, X=F-Ts) and the Verdet constant of heavy noble gas atoms (Xe, Rn, Og), in order to investigate the differences and similarities of QR-CC and the more approximate QR-EOMCC. Furthermore, we have determined the relative importance of scalar relativistic effects and spin-orbit coupling to these properties, through a comparison of different Hamiltonians, and extended our calculations to superheavy element species (HTs for hyperpolarizabilities, Og for the Verdet constant). Our results show that as one moves towards the bottom of the periodic table, QR-EOMCC can yield rather different results (hyperpolarizabilities) or perform rather similarly (Verdet constant) to QR-CC. These results underscore the importance of further characterizing the performance of QR-EOMCC for heavy element systems.</description>

      <title>Insights into Ionic Diffusion in C-S-H Gel Pore from MD Simulations: Spatial Distributions, Energy Barriers, and Structural Descriptor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding transport behavior in nanoconfined environments is critical to many natural and engineering systems, including cementitious materials, yet its molecular-level mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were used to investigate Na+, Cl-, and water diffusion inside a 4 nm calcium-silicate-hydrate (C-S-H) pore channel over temperatures ranging from 300 K to 360 K. Spatially resolved analysis revealed strong suppression of diffusivity near the solid-liquid interface and gradual recovery toward the pore center. Arrhenius analysis further quantified the spatial variation of activation energy barriers and intrinsic mobilities across the pore channel, showing distinct confinement effects. The spatially resolved structural analysis uncovers a mechanistic transition from structure-controlled to hydrodynamics-controlled transport regimes with increasing distance from the pore surface. A structural descriptor, total coordination strength (TCS), was introduced, providing a predictive link between local liquid structure and molecular mobility within approximately 1 nm of the interface. Beyond 1 nm, suppressed diffusivities were well captured by an exponential decay model based on the Darcy-Brinkman framework. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first MD study to comprehensively resolve the spatial heterogeneity of transport, thermal kinetics, and structure within cementitious nanopores. These findings deepen the fundamental understanding of nanoscale transport phenomena and suggest that tailoring the nanochannel structure and interfacial chemistry of cementitious gels, such as surface coordination environments, pore size distributions, and adsorption sites, may offer a promising strategy to suppress ionic ingress and enhance the durability of cement-based materials.</description>

      <title>On Boltzmann Averaging in Ab Initio Thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ab initio thermodynamics is a widespread, computationally efficient approach to predict the stable configuration of a surface in contact with a surrounding (gas or liquid) environment. In a prevalent realization of this approach, this stable configuration is simply equated with the structure in a considered candidate pool that exhibits the lowest surface free energy. Here we discuss the possibility to consider the thermal accessibility of competing, higher-energy configurations through Boltzmann averaging when the extended surface configurations and their energetics are computed within periodic boundary condition supercells. We show analytically that fully converged averages can be obtained with a candidate pool derived from exhaustive sampling in a surface unit-cell exceeding the system's correlation length. In contrast, averaging over a small pool of ad hoc assembled structures is generally ill-defined. Enumerations of a lattice-gas Hamiltonian model for on-surface oxygen adsorption at Pd(100) are employed to illustrate these considerations in a practical context.</description>

      <title>Towards Large-Scale Condensed Phase Simulations using Machine Learned Energy Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate, yet computationally efficient energy functions are essential for state-of-the art molecular dynamics (MD) studies of condensed phase systems. Here, a generic workflow based on a combination of machine learning-based and empirical representations of intra- and intermolecular interactions is presented. The total energy is decomposed into internal contributions, and electrostatic and van der Waals interactions between monomers. The monomer potential energy surface is described using a neural network, whereas for the electrostatics the flexible minimally distributed charge model is employed. Remaining contributions between reference energies from electronic structure calculations and the model are fitted to standard Lennard-Jones (12-6) terms. For water as a topical example, reference energies for the monomers are determined from CCSD(T)-F12 calculations whereas for an ensemble of cluster structures containing $[2,60]$ and $[2,4]$ monomers DFT and CCSD(T) energies, respectively, were used to best match the van der Waals contributions. Based on the bulk liquid density and heat of vaporization, the best-performing set of LJ(12-6) parameters was selected and a wide range of condensed phase properties were determined and compared with experiment. MD Simulations on the multiple-nanosecond time scale were carried out for water boxes containing 2000 to 8000 monomers, depending on the property considered. The performance of such a generic ML-inspired parametrization scheme is very promising and future improvements and extensions are discussed, also in view of recent advances for water in particular in the literature.</description>

      <title>High-Precision Quantum Dynamics of He$_2$ b $^3\Pi_\mathrm{g}$-c $^3\Sigma_\mathrm{g}^+$ including Non-adiabatic, Relativistic and QED Corrections and Couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relativistic, quantum electrodynamics, as well as non-adiabatic corrections and couplings, are computed for the b $^3\Pi_\mathrm{g}$ and c $^3\Sigma_\mathrm{g}^+$ electronic states of the helium dimer. The underlying Born-Oppenheimer potential energy curves are converged to 1 ppm ($1:10^6$) relative precision using a variational explicitly correlated Gaussian approach. % The quantum nuclear motion is computed over the b $^3\Pi_\mathrm{g}$-c $^3\Sigma_\mathrm{g}^+$ (and B $^1\Pi_\mathrm{g}$-C $^1\Sigma_\mathrm{g}^+$) 9-(12-)dimensional electronic-spin subspace coupled by non-adiabatic and relativistic (magnetic) interactions. The electron's anomalous magnetic moment is also included; its effect is expected to be visible in high-resolution experiments. The computed rovibronic energy intervals are in excellent agreement with available high-resolution spectroscopy data, including the rovibronic b $^3\Pi_\mathrm{g}$-state fine structure. Fine-structure splittings are also predicted for the c $^3\Sigma_\mathrm{g}^+$ levels, which have not been fully resolved experimentally, yet.</description>

      <title>Multi-plateau high-harmonic generation in liquids driven by off-site recombination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-perturbative high-harmonic generation (HHG) has recently been observed in the liquid phase, where it was demonstrated to have a different physical mechanism compared to gas and solid phases of matter. The currently best physical picture for liquid HHG eliminates scattered-electron contributions and identifies on-site recombination as the dominant contributor. This mechanism accurately predicts the cut-off energy and its independence of the driving laser wavelength and intensity. However, this implies that additional energy absorbed in the liquid as the driving laser intensity is increased does not result in higher-order non-linearities, which is in contrast to the conventional expectation from most nonlinear media. Here we experimentally observe the formation of a second plateau in HHG from multiple liquids (water, heavy water, propranol, and ethanol), thus explaining the conundrum of the missing higher-order response. We analyze this second plateau with a combination of experimental, state-of-the-art ab-initio numerical (in diverse systems of water, ammonia, and liquid methane), and semi-classical analytical, techniques, and elucidate its physical origin to electrons that recombine on neighboring water molecules rather than at the ionization site, leading to unique HHG ellipticity dependence. Remarkably, we find that the second plateau is dominated by electrons recombining at the second solvation shell, relying on wide hole delocalization. Theory also predicts the appearance of even higher plateaus, indicating a general trend. Our work establishes new physical phenomena in the highly non-linear optical response of liquids, paving the way to attosecond probing of electron dynamics in solutions.</description>

      <title>Deconstructing the Origins of Interfacial Catalysis: Why Electric Fields are Inseparable from Solvation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the last decade, there has been a surge of experiments showing that certain chemical reactions undergo an enormous boost when taken from bulk aqueous conditions to microdroplet environments. The microscopic basis of this phenomenon remains elusive and continues to be widely debated. One of the key driving forces invoked are the specific properties of the air-water interface including the presence of large electric fields and distinct solvation at the surface. Here, using a combination of classical molecular dynamics simulations, the chemical physics of solvation, and unsupervised learning approaches, we place these assumptions under close scrutiny. Using phenol as a model system, we demonstrate that the electric field at the surface of water is not anomalous or unique compared to bulk water conditions. Furthermore, the electric field fluctuations de-correlate on a timescale of ~10 ps implying that their role in activating much slower chemical reactions remains inconclusive. We deploy a recently developed unsupervised learning approach, dubbed information balance, which detects in an agnostic fashion the relationship between the electric field and solvation collective variables. It turns out that the electric field on the hydroxyl group of the phenol is mostly determined by phenol hydration including the proximity and orientation of nearby water molecules. We caution that the growing attention of the role that electric fields have garnered in enhancing chemical reactivity at the air-water interface, may not reflect their actual importance.</description>

      <title>VALID-Mol: a Systematic Framework for Validated LLM-Assisted Molecular Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable potential for scientific discovery, but their application in domains requiring factual accuracy and domain-specific constraints remains challenging. In molecular design for drug discovery, LLMs can suggest creative molecular modifications but often produce chemically invalid or impractical structures. We present VALID-Mol, a systematic framework for integrating chemical validation with LLM-driven molecular design that increases the rate of generating valid chemical structures from 3% to 83%. Our approach combines methodical prompt engineering, automated chemical validation, and a fine-tuned domain-adapted LLM to ensure reliable generation of synthesizable molecules with improved properties. Beyond the specific implementation, we contribute a generalizable methodology for scientifically-constrained LLM applications, with quantifiable reliability improvements. Computational predictions suggest our framework can generate promising candidates for synthesis with up to 17-fold computationally predicted improvements in target affinity while maintaining synthetic accessibility. We provide a detailed analysis of our prompt engineering process, validation architecture, and fine-tuning approach, offering a reproducible blueprint for applying LLMs to other scientific domains where domain-specific validation is essential.</description>

      <title>Liquid water under vibrational strong coupling: an extended cavity Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02510v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A computational study of liquid water when the system is coupled with a (model) Fabry-Perot cavity is reported. At this end, the Cavity Born-Oppenheimer Molecular Dynamics approach proposed recently (Li et al., Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA, 2020, 117, 18324-18331) is employed and different properties of water under vibrational strong coupling (VSC) are investigated. Different cavity frequencies are considered, corresponding to different modes in the IR spectrum of liquid water: high frequency (corresponding to O-H stretching modes), medium frequency (corresponding to water molecule bending) and low frequencies (corresponding to librational modes). Simulations were done both using classical and quantum nuclear dynamics, this last via Ring Polymer Molecular Dynamics. Similar effects of the cavity are obtained in both cases. Namely, whereas the infrared spectrum is observed to be split for all cavity frequencies, no effects on structural properties are detected. In addition, transport and dynamical properties, including the diffusion coefficient, molecular reorientation and hydrogen bond (HB) jump exchange times, show no effect due to cavity coupling when an extended statistical analysis is performed.</description>

      <title>Computing hydration free energies of small molecules with first principles accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18171v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Free energies play a central role in characterising the behaviour of chemical systems and are among the most important quantities that can be calculated by molecular dynamics simulations. The free energy of hydration in particular is a well-studied physicochemical property of drug-like molecules and is commonly used to assess and optimise the accuracy of nonbonded parameters in empirical forcefields, and as a fast-to-compute surrogate of performance for protein-ligand binding free energy estimation. Machine learned potentials (MLPs) show great promise as more accurate alternatives to empirical forcefields, but are not readily decomposed into physically motivated functional forms, which has thus far rendered them incompatible with standard alchemical free energy methods that manipulate individual pairwise interaction terms. However, since the accuracy of free energy calculations is highly sensitive to the forcefield, this is a key area in which MLPs have the potential to address the shortcomings of empirical forcefields. In this work, we introduce an efficient alchemical free energy method compatible with MLPs, enabling, for the first time, calculations of biomolecular free energy with \textit{ab initio} accuracy. Using a pretrained, transferrable, alchemically equipped MACE model, we demonstrate sub-chemical accuracy for the hydration free energies of organic molecules.</description>

      <title>SmileyLlama: Modifying Large Language Models for Directed Chemical Space Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02231v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Here we show that a general-purpose large language model (LLM) chatbot, Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, can be transformed via supervised fine-tuning of engineered prompts into a chemical language model (CLM), SmileyLlama, for molecule generation. We benchmark SmileyLlama by comparing it to CLMs trained from scratch on large amounts of ChEMBL data for their ability to generate valid and novel drug-like molecules. We also use direct preference optimization to both improve SmileyLlama's adherence to a prompt and to generate molecules within the iMiner reinforcement learning framework to predict new drug molecules with optimized 3D conformations and high binding affinity to drug targets, illustrated with the SARS-Cov-2 Main Protease. This overall framework allows a LLM to speak directly as a CLM which can generate molecules with user-specified properties, rather than acting only as a chatbot with knowledge of chemistry or as a helpful virtual assistant. While our dataset and analyses are geared toward drug discovery, this general procedure can be extended to other chemical applications such as chemical synthesis.</description>

      <title>Approximations of the Iterative Stockholder Analysis scheme using exponential basis functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05079v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce several approximations of the Iterative Stockholder Analysis (ISA) method based on exponential basis functions. These approximations are categorized into linear and non-linear models, referred to as LISA and NLIS, respectively. By particular choices of hyperparameters in the NLIS model, both LISA and the Minimal-Basis Iterative Stockholder (MBIS) method can be reproduced. Four LISA variants are constructed using systematically generated exponential basis functions derived from the NLIS model applied to atomic systems. The performance of these LISA variants and NLIS models is benchmarked on 15 small molecules, including neutral, anionic, and cationic species. To facilitate comparison, we propose several metrics designed to highlight differences between the methods. Our results demonstrate that LISA, employing Gaussian basis functions derived from the NLIS model on isolated atomic systems, achieves an optimal balance of computational accuracy, robustness, and efficiency, particularly in minimizing the objective function.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01020v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, the effect of amino acid environment on the nucleobase-centered anion radical shape resonances is investigated by employing uracil as a model system for pyrimidine base in RNA. Anionic uracil-glycine complexes have been used to model the RNA-protein interactions. The resonance positions and widths of these complexes have been simulated using the equation of motion coupled cluster method coupled with resonance via Pad\'e approach. Our work shows that in the transient negative ion (TNI, or, the anion radical of glycine:uracil complex), glycine stabilizes the nucleobase-centered resonances through hydrogen bonding, increasing the lifetime of TNI. At the same time, a glycine-centered resonance shows the ability of amino acids to capture the electron density and move it away from the uracil nucleobase. At the micro-solvation level, this modeling indicates that amino acids would have more influence on nucleobase-centered resonances in the TNI than that displayed by the corresponding aqueous environment.</description>

      <title>Shifting sands of hardware and software in exascale quantum mechanical simulations</title>

Abstract: The era of exascale computing presents both exciting opportunities and unique challenges for quantum mechanical simulations. Although the transition from petaflops to exascale computing has been marked by a steady increase in computational power, it is accompanied by a shift towards heterogeneous architectures, with graphical processing units (GPUs) in particular gaining a dominant role. The exascale era, therefore, demands a fundamental shift in software development strategies. This Perspective examines the changing landscape of hardware and software for exascale computing, highlighting the limitations of traditional algorithms and software implementations in light of the increasing use of heterogeneous architectures in high-end systems. We discuss the challenges of adapting quantum chemistry software to these new architectures, including the fragmentation of the software stack, the need for more efficient algorithms (including reduced precision versions) tailored for GPUs, and the importance of developing standardized libraries and programming models.</description>

      <title>Graph Fourier Neural ODEs: Modeling Spatial-temporal Multi-scales in Molecular Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01600v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurately predicting long-horizon molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories remains a significant challenge, as existing deep learning methods often struggle to retain fidelity over extended simulations. We hypothesize that one key factor limiting accuracy is the difficulty of capturing interactions that span distinct spatial and temporal scales, ranging from high-frequency local vibrations to low-frequency global conformational changes. To address these limitations, we propose Graph Fourier Neural ODEs (GF-NODE), integrating a graph Fourier transform for spatial frequency decomposition with a Neural ODE framework for continuous-time evolution. Specifically, GF-NODE first decomposes molecular configurations into multiple spatial frequency modes using the graph Laplacian, then evolves the frequency components in time via a learnable Neural ODE module that captures both local and global dynamics, and finally reconstructs the updated molecular geometry through an inverse graph Fourier transform. By explicitly modeling high- and low-frequency phenomena in this unified pipeline, GF-NODE captures long-range correlations and local fluctuations more effectively. We provide theoretical insight through heat equation analysis on a simplified diffusion model, demonstrating how graph Laplacian eigenvalues can determine temporal dynamics scales, and crucially validate this correspondence through comprehensive empirical analysis on real molecular dynamics trajectories showing quantitative spatial-temporal correlations across diverse molecular systems. Experimental results on challenging MD benchmarks demonstrate that GF-NODE achieves state-of-the-art accuracy while preserving essential geometrical features over extended simulations. These findings highlight the promise of bridging spectral decomposition with continuous-time modeling to improve the robustness and predictive power of MD simulations.</description>

      <title>To jump or not to jump: Adhesion and viscous dissipation dictate the detachment of coalescing wall-attached bubbles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05532v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bubble coalescence can promote bubble departure at much smaller sizes compared to buoyancy. This can critically enhance the efficiency of gas-evolving electrochemical processes, such as water electrolysis. In this study, we integrate high-speed imaging experiments and direct numerical simulations to dissect how and under which conditions bubble coalescence on surfaces leads to detachment. Our transparent electrode experiments provide new insights into contact line dynamics, demonstrating that the bubble neck generally does not contact the surface during coalescence. We reveal that whether coalescence leads to bubble departure or not is determined by the balance between surface energy, adhesion forces, and viscous dissipation. For the previously unexplored regime at low effective Ohnesorge number, a measure of viscosity that incorporates the effect of asymmetry between the coalescing bubbles, we identify a critical dimensionless adhesion energy threshold of $\approx$15% of the released surface energy, below which bubbles typically detach. We develop a global energy balance model that successfully predicts coalescence outcomes across diverse experimental conditions.</description>

      <title>Imaging nuclei by smashing them at high energies: how are their shapes revealed after destruction?</title>

Abstract: High-energy nuclear collisions has recently emerged as a powerful ``imaging-by-smashing'' tool to reveal the global shapes of atomic nuclei. Here, I layout a conceptual framework for this technique, explaining how nuclear shapes are encoded during quark-gluon plasma formation and evolution, and how they can be decoded from final-state particle distributions. I highlight the method's potential to advance our understanding of both nuclear structure and quark-gluon plasma physics.</description>

      <title>Computing Anharmonic Infrared Spectra of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons Using Machine-Learning Molecular Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05120v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a machine learning molecular dynamics (MLMD) approach to calculate the anharmonic infrared (IR) absorption spectra of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), key carriers of interstellar aromatic IR bands. This method accounts for temperature effects in a molecule-specific way and achieves accuracy comparable to conventional quantum chemical calculations at a fraction of the cost, scaling linearly with system size. We applied MLMD to calculate the anharmonic spectra of 1,704 PAHs in the NASA Ames PAH IR Spectroscopic Database with up to 216 carbon atoms at different temperatures, demonstrating its capability for high-throughput spectral calculations of large molecular systems.</description>

      <title>Role of defects in atom probe analysis of sol-gel silica</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06138v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Silicon dioxide is a suitable material to encapsulate proteins at room temperature so that they can be analysed at the atomic level using laser-assisted atom probe tomography (La-APT). To achieve this goal, in this study we show that UV and deep UV lasers can achieve a high success rate in La-APT of silica in terms of chemical resolution and three-dimensional image volume, with both lasers providing comparable results. Since the La-APT analyses are driven by photon absorption, in order to understand the mechanisms behind the enhanced absorption of UV light, we performed density functional theory calculations to model the electronic and optical properties of amorphous silica matrices generated using a Monte Carlo approach to structural optimisation. In particular, we have investigated the role of various defects introduced during sample preparation, such as substitutional and interstitial carbon, sodium and gallium ions, and hydrogen. Our results show that the presence of defects increases the absorption of silica in the UV and deep-UV range and thus improves the La-APT capabilities of the material. However, due to the low density of free charge carriers resulting from the absorption of laser energy by defects, deviations from the nominal chemical composition and suboptimal chemical resolution may occur, potentially limiting the optimal acquisition of APT mass spectra.</description>
