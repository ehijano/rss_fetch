      <title>Minimizing finite viscosity enhances relative kinetic energy absorption in bistable mechanical metamaterials but only with sufficiently fine discretization: a nonlinear dynamical size effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bistable mechanical metamaterials have shown promise for mitigating the harmful consequences of impact by converting kinetic energy into stored strain energy, offering an alternative and potentially synergistic approach to conventional methods of attenuating energy transmission. In this work, we numerically study the dynamic response of a one-dimensional bistable metamaterial struck by a high speed impactor (where the impactor velocity is commensurate with the sound speed), using the peak kinetic energy experienced at midpoint of the metamaterial compared to that in an otherwise identical linear system as our performance metric. We make five key findings: 1) The bistable material can counter-intuitively perform better (to nearly 1000x better than the linear system) as the viscosity decreases (but remains finite), but only when sufficiently fine discretization has been reached (i.e. the system approaches sufficiently close to the continuum limit); 2) This discretization threshold is sharp, and depends on the viscosity present; 3) The bistable materials can also perform significantly worse than linear systems (for low discretization and viscosity or zero viscosity); 4) The dependence on discretization stems from the partition of energy into trains of solitary waves that have pulse lengths proportional to the unit cell size, where, with intersite viscosity, the solitary wave trains induce high velocity gradients and thus enhanced damping compared to linear, and low-unit-cell-number bistable, materials; and 5) When sufficiently fine discretization has been reached at low viscosities, the bistable system outperforms the linear one for a wide range of impactor conditions. The first point is particularly important, as it shows the existence of a nonlinear dynamical size effect, where, given a protective layer of some thickness...</description>

      <title>Multi-soliton solutions for equivariant wave maps on a $2+1$ dimensional wormhole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study equivariant wave maps from the $2+1$ dimensional wormhole to the 2-sphere. This model has explicit harmonic map solutions which, in suitable coordinates, have the form of the sine-Gordon kinks/anti-kinks. We conjecture that there exist asymptotically static chains of $N\geq 2$ alternating kinks and anti-kinks whose subsequent rates of expansion increase in geometric progression as $t\rightarrow \infty$. Our argument employs the method of collective coordinates to derive effective finite-dimensional ODE models for the asymptotic dynamics of $N$-chains. For $N=2,3$ the predictions of these effective models are verified by direct PDE computations which demonstrate that the $N$-chains lie at the threshold of kink-anti-kink annihilation.</description>

      <title>Pattern formation and spatiotemporal chaos in relativistic degenerate plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We numerically study the nonlinear interactions of high-frequency circularly polarized electromagnetic (EM) waves and low-frequency electron-acoustic (EA) density perturbations driven by the EM wave ponderomotive force in relativistic plasmas with two groups of electrons--the population of relativistic degenerate dense electrons (bulk plasma) and the sparse relativistic nondegenerate (classical) electrons, and immobile singly charged positive ions. By pattern selection, we show that many solitary patterns can be generated and drenched through modulational instability of EM waves at different spatial length scales and that the EM wave radiation spectra emanating from compact astrophysical objects may not settle into stable envelope solitons but into different incoherent states, including the emergence of temporal and spatiotemporal chaos due to collisions and fusions among the patterns with strong EA wave emission. The appearance of these states is confirmed by analyzing the Lyapunov exponent spectra, correlation function, and mutual information. As a result, the redistribution of wave energy from initially excited many solitary patterns at large scales to a few new incoherent patterns with small wavelengths in the system occurs, leading to the onset of turbulence in astrophysical plasmas.</description>

      <title>Homoclinic snaking of contact defects in reaction-diffusion equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We apply spatial dynamical-systems techniques to prove that certain spatiotemporal patterns in reversible reaction-diffusion equations undergo snaking bifurcations. That is, in a narrow region of parameter space, countably many branches of patterned states coexist that connect at towers of saddle-node bifurcations. Our patterns of interest are contact defects, which are 1-dimensional time-periodic patterns with a spatially oscillating core region that at large distances from the origin in space resemble pure temporally oscillatory states and arise as natural analogues of spiral and target waves in one spatial dimension. We show that these solutions lie on snaking branches that have a more complex structure than has been seen in other contexts. In particular, we predict the existence of families of asymmetric travelling defect solutions with arbitrary background phase offsets, in addition to symmetric standing target and spiral patterns. We prove the presence of these additional patterns by reconciling results in classic ODE studies with results from the spatial-dynamics study of patterns in PDEs and using geometrical information contained in the stable and unstable manifolds of the background wavetrains and their natural equivariance structure.</description>

      <title>Fast-moving pattern interfaces close to a Turing instability in an asymptotic model for the three-dimensional B\'enard-Marangoni problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the bifurcation of planar patterns and fast-moving pattern interfaces in an asymptotic long-wave model for the three-dimensional B\'enard-Marangoni problem, which is close to a Turing instability. We derive the model from the full free-boundary B\'enard-Marangoni problem for a thin liquid film on a heated substrate of low thermal conductivity via a lubrication approximation. This yields a quasilinear, fully coupled, mixed-order degenerate-parabolic system for the film height and temperature. As the Marangoni number $M$ increases beyond a critical value $M^*$, the pure conduction state destabilises via a Turing(-Hopf) instability. Close to this critical value, we formally derive a system of amplitude equations which govern the slow modulation dynamics of square or hexagonal patterns. Using center manifold theory, we then study the bifurcation of square and hexagonal planar patterns. Finally, we construct planar fast-moving modulating travelling front solutions that model the transition between two planar patterns. The proof uses a spatial dynamics formulation and a center manifold reduction to a finite-dimensional invariant manifold, where modulating fronts appear as heteroclinic orbits. These modulating fronts facilitate a possible mechanism for pattern formation, as previously observed in experiments.</description>
