      <title>CHEmical-shift selective Adiabatic Pulse (CHEAP): Fast and High Resolution Downfield 3D 1H-MRSI at 7T</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The key molecules such as triphosphate (ATP), glutathione (GSH), and homocarnosine (hCs) - central to metabolic processes in the human brain remain elusive or challenging to detect with upfield 1H-MRSI. Traditional 3D 1H-MRSI in vivo faces challenges, including a low signal-to-noise ratio and magnetization transfer effects with water, leading to prolonged measurement times and reduced resolution. To address these limitations, we propose a downfield 3D-MRSI method aimed at measuring downfield metabolites with enhanced spatial resolution, and speed acceptable for clinical practice at 7T. The CHEmical-shift selective Adiabatic Pulse (CHEAP) technique was integrated into echo-planar spectroscopic imaging (EPSI) readout sequence for downfield metabolite and water reference 3D-MRSI. Five healthy subjects and two glioma patients were scanned to test the feasibility. In this work, CHEAP-EPSI technique is shown to significantly enhance spatial the resolution to 0.37 ml while simultaneously reducing the scan time to 10.5 minutes. Its distinct advantages include low specific absorption rate, effective suppression of water and lipid signals, and minimal baseline distortions, making it a valuable tool for research or potentially diagnostic purposes. CHEAP-EPSI improves the detection sensitivity of downfield metabolites like N-acetyl-aspartate (NAA+) and DF8.18 (ATP&amp;GSH+), and offers new possibilities for the study of metabolism in healthy and diseased brain.</description>

      <title>Female and Combined Male-Female Injury Risk Functions for the Anterior Pelvis Under Frontal Lap Belt Loading Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Purpose: Iliac wing fractures due to lap belt loading have been observed in laboratory settings for 50 years and recent data suggest they are also occurring in the field. Automated driving systems (ADS) and other occupant compartment advancements are expected to offer enhanced flexibility in seating orientation, which could place a greater reliance on the seatbelt to restrain occupants. Such changes may increase seatbelt loads and create new challenges in successfully restraining occupants and mitigating injury to areas such as the pelvis. Injury criteria exist for component-level male iliac wing fractures resulting from frontal lap belt loading, but not for females. Methods: This study explored female iliac wing fracture tolerance in the same loading environment as a previous study that explored the fracture tolerance of isolated male iliac wings. Male and female fracture data were combined to evaluate the effect of sex. Injury risk functions were created by fitting Weibull survival models to data that integrated censored and exact failure observations. Results: Twenty female iliac wings were tested; fourteen of them sustained fracture with known failure forces (exact), but the remaining six wings either (1) did not fracture, or (2) fractured after an event that changed the boundary conditions (right censored). The fracture tolerance of the tested specimens ranged widely (1134 - 8759 N) and averaged 4240 N (SD 2516 N). Conclusion: Female data and combined male-female data were analyzed. Age was the only covariate investigated in this study that had a statistically significant effect and improved the predictive performance of the models.</description>

      <title>Discrimination loss vs. SRT: A model-based approach towards harmonizing speech test interpretations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Objective: Speech tests aim to estimate discrimination loss or speech recognition threshold (SRT). This paper investigates the potential to estimate SRTs from clinical data that target at characterizing the discrimination loss. Knowledge about the relationship between the speech test outcome variables--conceptually linked via the psychometric function--is important towards integration of data from different databases.
  Design: Depending on the available data, different SRT estimation procedures were compared and evaluated. A novel, model-based SRT estimation procedure was proposed that deals with incomplete patient data. Interpretations of supra-threshold deficits were assessed for the two interpretation modes.
  Study sample: Data for 27009 patients with Freiburg monosyllabic speech test (FMST) and audiogram (AG) results from the same day were included in the retrospective analysis.
  Results: The model-based SRT estimation procedure provided accurate SRTs, but with large deviations in the estimated slope. Supra-threshold hearing loss components differed between the two interpretation modes.
  Conclusions: The model-based procedure can be used for SRT estimation, and its properties relate to data availability for individual patients. All SRT procedures are influenced by the uncertainty of the word recognition scores. In the future, the proposed approach can be used to assess additional differences between speech tests.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of radiomic feature harmonization techniques for benign and malignant pulmonary nodules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16758v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Radiomics provides quantitative features of pulmonary nodules (PNs) which could aid lung cancer diagnosis, but medical image acquisition variability is an obstacle to clinical application. Acquisition effects may differ between radiomic features from benign vs. malignant PNs. PURPOSE: We evaluated how to account for differences between benign and malignant PNs when correcting radiomic features' acquisition dependency. METHODS: We used 567 chest CT scans grouped as benign, malignant, or lung cancer screening (mixed benign, malignant). ComBat harmonization was applied to extracted features for variation in 4 acquisition parameters. We compared: harmonizing without distinction, harmonizing with a covariate to preserve distinctions between subgroups, and harmonizing subgroups separately. Significant ($p\le0.05$) Kruskal-Wallis tests showed whether harmonization removed acquisition dependency. A LASSO-SVM pipeline was trained on successfully harmonized features to predict malignancy. To evaluate predictive information in these features, the trained harmonization estimators and predictive model were applied to unseen test sets. Harmonization and predictive performance were assessed for 10 trials of 5-fold cross-validation. RESULTS: An average 2.1% of features (95% CI:1.9-2.4%) were acquisition-independent when harmonized without distinction, 27.3% (95% CI:25.7-28.9%) when harmonized with a covariate, and 90.9% (95% CI:90.4-91.5%) when harmonized separately. Data harmonized separately or with a covariate trained models with higher ROC-AUC for screening scans than data harmonized without distinction between benign and malignant PNs (Delong test, adjusted $p\le0.05$). CONCLUSIONS: Radiomic features of benign and malignant PNs need different corrective transformations to recover acquisition-independent distributions. This can be done by harmonizing separately or with a covariate.</description>
