      <title>Achievement of 1 MA Discharges in Hydrogen-Boron Plasmas on EXL-50U</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One mega ampere (MA) plasma discharges were achieved on the EXL-50U spherical torus (ST) in hydrogen-boron (p-B) plasmas with toroidal fields up to 1 T at major radii up to 0.6m. A key innovation in these experiments was the use of a boron-rich fueling strategy, incorporating a high-concentration boron-containing gas mixture and real-time boron powder injection during the discharges. The boron content in the fueling reached 10%, representing the first publicly reported MA-class hydrogen-boron plasma with such a high boron concentration. Non-inductive plasma startup was achieved using electron cyclotron resonance heating (ECRH), and a rapid current ramp-up to 1 MA was realized through the synergistic use of ECRH and the central solenoid (CS). With 800 kW of ECRH power, core electron temperatures of up to 3 keV were attained. These results demonstrate the feasibility of producing high-performance hydrogen-boron plasmas in a spherical torus configuration and offer important physics and engineering insights for future reactor-scale applications - particularly in the areas of low loop voltage current start-up and real-time boronization techniques.</description>

      <title>Role of ion acoustic instability in magnetic reconnection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on a first-principles numerical study of magnetic reconnection in plasmas with different initial ion-to-electron temperature ratios. In cases where this ratio is significantly below unity, we observe intense wave activity in the diffusion region, driven by the ion-acoustic instability. Our analysis shows that the dominant macroscopic effect of this instability is to drive substantial ion heating. In contrast to earlier studies reporting significant anomalous resistivity, we find that anomalous contributions due to the ion-acoustic instability are minimal. These results shed light on the dynamical impact of this instability on reconnection processes, offering new insights into the fundamental physics governing collisionless reconnection.</description>

      <title>Turbulent Transport-Limited Pedestals in Tokamaks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: H-mode operation of tokamak fusion plasmas free of dangerous Type 1 edge-localized-modes (ELMs) requires a non-ELM mechanism for saturating the edge pedestal growth. One possible mechanism is turbulent transport. We introduce a transport threshold model to find pedestal width-height scalings for turbulent transport-limited pedestals. The model is applied to electron heat transport resulting from electron-temperature-gradient (ETG) turbulence. The width-height scalings are highly sensitive to the relative contribution of density and temperature to the pedestal pressure. Pressure that builds up mainly through temperature is more likely to be transport-limited, and hence ELM-free. A relative radial inward shift of the temperature to density pedestal location is also more likely to transport-limit the pedestal. A second constraint such as flow shear is required to saturate pedestal growth. We also calculate width-height transport scalings resulting from particle and heat transport arising from ETG and kinetic-ballooning-mode turbulence. Comparisons are performed for ELMy and ELM-free experiments in MAST-U, NSTX, and DIII-D. This is a first step towards a pedestal width-height scaling for transport-limited ELM-free pedestals.</description>

      <title>Petahertz-bandwidth spectral combs from the amplified spontaneous emission of a collisional plasma-based x-ray laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The possibility of generating spectral combs of petahertz bandwidth is demonstrated from amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) of a collisional plasma-based x-ray laser when its active medium is irradiated with a linearly polarized near-infrared (IR) laser field. It is shown that at a sufficiently high IR-field intensity these combs correspond to a sequence of subfemtosecond beats of extreme ultraviolet (XUV) radiation of a deterministic shape. At the same time, at a lower IR-field intensity ASE remains quasimonochromatic, but its frequency shifts as a result of the IR-induced quadratic Stark effect. In this case, the frequency tuning range of XUV radiation is approximately twice the frequency of the modulating IR field. In addition, modulation by the IR field leads to amplitude and frequency discrimination of the polarization components of ASE, parallel and orthogonal to the IR field. The possibility of observing these effects is analyzed for a collisional plasma x-ray laser based on neon-like Ti12+ ions with an unperturbed ASE wavelength of 32.6 nm and a modulating field with a wavelength of 1 {\mu}m and an intensity in the range of 10^16 - 10^17 W/cm^2.</description>

      <title>Uncovering the Varieties of Three-dimensional Hall-MHD Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We carry out extensive pseudospectral direct numerical simulations (DNSs) of decaying three-dimensional (3D) Hall magnetohydrodynamics (3D HMHD) plasma turbulence at three magnetic Prandtl numbers $Pr_{m}=0.1$, $1.0$ and $10.0$. Our DNSs have been designed to uncover the dependence of the statistical properties of 3D HMHD turbulence on $Pr_m$ and to bring out the subtle interplay between three lengths, the kinetic and magnetic dissipation length scales $\eta_u$, and $\eta_b$ and the ion-inertial scale $d_i$, below which we see the manifestations of the Hall term. This interplay, qualitatively apparent from isosurface plots of the moduli of the vorticity and the current density, is exposed clearly by the kinetic-energy and magnetic-energy spectra, $E_u(k)$ and $E_b(k)$, respectively. We find two different inertial regions, In the first inertial region $k&lt;k_{i}\sim1/d_i$, both the kinetic-energy and magnetic-energy spectra, $E_u(k)$ and $E_b(k)$, respectively, display power-law regions with an exponent that is consistent with Kolmogorov-type $-5/3$ scaling, at all values of $Pr_m$. In the second inertial region $k &gt; k_{i}$, the scaling of $E_b(k)$ depends upon $Pr_M$: At $Pr_{m}=0.1$, the spectral-scaling exponent is $-17/3$, but for $Pr_{m}=1$ and $10$ this exponent is $-11/3$. We then show theoretically that
  $E_u(k) \sim k^2 E_b(k)$ for $Pr_m \ll 1$ and $E_b(k) \sim k^2 E_u(k)$ for $Pr_m \gg 1$; our DNS results are consistent with our theoretical predictions. We examine, furthermore, left- and right-polarised fluctuations of the fields that lead, respectively, to the dominance of ion-cyclotron or whistler waves.</description>

      <title>High-Performance Computational Magnetohydrodynamics with Python</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20899v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the AGATE simulation code, a Python-based framework developed primarily for solving the magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) equations while maintaining adaptability to other equation sets. The code employs a modular, object-oriented architecture that separates interface specifications from numerical implementations, allowing users to customize numerical methods and physics models. Built on a Godunov-type finite-volume scheme, AGATE currently supports the ideal, Hall, and Chew-Goldberger-Low (CGL) MHD equations, with multiple acceleration options ranging from Numpy to GPU-enabled computation via NVIDIA CUDA. Performance testing demonstrates that our GPU implementations achieve 40-60x speedups over CPU versions. Comprehensive validation through established benchmarks confirms accurate reproduction of both linear and nonlinear phenomena across different MHD regimes. This combination of modularity, performance, and extensibility makes AGATE suitable for multiple applications: from rapid prototyping to production simulations, and from numerical algorithm development to physics education.</description>

      <title>Theory of the kinetic helicity effect on turbulent diffusion of magnetic and scalar fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13807v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kinetic helicity is a fundamental characteristics of astrophysical turbulent flows. It is not only responsible for the generation of large-scale magnetic fields in the Sun, stars, and spiral galaxies, but it also affects turbulent diffusion resulting in the dissipation of large-scale magnetic fields. Using the path integral approach for random helical velocity fields with a finite correlation time and large Reynolds numbers, we show that turbulent magnetic diffusion is reduced by the kinetic helicity, while the turbulent diffusivity of a passive scalar is enhanced by the helicity. The latter can explain the results of recent numerical simulations for forced helical turbulence. One of the crucial reasons for the difference between the kinetic helicity effect on magnetic and scalar fields is related to the helicity dependence of the correlation time of a turbulent velocity field.</description>

      <title>Nystr\"om Type Exponential Integrators for Strongly Magnetized Charged Particle Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00288v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Calculating the dynamics of charged particles in electromagnetic fields (i.e. the particle pushing problem) is one of the most computationally intensive components of particle-in-cell (PIC) methods for plasma physics simulations. This task is especially challenging when the plasma is strongly magnetized, since in this case the particle motion consists of a wide range of temporal scales from highly oscillatory fast gyromotion to slow macroscopic behavior and the resulting numerical model is very stiff. Current state-of-the-art time integrators used to simulate particle motion have limitations given the severe numerical stiffness of the problem and more efficient methods are of interest. Recently, exponential integrators have been proposed as a promising new approach for these simulations and shown to offer computational advantages over commonly used schemes. Exponential methods can solve linear problems exactly and are $A$-stable. In this paper, the standard exponential algorithms framework is extended to derive Nystr\"om-type exponential methods that integrate the Newtonian equations of motion as a second-order differential equation. Specific Nystr\"om-type schemes of second and third orders are derived and applied to strongly magnetized particle pushing problems. Numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate that the Nystr\"om-type exponential integrators can provide significant improvement in computational efficiency over the standard exponential methods.</description>
