      <title>Extracting average properties of disordered spin chains with translationally invariant tensor networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a tensor network-based method for calculating disorder-averaged expectation values in random spin chains without having to explicitly sample over disorder configurations. The algorithm exploits statistical translation invariance and works directly in the thermodynamic limit. We benchmark our method on the infinite-randomness critical point of the random transverse field Ising model.</description>

      <title>Quantum Annealing Algorithms for Estimating Ising Partition Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Estimating partition functions of Ising spin glasses is crucial in statistical physics, optimization, and machine learning, yet remains classically intractable due to its #P-hard complexity. While Jarzynski's equality offers a theoretical approach, it becomes unreliable at low temperatures due to rare divergent statistical fluctuations. Here, we present a protocol that overcomes this limitation by synergizing reverse quantum annealing with tailored nonequilibrium initial distributions. Our method can dramatically suppress the estimator variance, achieving saturation in the low-temperature regime. Numerical benchmarks on the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick spin glass and the 3-SAT problem demonstrate that our protocol reduces scaling exponents by over an order of magnitude (e.g., from ~8.5 to ~0.5), despite retaining exponential system-size dependences. Crucially, our protocol circumvents stringent adiabatic constraints, making it feasible for near-term quantum devices like superconducting qubits, trapped ions, and Rydberg atom arrays. This work bridges quantum dynamics with computational complexity, offering a practical pathway to quantum advantage in spin glass thermodynamics and beyond.</description>

      <title>The fundamental localization phases in quasiperiodic systems: A unified framework and exact results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24380v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The disordered quantum systems host three types of quantum states, the extended, localized, and critical, which bring up various distinct fundamental phases, including the pure phases and coexisting ones with mobility edges. The quantum phases involving critical states are of particular importance, but are less understood compared with the other ones, and the different phases have been separately studied in different quasiperiodic models. Here we propose a unified framework based on a spinful quasiperiodic system which unifies the realizations of all the fundamental Anderson phases, with the exact and universal results being obtained for these distinct phases. Through the duality transformation and renormalization group method, we show that the pure phases are obtained when the chiral symmetry preserves in the proposed spin-1/2 quasiperiodic model, which provides a criterion for the emergence of the pure phases or the coexisting ones with mobility edges. Further, we uncover a new universal mechanism for the critical states that the emergence of such states is protected by the generalized incommensurate matrix element zeros in the spinful quasiperiodic model, as a nontrivial generalization of the mechanism in the spinless systems. We also show with the Avila's global theory the criteria of exact solvability for the present unified quasiperiodic system, with which we identify several new quasiperiodic models hosting exactly solvable Anderson phases. We particularly reach two novel models, with one hosting all basic types of mobility edges and the other hosting all the seven fundamental phases of Anderson localization. Finally, an experimental scheme is proposed to realize these models using quasiperiodic optical Raman lattices.</description>
