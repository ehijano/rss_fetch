      <title>The Identity Problem in virtually solvable matrix groups over algebraic numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Tits alternative states that a finitely generated matrix group either contains a nonabelian free subgroup $F_2$, or it is virtually solvable. This paper considers two decision problems in virtually solvable matrix groups: the Identity Problem (does a given finitely generated subsemigroup contain the identity matrix?), and the Group Problem (is a given finitely generated subsemigroup a group?). We show that both problems are decidable in virtually solvable matrix groups over the field of algebraic numbers $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$. Our proof also extends the decidability result for nilpotent groups by Bodart, Ciobanu, Metcalfe and Shaffrir, and the decidability result for metabelian groups by Dong (STOC'24). Since the Identity Problem and the Group Problem are known to be undecidable in matrix groups containing $F_2 \times F_2$, our result significantly reduces the decidability gap for both decision problems.</description>

      <title>Embedding relatively hyperbolic groups into products of binary trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that if a group $G$ is relatively hyperbolic with respect to virtually abelian peripheral subgroups then $G$ quasiisometrically embeds into a product of binary trees. This extends the result of Buyalo, Dranishnikov and Schroeder in which they prove that a hyperbolic group quasiisometrically embeds into a product of binary trees. To prove the main result, we use the machinery of projection complexes and quasi-trees of metric spaces developed by Bestvina, Bromberg, Fujiwara and Sisto. We build on this theory by proving that one can remove certain edges from the quasi-tree of metric spaces, and be left with a tree of metric spaces which is quasiisometric to the quasi-tree of metric spaces. In particular, this reproves a result of Hume. Further, inspired by Buyalo, Dranishnikov and Schroeder's Alice's Diary, we develop a general theory of diaries and linear statistics. These notions provide a framework by which one can take a quasiisometric embedding of a metric space into a product of infinite-valence trees and upgrade it to a quasiisometric embedding into a product of binary trees.</description>

      <title>A Classification of the flag-transitive $2$-$(v,k,2)$ designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide a complete classification of $2$-$(v,k,2)$ design admitting a flag-transitive automorphism group of affine type with the only exception of the semilinear $1$-dimensional group. Alongside this analysis we provide a construction of seven new families of such flag-transitive $2$-designs, two of them infinite, and some of them involve remarkable objects such as $t$-spreads, translation planes, quadrics and Segre varieties.
  Our result together with those Alavi et al. [1,2], Praeger et al. [15], Zhou and the first author [37,38] provides a complete classification of $2$-$(v,k,2)$ design admitting a flag-transitive automorphism group with the only exception of the semilinear $1$-dimensional case.</description>

      <title>On the space of subgroups of Baumslag-Solitar groups I: perfect kernel and phenotype</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.14990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.14990v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a Baumslag-Solitar group, we study its space of subgroups from a topological and dynamical perspective. We first determine its perfect kernel (the largest closed subset without isolated points). We then bring to light a natural partition of the space of subgroups into one closed subset and countably many open subsets that are invariant under the action by conjugation. One of our main results is that the restriction of the action to each piece is topologically transitive. This partition is described by an arithmetically defined function, that we call the phenotype, with values in the positive integers or infinity. We eventually study the closure of each open piece and also the closure of their union. We moreover identify in each phenotype a (the) maximal compact invariant subspace.</description>

      <title>Waring Problem For Triangular Matrix Algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09598v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Matrix Waring problem is if we can write every matrix as a sum of $k$-th powers. Here, we look at the same problem for triangular matrix algebra $T_n(\mathbb{F}_q)$ consisting of upper triangular matrices over a finite field. We prove that for all integers $k, n \geq 1$, there exists a constant $\mathcal C(k, n)$, such that for all $q&gt; \mathcal C(k,n)$, every matrix in $T_n(\mathbb{F}_q)$ is a sum of three $k$-th powers. Moreover, if $-1$ is $k$-th power in $\mathbb{F}_q$, then for all $q&gt;\mathcal C(k,n)$, every matrix in $T_n(\mathbb{F}_q)$ is a sum of two $k$-th powers. We make use of Lang-Weil estimates about the number of solutions of equations over finite fields to achieve the desired results.</description>

      <title>An algebraic criterion for the vanishing of bounded cohomology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16259v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove the vanishing of bounded cohomology with separable dual coefficients for many groups of interest in geometry, dynamics, and algebra. These include compactly supported structure-preserving diffeomorphism groups of certain manifolds; the group of interval exchange transformations of the half line; piecewise linear and piecewise projective groups of the line, giving strong answers to questions of Calegari and Navas; direct limit linear groups of relevance in algebraic K-theory, thereby answering a question by Kastenholz and Sroka and a question of two of the authors and L\"oh; and certain subgroups of big mapping class groups, such as the stable braid group and the stable mapping class group, proving a conjecture of Bowden. Moreover, we prove that in the recently introduced framework of enumerated groups, the generic group has vanishing bounded cohomology with separable dual coefficients. At the heart of our approach is an elementary algebraic criterion called the commuting cyclic conjugates condition that is readily verifiable for the aforementioned large classes of groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.05933v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We improve some foundational connectivity results and the relative Hurewicz theorem in motivic homotopy theory, study functorial central series in motivic local group theory, establish the existence of functorial Moore--Postnikov factorizations for nilpotent morphisms of motivic spaces under a mild technical hypothesis and establish an analog of the Whitehead theorem for nilpotent motivic spaces. As an application, we deduce a surprising unstable motivic periodicity result.</description>
