      <title>Trust in LLM-controlled Robotics: a Survey of Security Threats, Defenses and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into robotics has revolutionized their ability to interpret complex human commands and execute sophisticated tasks. However, such paradigm shift introduces critical security vulnerabilities stemming from the ''embodiment gap'', a discord between the LLM's abstract reasoning and the physical, context-dependent nature of robotics. While security for text-based LLMs is an active area of research, existing solutions are often insufficient to address the unique threats for the embodied robotic agents, where malicious outputs manifest not merely as harmful text but as dangerous physical actions. In this work, we present a systematic survey, summarizing the emerging threat landscape and corresponding defense strategies for LLM-controlled robotics. Specifically, we discuss a comprehensive taxonomy of attack vectors, covering topics such as jailbreaking, backdoor attacks, and multi-modal prompt injection. In response, we analyze and categorize a range of defense mechanisms, from formal safety specifications and runtime enforcement to multi-LLM oversight and prompt hardening. Furthermore, we review key datasets and benchmarks used to evaluate the robustness of these embodied systems. By synthesizing current research, this work highlights the urgent need for context-aware security solutions and provides a foundational roadmap for the development of safe, secure, and reliable LLM-controlled robotics.</description>

      <title>Modeling the Mental World for Embodied AI: A Comprehensive Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the application of Embodied AI Agents in avatars, wearable devices, and robotic systems continues to deepen, their core research challenges have gradually shifted from physical environment interaction to the accurate understanding of social interactions. Traditional physical world models (PWM) focus on quantifiable physical attributes such as space and motion, failing to meet the needs of social intelligence modeling. In contrast, the Mental World Model (MWM), as a structured representation of humans' internal mental states, has become the critical cognitive foundation for embodied agents to achieve natural human-machine collaboration and dynamic social adaptation. However, current MWM research faces significant bottlenecks: such as fragmented conceptual framework with vague boundaries between MWM and PWM, disjointed reasoning mechanisms for the technical pathways and applicable scenarios of different Theory of Mind (ToM) reasoning paradigms, and detachment between evaluation and practice.
  To address these issues, this review systematically synthesizes over 100 authoritative studies to provide a comprehensive overview of MWM research for embodied AI. Its core contributions are threefold: First, it constructs a complete theoretical framework for MWM for the first time. Specifically, it distinguishes the essential differences between MWM and PWMs. Second, it systematically defines the key components of MWM through two paradigms for mental element representation. Third, it comprehensively analyzes two core ToM reasoning paradigms with 19 ToM methods. Finally, it also clarifies the integration trend of neuro-symbolic hybrid architectures, and synthesizes 26 ToM evaluation benchmarks. This work aims to promote the integration of embodied agents into human society and advance the in-depth development of human-machine collaborative interaction.</description>

      <title>Movement Primitives in Robotics: A Comprehensive Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biological systems exhibit a continuous stream of movements, consisting of sequential segments, that allow them to perform complex tasks in a creative and versatile fashion. This observation has led researchers towards identifying elementary building blocks of motion known as movement primitives, which are well-suited for generating motor commands in autonomous systems, such as robots. In this survey, we provide an encyclopedic overview of movement primitive approaches and applications in chronological order. Concretely, we present movement primitive frameworks as a way of representing robotic control trajectories acquired through human demonstrations. Within the area of robotics, movement primitives can encode basic motions at the trajectory level, such as how a robot would grasp a cup or the sequence of motions necessary to toss a ball. Furthermore, movement primitives have been developed with the desirable analytical properties of a spring-damper system, probabilistic coupling of multiple demonstrations, using neural networks in high-dimensional systems, and more, to address difficult challenges in robotics. Although movement primitives have widespread application to a variety of fields, the goal of this survey is to inform practitioners on the use of these frameworks in the context of robotics. Specifically, we aim to (i) present a systematic review of major movement primitive frameworks and examine their strengths and weaknesses; (ii) highlight applications that have successfully made use of movement primitives; and (iii) examine open questions and discuss practical challenges when applying movement primitives in robotics.</description>

      <title>InternVLA-A1: Unifying Understanding, Generation and Action for Robotic Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prevalent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are typically built upon Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and demonstrate exceptional proficiency in semantic understanding, but they inherently lack the capability to deduce physical world dynamics. Consequently, recent approaches have shifted toward World Models, typically formulated via video prediction; however, these methods often suffer from a lack of semantic grounding and exhibit brittleness when handling prediction errors. To synergize semantic understanding with dynamic predictive capabilities, we present InternVLA-A1. This model employs a unified Mixture-of-Transformers architecture, coordinating three experts for scene understanding, visual foresight generation, and action execution. These components interact seamlessly through a unified masked self-attention mechanism. Building upon InternVL3 and Qwen3-VL, we instantiate InternVLA-A1 at 2B and 3B parameter scales. We pre-train these models on hybrid synthetic-real datasets spanning InternData-A1 and Agibot-World, covering over 533M frames. This hybrid training strategy effectively harnesses the diversity of synthetic simulation data while minimizing the sim-to-real gap. We evaluated InternVLA-A1 across 12 real-world robotic tasks and simulation benchmark. It significantly outperforms leading models like pi0 and GR00T N1.5, achieving a 14.5\% improvement in daily tasks and a 40\%-73.3\% boost in dynamic settings, such as conveyor belt sorting.</description>

      <title>Learning and Optimizing the Efficacy of Spatio-Temporal Task Allocation under Temporal and Resource Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex multi-robot missions often require heterogeneous teams to jointly optimize task allocation, scheduling, and path planning to improve team performance under strict constraints. We formalize these complexities into a new class of problems, dubbed Spatio-Temporal Efficacy-optimized Allocation for Multi-robot systems (STEAM). STEAM builds upon trait-based frameworks that model robots using their capabilities (e.g., payload and speed), but goes beyond the typical binary success-failure model by explicitly modeling the efficacy of allocations as trait-efficacy maps. These maps encode how the aggregated capabilities assigned to a task determine performance. Further, STEAM accommodates spatio-temporal constraints, including a user-specified time budget (i.e., maximum makespan). To solve STEAM problems, we contribute a novel algorithm named Efficacy-optimized Incremental Task Allocation Graph Search (E-ITAGS) that simultaneously optimizes task performance and respects time budgets by interleaving task allocation, scheduling, and path planning. Motivated by the fact that trait-efficacy maps are difficult, if not impossible, to specify, E-ITAGS efficiently learns them using a realizability-aware active learning module. Our approach is realizability-aware since it explicitly accounts for the fact that not all combinations of traits are realizable by the robots available during learning. Further, we derive experimentally-validated bounds on E-ITAGS' suboptimality with respect to efficacy. Detailed numerical simulations and experiments using an emergency response domain demonstrate that E-ITAGS generates allocations of higher efficacy compared to baselines, while respecting resource and spatio-temporal constraints. We also show that our active learning approach is sample efficient and establishes a principled tradeoff between data and computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Making Infeasible Tasks Feasible: Planning to Reconfigure Disconnected 3D Environments with Movable Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several planners have been developed to compute dynamically feasible, collision-free robot paths from an initial to a goal configuration. A key assumption in these works is that the goal region is reachable; an assumption that often fails in practice when environments are disconnected. Motivated by this limitation, we consider known 3D environments comprising objects, also called blocks, that form distinct navigable support surfaces (planes), and that are either non-movable (e.g., tables) or movable (e.g., boxes). These surfaces may be mutually disconnected due to height differences, holes, or lateral separations. Our focus is on tasks where the robot must reach a goal region residing on an elevated plane that is unreachable. Rather than declaring such tasks infeasible, an effective strategy is to enable the robot to interact with the environment, rearranging movable objects to create new traversable connections; a problem known as Navigation Among Movable Objects (NAMO). Existing NAMO planners typically address 2D environments, where obstacles are pushed aside to clear a path. These methods cannot directly handle the considered 3D setting; in such cases, obstacles must be placed strategically to bridge these physical disconnections. We address this challenge by developing BRiDGE (Block-based Reconfiguration in Disconnected 3D Geometric Environments), a sampling-based planner that incrementally builds trees over robot and object configurations to compute feasible plans specifying which objects to move, where to place them, and in what order, while accounting for a limited number of movable objects. To accelerate planning, we introduce non-uniform sampling strategies. We show that our method is probabilistically complete and we provide extensive numerical and hardware experiments validating its effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Effective Online 3D Bin Packing with Lookahead Parcels Using Monte Carlo Tree Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online 3D Bin Packing (3D-BP) with robotic arms is crucial for reducing transportation and labor costs in modern logistics. While Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has shown strong performance, it often fails to adapt to real-world short-term distribution shifts, which arise as different batches of goods arrive sequentially, causing performance drops. We argue that the short-term lookahead information available in modern logistics systems is key to mitigating this issue, especially during distribution shifts. We formulate online 3D-BP with lookahead parcels as a Model Predictive Control (MPC) problem and adapt the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) framework to solve it. Our framework employs a dynamic exploration prior that automatically balances a learned RL policy and a robust random policy based on the lookahead characteristics. Additionally, we design an auxiliary reward to penalize long-term spatial waste from individual placements. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving over 10\% gains under distributional shifts, 4\% average improvement in online deployment, and up to more than 8\% in the best case--demonstrating the effectiveness of our framework.</description>

      <title>Learning to Nudge: A Scalable Barrier Function Framework for Safe Robot Interaction in Dense Clutter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robots operating in everyday environments must navigate and manipulate within densely cluttered spaces, where physical contact with surrounding objects is unavoidable. Traditional safety frameworks treat contact as unsafe, restricting robots to collision avoidance and limiting their ability to function in dense, everyday settings. As the number of objects grows, model-based approaches for safe manipulation become computationally intractable; meanwhile, learned methods typically tie safety to the task at hand, making them hard to transfer to new tasks without retraining. In this work we introduce Dense Contact Barrier Functions(DCBF). Our approach bypasses the computational complexity of explicitly modeling multi-object dynamics by instead learning a composable, object-centric function that implicitly captures the safety constraints arising from physical interactions. Trained offline on interactions with a few objects, the learned DCBFcomposes across arbitrary object sets at runtime, producing a single global safety filter that scales linearly and transfers across tasks without retraining. We validate our approach through simulated experiments in dense clutter, demonstrating its ability to enable collision-free navigation and safe, contact-rich interaction in suitable settings.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Various Manipulator Configurations Based on Multi-Objective Black-Box Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Various 6-degree-of-freedom (DOF) and 7-DOF manipulators have been developed to date. Over a long history, their joint configurations and link length ratios have been determined empirically. In recent years, the development of robotic foundation models has become increasingly active, leading to the continuous proposal of various manipulators to support these models. However, none of these manipulators share exactly the same structure, as the order of joints and the ratio of link lengths differ among robots. Therefore, in order to discuss the optimal structure of a manipulator, we performed multi-objective optimization from the perspectives of end-effector reachability and joint torque. We analyze where existing manipulator structures stand within the sampling results of the optimization and provide insights for future manipulator design.</description>

      <title>Loop Closure using AnyLoc Visual Place Recognition in DPV-SLAM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Loop closure is crucial for maintaining the accuracy and consistency of visual SLAM. We propose a method to improve loop closure performance in DPV-SLAM. Our approach integrates AnyLoc, a learning-based visual place recognition technique, as a replacement for the classical Bag of Visual Words (BoVW) loop detection method. In contrast to BoVW, which relies on handcrafted features, AnyLoc utilizes deep feature representations, enabling more robust image retrieval across diverse viewpoints and lighting conditions. Furthermore, we propose an adaptive mechanism that dynamically adjusts similarity threshold based on environmental conditions, removing the need for manual tuning. Experiments on both indoor and outdoor datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the original DPV-SLAM in terms of loop closure accuracy and robustness. The proposed method offers a practical and scalable solution for enhancing loop closure performance in modern SLAM systems.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Control-Friendly Trajectories with Self-Supervised Residual Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-world physics can only be analytically modeled with a certain level of precision for modern intricate robotic systems. As a result, tracking aggressive trajectories accurately could be challenging due to the existence of residual physics during controller synthesis. This paper presents a self-supervised residual learning and trajectory optimization framework to address the aforementioned challenges. At first, unknown dynamic effects on the closed-loop model are learned and treated as residuals of the nominal dynamics, jointly forming a hybrid model. We show that learning with analytic gradients can be achieved using only trajectory-level data while enjoying accurate long-horizon prediction with an arbitrary integration step size. Subsequently, a trajectory optimizer is developed to compute the optimal reference trajectory with the residual physics along it minimized. It ends up with trajectories that are friendly to the following control level. The agile flight of quadrotors illustrates that by utilizing the hybrid dynamics, the proposed optimizer outputs aggressive motions that can be precisely tracked.</description>

      <title>Unified Meta-Representation and Feedback Calibration for General Disturbance Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise control in modern robotic applications is always an open issue due to unknown time-varying disturbances. Existing meta-learning-based approaches require a shared representation of environmental structures, which lack flexibility for realistic non-structural disturbances. Besides, representation error and the distribution shifts can lead to heavy degradation in prediction accuracy. This work presents a generalizable disturbance estimation framework that builds on meta-learning and feedback-calibrated online adaptation. By extracting features from a finite time window of past observations, a unified representation that effectively captures general non-structural disturbances can be learned without predefined structural assumptions. The online adaptation process is subsequently calibrated by a state-feedback mechanism to attenuate the learning residual originating from the representation and generalizability limitations. Theoretical analysis shows that simultaneous convergence of both the online learning error and the disturbance estimation error can be achieved. Through the unified meta-representation, our framework effectively estimates multiple rapidly changing disturbances, as demonstrated by quadrotor flight experiments.

      <title>Advancing Assistive Robotics: Multi-Modal Navigation and Biophysical Monitoring for Next-Generation Wheelchairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Assistive electric-powered wheelchairs (EPWs) have become essential mobility aids for people with disabilities such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), post-stroke hemiplegia, and dementia-related mobility impairment. This work presents a novel multi-modal EPW control system designed to prioritize patient needs while allowing seamless switching between control modes. Four complementary interfaces, namely joystick, speech, hand gesture, and electrooculography (EOG), are integrated with a continuous vital sign monitoring framework measuring heart rate variability, oxygen saturation (SpO2), and skin temperature. This combination enables greater patient independence while allowing caregivers to maintain real-time supervision and early intervention capability.
  Two-point calibration of the biophysical sensors against clinical reference devices resulted in root mean square errors of at most 2 bpm for heart rate, 0.5 degree Celsius for skin temperature, and 1 percent for SpO2. Experimental evaluation involved twenty participants with mobility impairments executing a total of 500 indoor navigation commands. The achieved command recognition accuracies were 99 percent for joystick control, 97 percent plus or minus 2 percent for speech, and 95 percent plus or minus 3 percent for hand gesture, with an average closed-loop latency of 20 plus or minus 0.5 milliseconds. Caregivers receive real-time alerts through an Android application following encrypted cloud transmission of physiological data. By integrating multi-modal mobility control with cloud-enabled health monitoring and reporting latency and energy budgets, the proposed prototype addresses key challenges in assistive robotics, contributes toward compliance with ISO 7176-31 and IEC 80601-2-78 safety standards, and establishes a foundation for future adaptive machine learning enhancements.</description>

Abstract: Agile locomotion in legged robots poses significant challenges for visual perception. Traditional frame-based cameras often fail in these scenarios for producing blurred images, particularly under low-light conditions. In contrast, event cameras capture changes in brightness asynchronously, offering low latency, high temporal resolution, and high dynamic range. These advantages make them suitable for robust perception during rapid motion and under challenging illumination. However, existing event camera datasets exhibit limitations in stereo configurations and multi-band sensing domains under various illumination conditions. To address this gap, we present M-SEVIQ, a multi-band stereo event visual and inertial quadruped dataset collected using a Unitree Go2 equipped with stereo event cameras, a frame-based camera, an inertial measurement unit (IMU), and joint encoders. This dataset contains more than 30 real-world sequences captured across different velocity levels, illumination wavelengths, and lighting conditions. In addition, comprehensive calibration data, including intrinsic, extrinsic, and temporal alignments, are provided to facilitate accurate sensor fusion and benchmarking. Our M-SEVIQ can be used to support research in agile robot perception, sensor fusion, semantic segmentation and multi-modal vision in challenging environments.</description>

      <title>Closing the Reality Gap: Zero-Shot Sim-to-Real Deployment for Dexterous Force-Based Grasping and Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human-like dexterous hands with multiple fingers offer human-level manipulation capabilities, but training control policies that can directly deploy on real hardware remains difficult due to contact-rich physics and imperfect actuation. We close this gap with a practical sim-to-real reinforcement learning (RL) framework that utilizes dense tactile feedback combined with joint torque sensing to explicitly regulate physical interactions. To enable effective sim-to-real transfer, we introduce (i) a computationally fast tactile simulation that computes distances between dense virtual tactile units and the object via parallel forward kinematics, providing high-rate, high-resolution touch signals needed by RL; (ii) a current-to-torque calibration that eliminates the need for torque sensors on dexterous hands by mapping motor current to joint torque; and (iii) actuator dynamics modeling to bridge the actuation gaps with randomization of non-ideal effects such as backlash, torque-speed saturation. Using an asymmetric actor-critic PPO pipeline trained entirely in simulation, our policies deploy directly to a five-finger hand. The resulting policies demonstrated two essential skills: (1) command-based, controllable grasp force tracking, and (2) reorientation of objects in the hand, both of which were robustly executed without fine-tuning on the robot. By combining tactile and torque in the observation space with effective sensing/actuation modeling, our system provides a practical solution to achieve reliable dexterous manipulation. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of controllable grasping on a multi-finger dexterous hand trained entirely in simulation and transferred zero-shot on real hardware.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning for Follow-the-Leader Robotic Endoscopic Navigation via Synthetic Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous navigation is crucial for both medical and industrial endoscopic robots, enabling safe and efficient exploration of narrow tubular environments without continuous human intervention, where avoiding contact with the inner walls has been a longstanding challenge for prior approaches. We present a follow-the-leader endoscopic robot based on a flexible continuum structure designed to minimize contact between the endoscope body and intestinal walls, thereby reducing patient discomfort. To achieve this objective, we propose a vision-based deep reinforcement learning framework guided by monocular depth estimation. A realistic intestinal simulation environment was constructed in \textit{NVIDIA Omniverse} to train and evaluate autonomous navigation strategies. Furthermore, thousands of synthetic intraluminal images were generated using NVIDIA Replicator to fine-tune the Depth Anything model, enabling dense three-dimensional perception of the intestinal environment with a single monocular camera. Subsequently, we introduce a geometry-aware reward and penalty mechanism to enable accurate lumen tracking. Compared with the original Depth Anything model, our method improves $\delta_{1}$ depth accuracy by 39.2% and reduces the navigation J-index by 0.67 relative to the second-best method, demonstrating the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Soft Responsive Materials Enhance Humanoid Safety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Humanoid robots are envisioned as general-purpose platforms in human-centered environments, yet their deployment is limited by vulnerability to falls and the risks posed by rigid metal-plastic structures to people and surroundings. We introduce a soft-rigid co-design framework that leverages non-Newtonian fluid-based soft responsive materials to enhance humanoid safety. The material remains compliant during normal interaction but rapidly stiffens under impact, absorbing and dissipating fall-induced forces. Physics-based simulations guide protector placement and thickness and enable learning of active fall policies. Applied to a 42 kg life-size humanoid, the protector markedly reduces peak impact and allows repeated falls without hardware damage, including drops from 3 m and tumbles down long staircases. Across diverse scenarios, the approach improves robot robustness and environmental safety. By uniting responsive materials, structural co-design, and learning-based control, this work advances interact-safe, industry-ready humanoid robots.</description>

      <title>Warm-Starting Collision-Free Model Predictive Control With Object-Centric Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Acting in cluttered environments requires predicting and avoiding collisions while still achieving precise control. Conventional optimization-based controllers can enforce physical constraints, but they struggle to produce feasible solutions quickly when many obstacles are present. Diffusion models can generate diverse trajectories around obstacles, yet prior approaches lacked a general and efficient way to condition them on scene structure. In this paper, we show that combining diffusion-based warm-starting conditioned with a latent object-centric representation of the scene and with a collision-aware model predictive controller (MPC) yields reliable and efficient motion generation under strict time limits. Our approach conditions a diffusion transformer on the system state, task, and surroundings, using an object-centric slot attention mechanism to provide a compact obstacle representation suitable for control. The sampled trajectories are refined by an optimal control problem that enforces rigid-body dynamics and signed-distance collision constraints, producing feasible motions in real time. On benchmark tasks, this hybrid method achieved markedly higher success rates and lower latency than sampling-based planners or either component alone. Real-robot experiments with a torque-controlled Panda confirm reliable and safe execution with MPC.</description>

      <title>LOST-3DSG: Lightweight Open-Vocabulary 3D Scene Graphs with Semantic Tracking in Dynamic Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tracking objects that move within dynamic environments is a core challenge in robotics. Recent research has advanced this topic significantly; however, many existing approaches remain inefficient due to their reliance on heavy foundation models. To address this limitation, we propose LOST-3DSG, a lightweight open-vocabulary 3D scene graph designed to track dynamic objects in real-world environments. Our method adopts a semantic approach to entity tracking based on word2vec and sentence embeddings, enabling an open-vocabulary representation while avoiding the necessity of storing dense CLIP visual features. As a result, LOST-3DSG achieves superior performance compared to approaches that rely on high-dimensional visual embeddings. We evaluate our method through qualitative and quantitative experiments conducted in a real 3D environment using a TIAGo robot. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of LOST-3DSG in dynamic object tracking. Code and supplementary material are publicly available on the project website at https://lab-rococo-sapienza.github.io/lost-3dsg/.</description>

      <title>Parameter-Robust MPPI for Safe Online Learning of Unknown Parameters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.02948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robots deployed in dynamic environments must remain safe even when key physical parameters are uncertain or change over time. We propose Parameter-Robust Model Predictive Path Integral (PRMPPI) control, a framework that integrates online parameter learning with probabilistic safety constraints. PRMPPI maintains a particle-based belief over parameters via Stein Variational Gradient Descent, evaluates safety constraints using Conformal Prediction, and optimizes both a nominal performance-driven and a safety-focused backup trajectory in parallel. This yields a controller that is cautious at first, improves performance as parameters are learned, and ensures safety throughout. Simulation and hardware experiments demonstrate higher success rates, lower tracking error, and more accurate parameter estimates than baselines.</description>

      <title>Learning to Act Robustly with View-Invariant Latent Actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-based robotic policies often struggle with even minor viewpoint changes, underscoring the need for view-invariant visual representations. This challenge becomes more pronounced in real-world settings, where viewpoint variability is unavoidable and can significantly disrupt policy performance. Existing methods typically learn invariance from multi-view observations at the scene level, but such approaches rely on visual appearance and fail to incorporate the physical dynamics essential for robust generalization. We propose View-Invariant Latent Action (VILA), which models a latent action capturing transition patterns across trajectories to learn view-invariant representations grounded in physical dynamics. VILA aligns these latent actions across viewpoints using an action-guided objective based on ground-truth action sequences. Experiments in both simulation and the real world show that VILA-based policies generalize effectively to unseen viewpoints and transfer well to new tasks, establishing VILA as a strong pretraining framework that improves robustness and downstream learning performance.</description>

      <title>A Bi-directional Adaptive Framework for Agile UAV Landing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous landing on mobile platforms is crucial for extending quadcopter operational flexibility, yet conventional methods are often too inefficient for highly dynamic scenarios. The core limitation lies in the prevalent ``track-then-descend'' paradigm, which treats the platform as a passive target and forces the quadcopter to perform complex, sequential maneuvers. This paper challenges that paradigm by introducing a bi-directional cooperative landing framework that redefines the roles of the vehicle and the platform. The essential innovation is transforming the problem from a single-agent tracking challenge into a coupled system optimization. Our key insight is that the mobile platform is not merely a target, but an active agent in the landing process. It proactively tilts its surface to create an optimal, stable terminal attitude for the approaching quadcopter. This active cooperation fundamentally breaks the sequential model by parallelizing the alignment and descent phases. Concurrently, the quadcopter's planning pipeline focuses on generating a time-optimal and dynamically feasible trajectory that minimizes energy consumption. This bi-directional coordination allows the system to execute the recovery in an agile manner, characterized by aggressive trajectory tracking and rapid state synchronization within transient windows. The framework's effectiveness, validated in dynamic scenarios, significantly improves the efficiency, precision, and robustness of autonomous quadrotor recovery in complex and time-constrained missions.</description>

      <title>Validating Generalist Robots with Situation Calculus and STL Falsification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalist robots are becoming a reality, capable of interpreting natural language instructions and executing diverse operations. However, their validation remains challenging because each task induces its own operational context and correctness specification, exceeding the assumptions of traditional validation methods. We propose a two-layer validation framework that combines abstract reasoning with concrete system falsification. At the abstract layer, situation calculus models the world and derives weakest preconditions, enabling constraint-aware combinatorial testing to systematically generate diverse, semantically valid world-task configurations with controllable coverage strength. At the concrete layer, these configurations are instantiated for simulation-based falsification with STL monitoring. Experiments on tabletop manipulation tasks show that our framework effectively uncovers failure cases in the NVIDIA GR00T controller, demonstrating its promise for validating general-purpose robot autonomy.</description>

      <title>PiDR: Physics-Informed Inertial Dead Reckoning for Autonomous Platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fundamental requirement for full autonomy is the ability to sustain accurate navigation in the absence of external data, such as GNSS signals or visual information. In these challenging environments, the platform must rely exclusively on inertial sensors, leading to pure inertial navigation. However, the inherent noise and other error terms of the inertial sensors in such real-world scenarios will cause the navigation solution to drift over time. Although conventional deep-learning models have emerged as a possible approach to inertial navigation, they are inherently black-box in nature. Furthermore, they struggle to learn effectively with limited supervised sensor data and often fail to preserve physical principles. To address these limitations, we propose PiDR, a physics-informed inertial dead-reckoning framework for autonomous platforms in situations of pure inertial navigation. PiDR offers transparency by explicitly integrating inertial navigation principles into the network training process through the physics-informed residual component. PiDR plays a crucial role in mitigating abrupt trajectory deviations even under limited or sparse supervision. We evaluated PiDR on real-world datasets collected by a mobile robot and an autonomous underwater vehicle. We obtained more than 29% positioning improvement in both datasets, demonstrating the ability of PiDR to generalize different platforms operating in various environments and dynamics. Thus, PiDR offers a robust, lightweight, yet effective architecture and can be deployed on resource-constrained platforms, enabling real-time pure inertial navigation in adverse scenarios.</description>

      <title>SOP: A Scalable Online Post-Training System for Vision-Language-Action Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models achieve strong generalization through large-scale pre-training, but real-world deployment requires expert-level task proficiency in addition to broad generality. Existing post-training approaches for VLA models are typically offline, single-robot, or task-specific, limiting effective on-policy adaptation and scalable learning from real-world interaction. We introduce a Scalable Online Post-training (SOP) system that enables online, distributed, multi-task post-training of generalist VLA models directly in the physical world. SOP tightly couples execution and learning through a closed-loop architecture in which a fleet of robots continuously streams on-policy experience and human intervention signals to a centralized cloud learner, and asynchronously receives updated policies. This design supports prompt on-policy correction, scales experience collection through parallel deployment, and preserves generality during adaptation. SOP is agnostic to the choice of post-training algorithm; we instantiate it with both interactive imitation learning (HG-DAgger) and reinforcement learning (RECAP). Across a range of real-world manipulation tasks including cloth folding, box assembly, and grocery restocking, we show that SOP substantially improves the performance of large pretrained VLA models while maintaining a single shared policy across tasks. Effective post-training can be achieved within hours of real-world interaction, and performance scales near-linearly with the number of robots in the fleet. These results suggest that tightly coupling online learning with fleet-scale deployment is instrumental to enabling efficient, reliable, and scalable post-training of generalist robot policies in the physical world.</description>

      <title>A Fast Semidefinite Convex Relaxation for Optimal Control Problems With Spatio-Temporal Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solving optimal control problems (OCPs) of autonomous agents operating under spatial and temporal constraints fast and accurately is essential in applications ranging from eco-driving of autonomous vehicles to quadrotor navigation. However, the nonlinear programs approximating the OCPs are inherently nonconvex due to the coupling between the dynamics and the event timing, and therefore, they are challenging to solve. Most approaches address this challenge by predefining waypoint times or just using nonconvex trajectory optimization, which simplifies the problem but often yields suboptimal solutions. To significantly improve the numerical properties, we propose a formulation with a time-scaling direct multiple shooting scheme that partitions the prediction horizon into segments aligned with characteristic time constraints. Moreover, we develop a fast semidefinite-programming-based convex relaxation that exploits the sparsity pattern of the lifted formulation. Comprehensive simulation studies demonstrate the solution optimality and computational efficiency. Furthermore, real-world experiments on a quadrotor waypoint flight task with constrained open time windows validate the practical applicability of the approach in complex environments.</description>

      <title>HEXAR: a Hierarchical Explainability Architecture for Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As robotic systems become increasingly complex, the need for explainable decision-making becomes critical. Existing explainability approaches in robotics typically either focus on individual modules, which can be difficult to query from the perspective of high-level behaviour, or employ monolithic approaches, which do not exploit the modularity of robotic architectures. We present HEXAR (Hierarchical EXplainability Architecture for Robots), a novel framework that provides a plug-in, hierarchical approach to generate explanations about robotic systems. HEXAR consists of specialised component explainers using diverse explanation techniques (e.g., LLM-based reasoning, causal models, feature importance, etc) tailored to specific robot modules, orchestrated by an explainer selector that chooses the most appropriate one for a given query. We implement and evaluate HEXAR on a TIAGo robot performing assistive tasks in a home environment, comparing it against end-to-end and aggregated baseline approaches across 180 scenario-query variations. We observe that HEXAR significantly outperforms baselines in root cause identification, incorrect information exclusion, and runtime, offering a promising direction for transparent autonomous systems.</description>

      <title>Dual-quaternion learning control for autonomous vehicle trajectory tracking with safety guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a learning-based trajectory tracking controller for autonomous robotic platforms whose motion can be described kinematically on $\mathrm{SE}(3)$. The controller is formulated in the dual quaternion framework and operates at the velocity level, assuming direct command of angular and linear velocities, as is standard in many aerial vehicles and omnidirectional mobile robots. Gaussian Process (GP) regression is integrated into a geometric feedback law to learn and compensate online for unknown, state-dependent disturbances and modeling imperfections affecting both attitude and position, while preserving the algebraic structure and coupling properties inherent to rigid-body motion.
  The proposed approach does not rely on explicit parametric models of the unknown effects, making it well-suited for robotic systems subject to sensor-induced disturbances, unmodeled actuation couplings, and environmental uncertainties. A Lyapunov-based analysis establishes probabilistic ultimate boundedness of the pose tracking error under bounded GP uncertainty, providing formal stability guarantees for the learning-based controller.
  Simulation results demonstrate accurate and smooth trajectory tracking in the presence of realistic, localized disturbances, including correlated rotational and translational effects arising from magnetometer perturbations. These results illustrate the potential of combining geometric modeling and probabilistic learning to achieve robust, data-efficient pose control for autonomous robotic systems.</description>

      <title>A High-Fidelity Digital Twin for Robotic Manipulation Based on 3D Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developing high-fidelity, interactive digital twins is crucial for enabling closed-loop motion planning and reliable real-world robot execution, which are essential to advancing sim-to-real transfer. However, existing approaches often suffer from slow reconstruction, limited visual fidelity, and difficulties in converting photorealistic models into planning-ready collision geometry. We present a practical framework that constructs high-quality digital twins within minutes from sparse RGB inputs. Our system employs 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for fast, photorealistic reconstruction as a unified scene representation. We enhance 3DGS with visibility-aware semantic fusion for accurate 3D labelling and introduce an efficient, filter-based geometry conversion method to produce collision-ready models seamlessly integrated with a Unity-ROS2-MoveIt physics engine. In experiments with a Franka Emika Panda robot performing pick-and-place tasks, we demonstrate that this enhanced geometric accuracy effectively supports robust manipulation in real-world trials. These results demonstrate that 3DGS-based digital twins, enriched with semantic and geometric consistency, offer a fast, reliable, and scalable path from perception to manipulation in unstructured environments.</description>

      <title>AMC26: High-performance DOb for robust position control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a new HPDOb that significantly improves disturbance estimation accuracy and robustness in motion control systems, surpassing the capabilities of conventional DObs. The proposed observer is analysed and synthesised in the discrete-time domain, providing a realistic representation of their dynamic behaviour and enabling enhanced controller design for practical applications. The core contribution of the HPDOb is a novel synthesis method that incorporates higher-order truncation error dynamics into disturbance estimation. Unlike conventional DObs, which are limited to zero-order truncation error, the HPDOb achieves first-order truncation error, yielding markedly improved estimation accuracy and robustness against disturbances in motion control systems. Simulation and experiments verify the stability and performance of HPDOb.</description>

      <title>Towards Zero-Shot Point Cloud Registration Across Diverse Scales, Scenes, and Sensor Setups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Some deep learning-based point cloud registration methods struggle with zero-shot generalization, often requiring dataset-specific hyperparameter tuning or retraining for new environments. We identify three critical limitations: (a) fixed user-defined parameters (e.g., voxel size, search radius) that fail to generalize across varying scales, (b) learned keypoint detectors exhibit poor cross-domain transferability, and (c) absolute coordinates amplify scale mismatches between datasets. To address these three issues, we present BUFFER-X, a training-free registration framework that achieves zero-shot generalization through: (a) geometric bootstrapping for automatic hyperparameter estimation, (b) distribution-aware farthest point sampling to replace learned detectors, and (c) patch-level coordinate normalization to ensure scale consistency. Our approach employs hierarchical multi-scale matching to extract correspondences across local, middle, and global receptive fields, enabling robust registration in diverse environments. For efficiency-critical applications, we introduce BUFFER-X-Lite, which reduces total computation time by 43% (relative to BUFFER-X) through early exit strategies and fast pose solvers while preserving accuracy. We evaluate on a comprehensive benchmark comprising 12 datasets spanning object-scale, indoor, and outdoor scenes, including cross-sensor registration between heterogeneous LiDAR configurations. Results demonstrate that our approach generalizes effectively without manual tuning or prior knowledge of test domains. Code: https://github.com/MIT-SPARK/BUFFER-X.</description>

      <title>Limited Linguistic Diversity in Embodied AI Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Language plays a critical role in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, yet the linguistic characteristics of the datasets used to train and evaluate these systems remain poorly documented. In this work, we present a systematic dataset audit of several widely used VLA corpora, aiming to characterize what kinds of instructions these datasets actually contain and how much linguistic variety they provide. We quantify instruction language along complementary dimensions-including lexical variety, duplication and overlap, semantic similarity, and syntactic complexity. Our analysis shows that many datasets rely on highly repetitive, template-like commands with limited structural variation, yielding a narrow distribution of instruction forms. We position these findings as descriptive documentation of the language signal available in current VLA training and evaluation data, intended to support more detailed dataset reporting, more principled dataset selection, and targeted curation or augmentation strategies that broaden language coverage.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Spectral Modeling and Control of Soft-Robotic Muscles from Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial muscles are essential for compliant musculoskeletal robotics but complicate control due to nonlinear multiphysics dynamics. Hydraulically amplified electrostatic (HASEL) actuators, a class of soft artificial muscles, offer high performance but exhibit memory effects and hysteresis. Here we present a data-driven reduction and control strategy grounded in spectral submanifold (SSM) theory. In the adiabatic regime, where inputs vary slowly relative to intrinsic transients, trajectories rapidly converge to a low-dimensional slow manifold. We learn an explicit input-to-output map on this manifold from forced-response trajectories alone, avoiding decay experiments that can trigger hysteresis. We deploy the SSM-based model for real-time control of an antagonistic HASEL-clutch joint. This approach yields a substantial reduction in tracking error compared to feedback-only and feedforward-only baselines under identical settings. This record-and-control workflow enables rapid characterization and high-performance control of soft muscles and muscle-driven joints without detailed physics-based modeling.</description>

      <title>RobotDiffuse: Diffusion-Based Motion Planning for Redundant Manipulators with the ROP Obstacle Avoidance Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19500v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Redundant manipulators, with their higher Degrees of Freedom (DoFs), offer enhanced kinematic performance and versatility, making them suitable for applications like manufacturing, surgical robotics, and human-robot collaboration. However, motion planning for these manipulators is challenging due to increased DoFs and complex, dynamic environments. While traditional motion planning algorithms struggle with high-dimensional spaces, deep learning-based methods often face instability and inefficiency in complex tasks. This paper introduces RobotDiffuse, a diffusion model-based approach for motion planning in redundant manipulators. By integrating physical constraints with a point cloud encoder and replacing the U-Net structure with an encoder-only transformer, RobotDiffuse improves the model's ability to capture temporal dependencies and generate smoother, more coherent motion plans. We validate the approach using a complex simulator and release a new dataset, Robot-obtalcles-panda (ROP), with 35M robot poses and 0.14M obstacle avoidance scenarios. The highest overall score obtained in the experiment demonstrates the effectiveness of RobotDiffuse and the promise of diffusion models for motion planning tasks. The dataset can be accessed at https://github.com/ACRoboT-buaa/RobotDiffuse.</description>

      <title>Steering Flexible Linear Objects in Planar Environments by Two Robot Hands Using Euler's Elastica Solutions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02874v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The manipulation of flexible objects such as cables, wires and fresh food items by robot hands forms a special challenge in robot grasp mechanics. This paper considers the steering of flexible linear objects in planar environments by two robot hands. The flexible linear object, modeled as an elastic non-stretchable rod, is manipulated by varying the gripping endpoint positions while keeping equal endpoint tangents. The flexible linear object shape has a closed form solution in terms of the grasp endpoint positions and tangents, called Euler's elastica. This paper obtains the elastica solutions under the optimal control framework, then uses the elastica solutions to obtain closed-form criteria for non self-intersection, stability and obstacle avoidance of the flexible linear object. The new tools are incorporated into a planning scheme for steering flexible linear objects in planar environments populated by sparsely spaced obstacles. The scheme is fully implemented and demonstrated with detailed examples.</description>

      <title>Efficient Swept Volume-Based Trajectory Generation for Arbitrary-Shaped Ground Robot Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07554v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Navigating an arbitrary-shaped ground robot safely in cluttered environments remains a challenging problem. The existing trajectory planners that account for the robot's physical geometry severely suffer from the intractable runtime. To achieve both computational efficiency and Continuous Collision Avoidance (CCA) of arbitrary-shaped ground robot planning, we proposed a novel coarse-to-fine navigation framework that significantly accelerates planning. In the first stage, a sampling-based method selectively generates distinct topological paths that guarantee a minimum inflated margin. In the second stage, a geometry-aware front-end strategy is designed to discretize these topologies into full-state robot motion sequences while concurrently partitioning the paths into SE(2) sub-problems and simpler R2 sub-problems for back-end optimization. In the final stage, an SVSDF-based optimizer generates trajectories tailored to these sub-problems and seamlessly splices them into a continuous final motion plan. Extensive benchmark comparisons show that the proposed method is one to several orders of magnitude faster than the cutting-edge methods in runtime while maintaining a high planning success rate and ensuring CCA.</description>

      <title>Characterizing the Robustness of Black-Box LLM Planners Under Perturbed Observations with Adaptive Stress Testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05665v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated success in decision-making tasks including planning, control, and prediction, but their tendency to hallucinate unsafe and undesired outputs poses risks. This unwanted behavior is further exacerbated in environments where sensors are noisy or unreliable. Characterizing the behavior of LLM planners to varied observations is necessary to proactively avoid failures in safety-critical scenarios. We specifically investigate the response of LLMs along two different perturbation dimensions. Like prior works, one dimension generates semantically similar prompts with varied phrasing by randomizing order of details, modifying access to few-shot examples, etc. Unique to our work, the second dimension simulates access to varied sensors and noise to mimic raw sensor or detection algorithm failures. An initial case study in which perturbations are manually applied show that both dimensions lead LLMs to hallucinate in a multi-agent driving environment. However, manually covering the entire perturbation space for several scenarios is infeasible. As such, we propose a novel method for efficiently searching the space of prompt perturbations using adaptive stress testing (AST) with Monte-Carlo tree search (MCTS). Our AST formulation enables discovery of scenarios, sensor configurations, and prompt phrasing that cause language models to act with high uncertainty or even crash. By generating MCTS prompt perturbation trees across diverse scenarios, we show through extensive experiments that offline analyses can be used to proactively understand potential failures that may arise at runtime.</description>

      <title>Augmented Reality for RObots (ARRO): Pointing Visuomotor Policies Towards Visual Robustness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08627v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Visuomotor policies trained on human expert demonstrations have recently shown strong performance across a wide range of robotic manipulation tasks. However, these policies remain highly sensitive to domain shifts stemming from background or robot embodiment changes, which limits their generalization capabilities. In this paper, we present ARRO, a novel visual representation that leverages zero-shot open-vocabulary segmentation and object detection models to efficiently mask out task-irrelevant regions of the scene in real time without requiring additional training, modeling of the setup, or camera calibration. By filtering visual distractors and overlaying virtual guides during both training and inference, ARRO improves robustness to scene variations and reduces the need for additional data collection. We extensively evaluate ARRO with Diffusion Policy on a range of tabletop manipulation tasks in both simulation and real-world environments, and further demonstrate its compatibility and effectiveness with generalist robot policies, such as Octo, OpenVLA and Pi Zero. Across all settings in our evaluation, ARRO yields consistent performance gains, allows for selective masking to choose between different objects, and shows robustness even to challenging segmentation conditions.

      <title>Chain-of-Action: Trajectory Autoregressive Modeling for Robotic Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09990v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present Chain-of-Action (CoA), a novel visuo-motor policy paradigm built upon Trajectory Autoregressive Modeling. Unlike conventional approaches that predict next step action(s) forward, CoA generates an entire trajectory by explicit backward reasoning with task-specific goals through an action-level Chain-of-Thought (CoT) process. This process is unified within a single autoregressive structure: (1) the first token corresponds to a stable keyframe action that encodes the task-specific goals; and (2) subsequent action tokens are generated autoregressively, conditioned on the initial keyframe and previously predicted actions. This backward action reasoning enforces a global-to-local structure, allowing each local action to be tightly constrained by the final goal. To further realize the action reasoning structure, CoA incorporates four complementary designs: continuous action token representation; dynamic stopping for variable-length trajectory generation; reverse temporal ensemble; and multi-token prediction to balance action chunk modeling with global structure. As a result, CoA gives strong spatial generalization capabilities while preserving the flexibility and simplicity of a visuo-motor policy. Empirically, we observe CoA achieves the state-of-the-art performance across 60 RLBench tasks and 8 real-world manipulation tasks.</description>

      <title>An Informative Planning Framework for Target Tracking and Active Mapping in Dynamic Environments with ASVs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14636v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mobile robot platforms are increasingly being used to automate information gathering tasks such as environmental monitoring. Efficient target tracking in dynamic environments is critical for applications such as search and rescue and pollutant cleanups. In this letter, we study active mapping of floating targets that drift due to environmental disturbances such as wind and currents. This is a challenging problem as it involves predicting both spatial and temporal variations in the map due to changing conditions. We introduce an integrated framework combining dynamic occupancy grid mapping and an informative planning approach to actively map and track freely drifting targets with an autonomous surface vehicle. A key component of our adaptive planning approach is a spatiotemporal prediction network that predicts target position distributions over time. We further propose a planning objective for target tracking that leverages these predictions. Simulation experiments show that this planning objective improves target tracking performance compared to existing methods that consider only entropy reduction as the planning objective. Finally, we validate our approach in field tests, showcasing its ability to track targets in real-world monitoring scenarios.</description>

      <title>DDBot: Differentiable Physics-based Digging Robot for Unknown Granular Materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17335v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Automating the manipulation of granular materials poses significant challenges due to complex contact dynamics, unpredictable material properties, and intricate system states. Existing approaches often fail to achieve efficiency and accuracy in such tasks. To fill the research gap, this article studies the small-scale and high-precision granular material digging task with unknown physical properties. A key scientific problem addressed is the feasibility of applying first-order gradient-based optimization to complex differentiable granular material simulation and overcoming associated numerical instability. A new framework, named differentiable digging robot (DDBot), is proposed to manipulate granular materials, including sand and soil. Specifically, we equip DDBot with a differentiable physics-based simulator, tailored for granular material manipulation, powered by GPU-accelerated parallel computing and automatic differentiation. DDBot can perform efficient differentiable system identification and high-precision digging skill optimization for unknown granular materials, which is enabled by a differentiable skill-to-action mapping, a task-oriented demonstration method, gradient clipping and line search-based gradient descent. Experimental results show that DDBot can efficiently (converge within 5 to 20 minutes) identify unknown granular material dynamics and optimize digging skills, with high-precision results in zero-shot real-world deployments, highlighting its practicality. Benchmark results against state-of-the-art baselines also confirm the robustness and efficiency of DDBot in such digging tasks.</description>

      <title>Indicating Robot Vision Capabilities with Augmented Reality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.03550v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Research indicates that humans can mistakenly assume that robots and humans have the same field of view, possessing an inaccurate mental model of robots. This misperception may lead to failures during human-robot collaboration tasks where robots might be asked to complete impossible tasks about out-of-view objects. The issue is more severe when robots do not have a chance to scan the scene to update their world model while focusing on assigned tasks.
  To help align humans' mental models of robots' vision capabilities, we propose four field-of-view indicators in augmented reality and conducted a human-subjects experiment (N=41) to evaluate them in a collaborative assembly task regarding accuracy, confidence, task efficiency, and workload. These indicators span a spectrum of positions: two at robot's eye and head space -- deepening eye socket and adding blocks to two sides of the eyes (i.e., egocentric), and two anchoring in the robot's task space -- adding extended blocks from the sides of eyes to the table and placing blocks directly on the tables (i.e., allocentric).
  Results showed that, when placed directly in the task space, the allocentric indicator yields the highest accuracy, although with a delay in interpreting the robot's field of view. When placed at the robot's eyes, the egocentric indicator of deeper eye sockets, possible for physical alteration, also increased accuracy. In all indicators, participants' confidence was high while cognitive load remained low. Finally, we contribute six guidelines for practitioners to apply our augmented reality indicators or physical alterations to align humans' mental models with robots' vision capabilities.</description>

Abstract: Multi-Agent Path Finding is a fundamental problem in robotics and AI, yet most existing formulations treat planning and execution separately and address variants of the problem in an ad hoc manner. This paper presents a system-level framework for MAPF that integrates planning and execution, generalizes across variants, and explicitly models uncertainties. At its core is the MAPF system, a formal model that casts MAPF as a control design problem encompassing classical and uncertainty-aware formulations. To solve it, we introduce Finite-Horizon Closed-Loop Factorization (FICO), a factorization-based algorithm inspired by receding-horizon control that exploits compositional structure for efficient closed-loop operation. FICO enables real-time responses -- commencing execution within milliseconds -- while scaling to thousands of agents and adapting seamlessly to execution-time uncertainties. Extensive case studies demonstrate that it reduces computation time by up to two orders of magnitude compared with open-loop baselines, while delivering significantly higher throughput under stochastic delays and agent arrivals. These results establish a principled foundation for analyzing and advancing MAPF through system-level modeling, factorization, and closed-loop design.</description>

Abstract: The 2025 BEHAVIOR Challenge is designed to rigorously track progress toward solving long-horizon tasks by physical agents in simulated environments. BEHAVIOR-1K focuses on everyday household tasks that people most want robots to assist with and these tasks introduce long-horizon mobile manipulation challenges in realistic settings, bridging the gap between current research and real-world, human-centric applications. This report presents our solution to the 2025 BEHAVIOR Challenge in a very close 2nd place and substantially outperforms the rest of the submissions. Building on $\pi_{0.5}$, we focus on systematically building our solution by studying the effects of training techniques and data. Through careful ablation studies, we reveal the scaling benefits in both the pre-training and post-training phases, leading to a validation Q-score of 0.345, significantly surpassing previous state-of-the-art performance. We summarize our practical lessons and design recommendations that we hope will provide actionable insights for the broader embodied AI community when adapting powerful foundation models to complex embodied scenarios.

      <title>Evaluating Gemini Robotics Policies in a Veo World Simulator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.10675v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generative world models hold significant potential for simulating interactions with visuomotor policies in varied environments. Frontier video models can enable generation of realistic observations and environment interactions in a scalable and general manner. However, the use of video models in robotics has been limited primarily to in-distribution evaluations, i.e., scenarios that are similar to ones used to train the policy or fine-tune the base video model. In this report, we demonstrate that video models can be used for the entire spectrum of policy evaluation use cases in robotics: from assessing nominal performance to out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization, and probing physical and semantic safety. We introduce a generative evaluation system built upon a frontier video foundation model (Veo). The system is optimized to support robot action conditioning and multi-view consistency, while integrating generative image-editing and multi-view completion to synthesize realistic variations of real-world scenes along multiple axes of generalization. We demonstrate that the system preserves the base capabilities of the video model to enable accurate simulation of scenes that have been edited to include novel interaction objects, novel visual backgrounds, and novel distractor objects. This fidelity enables accurately predicting the relative performance of different policies in both nominal and OOD conditions, determining the relative impact of different axes of generalization on policy performance, and performing red teaming of policies to expose behaviors that violate physical or semantic safety constraints. We validate these capabilities through 1600+ real-world evaluations of eight Gemini Robotics policy checkpoints and five tasks for a bimanual manipulator.</description>

      <title>RoboTracer: Mastering Spatial Trace with Reasoning in Vision-Language Models for Robotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13660v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spatial tracing, as a fundamental embodied interaction ability for robots, is inherently challenging as it requires multi-step metric-grounded reasoning compounded with complex spatial referring and real-world metric measurement. However, existing methods struggle with this compositional task. To this end, we propose RoboTracer, a 3D-aware VLM that first achieves both 3D spatial referring and measuring via a universal spatial encoder and a regression-supervised decoder to enhance scale awareness during supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Moreover, RoboTracer advances multi-step metric-grounded reasoning via reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) with metric-sensitive process rewards, supervising key intermediate perceptual cues to accurately generate spatial traces. To support SFT and RFT training, we introduce TraceSpatial, a large-scale dataset of 30M QA pairs, spanning outdoor/indoor/tabletop scenes and supporting complex reasoning processes (up to 9 steps). We further present TraceSpatial-Bench, a challenging benchmark filling the gap to evaluate spatial tracing. Experimental results show that RoboTracer surpasses baselines in spatial understanding, measuring, and referring, with an average success rate of 79.1%, and also achieves SOTA performance on TraceSpatial-Bench by a large margin, exceeding Gemini-2.5-Pro by 36% accuracy. Notably, RoboTracer can be integrated with various control policies to execute long-horizon, dynamic tasks across diverse robots (UR5, G1 humanoid) in cluttered real-world scenes.

      <title>RoboMIND 2.0: A Multimodal, Bimanual Mobile Manipulation Dataset for Generalizable Embodied Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24653v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While data-driven imitation learning has revolutionized robotic manipulation, current approaches remain constrained by the scarcity of large-scale, diverse real-world demonstrations. Consequently, the ability of existing models to generalize across long-horizon bimanual tasks and mobile manipulation in unstructured environments remains limited. To bridge this gap, we present RoboMIND 2.0, a comprehensive real-world dataset comprising over 310K dual-arm manipulation trajectories collected across six distinct robot embodiments and 739 complex tasks. Crucially, to support research in contact-rich and spatially extended tasks, the dataset incorporates 12K tactile-enhanced episodes and 20K mobile manipulation trajectories. Complementing this physical data, we construct high-fidelity digital twins of our real-world environments, releasing an additional 20K-trajectory simulated dataset to facilitate robust sim-to-real transfer. To fully exploit the potential of RoboMIND 2.0, we propose MIND-2 system, a hierarchical dual-system frame-work optimized via offline reinforcement learning. MIND-2 integrates a high-level semantic planner (MIND-2-VLM) to decompose abstract natural language instructions into grounded subgoals, coupled with a low-level Vision-Language-Action executor (MIND-2-VLA), which generates precise, proprioception-aware motor actions.</description>

      <title>AdaVLN: Towards Visual Language Navigation in Continuous Indoor Environments with Moving Humans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18539v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Visual Language Navigation is a task that challenges robots to navigate in realistic environments based on natural language instructions. While previous research has largely focused on static settings, real-world navigation must often contend with dynamic human obstacles. Hence, we propose an extension to the task, termed Adaptive Visual Language Navigation (AdaVLN), which seeks to narrow this gap. AdaVLN requires robots to navigate complex 3D indoor environments populated with dynamically moving human obstacles, adding a layer of complexity to navigation tasks that mimic the real-world. To support exploration of this task, we also present AdaVLN simulator and AdaR2R datasets. The AdaVLN simulator enables easy inclusion of fully animated human models directly into common datasets like Matterport3D. We also introduce a "freeze-time" mechanism for both the navigation task and simulator, which pauses world state updates during agent inference, enabling fair comparisons and experimental reproducibility across different hardware. We evaluate several baseline models on this task, analyze the unique challenges introduced by AdaVLN, and demonstrate its potential to bridge the sim-to-real gap in VLN research.</description>

      <title>VLN-MME: Diagnosing MLLMs as Language-guided Visual Navigation agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24851v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a wide range of vision-language tasks. However, their performance as embodied agents, which requires multi-round dialogue spatial reasoning and sequential action prediction, needs further exploration. Our work investigates this potential in the context of Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) by introducing a unified and extensible evaluation framework to probe MLLMs as zero-shot agents by bridging traditional navigation datasets into a standardized benchmark, named VLN-MME. We simplify the evaluation with a highly modular and accessible design. This flexibility streamlines experiments, enabling structured comparisons and component-level ablations across diverse MLLM architectures, agent designs, and navigation tasks. Crucially, enabled by our framework, we observe that enhancing our baseline agent with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning and self-reflection leads to an unexpected performance decrease. This suggests MLLMs exhibit poor context awareness in embodied navigation tasks; although they can follow instructions and structure their output, their 3D spatial reasoning fidelity is low. VLN-MME lays the groundwork for systematic evaluation of general-purpose MLLMs in embodied navigation settings and reveals limitations in their sequential decision-making capabilities. We believe these findings offer crucial guidance for MLLM post-training as embodied agents.</description>

      <title>DarkEQA: Benchmarking Vision-Language Models for Embodied Question Answering in Low-Light Indoor Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24985v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly adopted as central reasoning modules for embodied agents. Existing benchmarks evaluate their capabilities under ideal, well-lit conditions, yet robust 24/7 operation demands performance under a wide range of visual degradations, including low-light conditions at night or in dark environments--a core necessity that has been largely overlooked. To address this underexplored challenge, we present DarkEQA, an open-source benchmark for evaluating EQA-relevant perceptual primitives under multi-level low-light conditions. DarkEQA isolates the perception bottleneck by evaluating question answering from egocentric observations under controlled degradations, enabling attributable robustness analysis. A key design feature of DarkEQA is its physical fidelity: visual degradations are modeled in linear RAW space, simulating physics-based illumination drop and sensor noise followed by an ISP-inspired rendering pipeline. We demonstrate the utility of DarkEQA by evaluating a wide range of state-of-the-art VLMs and Low-Light Image Enhancement (LLIE) models. Our analysis systematically reveals VLMs' limitations when operating under these challenging visual conditions. Project website: https://darkeqa-benchmark.github.io/</description>
