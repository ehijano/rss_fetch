      <title>Cosmological feedback from a halo assembly perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The impact of feedback from galaxy formation on cosmological probes is typically quantified in terms of the suppression of the matter power spectrum in hydrodynamical compared to gravity-only simulations. In this paper, we instead study how baryonic feedback impacts halo assembly histories and thereby imprints on cosmological observables. We investigate the sensitivity of the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect (tSZ) power spectrum, X-ray number counts, weak lensing and kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) stacked profiles to halo populations as a function of mass and redshift. We then study the imprint of different feedback implementations in the FLAMINGO suite of cosmological simulations on the assembly histories of these halo populations, as a function of radial scale. We find that kSZ profiles target lower-mass halos ($M_{\rm 200m}\sim 10^{13.1}\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$) compared to all other probes considered ($M_{200\mathrm{m}}\sim 10^{15}\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$). Feedback is inefficient in high-mass clusters with $\sim 10^{15} \, \mathrm{M}_\odot$ at $z=0$, but was more efficient at earlier times in the same population, with a $\sim 5$-$10\%$ effect on mass at $2&lt;z&lt;4$ (depending on radial scale). Conversely, for lower-mass halos with $\sim10^{13}\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$ at $z=0$, feedback exhibits a $\sim5$-$20\%$ effect on mass at $z=0$ but had little impact at earlier times ($z&gt;2$). These findings are tied together by noting that, regardless of redshift, feedback most efficiently redistributes baryons when halos reach a mass of $M_{\rm 200m} \simeq {10^{12.8}}\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ and ceases to have any significant effect by the time $M_{\rm 200m} \simeq {10^{15}}\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$. We put forward strategies for minimizing sensitivity of lensing analyses to baryonic feedback, and for exploring baryonic resolutions to the unexpectedly low tSZ power in cosmic microwave background observations.</description>

      <title>Addressing $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions within $f(Q)$ cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the viability of $f(Q)$ gravity as an alternative framework to address the $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions in cosmology. Focusing on three representative $f(Q)$ models, we perform a comprehensive Bayesian analysis using a combination of cosmological observations, including cosmic chronometers, Type Ia supernovae, gamma-ray bursts, baryon acoustic oscillations, and redshift-space distortions. Our results demonstrate that most of these models can yield higher values of $H_0$ than those predicted by $\Lambda$CDM, offering a partial alleviation of the tension. In addition, one model satisfies the condition $G_{\mathrm{eff}} &lt; G$ and predicts $S_8$ values consistent with weak lensing observations, making it a promising candidate for addressing the $S_8$ tension. However, these improvements are accompanied by mild internal inconsistencies between different subsets of data, which limit the overall statistical preference relative to $\Lambda$CDM. Despite this, $f(Q)$ gravity remains a promising and flexible framework for late-time cosmology, and our results motivate further exploration of extended or hybrid models that may reconcile all observational constraints.</description>

      <title>Minimal Plateau Inflation in light of ACT DR6 Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore a class of minimal plateau inflationary models constrained by the latest cosmological observations from ACT DR6, Planck 2018, BICEP/Keck 2018, and DESI, collectively referred to as P-ACT-LB-BK18. These models, characterized by a non-polynomial potential, are analyzed using both inflationary and post-inflationary reheating dynamics, and the limits on the viable model parameter space are obtained. Our results show that the minimal model with matter-like post inflationary reheating phase remains consistent with current data at both $1\sigma$ and $2\sigma$ levels. The inflaton potential's exponent $n$ and reheating epoch are intertwined in that upon its increase, corresponding to the stiffer reheating equation of state, the viable model parameter space in accordance with ACT shrinks, which is further facilitated by the primordial gravitational waves (PGWs) overproduction. We further explored a supergravity-inspired extension of the model under study with similar results, but with tighter constraints on the model parameters. These results emphasize the importance of jointly analyzing CMB data and reheating physics to test inflationary models.</description>

      <title>Radio Observations as a Probe of Cosmic Web Magnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Universe's magnetogenesis can be investigated with radio observations of cosmic filaments, where the information on the initial magnetic field seeds is expected to be preserved in time. In this work, we update the comparison between recent observational results in filaments with the predictions from recent cosmological simulations to check whether one of them is favoured. The radio probes we use are the rotation measure (RM) of filaments as a function of the redshift ($z$), stacking of synchrotron emission from filaments, and the RM radial profile away from galaxy groups. The first two probes favour the presence of a dominant primordial magnetic field component and disfavour a sole astrophysical scenario, the third probe does not yet give an unambiguous outcome. We also estimate the average field strength in filaments. Independently of the scenario and the shape of the astrophysical component RM, it is in the range 10--60 nG at $z=0$, while, when restricted to the model that gives the best match to the simulations, it gives $43\pm 7$ nG, with an astrophysical component RM rapidly decreasing with the redshift.</description>

      <title>Clustering analysis of BOSS-CMASS galaxies with semi-analytical model for galaxy formation and halo occupation distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spatial distribution and clustering property of massive and luminous galaxies have provided important constraints on the fundamental cosmological parameters and physical processes governing galaxy formation. In this work, we construct and compare independent galaxy-halo connection models in the application of clustering measurement at non-linear scales of BOSS-CMASS galaxies. In particular, we adopt a halo occupation distribution (HOD) model with 11 parameters and a semi-analytical model (SAM) with 16 parameters to describe the galaxy correlation function including the projected correlation function, redshift space monopole and quadrupole. We focus on the redshift space distortion effect caused by the galaxy peculiar velocity. With a empirical model for the velocity field and the emulator technique, we can explore the parameter space of both models. We find that the HOD model is able to recover the underlying velocity field of SAM with an accuracy of 3\%, and can be improved to 1\% when the analysis is restricted to scales above 1$h^{-1}$Mpc. The comparison is based on multiple samplings in the parameter space which can verify the convergence of the empirical and physical model for galaxy formation. Then we perform constraints on the model parameters using clustering measurement of CMASS galaxies. Although limited by the emulator accuracy and the flexibility of the model, we find that the clustering measurement is capable of constraining a subset of the SAM parameters, especially for components sensitive to the star formation rate. This result leads us to anticipate that a joint analysis of both clustering and abundance measurements can significantly constrain the parameters of galaxy formation physics, which requires further investigation from both theoretical and observational aspects.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Dark Energy at Late Time $\Lambda$CDM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamical properties of dark energy through a detailed analysis of its equation of state parameter $w(z)$ as a function of redshift. We derive a general expression for $w(z)$ from the Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) equations, establishing a direct relationship between the dark energy equation of state and the observable Hubble parameter $H(z)$ and its derivative. Using the relation $w(z) = -1 + \frac{2(1+z)}{3H(z)} \frac{dH}{dz}$, we develop an approximation method valid for $z \lesssim 1$ that accounts for the changing balance between matter and dark energy contributions to cosmic expansion. We compare our theoretical framework with recent observational data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) DR2, analysing how well the commonly used Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parametrization $w(z) = -1 + w_a \frac{z}{1+z}$ captures the evolution of dark energy. Our results indicate that the dark energy equation of state exhibits a monotonic evolution with redshift, transitioning from deceleration to acceleration around $z \approx 0.7$. Notably, our predicted $w_{\mathrm{DE}}$ remains greater than $-1$ across all redshifts, avoiding phantom energy scenarios that would violate the null energy condition. This work demonstrates how precise measurements of the cosmic expansion history can constrain the nature of dark energy and provides a framework for testing dynamical dark energy models against current and future cosmological observations.</description>

      <title>Examining Quintessence Models with DESI Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) collaboration which has implications for the nature of dark energy. We consider classes of models that manifestly obey the null energy condition, with a focus on quintessence models. We find that hilltop potentials and exponential potentials provide modest improvement compared to a cosmological constant, but the statistical evidence is only marginal at this stage. We correct some analyses in the existing literature which attempted to compare some quintessence models to the data, giving an overly positive result.</description>

      <title>On the Pipeline Dependence of DESI Dynamical Dark Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We continue scientific scrutiny of the DESI dynamical dark energy (DE) claim by explicitly demonstrating that the result depends on the analysis pipeline. Concretely, we define a likelihood that converts the $w_0 w_a$CDM model back into the flat $\Lambda$CDM model, which we fit to DESI constraints on the flat $\Lambda$CDM model from DR1 Full-Shape (FS) modelling and BAO. We further incorporate CMB constraints. Throughout, we find that $w_0$ and $w_a$ are within $1 \sigma$ of the flat $\Lambda$CDM Model. Our work makes it explicit that, in contrast to DR1 and DR2 BAO, there is no dynamical DE signal in FS modelling, even when combined with BAO and CMB. Moreover, one confirms late-time accelerated expansion today $(q_0 &lt; 0)$ at $ \gtrsim 3.4 \sigma$ in FS modelling+BAO. On the contrary, DR1 and DR2 BAO fail to confirm $q_0 &lt; 0$ under similar assumptions. Our analyses highlight the fact that trustable scientific results should be independent of the analysis pipeline.</description>

      <title>Origins of Supermassive Black Holes in Galactic Centers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direct imaging of black hole shadow halos has firmly confirmed the existence of supermassive black holes (SMBHs), with millions of solar masses, residing at the centers of the Milky Way and M87 galaxies. These groundbreaking discoveries represent a monumental success of Einstein's theory of general relativity and have revealed the hidden "monsters" lurking at the centers of galaxies. Moreover, observations of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) indicate that SMBHs with billions of solar masses were already in place within the first billion years after the Big Bang. However, the origins of these SMBHs, as well as their co-evolution with host galaxies, remain poorly understood. This review focuses on the origin of SMBHs, particularly on the formation of their seed black holes. We also highlight several outstanding challenges in modeling seed formation and discuss possible observational signatures. These signatures may be testable with current and future facilities, including the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and the upcoming gravitational wave observatory, the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA).</description>

      <title>Probing Time-Varying Dark Energy with DESI: The Crucial Role of Precision Matter Density ($\Omega_{m0}$) Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate measurements of fundamental cosmological parameters, especially the Hubble constant ($H_0$) and present-day matter density ($\Omega_{m0}$), are crucial for constraining dark energy (DE) evolution. We analyze the sensitivities of cosmological observables ($H(z)$, $D_L(z)$, $\EG$) to $\Omega_{m0}$, $\omega_0$, and $\omega_a$ under different parametrizations. Our results show observables are far more sensitive to $\Omega_{m0}$ than to DE equation of state parameters (e.g., at $z \sim 0.5$, $H(z)$'s $\Omega_{m0}$ sensitivity is $\sim 0.7$ vs. $\omega_a$'s $\sim 0.04$). This hierarchy mandates high-precision $\Omega_{m0}$ measurements to accurately constrain time-varying DE. We also find DE parameter sensitivity highly depends on parametrization; the standard CPL form shows low sensitivity to $\omega_a$, but $\omega(z) = \omega_0 + \omega_a \ln(1+z)$ significantly enhances it. Our analysis of DESI DR1/DR2 data confirms these theoretical limits: standalone DESI data primarily provides only upper limits for $\omega_a$, underscoring insufficient constraining power for a definitive time-varying DE detection. While combined datasets offer tighter constraints, interpretation requires caution due to parametrization influence. In conclusion, improving $\Omega_{m0}$ precision and adopting optimized parametrizations are imperative for future surveys like DESI to fully probe dark energy's nature.</description>

      <title>Testing cosmological principle under Copernican principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent observational analyses have revealed potential evidence for a preferred spatial direction in cosmological data. Such directional parameterization inherently places observers at a privileged spatial position, thereby conflicting with the Copernican principle and suffering from the look-elsewhere effect. To restore the Copernican principle which is the foundation of modern astronomy, we propose a stochastic framework for cosmological principle violations. The almost uniform temperature of cosmic microwave background suggests that the deviation of isotropy is negligible ($\lesssim 10^{-5}$ level) on the last scattering surface, which can be used as a zero boundary condition to construct an orthogonal basis below the redshift of recombination. The relative deviation from Hubble diagram of isotropic ($\Lambda$CDM or $w_0w_a$CDM) models is expanded with the orthogonal basis with a hierarchy of increasing resolution. Using this new approach, we test cosmological principle with type Ia supernovae, strong lens time delay, and gravitational-wave standard siren. The data sets are consistent with statistical isotropy on large scales.</description>

      <title>Geometric Determinations Of Characteristic Redshifts From DESI-DR2 BAO and DES-SN5YR Observations: Hints For New Expansion Rate Anomalies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we perform a model-agnostic reconstruction of the cosmic expansion history by combining DESI-DR2 BAO and DES-SN5YR data, with a focus on geometric determination of characteristic redshifts where notable tensions in the expansion rate are found to emerge. Employing Gaussian process regression alongside knot-based spline techniques, we reconstruct cosmic distances and their derivatives to pinpoint these characteristic redshifts and infer $E(z)$. Our analysis reveals significant deviations of approximately 4 to 5$\sigma$ from the Planck 2018 $\Lambda$CDM predictions, particularly pronounced in the redshift range $z \sim 0.35-0.55$. These anomalies are consistently observed across both reconstruction methods and combined datasets, indicating robust late-time departures that could signal new physics beyond the standard cosmological framework. The joint use of BAO and SN probes enhances the precision of our constraints, allowing us to isolate these deviations without reliance on specific cosmological assumptions. Our findings underscore the role of characteristic redshifts as sensitive indicators of expansion rate anomalies and motivate further scrutiny with forthcoming datasets from DESI-5YR BAO, Euclid, and LSST. These future surveys will tighten constraints and help distinguish whether these late-time anomalies arise from new fundamental physics or unresolved systematics in the data.</description>

      <title>Probing Memory-Burdened Primordial Black Holes with Galactic Sources observed by LHAASO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recently identified \textit{memory burden} effect has the potential to significantly decelerate the evaporation of black holes. Specifically, when approximately half of a black hole's initial mass has been radiated away, the evaporation process is halted. This mechanism allows very light primordial black holes (PBHs) with masses $m_{\rm PBH}&lt;10^{15}$ g to persist until the present day and may contribute to the dark matter (DM) content of the universe. In this work, we focus on PBHs with masses $\lesssim 10^{9}$ g. Due to the memory burden effect, these PBHs emit high-energy gamma-rays, which in turn alter the corresponding observed energy spectra. To investigate the constraints on the masses and DM abundance of PBHs, we analyze data from four Galactic sources measured by the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO), including the Crab Nebula, LHAASO J2226+6057, LHAASO J1908+0621, and LHAASO J1825-1326. Our findings indicate that the ultra-high-energy gamma-ray spectra from these Galactic sources provide crucial probes for light PBHs, thereby significantly constraining their potential contribution to DM.</description>

      <title>Probing dipolar power asymmetry with galaxy clustering and intrinsic alignments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the prospects for probing large-scale statistical anisotropy through galaxy clustering and intrinsic alignments (IA) in Stage IV galaxy surveys. Specifically, we consider a dipolar modulation in the primordial power spectrum and evaluate the Fisher information matrix using the two-point statistics of both the galaxy clustering and IA. Our analysis reveals that while IA alone provides limited improvement in constraining the anisotropy amplitude, the cross-spectrum between galaxy density and IA can contribute up to half the constraining power of galaxy clustering, especially for surveys with low galaxy bias and high number density of galaxies, such as Euclid. This demonstrates the potential of IA-clustering cross-correlations as a robust consistency check against systematics, and highlights the complementary roles of galaxy clustering and IA in constraining cosmic statistical anisotropy. We also show that marginalizing over galaxy bias and IA bias parameters has a negligible impact on the final constraint on the anisotropy amplitude.</description>

      <title>Comparative study of the strong backreaction regime in axion inflation: the effect of the potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent works have demonstrated the necessity of capturing the local inhomogeneous physics in axion inflation, and showed new genuine features, most notably the extension of the inflationary period dictated by an electromagnetic slow-roll phase. In this work, we further investigate the model by performing a systematic study of the effect of the inflationary potential in the dynamics during the strong backreaction regime. The results indicate that the novel features associated with the local backreaction are universal and intrinsic to the model, hence independent on the choice of inflationary potential. We find that the main quantitative differences between the different choices manifest in the lengthening of inflation. We discuss the possible observational impact of this. Finally, we assess the possible reconciliation of the homogeneous backreaction method with fully inhomogeneous lattice techniques, and obtain that the former fails to provide a correct description for the regime studied in this work.</description>

      <title>Viability of general relativity and modified gravity cosmologies using high-redshift cosmic probes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several models based on General Relativity and Modified Gravity aim to reproduce the observed universe with precision comparable to the standard flat-$\Lambda$CDM model. In this study, we investigate the consistency of some of these models with current high-redshift cosmic data, assessing their ability to simultaneously describe both the background expansion and matter clustering, using measurements of the Hubble parameter $H(z)$, the luminosity distance $D_L(z)$, and the growth rate of structures $[f\sigma_8](z)$ through parametric and non-parametric methods. Our results indicate that background observables alone offer limited capacity to distinguish between models, while the inclusion of growth of structures data proves useful in revealing deviations, even if small. An $F(Q)$ model, the non-flat $\Lambda$CDM and the $\omega$CDM emerge as alternatives well supported by data, closely matching the growth data and showing performance comparable to $\Lambda$CDM, as revealed by the Akaike Information Criterion. In contrast, $F(R)$ models are strongly disfavored compared to $\Lambda$CDM and $F(Q)$. These analyses illustrate the usefulness of both parametric and non-parametric approaches to explore the observational viability of alternative cosmological models.</description>

      <title>On the detection of caustic crossing events associated with dark matter in the form of primordial black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The possibility that stellar mass primordial black holes may make up at least a significant fraction of dark matter has recently received much attention, partly as a result of gravitational wave observations, but more specifically from observations of microlensing in the Galactic halo and in quasar gravitational lens systems. If this is the case then a number of observable consequences are to be expected. This paper focusses on the prediction that dark matter in the form of primordial black holes will result in a web of caustics which when traversed by quasars will result in a complex but characteristic amplification of the accretion disc light source. Caustic crossings produce features in quasar light curves which are relatively straightforward to identify, and are hard to associate with any intrinsic mode of variation. Microlensing simulations are used to clarify the nature of the expected light curve features, and compared with observed light curves to demonstrate that caustic crossing features can be present. A further test of microlensing is based on the expected statistical symmetry of the light curves, which is not predicted for most models of intrinsic quasar variability, but is found in large samples of quasar light curves. The conclusion of the paper is that observations of quasar light curves are consistent with the expected microlensing amplifications from dark matter made up of stellar mass primordial black holes, but cannot easily be explained by intrinsic variations of the quasar accretion disc.</description>

      <title>A frequentist view on the two-body decaying dark matter model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decaying dark matter (DDM) has emerged as an interesting framework to extend the Lambda-cold-dark-matter (LCDM) model, as many particle physics models predict that dark matter may not be stable over cosmic time and can impact structure formation. In particular, a model in which DM decays at a rate $\Gamma$ and imprints a velocity kick $v$ onto its decay products leads to a low amplitude of fluctuations, as quantified by the parameter $S_8$, in better agreement with that measured by some past weak lensing surveys. Bayesian analyses have provided mixed conclusions regarding its viability, with a reconstructed clustering amplitude only slightly below the standard LCDM value. In this paper, we perform a frequentist analysis of Planck+BAO data. We find $1\sigma$ constraints on the half-life of $6.93^{+7.88}_{-2.85}$Gyr and a velocity kick of $1250^{+1450}_{-1000}$km/s which differ from their Bayesian counterparts, indicating the presence of volume effects. Moreover, we find that under the DDM model, the frequentist analysis predicts lower values of $S_8$, in agreement with those found by KiDS-1000 and DES-Y3 at $1.5\sigma$. We further show that previously derived KiDS-1000 constraints that appeared to exclude the best-fit model from Planck data were driven by priors on the primordial parameters $A_s$ and $n_s$. When those are removed from the analysis, KiDS-1000 constraints on the DDM parameters are fully relaxed. It is only when applying Planck-informed priors on $A_s$ and $n_s$ to the KiDS-1000 analysis that one can constrain the model. We further highlight that in the absence of such priors, the region of scales best-measured by KiDS-1000 does not exactly match the $S_8$ kernel, but rather a slightly smaller range of scales centered around $k\sim 0.3\, h/$Mpc. One must thus be careful in applying $S_8$ constraints to a model instead of the full data likelihood.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Evolutions in Globular Clusters and Dwarf Galaxies: Conduction Fluid Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new two-fluid conduction scheme to simulate the evolution of an isolated, self-gravitating, equilibrium cluster of stars and collisionless dark matter on secular (gravothermal) timescales. We integrate the equations in Lagrangian coordinates via a second-order, semi-implicit algorithm, which is unconditionally stable when the mass of the lighter species is much less than that of the heavier species. The method can be straightforwardly generalized to handle a multi-species system with a population of stars or components beyond collisionless dark matter and stars. We apply the method to simulate the dynamical evolution of stellar-dark matter systems, exploring the consequences of mass segregation and gravothermal core collapse, and assessing those effects for observed globular clusters and dwarf galaxies in the Local Volume.</description>

      <title>Insights on the Cosmic Origin of Matter from Proton Stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the phenomenology of a model in which the proton is rendered absolutely stable by an IR mechanism that remains robust against unknown quantum gravity effects. A linear combination of baryon number and lepton flavors is gauged and spontaneously broken to a residual $\mathbb{Z}_9$ discrete gauge symmetry enforcing a strict selection rule: $\Delta B = 0\,(\mathrm{mod}\,3)$. Despite its minimal field content, the model successfully accounts for established empirical evidence of physics beyond the SM. High-scale symmetry breaking simultaneously provides a seesaw mechanism explaining the smallness of neutrino masses, minimal thermal leptogenesis, and a viable phenomenology of the majoron as dark matter. Any cosmic string-wall network remaining after inflation is unstable for numerous charge assignments. Lepton flavor non-universality, central to the construction, leads to predictive neutrino textures testable via oscillation experiments, neutrinoless double beta decay, and cosmology. The model motivates searches in $X$- and $\gamma$-ray lines, neutrino telescopes, and predicts CMB imprints.</description>

      <title>Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet-Myrzakulov Gravity from $R + F(T, G)$: Numerical Insights and Torsion-Gauss-Bonnet Dynamics in Weitzenb\"ock Spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of modified gravity models has garnered significant attention because of their potential to provide alternative explanations for cosmological phenomena, such as the accelerated expansion of the universe and the nature of dark energy. One such model, the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet-Myrzakulov $R + F(T, G)$ gravity (EGBMG), which incorporates the curvature $R$, torsion $T$, and the Gauss-Bonnet term $G$, offers a promising framework to explore the dynamics of the universe and its evolution. This paper delves into the theoretical and observational implications of the EGBMG model, focusing on its ability to address long-standing challenges in cosmology, including the evolution of dark energy and the transition from early-time inflationary behavior to late-time acceleration. We review recent advancements in the model, including its compatibility with observational data and its ability to provide new insights into cosmic acceleration. Through a combination of theoretical models, dynamical systems analysis, and cosmological diagnostics, we demonstrate the robustness of the EGBMG framework in explaining the large-scale structure of the universe and its accelerated expansion. This paper serves as a step toward further exploring the potential of this model to understand the fundamental forces driving Weitzenb$\"{o}$ck spacetime.</description>

Abstract: The strong evidence for low-frequency gravitational waves from pulsar timing arrays (PTAs), published in 2023, has widened the scope for teaching about gravitational wave astronomy. This article provides a simple, unified overview of the detection of gravitational waves using light waves that encompasses the recent PTA detections, the by-now classic interferometric detections using LIGO and similar detectors, and the yet-to-be-accomplished detections using long-arm detectors like the spaceborne LISA. The presentation is at a level accessible for undergraduate students. The influence of gravitational waves on light is derived in a way that makes use only of basic gravitational wave properties and Einstein's equivalence principle.</description>

      <title>Formation of Supersonic Turbulence in the Primordial Star-forming Cloud</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present new simulations of the formation and evolution of the first star-forming cloud within a massive minihalo of mass of $1.05 \times 10^7\, M_{\odot}$, carried out using the GIZMO code with detailed modeling of primordial gas cooling and chemistry. Unlike previous studies that simulated the formation of the first stars within a smaller cosmological boxsize of $\sim 1-2$ Mpc, our work adopts initial conditions from the large-scale cosmological simulations, IllustrisTNG spanning $\sim 50$ Mpc to study the formation of primordial clouds that give birth to the first stars. We increase the original resolution of IllustrisTNG by a factor of $\sim10^5$ using a particle-splitting technique, achieving an extremely high resolution that allows us to resolve turbulence driven by gravitational collapse during early structure formation. We find that strong supersonic turbulence with a characteristic Mach number of $\sim 5.2$ naturally develops within the collapsing halo. This turbulence efficiently stirs the gas, promoting fragmentation of the star-forming cloud into multiple dense clumps. Among them, we identify a gravitationally bound core with a mass of $8.07\,M_{\odot}$ and a size of $0.03$ pc, which exceeds its local Jeans mass and is on the verge of collapsing into a star. Our results indicate that supersonic turbulence may be common in primordial halos and can play a crucial role in cloud-scale fragmentation, potentially lowering the characteristic mass scale of the first stars.</description>

      <title>On the full non-Gaussian Surprise statistic and the cosmological concordance between DESI, SDSS and Pantheon+</title>

Abstract: With the increasing precision of recent cosmological surveys and the discovery of important tensions within the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm, it is becoming more and more important to develop tools to quantify accurately the discordance between different probes. One such tool is the Surprise statistic, a measure based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence. The Surprise, however, has been up to now applied only under its Gaussian approximation, which can fail to properly capture discordance in cases that deviate significantly from Gaussianity. In this paper we developed the \texttt{klsurprise} code which computes the full numerical non-Gaussian Surprise, and analyse the Surprise for BAO + BBN and supernova data. We test different cosmological models, some of which the parameters deviate significantly from Gaussianity. We find that the non-Gaussianities, mainly present in the Supernova dataset, change the Surprise values significantly from its Gaussian approximation, and reveal a borderline $2.0\sigma$ tension in the curved $w$CDM model (o$w$CDM) between the combined Pantheon+ and SH0ES (Pantheon+ &amp; SH0ES) data and the dataset which combines SDSS, BOSS and eBOSS BAO. This modest tension is hidden in the Gaussian Surprise approximation. For DESI, the discrepancy with Pantheon+ &amp; SH0ES is at the $1.5\sigma$ level for o$w$CDM, but a large $3.4\sigma$ for $\Lambda$CDM. Removing SH0ES data drops the $\Lambda$CDM significance to $2.6\sigma$.</description>

      <title>The multi-dimensional halo assembly bias can be preserved when enhancing halo properties with HALOSCOPE</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07361v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Over $90$\% of dark matter haloes in cosmological simulations have unresolved properties. This can hinder the dynamical range of simulations and result in systematic biases when modelling cosmological tracers. We aim to more precisely determine unresolved structural and dynamical halo properties while preserving the correlations with environment and halo assembly bias found in simulations. We have developed HALOSCOPE, a machine learning technique that uses multi-variate conditional probability distribution functions. This method ensures that correlations among various halo properties, as well as their dependence on the local environment, are preserved. In this work, we trained HALOSCOPE with a high-resolution (HR) simulation and used it to better determine the properties (concentration, spin, and two shape parameters) of unresolved dark matter haloes in an eight times lower resolution simulation. HALOSCOPE is able to recover the multi-dimensional halo assembly bias, that is, the correlations of different combinations of halo properties with the large-scale environment, measured in the HR simulation. This is achieved by including the linear halo-by-halo bias and tidal anisotropy in the set of input training parameters. HALOSCOPE, by design, also recovers the joint distribution of the halo properties. To study how resolution effects propagate into the clustering of model galaxies, we generated catalogues of central galaxies using two implementations of the assembly bias in a halo occupation distribution model. The clustering of central model galaxies is improved by a factor of three at $0.009&lt;k ({\rm Mpc}^{-1}h)&lt;0.6$ when the unresolved haloes are enhanced with HALOSCOPE. HALOSCOPE can improve the accuracy of cosmological tracer catalogues produced with approximate methods when many realisations are needed.</description>

      <title>Improving Galaxy Cluster Selection with the Outskirt Stellar Mass of Galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20205v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The number density and redshift evolution of optically selected galaxy clusters offer an independent measurement of the amplitude of matter fluctuations, $S_8$. However, recent results have shown that clusters chosen by the redMaPPer algorithm show richness-dependent biases that affect the weak lensing signals and number densities of clusters, increasing uncertainty in the cluster mass calibration and reducing their constraining power. In this work, we evaluate an alternative cluster proxy, outskirt stellar mass, $M_{\textrm{out}}$, defined as the total stellar mass within a $[50,100]$ kpc envelope centered on a massive galaxy. This proxy exhibits scatter comparable to redMaPPer richness, $\lambda$, but is less likely to be subject to projection effects. We compare the Dark Energy Survey Year 3 redMaPPer cluster catalog with a $M_{\textrm{out}}$ selected cluster sample from the Hyper-Suprime Camera survey. We use weak lensing measurements to quantify and compare the scatter of $M_{\textrm{out}}$ and $\lambda$ with halo mass. Our results show $M_{\textrm{out}}$ has a scatter consistent with $\lambda$, with a similar halo mass dependence, and that both proxies contain unique information about the underlying halo mass. We find $\lambda$-selected samples introduce features into the measured $\Delta \Sigma$ signal that are not well fit by a log-normal scatter only model, absent in $M_{\textrm{out}}$ selected samples. Our findings suggest that $M_{\textrm{out}}$ offers an alternative for cluster selection with more easily calibrated selection biases, at least at the generally lower richnesses probed here. Combining both proxies may yield a mass proxy with a lower scatter and more tractable selection biases, enabling the use of lower mass clusters in cosmology. Finally, we find the scatter and slope in the $\lambda-M_{\textrm{out}}$ scaling relation to be $0.49 \pm 0.02$ and $0.38 \pm 0.09$.</description>

      <title>Vortices and rotating solitons in ultralight dark matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02297v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dynamics of ultralight dark matter with non-negligible self-interactions are determined by a nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation rather than by the Vlasov equation of collisionless particles. This leads to wave-like effects, such as interferences, the formation of solitons, and a velocity field that is locally curl-free, implying that vorticity is carried by singularities associated with vortices. Using analytical derivations and numerical simulations in 2D, we study the evolution of such a system from stochastic initial conditions with nonzero angular momentum. Focusing on the Thomas-Fermi regime, where the de Broglie wavelength of the system is smaller than its size, we show that a rotating soliton forms in a few dynamical times. The rotation is not associated with a large orbital quantum number of the wave function. Instead, it is generated by a regular lattice of vortices that gives rise to a solid-body rotation in the continuum limit. Such rotating solitons have a maximal radius and rotation rate for a given central density, while the vortices follow the matter flow on circular orbits. We show that this configuration is a stable minimum of the energy at fixed angular momentum and we check that the numerical results agree with the analytical derivations. We expect most of these properties to extend to the 3D case where point vortices would be replaced by vortex rings.</description>

      <title>Curvature perturbations from vacuum transition during inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01632v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that in the presence of a light scalar spectator field, vacuum transitions taking place during inflation can produce large, potentially detectable non-Gaussian signatures in the primordial curvature perturbation. Such transitions are common in theories with multiple scalar fields when the potential has several minima. Our computation proceeds by numerically finding the instanton solution that describes quantum tunnelling between vacuum states in a de Sitter background, calculating its dependence on the spectator field and, thereby, its effect on the expansion of space. For a scenario with Higgs inflation, we obtain the non-Gaussianity parameter $f_\mathrm{NL} \sim O(10)$ and study its parameter dependence.</description>

      <title>Observable Primordial Gravitational Waves from Non-minimally Coupled $R^2$ Palatini Modified Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03573v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We probe the spectrum of primordial gravitational waves (GWs) produced during the eras of hyperkination, kination, and reheating in a non-minimally coupled, $\mathcal{L} \propto (1+ \xi \chi /M_{\text{Pl}})^t (R+\alpha R^2)$, modified gravity using the Palatini formulation. We consider a runaway potential, which gives an era of kinetic domination after the end of inflation. The coupling order $t$ is varied to examine a large class of theories up to $\chi^2 R^2$. For models with $t&gt;0$, reheating is not achieved naturally; hence, we supplement such theories with a reheating mechanism based on the interaction of inflaton and radiation produced at the end of inflation due to cosmological expansion. We demonstrate that the energy density of the GWs is enhanced as a function of the coupling during kination for all considered theories, and a short-lived phase of hyperkination truncates the boost and avoids the over-production of GWs. Hyperkination, and thus the $R^2$ term, should be deemed necessary in all theories with a runaway potential as it prevents the GW enhancement during kination from destabilizing the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis. The spectrum remains flat for the period of hyperkination and reheating. We examine the available parameter space for which the theories remain valid and place bounds on the Hubble parameter ($H$) and radiation energy density ($\Omega_r^{\text{end}}$) at the end of inflation. We find that as we decrease the order of the coupling, the spectra shift towards a more observable regime of future GW experiments. The observation of the plateau during reheating will constrain the $H$ and $\Omega_r^{\text{end}}$ values, while the spectral shape of the boost obtained during kination will confirm the nature of the theory. The bounds from hyperkination lie in the kHz-GHz frequency range.</description>

      <title>3D Vortices and rotating solitons in ultralight dark matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12100v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the formation and the dynamics of vortex lines in rotating scalar dark matter halos, focusing on models with quartic repulsive self-interactions. In the nonrelativistic regime, vortex lines and their lattices arise from the Gross-Pitaevskii equation of motion, as for superfluids and Bose-Einstein condensates studied in laboratory experiments. Indeed, in such systems vorticity is supported by the singularities of the phase of the scalar field, which leads to a discrete set of quantized vortices amid a curl-free velocity background. In the continuum limit where the number of vortex lines becomes very large, we find that the equilibrium solution is a rotating soliton that obeys a solid-body rotation, with an oblate density profile aligned with the direction of the total spin. This configuration is dynamically stable provided the rotational energy is smaller than the self-interaction and gravitational energies. Using numerical simulations in the Thomas-Fermi regime, with stochastic initial conditions for a spherical halo with a specific averaged density profile and angular momentum, we find that a rotating soliton always emerges dynamically, within a few dynamical times, and that a network of vortex lines aligned with the total spin fills its oblate profile. These vertical vortex lines form a regular lattice in the equatorial plane, in agreement with the analytical predictions of uniform vortex density and solid-body rotation. These vortex lines might further extend between halos to form the backbone of spinning cosmic filaments.</description>

      <title>Dark sirens and the impact of redshift precision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17747v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the growing number of gravitational wave detections, achieving a competitive measurement of $H_0$ with dark sirens is becoming increasingly feasible. The expansion of the Ligo-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration into a four detector network will reduce both the localisation area and the luminosity distance uncertainty associated with each gravitational wave event. It is therefore essential to identify and mitigate other major sources of error that could increase the uncertainty in $H_0$. In this work, we explore three scenarios relevant to the dark siren method in future observing runs. First, we demonstrate that there is a precision gain offered by a catalogue of spectroscopic-like redshifts compared to photometric-like redshifts, with the greatest improvements observed in smaller localisation areas. Second, we show that redshift outliers (as occur in realistic photometric redshift catalogues), do not introduce bias into the measurement of $H_0$. Finally, we find that uniformly sub-sampling spectroscopic-like redshift catalogues increases the uncertainty in $H_0$ as the completeness fraction is decreased; at a completeness of 50% the benefit of spectroscopic redshift precision is outweighed by the degradation from incompleteness. In all three scenarios, we obtain unbiased estimates of $H_0$. We conclude that a competitive measurement of $H_0$ using the dark siren method will require a hybrid catalogue of both photometric and spectroscopic redshifts, at least until highly complete spectroscopic catalogues become available.</description>

      <title>Improving Cosmic Birefringence Constraints via Delensing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04708v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a study on using delensing to enhance cosmic birefringence measurements based on full-sky, map-based simulations. In our analysis, we neglect foreground contamination and instrumental systematics to isolate the intrinsic impact of delensing on both isotropic and anisotropic birefringence. For the isotropic case, assuming a constant rotation angle of $\beta = 0.35^\circ$, delensing reduces the lensing-induced variance in the EB power spectrum, yielding an improvement in sensitivity of approximately 10% at 6 $\mu$K-arcmin noise and 25-40% at lower noise levels. For the anisotropic case, using simulations at 1 $\mu$K-arcmin noise, we reconstruct the birefringence angle for a scale-invariant spectrum and mitigate lensing bias by delensing, achieving a 50% reduction in the leading $N_{(0)}$ bias and a 30% improvement in the constraints on the amplitude $A_{CB}$. Our results demonstrate that delensing is an effective tool for enhancing the detectability of subtle parity-violating signals in the cosmic microwave background with forthcoming experiments such as the Simons Observatory, CMB-S4, and LiteBIRD.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Dark Energy Emerges from Massive Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03870v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we demonstrate that a dynamical dark energy component predicted by massive gravity gives rise to a distinctive evolution of the equation of state. This scenario is favoured over the standard $\Lambda$CDM model when confronted with the latest combined datasets from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), the cosmic microwave background (CMB), and supernova observations. The model stands out as a rare example of a healthy, self-consistent theory that accommodates phantom dark energy while maintaining a technically natural, small asymptotic cosmological constant. Our analysis indicates a preferred graviton mass of approximately $4.0 \times 10^{-33} \text{eV}$, suggesting the emergence of a new cosmological length scale. This leads to a maximal deviation of the equation of state around $z \sim 3$, a prediction that will be robustly tested by upcoming, deeper surveys of baryon acoustic oscillations.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Power Spectrum: A New Framework for Non-Stationary Fields with Applications to Light-Cone Effects in Line Intensity Mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09674v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern cosmological surveys cover extremely large volumes and map fluctuations on scales reaching gigaparsecs. As a result, it is no longer a valid assumption to ignore cosmological evolution along the line of sight from one end of the survey to the other. When extracting cosmological information, the power spectrum becomes suboptimal because it relies on the assumption of translational invariance of the observed field. For example, during the Epoch of Reionization (EoR), the 21cm brightness temperature field on the nearby (low-redshift) end of a large survey volume exhibits statistical properties that differ significantly from those at far (high-redshift) end. To overcome these limitations, we have developed a eigen decomposition-inspired non-Fourier basis that captures evolution effects. Our work demonstrates that using this new basis integrated in a new summary statistic yields tighter constraints on astrophysical parameters compared to the traditional power spectrum. Additionally, we provide an illustrative example and a practical guide for applying this basis in the context of a realistic forecast for interferometers such as the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13420v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Primordial scalar perturbations that reenter the horizon after inflation may induce a second-order Gravitational Wave spectrum with information about the primordial Universe on scales inaccessible to Cosmic Microwave Background experiments. In this work, we develop a general framework for the study of Scalar-Induced Gravitational Waves in Palatini $f(R)$ gravity, a theory that was proven to successfully realise inflation and quintessence, and consider the case of the Starobinsky-like model as an example. A regime of radiation domination with a subdominant matter component is assumed, allowing for a well-motivated perturbative approach to the gravity modifications. We calculate the kernel function and the density spectrum numerically and find accurate analytical expressions. The spectral density, which may be tested across a wide range of frequencies by upcoming Gravitational Wave experiments, is shown to differ from the General Relativity and metric $f(R)$ gravity predictions under certain conditions. We comment on previous results in the literature regarding the metric formulation and make special emphasis on the potential of these distinctive features of the spectrum to probe the two formalisms of gravity.</description>

      <title>Clustering and physical properties of AGN and Star-Forming Galaxies at fixed stellar mass: does assembly bias have a role in AGN activity?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.12943v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze a volume-limited sample from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) to compare the spatial clustering and physical properties of active galactic nuclei (AGN) and star-forming galaxies (SFG) at fixed stellar mass. We find no statistically significant difference in clustering strength or local density between AGN and SFG. However, after matching their stellar mass distributions, we detect statistically significant differences (at a confidence level $&gt;99.99\%$) in colour, star formation rate (SFR), $4000\r{A}$ break measurements (D$4000$), and morphology. These differences persist across both low- and high-density environments, suggesting that AGN are not driven by environmental factors. The development of favourable conditions for AGN activity within a galaxy may depend on the diverse evolutionary histories of galaxies. Our results imply that AGN activity may arise stochastically, modulated by the complex assembly history of galaxies.</description>

      <title>Direct Detection of Dark Photon Dark Matter with the James Webb Space Telescope</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17140v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we propose an investigation into dark photon dark matter (DPDM) within the infrared frequency band, utilizing highly sensitive infrared light detectors commonly integrated into space telescopes, such as the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). The presence of DPDM induces electron oscillations in both the reflectors and the interior of the detectors. Consequently, these oscillating electrons can emit monochromatic electromagnetic waves with a frequency almost equivalent to the mass of DPDM. By estimating the signal generated by DPDM inside the detector and comparing with observation data, we establish constraints on the kinetic mixing between the photon and dark photon within the range [10, 500] THz. Despite JWST not being optimized for DPDM searches, our findings reveal constraints comparable to those obtained from the XENON1T experiment in the laboratory, as well as astrophysical constraints from solar emission. Additionally, we propose to modify the configuration of JWST optical elements to focus the DPDM induced signal onto the detector. By employing the stationary phase approximation, we can demonstrate that when the size of the reflector significantly exceeds the wavelength of the electromagnetic wave, the contribution to the electromagnetic wave field at a given position primarily stems from the surface unit perpendicular to the relative position vector. This simplification results in the reduction of electromagnetic wave calculations to ray optics. We show that by rearranging the position of reflectors, JWST can achieve a sensitivity stronger than the existing limits by 1 or 2 orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Resonant or asymmetric: The status of sub-GeV dark matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17548v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sub-GeV dark matter (DM) particles produced via thermal freeze-out evade many of the strong constraints on heavier DM candidates but at the same time face a multitude of new constraints from laboratory experiments, astrophysical observations and cosmological data. In this work we combine all of these constraints in order to perform frequentist and Bayesian global analyses of fermionic and scalar sub-GeV DM coupled to a dark photon with kinetic mixing. For fermionic DM, we find viable parameter regions close to the dark photon resonance, which expand significantly when including a particle-antiparticle asymmetry. For scalar DM, the velocity-dependent annihilation cross section evades the strongest constraints even in the symmetric case. Using Bayesian model comparison, we show that both asymmetric fermionic DM and symmetric scalar DM are preferred over symmetric fermionic DM due to the reduced fine-tuning penalty. Finally, we explore the discovery prospects of near-future experiments both in the full parameter space and for specific benchmark points. We find that the most commonly used benchmark scenarios are already in tension with existing constraints and propose a new benchmark point that can be targeted with future searches.</description>

      <title>Cosmology of Quasi-Dilaton Massive Gravity with Non-minimal Kinetic Coupling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17915v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we introduce an extension of the quasi-dilaton massive gravity theory and derive the field equations by varying the action with respect to the metric. This extension elucidates the dynamics of the system and demonstrates how it can encompass and recover previous cosmological models through different parameter values. We present the cosmological background equations to analyze self-accelerating solutions that can explain the late-time accelerated expansion of the Universe, driven by an effective cosmological constant arising from massive gravity. Besides, we apply the quasi-dilaton massive gravity theory with non-minimal kinetic coupling to a Type Ia Supernovae (SNIa) data set to test its viability. Our findings indicate that the theory is able to account for the observed acceleration of the expansion of the universe without invoking dark energy. In addition, we carry out a comprehensive perturbation analysis examining tensor, vector, and scalar perturbations independently. We derive the dispersion relation of gravitational waves in a Friedman-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) cosmology and determine the stability conditions of the system. Such an analysis results in a sharper quasi-dilaton massive gravity theory with non-minimal kinetic coupling by ensuring the stability conditions of the system are maintained and that strong constraints on theory parameters are provided.</description>

      <title>Elementary considerations on possible entropy-driven cosmological evolutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15146v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For several independent reasons, the idea that notorious sources of entropy could exist in the Universe has been recently revived. Taking advantage of a new framework accounting for non-equilibrium processes in cosmology, we explicitly investigate the cosmological dynamics as a function of the entropy production, focusing on the stability of the system. An exhaustive investigation is performed. As the main physical conclusion, we show that for a wide class of entropy source terms, the fluid dynamics converges towards an effective cosmological constant. Constraints on the associated entropic force are also obtained.</description>

      <title>Primordial black holes as cosmic expansion accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18352v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel and natural mechanism for cosmic acceleration driven by primordial black holes (PBHs) exhibiting repulsive behavior. Using a new ``Swiss Cheese'' cosmological approach, we demonstrate that this cosmic acceleration mechanism is a general phenomenon by examining three regular black hole spacetimes - namely the Hayward, Bardeen and Dymnikova spacetimes - as well as the singular de Sitter-Schwarzschild spacetime. Interestingly, by matching these black hole spacetimes with an isotropic and homogeneous expanding Universe, we obtain a phase of cosmic acceleration that ends at an energy scale characteristic to the black hole parameters or due to black hole evaporation. This cosmic acceleration mechanism can be relevant either to an inflationary phase with a graceful exit and reheating or to an early dark energy type of contribution pertinent to the Hubble tension. Remarkably, we find that ultra-light PBHs with masses $m&lt;5\times 10^8\mathrm{g}$ dominating the energy content of the Univese before Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, can drive a successful inflationary expansion era without the use of an inflaton field. Additionally, PBHs with masses $m \sim 10^{12}\mathrm{g}$ and abundances $0.107 &lt; \Omega^\mathrm{eq}_\mathrm{PBH}&lt; 0.5$, slightly before matter-radiation equality, can produce a substantial amount of early dark energy, helping to alleviate the $H_0$ tension.</description>

      <title>GD-1 and the Milky Way Starless Subhalos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13290v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Measurements of the GD-1 star stream velocity distribution within $\pm$3 degrees of the centerline find a total line of sight velocity spread of 5-6 km/s in the well measured $\phi_1=$ [-30, 0] region (Valluri25). The velocity spread is far above the $\sim$2-3 km/s of a dissolved globular cluster in a smooth galactic potential. The dynamical heating of the GD-1 star stream is simulated in an evolving model Milky Way potential which includes the subhalos extracted from cosmological CDM and WDM Milky Way-like halos. The model bridges fully cosmological Milky Way-like halos and late time static Milky Way potentials allowing individual streams to be accurately integrated. An evolving CDM subhalo population acting for $\sim$11 Gyr heats GD-1 to 6.2 km/s. The WDM (7 keV and lighter) models develop a velocity dispersion of 3.9 km/s, only slightly greater than the 3.5 km/s in an evolving smooth halo without subhalos for 11 Gyr. The dynamical age of the best model stream is close to the isochrone age of the stars in the stream. Subhalos with masses in the decade around $10^{7.5} M_\odot$, below the mass range of dwarf galaxies, dominate the dynamical stream heating.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter (S)pins the Planet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17206v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dark matter heating in planets has been proposed as a potential probe for dark matter detection. Assuming near-equilibrium conditions, we find that the energy input from dark matter raises planetary temperatures and accelerates rotation. The distribution of energy between heating and rotational acceleration depends on both planetary properties and external inputs, suggesting that previous studies may have overestimated the heating contribution. At high dark matter densities, planetary rotation stabilizes earlier and becomes primarily governed by dark matter effects.</description>

      <title>How do Massive Primordial Black Holes Impact the Formation of the First Stars and Galaxies?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17585v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of massive primordial black holes (PBHs; $m_{\rm BH}\sim 10^6~M_{\odot}$) on the star formation and first galaxy assembly process using high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations from $z = 1100$ to $z \sim 9$. We find that PBH accretion is self-regulated by feedback, suppressing mass growth unless feedback is weak. PBHs accelerate structure formation by seeding dark matter halos and gravitationally attracting gas, but strong feedback can delay cooling and suppress star formation. In addition, the presence of baryon-dark matter streaming creates an offset between the PBH location and the peaks induced in gas density, promoting earlier and more efficient star formation compared to standard $\Lambda$CDM. By $z \sim 10$, PBH-seeded galaxies form dense star clusters, with PBH-to-stellar mass ratios comparable to observed high-$z$ AGN like UHZ-1. Our results support PBHs as viable SMBH seeds but do not exclude alternative scenarios. We emphasize that PBH-seeding provides a natural explanation for some of the newly-discovered overmassive SMBHs at high redshift, in particular those with extreme ratios of BH-to-dynamical (virial) mass that challenge standard formation channels. Future studies with ultra-deep JWST surveys, the Roman Space Telescope, and radio surveys with facilities such as SKA and HERA will be critical in distinguishing PBH-driven SMBH growth from other pathways.</description>

      <title>Consistency relations between multimessenger and large scale structure observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04574v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The effective field theory (EFT) of dark energy provides a unified model independent theoretical framework to study the effects of dark energy and modified gravity. We show that applying the EFT to Horndeski theories it is possible to derive consistency relations (CR) between physically observable quantities, valid for different classes of theories defined by the brading parameter behavior, while leaving the other property functions free. As expected, the CRs are also valid for general relativity, and relate the effective gravitational constant, the slip parameter, the gravitational and electromagnetic luminosity distances and the speed of gravitational waves (GW). We apply the CRs to map the large scale structure observational constraints on the effective gravitational constant and the slip parameter to GW-EMW distance ratio constraints. The CRs allow to probe the value of the effective gravitational constant and the slip parameter with multimessenger observations, independently from large scale structure observations.</description>

      <title>Primordial black hole-star binaries via dynamical friction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05564v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a new channel for binary system formation involving stars and stellar-mass primordial black holes (PBHs) embedded in dark matter (DM) minihalos. In this scenario, binaries form when a star passes through the DM minihalo surrounding a PBH and loses sufficient energy due to dynamical friction. The continued energy loss induced by this friction is expected to drive the resulting systems to merge rapidly. We estimate their merger rate and explore the implications for two observables: rapidly decaying X-ray binaries in the Milky Way and gravitational waves sourced by compact object mergers. We find that this mechanism naturally produces a population of O(1) currently observable short-lived X-ray binaries. It also leads to a non-negligible gravitational wave event rate of O(0.3) Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$, potentially involving high mass ratios and black holes in the lower or upper mass gap. This dynamical friction channel thus offers a plausible explanation for several unusual observations reported in recent years across both the X-ray and gravitational wave domains.</description>

      <title>Curvature corrections to Starobinsky inflation can explain the ACT results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10305v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of curvature corrections to Starobinsky inflation in light of the latest observational results from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT). While the pure Starobinsky model remains a compelling candidate for cosmic inflation, we explore how the higher-order curvature terms $R^3$, $R^{4}$ and $R^{3/2}$ modify the inflationary predictions. Using the scalar-tensor formulation of $f(R)$ gravity, we derive the effective scalar potentials and compute the resulting scalar tilt $n_s$, its running index $\alpha_s$ and the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$. We show that those curvature corrections can shift the predictions to align better with the ACT data, thus providing a possible resolution to a minor discrepancy between the standard Starobinsky model and ACT observations. Our findings suggest that the modified Starobinsky models with the higher-order curvature terms offer a viable pathway to reconciling inflationary predictions with precision cosmological measurements. At the same time, measuring or constraining primordial tensor modes can help to discriminate between these corrections.</description>
