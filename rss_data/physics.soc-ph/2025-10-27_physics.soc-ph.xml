      <title>The geography of novel and atypical research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The production of knowledge has become increasingly a global endeavor. Yet, location related factors, such as local working environment and national policy designs, may continue to affect what kind of science is being pursued. Here we examine the geography of the production of creative science by country, through the lens of novelty and atypicality proposed in Uzzi et al. (2013). We quantify a country's representativeness in novel and atypical science, finding persistent differences in propensity to generate creative works, even among developed countries that are large producers in science. We further cluster countries based on how their tendency to publish novel science changes over time, identifying one group of emerging countries. Our analyses point out the recent emergence of China not only as a large producer in science but also as a leader that disproportionately produces more novel and atypical research. Discipline specific analysis indicates that China's over-production of atypical science is limited to a few disciplines, especially its most prolific ones like materials science and chemistry.</description>

      <title>Urban Planning in 3D with a Two-tier LUTI model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The two-tier Lowry model brings dynamic simulations of population and employment directly into the planning process. By linking regional modelling with neighbourhood design, the framework enables planners to explore how alternative planning scenarios may evolve over time. The upper tier captures regional flows of people, jobs, and services, while the lower tier allocates these to fine-grain zones such as neighbourhoods or parcels. Implemented in CityEngine, the approach allows interactive visualisation and evaluation of multi-scale scenarios. A case study in South Yorkshire (UK) illustrates how regional forecasts can be translated into local design responses, connecting quantitative modelling with 3D spatial planning.</description>

      <title>Role division drives impact of resource allocation on epidemic spreading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on the real-world hierarchical structure of resource allocation, this paper presents a coupled dynamic model of resource allocation and epidemic spreading that incorporates a role-based division of network nodes into resource allocators and recipients. As the average number of links per recipient from allocators increases, the prevalence exhibits one of four distinct response patterns across conditions: monotonically increasing, monotonically decreasing, U-shaped trend, or a sudden decrease with large fluctuations. Analysis of the underlying physical mechanisms reveals three key features: (i) a trade-off between efficient resource allocation and infection risk for allocators, (ii) the critical importance of avoiding resource redundancy under high therapeutic resource efficiency, and (iii) cascade-induced bistability.</description>

      <title>The dynamics of discovery and the Heaps-Zipf relationship</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When following a sequence - such as reading a text or tracking a user's activity - one can measure how the "dictionary" of distinct elements (types) grows with the number of observations (tokens). When this growth follows a power law, it is referred to as Heaps' law, a regularity often associated with Zipf's law and frequently used to characterize human innovation and discovery processes. While random sampling from a Zipf-like distribution can reproduce Heaps' law, this connection relies on the assumption of temporal independence - an assumption often violated in real-world systems although frequently found in the literature. Here, we investigate how temporal correlations in token sequences affect the type-token curve. In systems like music listening and web browsing, domain-specific correlations in token ordering lead to systematic deviations from the Zipf-Heaps framework, effectively decoupling the type-token plot from the rank-frequency distribution. Using a minimal one-parameter model, we reproduce a wide variety of type-token trajectories, including the extremal cases that bound all possible behaviors compatible with a given frequency distribution. Our results demonstrate that type-token growth reflects not only the empirical distribution of type frequencies, but also the temporal structure of the sequence - a factor often overlooked in empirical applications of scaling laws to characterize human behavior.</description>

      <title>The Anatomy of Blame: A Network Analysis of Strategic Responsibility-Shifting After a Systemic Disaster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: After disasters, blame becomes a key mechanism through which institutions negotiate responsibility and legitimacy. Yet the structure of these exchanges remains poorly understood. Using evidence from the Grenfell Tower fire, we modelled accusations among public, private and regulatory actors as a directed network. The resulting pattern was highly interconnected, revealing that blame circulated through reciprocated and clustered ties rather than simple one-to-one accusations. These configurations indicate that institutions did not merely assign responsibility but engaged in strategic counter-blame and coalition-building to manage exposure. Comparisons with reference models confirmed that such dynamics exceed what would be expected from structural constraints alone. By mapping how blame spreads and concentrates across organisational systems, this study provides quantitative evidence for long-standing theories of blame avoidance and highlights how accountability in complex governance settings becomes collectively negotiated and structurally embedded.</description>

      <title>The local Gaussian correlation networks among return tails in the Chinese stock market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Financial networks based on Pearson correlations have been intensively studied. However, previous studies may have led to misleading and catastrophic results because of several critical shortcomings of the Pearson correlation. The local Gaussian correlation coefficient, a new measurement of statistical dependence between variables, has unique advantages including capturing local nonlinear dependence and handling heavy-tailed distributions. This study constructs financial networks using the local Gaussian correlation coefficients between tail regions of stock returns in the Shanghai Stock Exchange. The work systematically analyzes fundamental network metrics including node centrality, average shortest path length, and entropy. Compared with the local Gaussian correlation network among positive tails and the conventional Pearson correlation network, the properties of the local Gaussian correlation network among negative tails are more sensitive to the stock market risks. This finding suggests researchers should prioritize the local Gaussian correlation network among negative tails. Future work should reevaluate existing findings using the local Gaussian correlation method.</description>

      <title>Bounded-confidence opinion models with random-time interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15148v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In models of opinion dynamics, agents interact with each other and can change their opinions as a result of those interactions. One type of opinion model is a bounded-confidence model (BCM), in which opinions take continuous values and interacting agents compromise their opinions with each other if their opinions are sufficiently similar. In studies of BCMs, researchers typically assume that interactions between agents occur at deterministic times. This assumption neglects an inherent element of randomness in social interactions, and it is desirable to account for it. In this paper, we study BCMs on networks and allow agents to interact at random times. To incorporate random-time interactions, we use renewal processes to determine social-interaction event times, which can follow arbitrary interevent-time distributions (ITDs). We establish connections between these random-time-interaction BCMs and deterministic-time-interaction BCMs. We analyze the quantitative impact of ITDs on the transient dynamics of BCMs and derive approximate master equations for the time-dependent expectations of the BCM dynamics. We find that BCMs with Markovian ITDs have consistent statistical properties (in particular, they have the same expected time-dependent opinions) when the ITDs have the same mean but that the statistical properties of BCMs with non-Markovian ITDs depend on the type of ITD even when the ITDs have the same mean. Additionally, we numerically examine the transient and steady-state dynamics of our models with various ITDs on different networks and compare their expected order-parameter values and expected convergence times.</description>

      <title>Airborne assessment uncovers socioeconomic stratification of urban nature in England</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.13861v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nature access is increasingly recognised as a public health and equity imperative, yet cities lack standardised ways to measure who benefits from green infrastructure. We present the first national, building-level assessment of the 3-30-300 urban greening rule across England, integrating high-performance computing with open LiDAR and geospatial datasets. Our framework quantifies proximity, availability, and accessibility of greenery, linking each to socioeconomic deprivation through Gini-based inequality metrics. Results reveal that while most English residents meet the tree visibility criterion, only 0.1% of urban areas meet all three thresholds; canopy cover and park access sharply diverge along deprivation lines. Wealthier areas enjoy greater ambient greenness, whereas deprived urban cores often have better proximity to parks but lower vegetation density. The study offers a scalable computational blueprint for assessing nature equity and demonstrates that green accessibility represents a new dimension of socioeconomic inequality. These findings call for policy approaches that move beyond proximity metrics toward equitable, quality-based standards for nature access.</description>

      <title>Anti-correlation network among China A-shares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00028v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The correlation-based financial networks are studied intensively. However, previous studies ignored the importance of the anti-correlation. This paper is the first to consider the anti-correlation and positive correlation separately, and accordingly construct the weighted temporal anti-correlation and positive correlation networks among stocks listed in the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges. For both types of networks during the first 24 years of this century, fundamental topological measurements are analyzed systematically. This paper unveils some essential differences in these topological measurements between the anti-correlation and positive correlation networks. It also observes an asymmetry effect between the stock market decline and rise. The methodology proposed in this paper has the potential to reveal significant differences in the topological structure and dynamics of a complex financial system, stock behavior, investment portfolios, and risk management, offering insights that are not visible when all correlations are considered together. More importantly, this paper proposes a new direction for studying complex systems: the anti-correlation network. It is well worth reexamining previous relevant studies using this new methodology.</description>

      <title>Dual approach to proving electoral fraud via statistics and forensics (Dvojnoe dokazatel'stvo falsifikazij na vyborah statistikoj i kriminalistikoj)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04535v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electoral fraud often manifests itself as statistical anomalies in election results, yet its extent can rarely be reliably confirmed by other evidence. Here we report complete results of municipal elections in Vlasikha town near Moscow, where we observe both statistical irregularities in the vote-counting transcripts and forensic evidence of tampering with ballots during their overnight storage. We evaluate two types of statistical signatures in the vote sequence that can prove batches of fraudulent ballots have been injected. We find that pairs of factory-made security bags with identical serial numbers are used in this fraud scheme. At 8 out of our 9 polling stations, the statistical and forensic evidence agrees (identifying 7 as fraudulent and 1 as honest), while at the remaining station the statistical evidence detects the fraud while the forensic one is insufficient. We also illustrate that the use of tamper-indicating seals at elections is inherently unreliable.</description>
