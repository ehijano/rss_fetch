      <title>Direct three-body atom recombination: halogen atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recombination of halogen atoms has been a research topic in chemical physics for over a century. All theoretical descriptions of atom recombination depend on a two-step assumption, where two colliding atoms first form an unstable complex before a third colliding body either relaxes or reacts with it to yield a diatomic molecule. These mechanisms have served well in describing some of the dynamics of atom recombination, but have not yet provided a full theoretical understanding. In this work, we consider the role of the direct three-body recombination mechanism in halogen recombination reactions X + X + M $\rightarrow$ X$_2$ + M, where X is a halogen atom, and M is a rare gas atom. Our results agree well with experimental bromide and iodine recombination measurements, demonstrating that direct three-body recombination is essential in halogen recombination reactions.</description>

      <title>Energy shifts in predissociating levels of diatomic molecules: The case of N$_2$ (C$''^5\Pi _u$) and N$_2$(1$^7\Sigma ^+_u$) interacting states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a perturbative calculation methodology for evaluating the energy shifts and broadening of vibrational energy levels, caused by interactions between bound and unbound dissociative electronic states. The method is validated against previously semiclassical analyzed cases, demonstrating remarkable consistency. We successfully applied this approach to the N$_2$ molecule, which exhibits a strong spin-orbit interaction between the bound C$''^5\Pi_u$ and the repulsive 1$^7\Sigma^+_u$ electronic states, around 36 cm$^{-1}$. This interaction constitutes an major pathway for N($^{2}$D) production, important in both excitation and quenching in plasma afterglows. As a result, the maximum absolute shift of 0.15 cm$^{-1}$ was found for the C$''^5\Pi_u$ ($v$ = 7) and maximum broadening of 0.45 cm$^{-1}$ was calculated for $v$ = 8, demonstrating significant perturbation of the C$''^5\Pi_u$ by the 1$^7\Sigma^+_u$ state. The results obtained were compared with direct calculations of the predissociation rates of the C$''^5\Pi_u$ bound state, showing very good agreement.</description>

      <title>Periodic table for highly charged ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mendeleev's periodic table successfully groups atomic elements according to their chemical and spectroscopic properties. However, it becomes less sufficient in describing the electronic properties of highly charged ions (HCIs) in which many of the outermost electrons are ionized. In this work, we put forward a periodic table particularly suitable for HCIs. It is constructed purely based on the successive electron occupation of relativistic orbitals. While providing a much-simplified description of the level structure of highly charged isoelectronic ions -- essential for laboratory and astrophysical plasma spectroscopies, such a periodic table predicts a large family of highly forbidden transitions suitable for the development of next-generation optical atomic clocks. Furthermore, we also identify universal linear $Z$ scaling laws ($Z$ is the nuclear charge) in the so-called ``Coulomb splittings'' between angular momentum multiplets along isoelectronic sequences, complementing the physics of electron-electron interactions in multielectron atomic systems.</description>

      <title>Measurement of the g factor of ground-state 87Sr at the parts-per-million level using co-trapped ultracold atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate nuclear magnetic resonance of optically trapped ground-state ultracold 87Sr atoms. Using a scheme in which a cloud of ultracold 87Rb is co-trapped nearby, we improve the determination of the nuclear g factor, gI , of atomic 87Sr by more than two orders of magnitude, reaching accuracy at the parts-per-million level. We achieve similar accuracy in the ratio of relevant g factors between Rb and Sr. This establishes ultracold 87Sr as an excellent linear in-vacuum magnetometer. These results are relevant for ongoing efforts towards quantum simulation, quantum computation and optical atomic clocks employing 87Sr, and these methods can also be applied to other alkaline-earth and alkaline-earth-like atoms.</description>

      <title>Compact laser system with frequency stability dissemination for optical clocks and quantum computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern experiments in quantum metrology, sensing, and quantum computing require precise control of the state of atoms and molecules, achieved through the use of highly stable lasers and microwave generators with low phase noise. One of the most effective methods for ensuring high frequency stability is stabilization using a high-finesse Fabry-P\'erot reference cavity. However, implementing separate stabilization systems for each laser increases the complexity and size of the setup, limiting its use to laboratory conditions. An alternative approach is the use of a femtosecond optical frequency comb, which transfers the noise characteristics of a single stabilized frequency reference to other wavelengths in the optical and microwave ranges. In this work, we demonstrate a scheme for transferring frequency stability from an ultrastable laser at 871 nm to a laser at 1550 nm. Measurements using the three-cornered hat method show that the stabilized laser exhibits a fractional frequency instability of less than 4e-15 for averaging times between 0.4 and 2 s, and below 1e-14 for intervals ranging from 0.2 to 500 s. The femtosecond optical frequency comb and the cavity-stabilized laser were designed to meet compactness and portability requirements to enable field and onboard applications.</description>

      <title>Integration of a high-fidelity model of quantum sensors with a map-matching filter for quantum-enhanced navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Harnessing the potential of quantum sensors to assist in navigation requires enabling their operation in complex, dynamic environments and integrating them within existing navigation systems. While cross-couplings from platform dynamics generally degrade quantum measurements in a complex manner, navigation filters would need to be designed to handle such complex quantum sensor data. In this work, we report on the realization of a high-fidelity model of an atom-interferometry-based gravity gradiometer and demonstrate its integration with a map-matching navigation filter. Relying on the ability of our model to simulate the sensor behaviour across various dynamic platform environments, we show that aiding navigation via map matching using quantum gravity gradiometry results in stable trajectories, and highlight the importance of non-Gaussian errors arising from platform dynamics as a key challenge to map-matching navigation. We derive requirements for mitigating these errors, such as maintaining sensor tilt below 3.3 degrees, to inform future sensor development priorities. This work demonstrates the value of an end-to-end approach that could support future optimization of the overall navigation system. Beyond navigation, our atom interferometer modelling framework could be relevant to current research and innovation endeavours with quantum gravimeters, gradiometers and inertial sensors.</description>

      <title>Boundary Time Crystals Induced by Local Dissipation and Long-Range Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20761v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Driven-dissipative many-body system supports nontrivial quantum phases absent in equilibrium. As a prominent example, the interplay between coherent driving and collective dissipation can lead to a dynamical quantum phase that spontaneously breaks time-translation symmetry. This so-called boundary time crystal (BTC) is fragile in the presence of local dissipation, which can easily relax the system to a stationary state. In this work, we demonstrate a robust BTC that is intrinsically induced by local dissipation. We provide extensive numerical evidences to support existence of the BTC and study its behaviors in different regimes. In particular, with decreasing interaction range, we identify a transition from classical limit cycles to quantum BTCs featuring sizable spatial correlations. Our studies significantly broaden the scope of nonequilibrium phases and shed new light on experimental search for dynamical quantum matter.</description>
