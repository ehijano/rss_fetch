      <title>Compact Continuous Cold Atomic Beam from a Single Cell with 3D Cooling and Ultra-low Light Shift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a compact single-cell source of a continuous cold-atom beam with three-dimensional (3D) cooling. By integrating an off-axis moving optical molasses (OM) with a two-dimensional magneto-optical trap (MOT), we achieve simultaneous 3D cooling within a 50 mm interaction region. The source delivers a continuous flux up to 4.9(5)x10^9 atoms/s, with a transverse temperature of 94(5) microK, a longitudinal temperature as low as 231(65) microK, and a tunable mean velocity between 5 and 20 m/s. Custom in-vacuum mirrors integrate the reflective geometry for the off-axis OM beams with a 0.8 mm output aperture, ensuring stable alignment while suppressing stray light and fluorescence leakage. Ultra-low light shift and decoherence are verified via continuous Raman-Ramsey interferometry, yielding a light shift of -0.51(4)Hz and a typical fringe contrast of 90.85(30)% at a Raman separation of 100 mm (interrogation time of 8.70 ms). This compact continuous cold-atom beam source constitutes a practical building block for atomic-beam clocks and interferometers, enabling reduced aliasing noise together with improved sensitivity and accuracy for field applications.</description>

      <title>Collective excitation of Bose-Einstein condensate of Bose atoms with P\"oschl-Teller interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the collective excitations of Bose atoms in the condensate phase with finite-range interactions, modeled using the P\"oschl-Teller (PT) potential to explicitly account for the finite interaction range. Utilizing Bogoliubov theory, we derive the excitation spectrum and examine its dependence on interaction parameters. Our analysis reveals that the emergence and disappearance of the roton minima are directly influenced by the range of the PT interaction. Furthermore, we calculate the static structure factor and find enhanced correlations in the low-momentum regime, with their nature controlled by the characteristics of the PT potential. We have examined the interaction dependence of sound velocity and compressibility in detail.</description>

      <title>Splitting Isotope Shift in the $1s2p\,^3\!P_{0,1,2}$ Fine-Structure Triplet in $^{12,13,14}$C$^{4+}$: Experiment and Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report measurements and theoretical calculations of the fine-structure splittings in all three $1s2s\,^3\!S_1\rightarrow\,1s2p\,^3\!P_{0,1,2}$ transitions in the heliumlike systems of the isotopes $^{12,13,14}$C. The metastable triplet state was efficiently populated in an electron beam ion source and the C$^{4+}$ ions were electrostatically accelerated to 50\,keV to perform collinear laser spectroscopy. From the determined transition frequencies, the splitting isotope shift (SIS), i.e., the difference in fine-structure splittings between different isotopes of the same element, was extracted. In the SIS, theoretical uncertainties due to higher-order quantum electrodynamic corrections are strongly suppressed since they are independent of both nuclear mass and the fine-structure quantum number $J$ in lowest order. Comparison with theory provides an important test of experimental accuracy, particularly in the $^{13}$C$^{4+}$ case, for which the nuclear spin leads to hyperfine-induced fine-structure mixing. At the same time, the even-even isotopes $^{12,14}$C$^{4+}$ without nuclear spin can be used to confirm theory. Theoretical values of the SIS are given for all the heliumlike ions with $2\le Z\le 10$.</description>

      <title>Macroscopic Self-Trapping and Dynamical Phase Transition in Momentum Space Bose-Einstein Condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-trapping is a hallmark phenomenon of nonlinear dynamics. It has significant applications in modern physics, including band structure engineering, phase transition dynamics, quantum metrology, and more. Dilute-gas Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs), in which self-trapping can arise from interatomic interactions, are a prime testbed for probing nonlinear dynamics. In this Letter, we report the observation of self-trapping in a spin-orbit coupled BEC subjected to a stationary optical lattice. We employ Raman-induced spin-orbit coupling, complemented by a matching optical lattice that facilitates coupling between momentum eigenstates of the spin-orbit coupled system. By ramping the Raman detuning, we probe atomic current flow between these eigenstates and identify a clear distinction between a delocalized mixed state and a self-trapped regime. Following a quench of the Raman detuning, the time-averaged atomic current exhibits non-analytic behavior across the transition between these two regimes in certain parameter ranges, signaling a dynamical phase transition in the system.</description>

      <title>Autler-Townes spectroscopy of a Rydberg ladder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ladder-type two-photon excitation of an atom from a ground state $|g\rangle$, to an intermediate excited state $|e\rangle$, and, finally, to a Rydberg state $|r\rangle$, has a variety of uses from quantum information to sensing. A common scheme for detecting this transition optically is through electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT). However, in inverted wavelength schemes, where the ground-to-excited transition wavelength is shorter than the excited-to-Rydberg transition wavelength, the strength of the EIT feature on the lower-leg beam is strongly reduced in a Doppler-broadened medium. Here, we report on an alternative two-photon spectroscopic feature, which we term the two-photon Autler-Townes resonance, observed on the upper-leg beam. Compared to the EIT signal, this feature's superior signal-to-noise ratio allows one to resolve Rydberg resonances with principal quantum number as high as $n=80$. We also show that such a feature can be utilized to generate an error signal for stabilizing the frequency of the upper-leg beam.</description>

      <title>Efficient lambda-enhanced gray molasses using an EIT-based laser locking scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13360v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel implementation of lambda-enhanced gray molasses cooling in a non-standard beam geometry and with an inexpensive laser locking set-up. In contrast to the established use of resource-intensive phase locking methods, our laser system uses two independent lasers, frequency -locked to a spectral feature produced by an electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) resonance. We show that this approach achieves sufficient coherence to enable effective gray molasses cooling without the need for costly GHz electronics, significantly reducing the complexity and cost of experimental setups and represents a step toward more accessible cold atom technologies. A wave-function Monte Carlo analysis supports the experimental findings, offering insight into the cooling dynamics of this unconventional scheme</description>

      <title>Robust Superradiance and Spontaneous Spin Ordering in Disordered Waveguide QED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the collective emission of a disordered array of $N$ excited two-level atoms into a one-dimensional photonic waveguide. In the perfectly ordered case, where atoms are spaced by exact integer multiples of the wavelength, the system exhibits the characteristic superradiant burst with a peak emission rate scaling as $N^2$. Using large-scale semiclassical simulations, we find that this key signature of superradiance remains asymptotically robust under strong spatial and spectral disorder, but also exhibits subtle finite-size scaling toward this limit. To explain our observations, we provide an analytical variational estimate for the maximal decay rate, which tightly bounds the numerical results and reveals how disorder shapes the collective decay. Specifically, we find that even in the presence of strong disorder, the spins tend to self-organize spontaneously according to their locations, which overall optimizes constructive interference effects and explains the emergence of mirror-asymmetric correlations in superradiant decay. These findings resolve important open questions regarding the existence and nature of superradiance in strongly disordered arrays and offer valuable insights for understanding collective quantum optical phenomena in realistic systems.</description>

      <title>Chip-Scale Point-Source Sagnac Interferometer by Phase-Space Squeezing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16972v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Matter-wave interferometry plays a significant role in scientific research and technological applications. While position-momentum phase-space squeezing has been demonstrated to increase the coherence of atom sources by reducing momentum spread, we theoretically investigate the potential advantages of the opposite squeezing. As a case study, we analytically and numerically examine its effect on point source atom interferometry (PSI) for rotation sensing. Our analysis reveals that this squeezed PSI (SPSI) approach can significantly improve sensitivity and dynamic range while enabling shorter cycle times and higher repetition rates. Through simulations, we identify parameter spaces where sensitivity and dynamic range are enhanced by orders of magnitude. Under a specific definition of compactness, our calculations show that SPSI outperforms standard PSI by over four orders of magnitude. These theoretical findings suggest that SPSI could either enhance performance in standard-sized devices or maintain performance in miniaturized chip-scale devices, potentially paving the way for new practical applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11734v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We review various semiclassical models for strong-field physics. These semiclassical models employ ensembles of classical trajectories to simulate electron motion in the continuum after being released from an atom or molecule by an external laser field. We discuss different approaches to trajectory-based simulations and identify their advantages and shortcomings. We also review some of the recent applications of semiclassical models to the key strong-field phenomena: above-threshold ionization, high-order harmonic generation, nonsequential double ionization, and frustrated tunneling ionization.</description>
