      <title>Diffusion Transformer-based Universal Dose Denoising for Pencil Beam Scanning Proton Therapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: Intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT) offers precise tumor coverage while sparing organs at risk (OARs) in head and neck (H&amp;N) cancer. However, its sensitivity to anatomical changes requires frequent adaptation through online adaptive radiation therapy (oART), which depends on fast, accurate dose calculation via Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. Reducing particle count accelerates MC but degrades accuracy. To address this, denoising low-statistics MC dose maps is proposed to enable fast, high-quality dose generation.
  Methods: We developed a diffusion transformer-based denoising framework. IMPT plans and 3D CT images from 80 H&amp;N patients were used to generate noisy and high-statistics dose maps using MCsquare (1 min and 10 min per plan, respectively). Data were standardized into uniform chunks with zero-padding, normalized, and transformed into quasi-Gaussian distributions. Testing was done on 10 H&amp;N, 10 lung, 10 breast, and 10 prostate cancer cases, preprocessed identically. The model was trained with noisy dose maps and CT images as input and high-statistics dose maps as ground truth, using a combined loss of mean square error (MSE), residual loss, and regional MAE (focusing on top/bottom 10% dose voxels). Performance was assessed via MAE, 3D Gamma passing rate, and DVH indices.
  Results: The model achieved MAEs of 0.195 (H&amp;N), 0.120 (lung), 0.172 (breast), and 0.376 Gy[RBE] (prostate). 3D Gamma passing rates exceeded 92% (3%/2mm) across all sites. DVH indices for clinical target volumes (CTVs) and OARs closely matched the ground truth.
  Conclusion: A diffusion transformer-based denoising framework was developed and, though trained only on H&amp;N data, generalizes well across multiple disease sites.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Tensor MRI and Spherical-Deconvolution-Based Tractography on an Ultra-Low Field Portable MRI System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultra-low-field (ULF) MRI is emerging as an alternative modality to high-field (HF) MRI due to its lower cost, minimal siting requirements, portability, and enhanced accessibility factors that enable large-scale deployment. Although ULF-MRI exhibits lower signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), advanced imaging and data-driven denoising methods enabled by high-performance computing have made contrasts like diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) feasible at ULF. This study investigates the potential and limitations of ULF tractography, using data acquired on a 0.064 T commercially available mobile point-of-care MRI scanner. The results demonstrate that most major white matter bundles can be successfully retrieved in healthy adult brains within clinically tolerable scan times. This study also examines the recovery of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)-derived scalar maps, including fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity. Strong correspondence is observed between scalar maps obtained with ULF-MRI and those acquired at high field strengths. Furthermore, fibre orientation distribution functions reconstructed from ULF data show good agreement with high-field references, supporting the feasibility of using ULF-MRI for reliable tractography. These findings open new opportunities to use ULF-MRI in studies of brain health, development, and disease progression particularly in populations traditionally underserved due to geographic or economic constraints. The results show that robust assessments of white matter microstructure can be achieved with ULF-MRI, effectively democratising microstructural MRI and extending advanced imaging capabilities to a broader range of research and clinical settings where resources are typically limited.</description>

      <title>Synchro-Thermography: Monitoring ~10 mK Facial Temperature Changes with Heartbeat Referencing for Physiological Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Infrared thermography has gained interest as a tool for non-contact measurement of blood circulation and skin blood flow due to cardiac activity. Partiularly, blood vessels on the surface, such as on the back of the hand, are suited for visualization. However, standardized methodologies have not yet been established for areas such as the face and neck, where many blood vessels are lie deeper beneath the surface, and external stimulation for measurement could be harmful. Here we propose Synchro-Thermography for stable monitoring of facial temperature changes associated with heart rate variability. We conducted experiments with eight subjects and measured minute temperature changes with an amplitude of about \SI{10}{mK} on the forehead and chin. The proposed method improves the temperature resolution by a factor of 2 or more, and can stably measure skin temperature changes caused by blood flow. This skin temperature change could be applied to physiological sensing such as blood flow changes due to injury or disease, or as an indicator of stress.</description>

      <title>Fast PET Reconstruction with Variance Reduction and Prior-Aware Preconditioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate subset-based optimization methods for positron emission tomography (PET) image reconstruction incorporating a regularizing prior. PET reconstruction methods that use a prior, such as the relative difference prior (RDP), are of particular relevance, as they are widely used in clinical practice and have been shown to outperform conventional early-stopped and post-smoothed ordered subsets expectation maximization (OSEM).
  Our study evaluates these methods on both simulated data and real brain PET scans from the 2024 PET Rapid Image Reconstruction Challenge (PETRIC), where the main objective was to achieve RDP-regularized reconstructions as fast as possible, making it an ideal benchmark. Our key finding is that incorporating the effect of the prior into the preconditioner is crucial for ensuring fast and stable convergence.
  In extensive simulation experiments, we compare several stochastic algorithms -- including Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Stochastic Averaged Gradient Amelior\'e (SAGA), and Stochastic Variance Reduced Gradient (SVRG) -- under various algorithmic design choices and evaluate their performance for varying count levels and regularization strengths. The results show that SVRG and SAGA outperformed SGD, with SVRG demonstrating a slight overall advantage. The insights gained from these simulations directly contributed to the design of our submitted algorithms, which formed the basis of the winning contribution to the PETRIC 2024 challenge.</description>

      <title>A Gaussian process approach for rapid evaluation of skin tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Skin tension plays a pivotal role in clinical settings, it affects scarring, wound healing and skin necrosis. Despite its importance, there is no widely accepted method for assessing in vivo skin tension or its natural pre-stretch. This study aims to utilise modern machine learning (ML) methods to develop a model that uses non-invasive measurements of surface wave speed to predict clinically useful skin properties such as stress and natural pre-stretch. A large dataset consisting of simulated wave propagation experiments was created using a simplified two-dimensional finite element (FE) model. Using this dataset, a sensitivity analysis was performed, highlighting the effect of the material parameters and material model on the Rayleigh and supersonic shear wave speeds. Then, a Gaussian process regression model was trained to solve the ill-posed inverse problem of predicting stress and pre-stretch of skin using measurements of surface wave speed. This model had good predictive performance (R2 = 0.9570) and it was possible to interpolate simplified parametric equations to calculate the stress and pre-stretch. To demonstrate that wave speed measurements could be obtained cheaply and easily, a simple experiment was devised to obtain wave speed measurements from synthetic skin at different values of pre-stretch. These experimental wave speeds agree well with the FE simulations and a model trained solely on the FE data provided accurate predictions of synthetic skin stiffness. Both the simulated and experimental results provide further evidence that elastic wave measurements coupled with ML models are a viable non-invasive method to determine in vivo skin tension.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Inspired Genetic Optimization for Patient Scheduling in Radiation Oncology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Among the genetic algorithms generally used for optimization problems in the recent decades, quantum-inspired variants are known for fast and high-fitness convergence and small resource requirement. Here the application to the patient scheduling problem in proton therapy is reported. Quantum chromosomes are tailored to possess the superposed data of patient IDs and gantry statuses. Selection and repair strategies are also elaborated for reliable convergence to a clinically feasible schedule although the employed model is not complex. Clear advantage in population size is shown over the classical counterpart in our numerical results for both a medium-size test case and a large-size practical problem instance. It is, however, observed that program run time is rather long for the large-size practical case, which is due to the limitation of classical emulation and demands the forthcoming true quantum computation. Our results also revalidate the stability of the conventional classical genetic algorithm.</description>

      <title>Direct3{\gamma}: A Pipeline for Direct Three-gamma PET Image Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18337v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel image reconstruction pipeline for three-gamma (3-{\gamma}) positron emission tomography (PET) aimed at improving spatial resolution and reducing noise in nuclear medicine. The proposed Direct3{\gamma} pipeline addresses the inherent challenges in 3-{\gamma} PET systems, such as detector imperfections and uncertainty in photon interaction points. A key feature of the pipeline is its ability to determine the order of interactions through a model trained on Monte Carlo (MC) simulations using the Geant4 Application for Tomography Emission (GATE) toolkit, thus providing the necessary information to construct Compton cones which intersect with the line of response (LOR) to provide an estimate of the emission point. The pipeline processes 3-{\gamma} PET raw data, reconstructs histoimages by propagating energy and spatial uncertainties along the LOR, and applies a 3-D convolutional neural network (CNN) to refine these intermediate images into high-quality reconstructions. To further enhance image quality, the pipeline leverages both supervised learning and adversarial losses, the latter preserving fine structural details. Experimental results show that Direct3{\gamma} consistently outperforms conventional 200-ps time-of-flight (TOF) PET in terms of SSIM and PSNR.</description>

      <title>Modelling power-law ultrasound absorption using a time-fractional, static memory, Fourier pseudo-spectral method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02541v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe and implement a numerical method for modelling the frequency-dependent power-law absorption of ultrasound in tissue, as governed by the first order linear wave equations with a loss taking the form of a fractional time derivative. The (Caputo) fractional time derivative requires the full problem history which is contained within an iterative procedure. The resulting numerical method requires a fixed (static) memory cost irrespective of the number of time steps. The spatial domain is treated by the Fourier spectral method. Numerically comparisons are made against a model for the same power-law absorption with loss described by the fractional-Laplacian operator. One advantage of the fractional time derivative over the fractional-Laplacian operator is the local treatment of the power-law, allowing for a spatially varying frequency power-law.</description>

      <title>An Open Source Validation System for Continuous Arterial Blood Pressure Measuring Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07973v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Measuring the blood pressure waveform is becoming a more frequently studied area. The development of sensor technologies opens many new ways to be able to measure high-quality signals. The development of such an aim-specific sensor can be time-consuming, expensive, and difficult to test or validate with known and consistent waveforms. In this paper, we present an open source blood pressure waveform simulator with an open source Python validation package to reduce development costs for early-stage sensor development and research. The simulator mainly consists of 3D printed parts which technology has become a widely available and cheap solution. The core part of the simulator is a 3D printed cam that can be generated based on real blood pressure waveforms. The validation framework can create a detailed comparison between the signal waveform used to design the cam and the measured time series from the sensor being validated. The presented simulator proved to be robust and accurate in short- and long-term use, as it produced the signal waveform consistently and accurately. To validate this solution, a 3D force sensor was used, which was proven earlier to be able to measure high-quality blood pressure waveforms on the radial artery at the wrist. The results showed high similarity between the measured and the nominal waveforms, meaning that comparing the normalized signals, the RMSE value ranged from $0.0276 \pm 0.0047$ to $0.0212 \pm 0.0023$, and the Pearson correlation ranged from $0.9933 \pm 0.0027$ to $0.9978 \pm 0.0005$. Our validation framework is available at https://github.com/repat8/cam-bpw-sim. Our hardware framework, which allows reproduction of the presented solution, is available at https://github.com/repat8/cam-bpw-sim-hardware. The entire design is an open source project and was developed using free software.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional materials as ideal substrates for molecular quantum emitters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02292v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The generation and manipulation of non-classical states of light is central to quantum technologies. Color centers in insulators have been extensively studied for single-photon generation, but organic molecules immobilized on substrates have gained attention due to their superior scalability, large oscillator strengths, and tunable emission frequency. Here, we use first-principles calculations to investigate the photoemission from organic molecules adsorbed on 2D materials. Focusing on terrylene on hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), we obtain zero phonon line (ZPL) energies and emission lineshapes in excellent agreement with experiments. Notably, antisite defects in hBN can immobilize the molecule without influencing its key emission features. We further show that the main effect of the 2D substrate is to introduce sharp sidebands near the ZPL as a fingerprint of hindered rotational, translational, or bending modes of the molecule. Our findings provide insight into how substrate interactions shape the optical properties of molecular systems for quantum applications.</description>
