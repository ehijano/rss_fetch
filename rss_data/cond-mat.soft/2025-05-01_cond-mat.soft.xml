      <title>Analytical model and experimental validation for nonlinear mechanical response of aspirated elastic shells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We developed a physics-based analytical model to describe the nonlinear mechanical response of aspirated elastic shells. By representing the elastic energy through a stretching modulus, $K$, and a dimensionless ratio, $\delta$, capturing the balance between stretching and bending energies, the model reveals mechanical behaviors extending beyond conventional approaches. Validated across microscale droplets and macroscale silicone sheets by fitting experimental force-displacement curves, this approach provides accurate, scalable characterization of deformed elastic shells. This framework advances our understanding of soft thin-shell mechanics, with broad applications in probing living cells and designing soft materials.</description>

      <title>From fluttering to drifting in inertialess sedimentation of achiral particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There has been much recent interest in the chiral motion of achiral particles that sediment in a viscous fluid in a regime where inertial effects can be neglected. This occurs in a broad range of applications such as those involving biological objects like algae, ultra-thin graphene flakes, or colloidal suspensions. It is known that articles with two planes of symmetry can be categorised as ``settlers'', ``drifters'' or ``flutterers'', where the latter sediment along chiral trajectories despite their achiral shapes. Here we analyse the sedimentation of circular disks bent into a U-shape (``flutterers'') and show how their behaviour changes when we break one of their symmetries by pinching the disks along their axis. The ``fluttering'' behaviour is found to be robust to such shape changes, with the trajectories now evolving towards helical paths. However, the behaviour changes when the degree of pinching becomes too strong, at which point the particles become ``drifters'' which sediment steadily without rotation. We establish criteria for the transition between the two types of behaviour and confirm our predictions in experiments. Finally, we discuss the implications of our observations for the dispersion of dilute suspensions made of such particles.</description>

      <title>Diffusion of intruders in a granular gas thermostatted by a bath of elastic hard spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Boltzmann kinetic equation is considered to compute the transport coefficients associated with the mass flux of intruders in a granular gas. Intruders and granular gas are immersed in a gas of elastic hard spheres (molecular gas). We assume that the granular particles are sufficiently rarefied so that the state of the molecular gas is not affected by the presence of the granular gas. Thus, the gas of elastic hard spheres can be considered as a thermostat (or bath) at a fixed temperature $T_g$. In the absence of spatial gradients, the system achieves a steady state where the temperature of the granular gas $T$ differs from that of the intruders $T_0$ (energy nonequipartition). Approximate theoretical predictions for the temperature ratios $T/T_g$ and $T_0/T_g$ and the kurtosis $c$ and $c_0$ associated with the granular gas and the intruders compare very well with Monte Carlo simulations for conditions of practical interest. For states close to the steady homogeneous state, the Boltzmann equation for the intruders is solved by means of the Chapman--Enskog method to first order in the spatial gradients. As expected, the diffusion transport coefficients are given in terms of the solutions of a set of coupled linear integral equations which are approximately solved by considering the first-Sonine approximation. In dimensionless form, the transport coefficients are nonlinear functions of the mass and diameter ratios, the coefficients of restitution, and the (reduced) bath temperature. Interestingly, previous results derived from a suspension model based on an effective fluid-solid interaction force are recovered when $m/m_g\to \infty$ and $m_0/m_g\to \infty$, where $m$, $m_0$, and $m_g$ are the masses of the granular, intruder, and molecular gas particle, respectively. Finally, as an application of our results, thermal diffusion segregation is exhaustively analysed.</description>

      <title>Chiral interactions between tropocollagen molecules determine the collagen microfibril structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collagen is the most abundant structural protein in animals, forming hierarchically organised fibrils that provide mechanical support to tissues. Despite detailed structural studies, the physical principles that govern the formation of the characteristic axially-periodic collagen microfibril remain poorly understood. Here, we present a theoretical framework that links the amino acid sequence of tropocollagen to its supramolecular organisation. By combining statistical modeling of residue geometry with sequence-informed interaction potentials, we show that the chiral arrangement of outward-facing residues induces directional intermolecular interactions that drive molecular supercoiling. These interactions favour the formation of right-handed, pentameric microfibrils with a staggered axial periodicity of approximately 67 nm. Our simulations reveal that this structure emerges across a wide range of mammalian collagen sequences as a global energy minimum robust to biochemical noise. These findings provide a mechanistic explanation for collagen's supramolecular chirality and offer design principles for engineering synthetic collagen-mimetic materials.</description>

      <title>Diffusive contact between randomly driven colloidal suspensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12929v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the relaxation process of two driven colloidal suspensions in diffusive contact to a steady state, similar to thermalization. We start by studying a single suspension, subjecting it to random driving forces via holographic optical tweezers, which agitate it to a higher effective temperature. Interestingly, the effective temperature of the suspension, defined by the Einstein relation, exhibits a non-monotonic dependence on the driving frequency. Next, we follow the flux of particles between two such suspensions in diffusive contact, starting from a uniform density and relaxing to a state with zero net particle flux. The density remains uniform for systems with different frequencies but equal effective temperatures. At high driving frequencies, we show that the density distribution at steady state is determined by equating the ratio of the chemical potential to the effective temperature in both systems, mirroring thermal equilibrium behavior.</description>

      <title>Tailoring asymmetry for anisotropic friction in kirigami metamaterial skins with pop-up folding hinges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01338v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kirigami metamaterial sheets and tubes, owing to their capacity to undergo large elastic deformations while developing three-dimensional surface textures, have enormous potential as skins for soft robots. Here, we propose to use kirigami skins with folding hinges in this same context. These recently-introduced kirigami feature counter-rotating panels connected by pop-up folding hinges. So far, researchers have only explored auxetic and highly-symmetric versions of such patterns. Yet, some of these attributes have to be relaxed in order to explore their full potential as robotic skins. Thus, we parameterize these patterns and relax symmetry constraints, with the goal of using this same platform to obtain a wide range of shape-morphing behaviors. We derive kinematic formulas to explore the vast symmetry-enabled design space. We then use numerical simulations and experiments to validate the kinematic predictions and to explore the morphing mechanics of tubular skins. Finally, via experiments, we provide preliminary evidence of the anisotropic friction enabled by patterns with asymmetric pop-ups. We therefore demonstrate that it is possible to tailor parameters in kirigami with folding hinges to obtain skins that globally expand or contract due to axial elongation, and that present asymmetric pop-ups that yield anisotropic friction -- the most desired attribute for one-way locomotion of soft robots.</description>

      <title>Long-range angular correlations of particle displacements at a plastic-to-elastic transition in jammed amorphous solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04138v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding how a flow turns into an amorphous solid is a fundamental challenge in statistical physics, during which no apparent structural ordering appears. In the athermal limit, the two states are connected by a well-defined jamming transition, near which the solid is marginally stable. A recent mechanical response screening theory proposes an additional transition above jamming, called a plastic-to-elastic transition here, separating anomalous and quasi-elastic mechanical behavior. Through numerical inflation simulations in two dimensions, we show that the onsets of long-range radial and angular correlations of particle displacements decouple, occurring respectively at the jamming and plastic-to-elastic transitions. The latter is characterized by a power-law diverging correlation angle and a power-law spectrum of the displacements along a circle. This work establishes two-step transitions on the mechanical properties during ``decompression melting'' of an athermal over-jammed amorphous solid, reminiscent of the two-step structural melting of a crystal in two dimensions. In contradistinction with the latter, the plastic-to-elastic transition exists also in three dimensions.</description>

      <title>Contactless measurements of the elastic modulus of living cells using thermal fluctuations of atomic force microscope cantilever</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01095v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a contactless method for measuring the elastic modulus of living cells (human triple-negative breast cancer, MDA-MB-231) from the thermal fluctuations of an atomic force microscope (AFM) cantilever. By analyzing the power spectral density (PSD) of the cantilevers thermal fluctuations, we obtain the resonance frequencies of its first three modes at various cell to cantilever separation distances. By comparing measurements on living cells with those on a rigid borosilicate sphere of the same size, we extract the frequency shift caused by the elasto-hydrodynamic coupling between the cantilever fluctuations and the deformations of the cells. We then fit this frequency shift using an elasto-hydrodynamic model that integrates hydrodynamic forces and cell deformation. This approach allows us to determine the elastic modulus values of the living cells for the first three resonant frequencies of the cantilever.</description>

      <title>Inferring the Langevin Equation with Uncertainty via Bayesian Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01338v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pervasive across diverse domains, stochastic systems exhibit fluctuations in processes ranging from molecular dynamics to climate phenomena. The Langevin equation has served as a common mathematical model for studying such systems, enabling predictions of their temporal evolution and analyses of thermodynamic quantities, including absorbed heat, work done on the system, and entropy production. However, inferring the Langevin equation from observed trajectories is a challenging problem, and assessing the uncertainty associated with the inferred equation has yet to be accomplished. In this study, we present a comprehensive framework that employs Bayesian neural networks for inferring Langevin equations in both overdamped and underdamped regimes. Our framework first provides the drift force and diffusion matrix separately and then combines them to construct the Langevin equation. By providing a distribution of predictions instead of a single value, our approach allows us to assess prediction uncertainties, which can help prevent potential misunderstandings and erroneous decisions about the system. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in inferring Langevin equations for various scenarios including a neuron model and microscopic engine, highlighting its versatility and potential impact.</description>

      <title>Active Transport of Cargo-Carrying and Interconnected Chiral Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18703v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Directed motion up a concentration gradient is crucial for the survival and maintenance of numerous biological systems, such as sperms moving towards an egg during fertilization or ciliates moving towards a food source. In these systems, chirality - manifested as a rotational torque - plays a vital role in facilitating directed motion. While systematic studies of active molecules in activity gradients exist, the effect of chirality remains little studied. In this study, we examine the simplest case of a chiral active particle connected to a passive particle in a spatially varying activity field. We demonstrate that this minimal setup can exhibit rich emergent tactic behaviors, with the chiral torque serving as the tuning parameter. Notably, when the chiral torque is sufficiently large, even a small passive particle enables the system to display the desired accumulation behavior. Our results further show that in the dilute limit, this desired accumulation behavior persists despite the presence of excluded volume effects. Additionally, interconnected chiral active particles exhibit emergent chemotaxis beyond a critical chain length, with trimers and longer chains exhibiting strong accumulation at sufficiently high chiral torques. This study provides valuable insights into the design principles of hybrid bio-molecular devices of the future.</description>
