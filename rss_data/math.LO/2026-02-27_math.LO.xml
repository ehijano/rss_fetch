      <title>A Complete Bounded Theory with Unbounded Types</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One measure of the complexity of a first-order theory, and similarly a type, is the complexity of the formulas required to axiomatize it. We say a theory is bounded if there is an axiomatization involving only $\forall_n$-formulas for some finite $n$, and unbounded otherwise. One might expect bounded theories to have only bounded types. In fact, an analogue holds in infinitary logic, where the complexity of a Scott sentence roughly agrees with the complexity of the most complicated automorphism orbit. Our main result, however, shows this is not the case in the first-order setting: Namely, there can be a bounded theory, in fact $\forall_1$-axiomatizable, which has unbounded types.</description>

      <title>A $j$-translation with Kripke forcing relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a translation that combines the $j$-translation with Kripke forcing in the internal logic of an elementary topos. First, we show that our translation is sound for intuitionistic first-order logic and Heyting arithmetic. Furthermore, its interpretation in the effective topos provides an extension of the sheaf model of realizability introduced by de Jongh and Goodman. As an application, we systematically investigate translations of semi-classical axioms. Based on this investigation, we establish a separation result on semi-classical arithmetics, which cannot be obtained using the usual $j$-realizability.</description>

      <title>Distality in Ordered Abelian Groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.23256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a characterization of distal ordered abelian groups: An ordered abelian group is distal if and only if, for each prime number $p$, the sizes of ribs with respect to the "valuation" $\mathfrak{s}_p$ are uniformly bounded. This generalizes the distality criterion for ordered abelian groups with finite spines given by Aschenbrenner, Chernikov, Gehret, and Ziegler.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial Properties of the Raisonnier Filter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Raisonnier Filter is a combinatorial object isolated by Jean Raisonnier in order to simplify Shelah's proof that if all $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}^1_3$ sets are Lebesgue-measurable then there is an inner model with an inaccessible cardinal. In this paper, we study the combinatorics of a general version of the Raisonnier filter, with an eye to potential applications in descriptive set theory. Among the most interesting of our results is a partial converse to Raisonnier's theorem, which can be used to provide a new characterisation of the statement "all $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}^1_2$ sets are measurable". We also introduce an ideal on the Cantor Space induced by the Raisonnier filter and study its cardinal characteristics, connecting them to the well-known characteristics in Cicho\'n's Diagram.</description>

      <title>Generalized fluctuation bounds for stochastic algorithms in the presence of compactness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a convergence result for sequences of random variables taking values in a metric space that satisfy a stochastic quasi-Fej\'er monotonicity condition, in the context of a (local) compactness assumption. Our result is quantitative in that we derive an explicit and effective construction which, in terms of only a few moduli representing quantitative witnesses to key properties of the sequence of random variables and the underlying metric space involved, provides a metastable rate of pointwise convergence, a type of generalized fluctuation bound. That quantitative result in particular relies on the development of a finitary theory of martingales, culminating in a fully finitary Robbins-Siegmund theorem. We outline how this result particularises to the circumstances of the seminal work of Combettes and Pesquet on stochastic quasi-Fej\'er monotone sequences in separable Hilbert spaces, and we provide an initial application by illustrating how these results can be used to provide a metastable rate of pointwise convergence for a stochastic Krasnoselskii-Mann scheme solving a stochastic common fixed point problem for nonexpansive maps over proper Hadamard spaces. This work is set in the context of recent applications of the logic-based methodology of proof mining to probability theory, and represents its most sophisticated case study to date.</description>

      <title>Effectful Toposes and Their Lawvere-Tierney Topologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces effectful toposes as an extension of the effective topos and investigates their structure relative to Lawvere-Tierney topologies. First, we formulate effectful toposes by lifting the evidenced frame, which is a recently proposed model for effectful computation. Next, we define Lawvere-Tierney topologies on effectful toposes and characterize the sheaves on them. In the effective topos, Lawvere-Tierney topologies are known to correspond to computational oracles. Finally, to demonstrate that our result contributes to the connection between realizability relativized by oracles and effects, we show that the sheaf topos for the double negation topology is isomorphic to the effectful topos with the Continuation-Passing-Style effect; these toposes serve as a model of classical realizability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.23126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that one may approximate parametric suprema of constructible and power-constructible functions using functions within the same class. This resolves a conjecture by Adiceam and Cluckers, which was posited after studying a question posed by Sarnak. We apply our result to prove that a certain subclass of Cexp-class distributions is tempered and to make uniform a bound concerning pushforward measures.</description>

      <title>The logic of KM belief update is contained in the logic of AGM belief revision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For each axiom of KM belief update we provide a corresponding axiom in a modal logic containing three modal operators: a unimodal belief operator $B$, a bimodal conditional operator $&gt;$ and the unimodal necessity operator $\square$. We then compare the resulting logic to the similar logic obtained from converting the AGM axioms of belief revision into modal axioms and show that the latter contains the former. Denoting the latter by $\mathcal L_{AGM}$ and the former by $\mathcal L_{KM}$ we show that every axiom of $\mathcal L_{KM}$ is a theorem of $\mathcal L_{AGM}$. Thus AGM belief revision can be seen as a special case of KM belief update. For the strong version of KM belief update we show that the difference between $\mathcal L_{KM}$ and $\mathcal L_{AGM}$ can be narrowed down to a single axiom, which deals exclusively with unsurprising information, that is, with formulas that were not initially disbelieved.</description>

      <title>Ax-Kochen-Ershov principles for finitely ramified henselian fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.12145v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the model theory of finitely ramified henselian valued fields of fixed initial ramification, obtaining versions of the Ax-Kochen-Ershov principle as follows. We identify the induced structure on the residue field and show that once the residue field is endowed with this structure, the theory of the valued field is determined by the theories of the enriched residue field and the value group. Similarly, we show that the existential theory of the valued field is determined by the positive existential theory of the enriched residue field. We also prove that an embedding of finitely ramified henselian valued fields is existentially closed as soon as the induced embeddings of value group and residue field are existentially closed. This last result requires no enrichment of the residue field, in analogy to the corresponding result for model completeness, which holds by results of Ershov and Ziegler.</description>

Abstract: We present a new fragment of axiomatic set theory for pure sets and for the iteration of power sets within given transitive sets. It turns out that this formal system admits an interesting hierarchy of models with true membership relation and with only finite or countably infinite ordinals. Still a considerable part of mathematics can be formalized within this system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14516v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Assuming that no family of polynomial-size Boolean circuits can factorize a constant fraction of all products of two $n$-bit primes, we show that the bounded arithmetic theory $\text{PV}_1$, even when augmented by the sharply bounded choice scheme $BB(\Sigma^b_0)$, cannot prove that every number has some prime divisor. By the completeness theorem, it follows that under this assumption there is a model $M$ of $\text{PV}_1$ that contains a nonstandard number $m$ which has no prime factorization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13524v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Joel Hamkins asks whether there is a $\Pi^0_1$-formula $\rho(x)$ such that $\rho(\phi)$ is independent over ${\sf PA}+\phi$, if this theory is consistent, where this construction is extensional in $\phi$ with respect to ${\sf PA}$-provable equivalence. We show that there can be no such extensional Rosser formula of any complexity. We give a positive answer to Hamkins' question for the case where we replace Extensionality by a weaker demand *Consistent Extensionality*. We also prove that we can demand the negation of $\rho$ to be $\Pi^0_1$-conservative, if we ask for the still weaker *Conditional Extensionality*. We show that an intensional version of the result for Conditional Extensionality cannot work.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15680v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop dimension theoretic methods for propositional team based logics. Such quantitative methods were defined for team based first-order logic in a recent paper by Hella, Luosto and the third author and were used to obtain strong hierarchy results in the first-order logic context. We show that in propositional logic and in several important cases, a team theoretical atom can be expressed in terms of atoms of lower arity. We estimate the `price' of such a reduction of arity, i.e. how much more complicated the new expression is. Our estimates involve as parameters the arity of the atoms involved, as well as the number of times the atom occurs in a formula. We also consider new variants of atoms and propositional operations, inspired by our work. We believe that our quantitative analysis leads to a deeper understanding of the scope and limits of propositional team based logic.</description>

Abstract: We show that a circle and square of the same area in $\mathbb{R}^2$ are equidecomposable by translations using $\mathbf{\Delta}^0_2$ pieces. That is, pieces which are simultaneously $F_\sigma$ and $G_\delta$ sets. This improves a result of M\'ath\'e-Noel-Pikhurko and is the best possible complexity in terms of the Borel hierarchy. More generally we show that bounded sets $A,B \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ with small enough boundaries and the same nonzero Lebesgue measure are equidecomposable with pieces that are countable unions of finite Boolean combinations of translates of $A,B$, and open sets. The improvement comes from constructions of low complexity toasts and related objects which should be independently useful within Borel combinatorics.</description>

Abstract: We answer a recent question of Cs\'oka and Vidny\'anszky [arXiv:2407.10006] and give an alternate proof of one of their results. The subject of both is which finite graphs admit factor of i.i.d. homomorphisms from the 3-regular tree. We then give yet another proof of the result in the Borel setting which leads to the following: For each $d &gt; 2$ and $k \in \mathbb{N}$, there is a Borel hyperfinite $d$-regular forest $G$ and a finite graph with chromatic number $k$, $H$, so that $G$ does not admit a Borel homomorphism to $H$. All of this is tied together by a focus on the case when the target graph $H$ is a (subgraph of a) Kneser graph.</description>

      <title>Rigid many-one degrees contain infinite antichains of $1$-degrees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19960v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Odifreddi asked whether every non-irreducible many-one degree must contain an infinite antichain of one-one degrees. Positive answers are known for computably enumerable many-one degrees (Degtev) and, more recently, for many-one degrees admitting a $\Delta^0_2$ representative (Batyrshin). In this note we isolate a rigidity principle behind these phenomena.
  Call a set $A\subseteq\omega$ \emph{$m$-rigid} if every total computable $m$-autoreduction of $A$ is eventually the identity. We prove that if $A$ is $m$-rigid, then its many-one degree $\deg_m(A)$ contains an infinite antichain of $1$-degrees. The proof uses a uniform duplication construction: for each computable parameter $S$ we define $B_S\equiv_m A$ so that any injective reduction $B_S\le_1 B_T$ induces an $m$-autoreduction of $A$ and therefore forces $S\subseteq^{*}T$. Choosing an almost-inclusion infinite antichain of computable sets yields the desired infinite $1$-antichain inside $\deg_m(A)$.
  As applications, Jockusch's rigidity theorem implies that every $1$-generic set is $m$-rigid, giving a comeager family of positive instances. Moreover, $m$-rigidity holds with Lebesgue measure $1$ (indeed, every Martin-L\"of random real is $m$-rigid). Consequently, Odifreddi's Question~5 has a positive answer \emph{with probability $1$} for a fair-coin random $A\in 2^\omega$; any counterexample (if it exists) is confined to a null set (and, by genericity, also to a meager set).</description>

      <title>Automorphisms of valued Hahn groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.06290v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hahn groups endowed with the canonical valuation play a fundamental role in the classification of valued abelian groups. In this paper we study the group of valuation (respectively order) preserving automorphisms of a Hahn group $G$. Under the assumption that $G$ satisfies some lifting property, we prove a structure theorem decomposing the automorphism group into a semidirect product of two notable subgroups. We characterise a class of Hahn groups satisfying the aforementioned lifting property. For some special cases we provide a matrix description of the automorphism group.</description>

      <title>Prover-Adversary games for systems over (non-deterministic) branching programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16014v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce Pudlak-Buss style Prover-Adversary games to characterise proof systems reasoning over deterministic branching programs (BPs) and non-deterministic branching programs (NBPs). Our starting points are the proof systems eLDT and eLNDT, for BPs and NBPs respectively, previously introduced by Buss, Das and Knop. We prove polynomial equivalences between these proof systems and the corresponding games we introduce. This crucially requires access to a form of negation of branching programs which, for NBPs, requires us to formalise a non-uniform version of the Immerman-Szelepcsenyi theorem that coNL = NL. Thanks to the techniques developed, we further obtain a proof complexity theoretic version of Immerman-Szelepcsenyi, showing that eLNDT is polynomially equivalent to systems over boundedly alternating branching programs.</description>

      <title>Complexity Results in Team Semantics: Nonemptiness Is Not So Complex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08122v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We initiate the study of the complexity-theoretic properties of convex logics in team semantics. We focus on the extension of classical propositional logic with the nonemptiness atom NE, a logic known to be both convex and union closed. We show that the satisfiability problem for this logic is NP-complete, that its validity problem is coNP-complete, and that its model-checking problem is in P.</description>
