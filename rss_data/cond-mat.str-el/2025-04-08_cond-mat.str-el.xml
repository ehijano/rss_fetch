      <title>Flux attachment theory of fractional excitonic insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The search for fractional quantized Hall phases in the absence of a magnetic field has primarily targeted flat-band systems that mimic the features of a Landau level. In an alternative approach, the fractional excitonic insulator (FEI) has been proposed as a correlated electron-hole fluid that arises near a band inversion between bands of different angular momentum with strong interactions. It remains an interesting challenge to find Hamiltonians with realistic interactions that stabilize this state. Here, we describe composite boson and composite fermion theories that highlight the importance of $(p_x+ip_y)^m$ excitonic pairing in stabilizing FEIs in a class of band inversion models. We predict a sequence of Jain-like and Laughlin-like FEI states, the simplest of which has the topological order of the bosonic $\nu=1/2$ fractional quantized Hall state. We discuss implications for recent numerical studies on a chiral spin liquid phase in interacting Chern insulator models.</description>

      <title>Field-tunable quantum disordered ground state in the triangular-lattice antiferromagnet TlYbSe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the triangular-lattice antiferromagnet TlYbSe2 belonging to the rare-earth delafossite family with a relatively disorder-free frustrated triangular lattice - extending the search for the quintessential chiral quantum spin liquid state. While DC magnetization suggests magnetic exchange interactions in the order of several kelvin, the zero-field AC magnetization and heat capacity measurements reveal no signs of long-range magnetic order down to 20 mK, indicating a highly frustrated quantum-disordered ground state. The high-field AC magnetization reveals a phase diagram generally consistent with a large family of Yb delafossites. We observe a spin glass transition around 35 mK at zero field, which we argue is due to free spins. A broad anomaly in the heat capacity measurements between 2 - 5 K - indicative of short-range spin correlations - along with a linear temperature dependence at low temperatures and the complete absence of long-range order at low fields, establishes the low-temperature, low-field regime of TlYbSe2 as a prime location for exploring field-tunable QSL behavior.</description>

      <title>Electron-magnon dynamics triggered by an ultrashort laser pulse: A real-time Dual $GW$ study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrafast irradiation of correlated electronic systems triggers complex dynamics involving quasi-particle excitations, doublons, charge carriers, and spin fluctuations. To describe these effects, we develop an efficient non-equilibrium approach, dubbed D-$GW$, that enables a self-consistent treatment of local correlations within dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) and spatial charge and spin fluctuations, that are accounted for simultaneously within a diagrammatic framework. The method is formulated in the real-time domain and provides direct access to single- and two-particle momentum- and energy-dependent response functions without the need for analytical continuation, which is required in Matsubara frequency-based approaches. We apply the D-$GW$ method to investigate the dynamics of a photo-excited extended Hubbard model, the minimal system that simultaneously hosts strong charge and spin fluctuations. Focusing on the challenging parameter regime near the Mott transition, we demonstrate that correlated metals and narrow-gap Mott insulators undergo distinct thermalization processes involving complex energy transfer between single-particle and collective electronic excitations.</description>

      <title>Magnetic polaron formation in EuZn$_2$P$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Colossal magnetoresistance (CMR) has been observed across many Eu$^{2+}$-based materials; however, its origin is not completely understood. Here we investigate the antiferromagnetic insulator EuZn$_2$P$_2$ through single crystal x-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, electrical transport, magnetization, dilatometry, and electron spin resonance measurements complemented by density functional theory calculations. Our electrical resistivity data reveal a large negative magnetoresistance, $MR = [R(H)-R(0)]/R(0)$, that reaches $MR = -99.7\%$ at 9~T near the antiferromagnetic ordering temperature $T_N=23\ \text{K}$. Dilatometry measurements show an accompanying field-induced lattice strain. Additionally, Eu$^{2+}$ electron spin resonance reveals a strong ferromagnetic exchange interaction between Eu$^{2+}$ and conduction electrons. Our experimental results in EuZn$_2$P$_2$ are consistent with a magnetic polaron scenario and suggest magnetic polaron formation as a prevailing explanation of CMR in Eu$^{2+}$-based compounds.</description>

      <title>Multipolar Phase Transition in the 4$f^2$ fcc lattice compound PrCdNi$_{4}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transport and magnetic properties of a 4$f^{2}$ fcc lattice compound, PrCdNi$_4$, were studied. The magnetic susceptibility, $\chi(T)$, follows the Curie--Weiss law from 300 K to 20 K, as expected for a free Pr$^{3+}$ ion. As the temperature decreases below 5 K, $\chi(T)$ approaches a constant, indicating van-Vleck paramagnetic behavior. The specific heat, $C(T)$, displays a broad shoulder at around 4 K, which can be reproduced by a doublet triplet two-level model with an energy gap of 12 K. These results suggest a non-magnetic $\Gamma_3$ doublet ground state of the Pr$^{3+}$ ion in the cubic crystalline electric field. $C(T)$ exhibits a peak at $T_{\rm O}$ = 1.0 K and this peak remains robust against magnetic fields up to 5 T. In powder neutron diffraction measurements, no magnetic reflection was observed at 0.32 K $&lt;$ $T_{\rm O}$. Two anomalies at $B$ = 2.1 and 5.3 T in magnetoresistance $\rho(B)$ at 0.05 K likely originate from switching in the order parameter. These results suggest that the phase transition at $T_{\rm O}$ is ascribed to an antiferro-type order of the electric quadrupole or magnetic octupole of the $\Gamma_3$ doublet in the 4$f^2$ fcc lattice.</description>

      <title>Testing the parquet equations and the U(1) Ward identity for real-frequency correlation functions from the multipoint numerical renormalization group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, it has become possible to compute real-frequency four-point correlation functions of quantum impurity models using a multipoint extension of the numerical renormalization group (mpNRG). In this work, we perform several numerical consistency checks of the output of mpNRG by investigating exact relations between two- and four-point functions. This includes the Bethe-Salpeter equations and the Schwinger-Dyson equation from the parquet formalism, which we evaluate in two formally identical but numerically nonequivalent ways. We also study the first-order U(1) Ward identity between the vertex and the self-energy, which we derive for the first time in full generality in the real-frequency Keldysh formalism. We generally find good agreement of all relations, often up to a few percent, both at weak and at strong interaction.</description>

      <title>Exchange-Biased multi-ring Planar Hall Magnetoresistive Sensors with nT resolution in Non-Shielded Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Planar Hall magnetoresistive sensors (PHMR) are promising candidates for various magnetic sensing applications due to their high sensitivity, low power consumption, and compatibility with integrated circuit technology. However, their performance is often limited by inherent noise sources, impacting their resolution and overall sensitivity. Here the effect of three bilayer structures NiFe(10 nm)/IrMn(10 nm), NiFe(30 nm)/IrMn(10 nm), and NiFe(30 nm)/IrMn(20 nm) on noise levels is investigated at low-frequency (DC - 25 Hz). This study includes a detailed investigation on the optimization process and noise characteristics of multiring PHMR sensors, focusing on identifying and quantifying the dominant noise sources. The experimental measurements are complemented by a theoretical analysis of noise sources including thermal noise, 1/f noise, intermixing and environmental noise. The best magnetic resolution is observed for the NiFe(30 nm)/IrMn(10 nm) structure, which achieves a detectivity below 1.5 nT/sqrt(Hz) at 10 Hz in a non-shielded environment at room temperature. In addition, a substantial improvement in sensitivity is observed by annealing the sensors at 250 deg C for 1 hour. The findings of this study contribute to a deeper understanding of noise behavior in PHMR sensors, paving the way for developing strategies to improve their performance for demanding sensing applications at low frequencies.</description>

      <title>Characteristic exciton energy scales in antiferromagnetic NiPS$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional antiferromagnets are promising materials for spintronics. The van der Waals antiferromagnet NiPS$_3$ has attracted extensive interest due to its ultra-narrow exciton feature which is closely linked with the magnetic ordering. Here, we use time-resolved terahertz spectroscopy to investigate photo-excited carriers in NiPS$_3$. We identify the onset of interband transitions and estimate the exciton dissociation energy from the excitation wavelength and fluence dependence of the transient spectral weight. Our results provide key insights to quantify the exciton characteristics and validate the band structure for NiPS$_3$.</description>

      <title>Fast summation of fermionic Feynman diagrams beyond Bravais Lattices and on-site Hubbard interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We designed new algorithms for summing bold-line Feynman diagrams in arbitrary channels, where it can be readily modified for bare interaction series as well. When applied to magnetic channel bold-line series with on-site Hubbard interactions, the algorithm achieves competitive performance compared with the state-of-art RPADet. We then generalize it beyond square lattice and on-site Hubbard interactions and achieve better scaling in the number of sites within a unit cell, while there is substantial increase when there are more types of interactions. This work paves the way of diagrammatic Monte Carlo simulations for real materials, holding the premise for a robust replacement of state-of-art simulation tools in the thermodynamical limit.</description>

      <title>Interplay between trimer structure and magnetic ground state in Ba5Ru3O12 probed by Neutron and muSR techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a detailed inelastic neutron scattering (INS) and muon spin relaxation (muSR) investigations of a trimer Ruthenate Ba5Ru3O12 system, which undergoes long-range antiferromagnetic ordering at TN = 60 K. The INS reveals two distinct spin-wave excitations below TN : one around 5.6 meV and the other at 10 to 15 meV. The coexistence of such excitations at both low and high momentum transfer regions is speculated to be strong electronic correlation and spin-phonon coupling of Ruthenium. By accompanying the INS spectra based on a linear spin wave theory using SpinW software, we show that Ba5Ru3O12 exhibits spin frustration due to competing exchange interactions between neighboring and next-neighboring Ru-moments, exchange anisotropy and strong spin-orbit coupling, which yields a non-collinear spin structure, in contrast to other ruthenate trimers in this series. Interestingly, these magnetic excitations does not completely vanish even at high temperatures above TN , evidencing short-range magnetic correlations in this trimer system. This is further supported by muSR spectroscopy, which exhibits a gradual drop in the initial asymmetry around the magnetic phase transition and is further verified through maximum entropy analysis. The results of muSR spectroscopy indicates a dynamic nature of magnetic order, attributed to local magnetic anisotropy within the trimer as a result of local structural distortion and different hybridization, consistent with canted spin-structure. We predict the ground state of Ru3O12-isolated trimer through theoretical calculations which agree with the experimentally observed spin excitation.</description>

      <title>Coexistence of magnetic and dielectric glassy states in alternating kagome and triangular lattice LuBaCo$_4$O$_7$ cobaltite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To date, the alternating kagome and triangular lattice cobaltites, RBaCo$_4$O$_7$ (R = Ca, Y, and rare earth elements), have been well studied for their large structural distortions, anisotropic exchange interactions, chiral spin liquid states, and giant multiferroic properties. Here, we report the co-existence of magnetic and dielectric glassy states in LuBaCo$_4$O$_7$ below 50 K. AC magnetization studies show an absence of conventional spin-freezing behavior. The cooling and heating in unequal fields (CHUF), thermal cycling, and time-dependent magnetization measurements at low temperature ($T$) show the presence of magnetic glassy state. The $T$-dependent dielectric constant $\epsilon'$ measurements exhibit a strong frequency-independent response at the first-order structural phase transition $T = 160$ K (trigonal $P31c$ to monoclinic $Cc$) and also significant features at the $T = 110$ K (monoclinic $Cc$ to orthorhombic $Pbn2_1$) phase transition. Further, $\epsilon'$ shows a frequency-independent peak at 43 K ($Pbn2_1$) and also dipolar glassy features below 20 K ($Cc$). The non-equilibrium magnetic glassy dynamics and dipolar glassy state at low-$T$ arises from the kinetic arrest of $Cc$ and $Pbn2_1$ phases. From the dielectric probe, we are able to clearly distinguish the kinetically arrested phases at low-$T$ , whereas the bulk magnetization studies are unable to do so as the arrested phases have low magnetic moments.</description>

      <title>Antiferromagnetism and spin excitations in a two-dimensional non-Hermitian Hatano-Nelson flux model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The one-dimensional Hatano-Nelson model with non-reciprocal hoppings is a prominent example of a relatively simple non-Hermitian quantum-mechanical system, which allows to study various phenomena in open quantum systems without adding extra gain and loss terms. Here we propose to use it as a building block to construct a correlated non-Hermitian Hamiltonian in two dimensions. It has the characteristic form of a flux model with clock-anticlockwise non-reciprocal hopping on each plaquette. Adding the on-site Hubbard type interaction we analyze the formation of the longe-range antiferromagnetic order and its spin excitations. Such a model is non-Hermitian, but $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric, which leads to the existence of two regions: a region of unbroken $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry (real-valued spectrum) and a region of broken $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry with exceptional lines and complex-valued energy spectrum. The transition from one region to another is controlled by the value of the on-site interaction parameter and coincides with the metal-insulator transition. We also analyze the spin wave spectrum, which is characterized by two diffusive d-wave type of modes corresponding to gain and loss.</description>

      <title>Coexistence of ergodic and non-ergodic behavior and level spacing statistics in a one-dimensional model of a flat band superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09196v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by recent studies of the projected dice lattice Hamiltonian [K. Swaminathan et al., Phys. Rev. Research 5, 043215 (2023)], we introduce the on-site/bond singlet (OBS) model, a one-dimensional model of a flat band superconductor, in order to better understand the quasiparticle localization and interesting coexistence of ergodic and non-ergodic behavior present in the former model. The OBS model is the sum of terms that have direct counterparts in the projected dice lattice Hamiltonian, each of which is parameterized by a coupling constant. Exact diagonalization reveals that the energy spectrum and non-equilibrium dynamics of the OBS model are essentially the same as that of the dice lattice for some values of the coupling constants. The quasiparticle localization and breaking of ergodicity manifest in a striking manner in the level spacing distribution. Its near Poissonian form provides evidence for the existence of local integrals of motion and establishes the OBS model as a non-trivial integrable generalization of the projected Creutz ladder Hamiltonian. These results show that level spacing statistics is a promising tool to study quasiparticle excitations in flat band superconductors.</description>

      <title>Subexponential decay of local correlations from diffusion-limited dephasing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chaotic quantum systems at finite energy density are expected to act as their own heat baths, rapidly dephasing local quantum superpositions. We argue that in fact this dephasing is subexponential for chaotic dynamics with conservation laws in one spatial dimension: all local correlation functions decay as stretched exponentials or slower. The stretched exponential bound is saturated for operators that are orthogonal to all hydrodynamic modes. This anomalous decay is a quantum coherent effect, which lies beyond standard fluctuating hydrodynamics; it vanishes in the presence of extrinsic dephasing. Our arguments are general, subject principally to the assumption that there exist zero-entropy charge sectors (such as the particle vacuum) with no nontrivial dynamics: slow relaxation is due to the persistence of regions resembling these inert vacua, which we term "voids". In systems with energy conservation, this assumption is automatically satisfied because of the third law of thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Topologically correlated bound states via a dynamical gauge field</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in topological phases have opened new frontiers in materials science and quantum physics. However, their emergence in strongly correlated systems are less understood due to the complex interplay between particle interactions and band topology. In this work, we consider a cold-atom-based spin-dependent Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model with a non-Hermitian dynamical gauge field (DGF), where two kinds of topologically correlated bound states are found to emerge from the DGF. Specifically, edge bound states with co-localization of both spin species arise from the interplay between DGF and nontrivial single-particle topology, and bulk bound states with extended distribution in the lattice emerges from nontrivial topology of inter-species band inversion. These bound states can coexist in same parameter regimes and compete with each other, leading to distinguished dynamical signatures. This work bridges the gap between conventional band topology and strongly correlated physics, establishing a new paradigm for discovering emergent topological phenomena in quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Theory of scanning tunneling spectroscopy beyond one-electron molecular orbitals: can we image molecular orbitals?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05896v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interpretation of experimental spatially resolved scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) maps of close-shell molecules on surfaces is usually interpreted within the framework of oneelectron molecular orbitals. Although this standard practice often gives relatively good agreement with experimental data, it contradicts one of the basic assumptions of quantum mechanics, postulating the impossibility of direct observation of the wavefunction, i.e., individual molecular orbitals. The scanning probe community often considers this contradiction about observing molecular orbitals as a philosophical question rather than a genuine problem. Moreover, in the case of polyradical strongly correlated molecules, the interpretation of STS maps based on one-electron molecular orbitals often fails. Thus, for a precise interpretation of STS maps and their connection to the electronic structure of molecules, a theoretical description, including non-equilibrium tunneling processes going beyond one-electron process, is required. In this contribution, we first show why, in selected cases, it is possible to achieve good agreement with experimental data based on one-electron canonical molecular orbitals and Tersoff-Hamann approximation. Next, we will show that for an accurate interpretation of strongly correlated molecules, it is necessary to describe the process of removing/adding an electron within the formalism of many-electron wavefunctions for the neutral and charged states. This can be accomplished by the concept of so-called Dyson orbitals.</description>

      <title>Factorizing Defects from Generalized Pinning Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce generalized pinning fields in conformal field theory that model a large class of critical impurities at large distance, enriching the familiar universality classes. We provide a rigorous definition of such defects as certain unbounded operators on the Hilbert space and prove that when inserted on codimension-one surfaces they factorize the spacetime into two halves. The factorization channels are further constrained by symmetries in the bulk. As a corollary, we solve such critical impurities in the 2d minimal models and establish the factorization phenomena previously observed for localized mass deformations in the 3d ${\rm O}(N)$ model.</description>

      <title>Signatures of Candidate States of $\nu=12/5$ in Shot Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states are highly sought after because of their ability to host non-abelian anyons, whose braiding statistics make them excellent candidates for qubits in topological quantum computing. Multiple theoretical studies on the $\nu=\frac{12}{5}$ FQH state predict various quasi-particle states hosted by the $\frac{12}{5}$ plateau, which include $\mathbb Z_3$ parafermions and Majorana modes. In this work, we provide a systematic protocol to distinguish among four possible candidate wavefunctions of the $\frac{12}{5}$ plateau using zero-frequency short noise experiments on a filter-geometry. Qualitative comparisons of Fano-Factors provide a robust way to predict the candidate state across both the full and partial thermal equilibration regimes without prior knowledge of the experimental information, like thermal equilibration length, to allow for more realistic experiments.</description>

      <title>Moir\'e enhanced flat band in rhombohedral graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The fractional quantum anomalous Hall effect (FQAHE) is a fascinating emergent quantum state characterized by fractionally charged excitations in the absence of magnetic field,which could arise from the intricate interplay between electron correlation, nontrivial topology and spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking. Recently, FQAHE has been realized in aligned rhombohedral pentalayer graphene on BN superlattice (aligned R5G/BN), where the topological flat band is modulated by the moir\'e potential. However, intriguingly, the FQAHE is observed only when electrons are pushed away from the moir\'e interface. The apparently opposite implications from these experimental observations, along with different theoretical models, have sparked intense debates regarding the role of the moir\'e potential. Unambiguous experimental observation of the topological flat band as well as moir\'e bands with energy and momentum resolved information is therefore critical to elucidate the underlying mechanism. Here by performing nanospot angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (NanoARPES) measurements, we directly reveal the topological flat band electronic structures of R5G, from which key hopping parameters essential for determining the fundamental electronic structure of rhombohedral graphene are extracted. Moreover, a comparison of electronic structures between aligned and non-aligned samples reveals that the moir\'e potential plays a pivotal role in enhancing the topological flat band in the aligned sample. Our study provides experimental guiding lines to narrow down the phase space of rhombohedral graphene, laying an important foundation for understanding exotic quantum phenomena in this emerging platform.</description>

      <title>Low energy electrodynamics and a hidden Fermi liquid in the heavy-fermion CeCoIn$_5$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.10916v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present time-domain THz spectroscopy of thin films of the heavy-fermion superconductor CeCoIn$_5$. Below the $\approx$ 40 K Kondo coherence temperature, a narrow Drude-like peak forms, as the result of the $f$ orbital - conduction electron hybridization and the formation of the heavy-fermion state. The complex optical conductivity is analyzed through a Drude model and extended Drude model analysis. Via the extended Drude model analysis, we measure the frequency-dependent scattering rate ($1/ \tau $) and effective mass ($m^*/m_b$). This scattering rate shows a linear dependence on temperature, which matches the dependence of the resistivity as expected. Nevertheless, the width of the low-frequency Drude peak itself that is set by the {\it renormalized} quasiparticle scattering rate ($1 / \tau^* = m_b/ m^* \tau $) shows a $T^2$ dependence. This is the scattering rate that characterizes the relaxation time of the renormalized quasiparticles. This gives evidence for Fermi liquid state, which in conventional transport experiments is hidden by the strong temperature dependent mass.</description>

      <title>Ground State Phase Diagram of $\text{SU}(3)$ $t$-$J$ Chain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09344v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Distinct from the $\text{SU}(2)$ case, the fermionic systems with $\text{SU}(N)$ symmetry are expected to exhibit novel physics, such as exotic singlet formation. Using the density matrix renormalization group technique, we obtain the ground state phase diagram of the $\text{SU}(3)$ $t$-$J$ chain for density $n&lt;1$. The ground state phase diagram includes the Luttinger liquid, the extended Luther-Emery liquid characterized by a spin gap, and the phase separation state. We quantitatively assess the characteristics of the three phases by measuring spin gap, compressibility, various correlation functions and structure factors. We further study the extended Luther-Emery liquid phase and discover molecular superfluid quasi-long-range order. The mechanism of the molecular superfluid is the combination of three $\text{SU}(3)$ fermions on sites that are not completely connected. Accordingly, we can speculate the behavior of the $\text{SU}(N)$ $t$-$J$ chain model with larger $N$ values, operating within the same filling regime.</description>

      <title>Lattice T-duality from non-invertible symmetries in quantum spin chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18606v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dualities of quantum field theories are challenging to realize in lattice models of qubits. In this work, we explore one of the simplest dualities, T-duality of the compact boson CFT, and its realization in quantum spin chains. In the special case of the XX model, we uncover an exact lattice T-duality, which is associated with a non-invertible symmetry that exchanges two lattice U(1) symmetries. The latter symmetries flow to the momentum and winding U(1) symmetries with a mixed anomaly in the CFT. However, the charge operators of the two U(1) symmetries do not commute on the lattice and instead generate the Onsager algebra. We discuss how some of the anomalies in the CFT are nonetheless still exactly realized on the lattice and how the lattice U(1) symmetries enforce gaplessness. We further explore lattice deformations preserving both U(1) symmetries and find a rich gapless phase diagram with special $\mathrm{Spin}(2k)_1$ WZW model points and whose phase transitions all have dynamical exponent ${z&gt;1}$.</description>

      <title>Magnetism in symmetry-enforced nodal-line semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12187v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nodal-line semimetals (NLSMs) harbor a variety of novel physical properties owing to the particularities of the band degeneracies that characterize the spectrum of these materials. In symmetry-enforced NLSMs, band degeneracies, being imposed by symmetries, are robust to arbitrarily strong perturbations that preserve the symmetries. We investigate the effects of electron-electron interactions on a recently proposed vacancy-engineered NLSM known as holey graphene. Using mean-field calculations and quantum Monte Carlo simulation, we show that the Hubbard model on the depleted holey-graphene lattice at half-filling exhibits a transition from a NLSM to an insulating antiferromagnetic phase for an arbitrarily weak repulsive interaction $U$. In contrast to the semi-metal-insulator transition in the pristine honeycomb lattice, which occurs at a finite critical value of $U$, in the depleted lattice, the transition at $U=0$ is associated with a van Hove singularity arising from the crossing of accidental nodal lines enforced by symmetry. We also employ linear spin wave theory (LSWT) to the effective Heisenberg model in the strong-coupling limit and obtain the global antiferromagnetic order parameter $m_{\rm AFM} \approx 0.146$. The order parameters from both QMC and LSWT agree quantitatively. Our findings indicate that vacancy engineering offers an effective way to tailor the magnetic properties of quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Automated evaluation of imaginary time strong coupling diagrams by sum-of-exponentials hybridization fitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19727v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an efficient separation of variables algorithm for the evaluation of imaginary time Feynman diagrams appearing in the bold pseudo-particle strong coupling expansion of the Anderson impurity model. The algorithm uses a fitting method based on AAA rational approximation and numerical optimization to obtain a sum-of-exponentials expansion of the hybridization function, which is then used to decompose the diagrams. A diagrammatic formulation of the algorithm leads to an automated procedure for diagrams of arbitrary order and topology. We also present methods of stabilizing the self-consistent solution of the pseudo-particle Dyson equation. The result is a low-cost and high-order accurate impurity solver for quantum embedding methods using general multi-orbital hybridization functions at low temperatures, appropriate for low-to-intermediate expansion orders. In addition to other benchmark examples, we use our solver to perform a dynamical mean-field theory study of a minimal model of the strongly correlated compound Ca$_2$RuO$_4$, describing the anti-ferromagnetic transition and the in- and out-of-plane anisotropy induced by spin-orbit coupling.</description>

      <title>Classifying fermionic states via many-body correlation measures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.07956v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the structure of quantum correlations in a many-body system is key to its computational treatment. For fermionic systems, correlations can be defined as deviations from Slater determinant states. The link between fermionic correlations and efficient computational physics methods is actively studied but remains ambiguous. We make progress in establishing this connection mathematically. In particular, we find a rigorous classification of states relative to $k$-fermion correlations, which admits a computational physics interpretation. Correlations are captured by a measure $\omega_k$, a function of $k$-fermion reduced density matrix that we call twisted purity. A condition $\omega_k=0$ for a given $k$ puts the state in a class $G_k$ of correlated states. Sets $G_k$ are nested in $k$, and Slater determinants correspond to $k = 1$. Classes $G_{k=O(1)}$ are shown to be physically relevant, as $\omega_k$ vanishes or nearly vanishes for truncated configuration-interaction states, perturbation series around Slater determinants, and some nonperturbative eigenstates of the 1D Hubbard model. For each $k = O(1)$, we give an explicit ansatz with a polynomial number of parameters that covers all states in $G_k$. Potential applications of this ansatz and its connections to the coupled-cluster wavefunction are discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17523v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We adapt the precise definition of the flowing effective action in order to obtain a functional flow equation with simple properties close to physical intuition. The simplified flow equation is invariant under local gauge transformations and suitable for both euclidean and Minkowski signature and analytic continuation. The cutoff always removes fluctuations close to zeros of the inverse full propagator. A formulation of the simplified flow equation in terms of renormalized scale invariant fields permits direct access to scaling solutions and associated fixed points. Our setting is based on a particular choice of cutoff function which depends on the macroscopic fields. Corrections to the simplified flow equation involve a field-dependent modification of the cutoff for which we discuss a systematic expansion. Truncated solutions for a scalar field theory in four dimensions suggest a new fixed point with a field-dependent coefficient of the kinetic term.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15883v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe a class of spin chains with new physical and computational properties. On the physical side, the spin chains give examples of symmetry-protected topological phases that are defined by non-onsite symmetries, i.e. symmetries that are not a tensor product of single-site operators. These phases can be detected by string-order parameters, but notably do not exhibit entanglement spectrum degeneracy. On the computational side, the spin chains represent a new class of states that can be used to deterministically teleport information across long distances, with the novel property that the necessary classical side processing is a non-linear function of the measurement outcomes. We also give examples of states that can serve as universal resources for measurement-based quantum computation, providing the first examples of such resources without entanglement spectrum degeneracy. The key tool in our analysis is a new kind of tensor network representation which we call split-index matrix product states (SIMPS). We develop the basic formalism of SIMPS, compare them to matrix product states, show how they are better equipped to describe certain kinds of non-onsite symmetries including anomalous symmetries, and discuss how they are also well-suited to describing quantum teleportation and constrained spin chains.</description>

Abstract: The transport property of cold and dense nucleon matter is important for nuclear physics but is relatively less studied than that at finite temperatures. In this paper, we present a primary study of bulk and shear viscosities in the limit $T/\mu_B \ll 1$, where $T$ and $\mu_B$ are the temperature and the baryon chemical potential. The analysis is performed for a generic system where nucleons are dressed by the condensation of both scalar and vector interactions. Under the relaxation time approximation of the Boltzmann equation, we compute the viscosities of the system to leading power in $T/\mu_B$ expansion and establish a relation between the thermodynamic potential and transport coefficients, including bulk viscosity ($\zeta$) and shear viscosity ($\eta$). It is found that hydrodynamic stability ($\zeta&gt;0$) imposes additional constraints on the thermodynamic potential. As an example, these relations are applied to the Walecka model. The fluid properties of the cold and dense nucleon matter are characterized by the dimensionless combination of viscosities times the quasi-Fermi momentum over the enthalpy. Furthermore, we discuss the implication of the stability condition on the range of applicability of the model.</description>

      <title>The Smearing of Quasi-Particles: Signatures in the Entanglement Entropy of Excited Many-Particle Systems</title>

Abstract: The entanglement spectrum serves as a powerful tool for probing the structure and dynamics of quantum many-body systems, revealing key information about symmetry, topology, and excitations. While the entanglement entropy (EE) of ground states typically follows an area law, highly excited states obey a volume law, leading to a striking contrast in their scaling behavior. In this paper, we investigate the crossover between these two regimes, focusing on the role of quasi-particles (QPs) in mediating this transition. By analyzing the energy dependence of EE in various many-body systems, we explore how the presence of long-lived QPs influences the entanglement structure of excited states. We present numerical results for spinless fermions, a spin chain near a many-body localization transition, and the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, which lacks a conventional QP description. Our findings are complemented by a theoretical model based on Fermi liquid theory, providing insight into the interaction-dependent scaling of EE and its consistency with numerical simulations. We find that a hallmark of QPs is a linear dependence of the eigenstate EE on energy, which breaks down at high energy and in the limit of strong interaction. The slope of this linear dependence reflects the QP weight, which reduces with interaction strength.</description>

      <title>Oddities in the Entanglement Scaling of the Quantum Six-Vertex Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19152v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the entanglement properties of the Quantum Six-Vertex Model on a cylinder, focusing on the Shannon-Renyi entropy in the limit of Renyi order $n = \infty$. This entropy, calculated from the ground state amplitudes of the equivalent XXZ spin-1/2 chain, allows us to determine the Renyi entanglement entropy of the corresponding Rokhsar-Kivelson wavefunctions, which describe the ground states of certain conformal quantum critical points. Our analysis reveals a novel logarithmic correction to the expected entanglement scaling when the system size is odd. This anomaly arises from the geometric frustration of spin configurations imposed by periodic boundary conditions on odd-sized chains. We demonstrate that the scaling prefactor of this logarithmic term is directly related to the compactification radius of the low-energy bosonic field theory description, or equivalently, the Luttinger parameter. Thus, this correction provides a direct probe of the underlying Conformal Field Theory (CFT) describing the critical point. Our findings highlight the crucial role of system size parity in determining the entanglement properties of this model and offer insights into the interplay between geometry, frustration, and criticality.</description>

      <title>The Large-Scale Structure of Entanglement in Quantum Many-body Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03833v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the thermodynamic limit of a many-body system can reveal entanglement properties that are hard to detect in finite-size systems -- similar to how phase transitions only sharply emerge in the thermodynamic limit. The resulting operational entanglement properties are in one-to-one correspondence with abstract properties of the local observable algebras that emerge in the thermodynamic limit. These properties are insensitive to finite perturbations and hence describe the $\textit{large-scale structure of entanglement}$ of many-body systems. We formulate and discuss the emerging structures and open questions, both for gapped and gapless many-body systems. In particular, we show that every gapped phase of matter, even the trivial one, in $D\geq 2$ dimensions contains models with the strongest possible bipartite large-scale entanglement. Conversely, we conjecture the existence of topological phases of matter, where all representatives have the strongest form of entanglement.</description>

      <title>Observation of Persistent Zero Modes and Superconducting Vortex Doublets in UTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17450v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Superconducting vortices can reveal electron pairing details and nucleate topologically protected states. Yet, vortices of bulk spin-triplet superconductors have never been visualized. Recently, UTe$_2$ has emerged as a nominative spin-triplet superconductor, but its superconducting order parameter is elusive, and whether time-reversal symmetry is broken remains unsettled. Here, we visualize superconducting vortices on the (011) surface of ultra-clean UTe$_2$ single crystals ($T_c=2.1 K$) using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). We introduce $\frac{d^2 I}{dV^2}$ imaging as an effective method for vortex visualization in superconductors with substantial residual zero-energy density of states (DOS), as in UTe$_2$. Anisotropic single-flux-quantum vortices, with coherence lengths of $\sim$ 12 nm (4 nm) parallel (perpendicular) to the a-axis, form a triangular vortex lattice (VL) under small out-of-plane magnetic fields. The vortex size decreases at higher fields, suggesting multi-band superconductivity. The robustness of vortex structures and VL against magnetic field polarity and cooling history strongly supports time-reversal invariant superconductivity. Spatially non-splitting and spectroscopically narrow zero-bias peaks (ZBPs) of differential conductance at vortex cores (VCs) persist up $8T$, well beyond the Pauli limit ($3.9T$), consistent with Majorana zero modes (MZMs) in a topological vortex line protected by a combination of mirror, time-reversal, and particle-hole symmetries. Close examination of vortex structures reveals a mirror-asymmetric doublet $--$ one with a singular core and another with an enhanced energy gap. Such unconventional vortices in a non-chiral $p$-wave superconductor could originate from the induction of a subdominant order parameter close to the VCs.</description>

      <title>Universality of R\'enyi Entropy in Conformal Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24353v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use the thermal effective theory to prove that, for the vacuum state in any conformal field theory in $d$ dimensions, the $n$-th R\'enyi entropy $S_A^{(n)}$ behaves as $S_A^{(n)} = \frac{f}{(2\pi n)^{d-1}} \frac{ {\rm Area}(\partial A)}{(d-2)\epsilon^{d-2}}\left(1+O(n)\right)$ in the $n \rightarrow 0$ limit when the boundary of the entanglement domain $A$ is spherical with the UV cutoff $\epsilon$.The theory dependence is encapsulated in the cosmological constant $f$ in the thermal effective action. Using this result, we estimate the density of states for large eigenvalues of the modular Hamiltonian for the domain $A$. In two dimensions, we can use the hot spot idea to derive more powerful formulas valid for arbitrary positive $n$. We discuss the difference between two and higher dimensions and clarify the applicability of the hot spot idea. We also use the thermal effective theory to derive an analog of the Cardy formula for boundary operators in higher dimensions.</description>
