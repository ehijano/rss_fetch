      <title>Spore in the Wild: Case Study on Spore.fun, a Real-World Experiment of Sovereign Agent Open-ended Evolution on Blockchain with TEEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Artificial Life (ALife) research, replicating Open-Ended Evolution (OEE)-the continuous emergence of novelty observed in biological life-has traditionally been pursued within isolated closed system simulations, such as Tierra and Avida, which have typically plateaued after an initial burst of novelty, failing to achieve sustained OEE. Scholars suggest that OEE requires an "open" system that continually exchanges information or energy with its environment. A recent technological innovation in decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN) providing permissionless computational substrates enables deploying large language model (LLM)-based AI agents on blockchains integrated with Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). This enables on-chain agents to operate autonomously "in the wild," achieving self-sovereignty without human oversight. These agents can control their own social media accounts and cryptocurrency wallets, allowing them to interact directly with blockchain-based financial networks and broader human social media. Building on this new paradigm of on-chain agents, Spore.fun is a recent real-world AI evolution experiment that enables autonomous breeding and evolution of new on-chain agents. This paper presents a detailed case study of Spore.fun, examining agent behaviors and their evolutionary trajectories through digital ethology. We aim to spark discussion about whether "open" ALife systems "in-the-wild," based on permissionless computational substrates and driven by economic incentives to interact with their environment, could finally achieve the long-sought goal of OEE.</description>

      <title>HASHIRU: Hierarchical Agent System for Hybrid Intelligent Resource Utilization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rapid Large Language Model (LLM) advancements are fueling autonomous Multi-Agent System (MAS) development. However, current frameworks often lack flexibility, resource awareness, model diversity, and autonomous tool creation. This paper introduces HASHIRU (Hierarchical Agent System for Hybrid Intelligent Resource Utilization), a novel MAS framework enhancing flexibility, resource efficiency, and adaptability. HASHIRU features a "CEO" agent dynamically managing specialized "employee" agents, instantiated based on task needs and resource constraints (cost, memory). Its hybrid intelligence prioritizes smaller, local LLMs (via Ollama) while flexibly using external APIs and larger models when necessary. An economic model with hiring/firing costs promotes team stability and efficient resource allocation. The system also includes autonomous API tool creation and a memory function. Evaluations on tasks like academic paper review (58% success), safety assessments (100% on a JailbreakBench subset), and complex reasoning (outperforming Gemini 2.0 Flash on GSM8K: 96% vs. 61%; JEEBench: 80% vs. 68.3%; SVAMP: 92% vs. 84%) demonstrate HASHIRU's capabilities. Case studies illustrate its self-improvement via autonomous cost model generation, tool integration, and budget management. HASHIRU offers a promising approach for more robust, efficient, and adaptable MAS through dynamic hierarchical control, resource-aware hybrid intelligence, and autonomous functional extension. Source code and benchmarks are available at https://github.com/HASHIRU-AI/HASHIRU and https://github.com/HASHIRU-AI/HASHIRUBench respectively, and a live demo is available at https://hashiruagentx-hashiruai.hf.space upon request.</description>

      <title>CORA: Coalitional Rational Advantage Decomposition for Multi-Agent Policy Gradients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work focuses on the credit assignment problem in cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). Sharing the global advantage among agents often leads to suboptimal policy updates as it fails to account for the distinct contributions of agents. Although numerous methods consider global or individual contributions for credit assignment, a detailed analysis at the coalition level remains lacking in many approaches. This work analyzes the over-updating problem during multi-agent policy updates from a coalition-level perspective. To address this issue, we propose a credit assignment method called Coalitional Rational Advantage Decomposition (CORA). CORA evaluates coalitional advantages via marginal contributions from all possible coalitions and decomposes advantages using the core solution from cooperative game theory, ensuring coalitional rationality. To reduce computational overhead, CORA employs random coalition sampling. Experiments on matrix games, differential games, and multi-agent collaboration benchmarks demonstrate that CORA outperforms strong baselines, particularly in tasks with multiple local optima. These findings highlight the importance of coalition-aware credit assignment for improving MARL performance.</description>

      <title>CPU-Based Layout Design for Picker-to-Parts Pallet Warehouses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Picker-to-parts pallet warehouses often face inefficiencies due to conventional layouts causing excessive travel distances and high labor requirements. This study introduces a novel layout design inspired by CPU architecture, partitioning warehouse space into specialized zones, namely Performance (P), Efficiency (E), and Shared (S). Discrete-event simulation is used to evaluate this design against traditional rectangular (random and ABC storage) and Flying-V layouts. Results demonstrate significant improvements in throughput time and reduced labor requirements, highlighting the potential for CPU-based layouts in optimizing warehouse operations.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Collaborative Scheduling of Time-dependent UAVs, Workers and Vehicles for Crowdsensing in Disaster Response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Natural disasters have caused significant losses to human society, and the timely and efficient acquisition of post-disaster environmental information is crucial for the effective implementation of rescue operations. Due to the complexity of post-disaster environments, existing sensing technologies face challenges such as weak environmental adaptability, insufficient specialized sensing capabilities, and limited practicality of sensing solutions. This paper explores the heterogeneous multi-agent online autonomous collaborative scheduling algorithm HoAs-PALN, aimed at achieving efficient collection of post-disaster environmental information. HoAs-PALN is realized through adaptive dimensionality reduction in the matching process and local Nash equilibrium game, facilitating autonomous collaboration among time-dependent UAVs, workers and vehicles to enhance sensing scheduling. (1) In terms of adaptive dimensionality reduction during the matching process, HoAs-PALN significantly reduces scheduling decision time by transforming a five-dimensional matching process into two categories of three-dimensional matching processes; (2) Regarding the local Nash equilibrium game, HoAs-PALN combines the softmax function to optimize behavior selection probabilities and introduces a local Nash equilibrium determination mechanism to ensure scheduling decision performance. Finally, we conducted detailed experiments based on extensive real-world and simulated data. Compared with the baselines (GREEDY, K-WTA, MADL and MARL), HoAs-PALN improves task completion rates by 64.12%, 46.48%, 16.55%, and 14.03% on average, respectively, while each online scheduling decision takes less than 10 seconds, demonstrating its effectiveness in dynamic post-disaster environments.</description>

      <title>From Standalone LLMs to Integrated Intelligence: A Survey of Compound Al Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compound Al Systems (CAIS) is an emerging paradigm that integrates large language models (LLMs) with external components, such as retrievers, agents, tools, and orchestrators, to overcome the limitations of standalone models in tasks requiring memory, reasoning, real-time grounding, and multimodal understanding. These systems enable more capable and context-aware behaviors by composing multiple specialized modules into cohesive workflows. Despite growing adoption in both academia and industry, the CAIS landscape remains fragmented, lacking a unified framework for analysis, taxonomy, and evaluation. In this survey, we define the concept of CAIS, propose a multi-dimensional taxonomy based on component roles and orchestration strategies, and analyze four foundational paradigms: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), LLM Agents, Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), and orchestration-centric architectures. We review representative systems, compare design trade-offs, and summarize evaluation methodologies across these paradigms. Finally, we identify key challenges-including scalability, interoperability, benchmarking, and coordination-and outline promising directions for future research. This survey aims to provide researchers and practitioners with a comprehensive foundation for understanding, developing, and advancing the next generation of system-level artificial intelligence.</description>

      <title>Towards Language-Augmented Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Communication is a fundamental aspect of coordinated behavior in multi-agent reinforcement learning. Yet, most prior works in this field have focused on emergent communication protocols developed from scratch, often resulting in inefficient or non-interpretable systems. Inspired by the role of language in natural intelligence, we investigate how grounding agents in a human-defined language can improve learning and coordination of multiple embodied agents. We propose a framework in which agents are trained not only to act but also to produce and interpret natural language descriptions of their observations. This language-augmented learning serves a dual role: enabling explicit communication between agents and guiding representation learning. We demonstrate that agents trained with our method outperform traditional emergent communication baselines across various tasks. Our analysis reveals that language grounding leads to more informative internal representations, better generalization to new partners, and improved capability for human-agent interaction. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of integrating structured language into multi-agent learning and open avenues for more interpretable and capable multi-agent systems.</description>

      <title>Time to Talk: LLM Agents for Asynchronous Group Communication in Mafia Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LLMs are used predominantly in synchronous communication, where a human user and a model communicate in alternating turns. In contrast, many real-world settings are inherently asynchronous. For example, in group chats, online team meetings, or social games, there is no inherent notion of turns; therefore, the decision of when to speak forms a crucial part of the participant's decision making. In this work, we develop an adaptive asynchronous LLM-agent which, in addition to determining what to say, also decides when to say it. To evaluate our agent, we collect a unique dataset of online Mafia games, including both human participants, as well as our asynchronous agent. Overall, our agent performs on par with human players, both in game performance, as well as in its ability to blend in with the other human players. Our analysis shows that the agent's behavior in deciding when to speak closely mirrors human patterns, although differences emerge in message content. We release all our data and code to support and encourage further research for more realistic asynchronous communication between LLM agents. This work paves the way for integration of LLMs into realistic human group settings, from assistance in team discussions to educational and professional environments where complex social dynamics must be navigated.</description>

      <title>Language-Guided Multi-Agent Learning in Simulations: A Unified Framework and Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces LLM-MARL, a unified framework that incorporates large language models (LLMs) into multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to enhance coordination, communication, and generalization in simulated game environments. The framework features three modular components of Coordinator, Communicator, and Memory, which dynamically generate subgoals, facilitate symbolic inter-agent messaging, and support episodic recall. Training combines PPO with a language-conditioned loss and LLM query gating. LLM-MARL is evaluated in Google Research Football, MAgent Battle, and StarCraft II. Results show consistent improvements over MAPPO and QMIX in win rate, coordination score, and zero-shot generalization. Ablation studies demonstrate that subgoal generation and language-based messaging each contribute significantly to performance gains. Qualitative analysis reveals emergent behaviors such as role specialization and communication-driven tactics. By bridging language modeling and policy learning, this work contributes to the design of intelligent, cooperative agents in interactive simulations. It offers a path forward for leveraging LLMs in multi-agent systems used for training, games, and human-AI collaboration.</description>

      <title>Gen-n-Val: Agentic Image Data Generation and Validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance as agents across various tasks while data scarcity and label noise remain significant challenges in computer vision tasks, such as object detection and instance segmentation. A common solution for resolving these issues is to generate synthetic data. However, current synthetic data generation methods struggle with issues, such as multiple objects per mask, inaccurate segmentation, and incorrect category labels, limiting their effectiveness. To address these issues, we introduce Gen-n-Val, a novel agentic data generation framework that leverages Layer Diffusion (LD), LLMs, and VLLMs to produce high-quality, single-object masks and diverse backgrounds. Gen-n-Val consists of two agents: (1) The LD prompt agent, an LLM, optimizes prompts for LD to generate high-quality foreground instance images and segmentation masks. These optimized prompts ensure the generation of single-object synthetic data with precise instance masks and clean backgrounds. (2) The data validation agent, a VLLM, which filters out low-quality synthetic instance images. The system prompts for both agents are refined through TextGrad. Additionally, we use image harmonization to combine multiple instances within scenes. Compared to state-of-the-art synthetic data approaches like MosaicFusion, our approach reduces invalid synthetic data from 50% to 7% and improves performance by 1% mAP on rare classes in COCO instance segmentation with YOLOv9c and YOLO11m. Furthermore, Gen-n-Val shows significant improvements (7. 1% mAP) over YOLO-Worldv2-M in open-vocabulary object detection benchmarks with YOLO11m. Moreover, Gen-n-Val improves the performance of YOLOv9 and YOLO11 families in instance segmentation and object detection.</description>

      <title>Memory-Driven Bounded Confidence Opinion Dynamics: A Hegselmann-Krause Model Based on Fractional-Order Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Memory effects play a crucial role in social interactions and decision-making processes. This paper proposes a novel fractional-order bounded confidence opinion dynamics model to characterize the memory effects in system states. Building upon the Hegselmann-Krause framework and fractional-order difference, a comprehensive model is established that captures the persistent influence of historical information. Through rigorous theoretical analysis, the fundamental properties including convergence and consensus is investigated. The results demonstrate that the proposed model not only maintains favorable convergence and consensus characteristics compared to classical opinion dynamics, but also addresses limitations such as the monotonicity of bounded opinions. This enables a more realistic representation of opinion evolution in real-world scenarios. The findings of this study provide new insights and methodological approaches for understanding opinion formation and evolution, offering both theoretical significance and practical applications.</description>

      <title>Conservative classifiers do consistently well with improving agents: characterizing statistical and online learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning is now ubiquitous in societal decision-making, for example in evaluating job candidates or loan applications, and it is increasingly important to take into account how classified agents will react to the learning algorithms. The majority of recent literature on strategic classification has focused on reducing and countering deceptive behaviors by the classified agents, but recent work of Attias et al. identifies surprising properties of learnability when the agents genuinely improve in order to attain the desirable classification, such as smaller generalization error than standard PAC-learning. In this paper we characterize so-called learnability with improvements across multiple new axes. We introduce an asymmetric variant of minimally consistent concept classes and use it to provide an exact characterization of proper learning with improvements in the realizable setting. While prior work studies learnability only under general, arbitrary agent improvement regions, we give positive results for more natural Euclidean ball improvement sets. In particular, we characterize improper learning under a mild generative assumption on the data distribution. We further show how to learn in more challenging settings, achieving lower generalization error under well-studied bounded noise models and obtaining mistake bounds in realizable and agnostic online learning. We resolve open questions posed by Attias et al. for both proper and improper learning.</description>

      <title>Teaming in the AI Era: AI-Augmented Frameworks for Forming, Simulating, and Optimizing Human Teams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effective teamwork is essential across diverse domains. During the team formation stage, a key challenge is forming teams that effectively balance user preferences with task objectives to enhance overall team satisfaction. In the team performing stage, maintaining cohesion and engagement is critical for sustaining high team performance. However, existing computational tools and algorithms for team optimization often rely on static data inputs, narrow algorithmic objectives, or solutions tailored for specific contexts, failing to account for the dynamic interplay of team members personalities, evolving goals, and changing individual preferences. Therefore, teams may encounter member dissatisfaction, as purely algorithmic assignments can reduce members commitment to team goals or experience suboptimal engagement due to the absence of timely, personalized guidance to help members adjust their behaviors and interactions as team dynamics evolve. Ultimately, these challenges can lead to reduced overall team performance. My Ph.D. dissertation aims to develop AI-augmented team optimization frameworks and practical systems that enhance team satisfaction, engagement, and performance. First, I propose a team formation framework that leverages a multi-armed bandit algorithm to iteratively refine team composition based on user preferences, ensuring alignment between individual needs and collective team goals to enhance team satisfaction. Second, I introduce tAIfa (Team AI Feedback Assistant), an AI-powered system that utilizes large language models (LLMs) to deliver immediate, personalized feedback to both teams and individual members, enhancing cohesion and engagement. Finally, I present PuppeteerLLM, an LLM-based simulation framework that simulates multi-agent teams to model complex team dynamics within realistic environments, incorporating task-driven collaboration and long-term coordination.</description>

Abstract: We introduce an Implicit Game-Theoretic MPC (IGT-MPC), a decentralized algorithm for two-agent motion planning that uses a learned value function that predicts the game-theoretic interaction outcomes as the terminal cost-to-go function in a model predictive control (MPC) framework, guiding agents to implicitly account for interactions with other agents and maximize their reward. This approach applies to competitive and cooperative multi-agent motion planning problems which we formulate as constrained dynamic games. Given a constrained dynamic game, we randomly sample initial conditions and solve for the generalized Nash equilibrium (GNE) to generate a dataset of GNE solutions, computing the reward outcome of each game-theoretic interaction from the GNE. The data is used to train a simple neural network to predict the reward outcome, which we use as the terminal cost-to-go function in an MPC scheme. We showcase emerging competitive and coordinated behaviors using IGT-MPC in scenarios such as two-vehicle head-to-head racing and un-signalized intersection navigation. IGT-MPC offers a novel method integrating machine learning and game-theoretic reasoning into model-based decentralized multi-agent motion planning.</description>

      <title>From Intention To Implementation: Automating Biomedical Research via LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09429v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conventional biomedical research is increasingly labor-intensive due to the exponential growth of scientific literature and datasets. Artificial intelligence (AI), particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), has the potential to revolutionize this process by automating various steps. Still, significant challenges remain, including the need for multidisciplinary expertise, logicality of experimental design, and performance measurements. This paper introduces BioResearcher, the first end-to-end automated system designed to streamline the entire biomedical research process involving dry lab experiments. BioResearcher employs a modular multi-agent architecture, integrating specialized agents for search, literature processing, experimental design, and programming. By decomposing complex tasks into logically related sub-tasks and utilizing a hierarchical learning approach, BioResearcher effectively addresses the challenges of multidisciplinary requirements and logical complexity. Furthermore, BioResearcher incorporates an LLM-based reviewer for in-process quality control and introduces novel evaluation metrics to assess the quality and automation of experimental protocols. BioResearcher successfully achieves an average execution success rate of 63.07% across eight previously unmet research objectives. The generated protocols, on average, outperform typical agent systems by 22.0% on five quality metrics. The system demonstrates significant potential to reduce researchers' workloads and accelerate biomedical discoveries, paving the way for future innovations in automated research systems.</description>

      <title>Optimization under Attack: Resilience, Vulnerability, and the Path to Collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05954v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optimization is instrumental for improving operations of large-scale socio-technical infrastructures of Smart Cities, for instance, energy and traffic systems. In particular, understanding the performance of multi-agent discrete-choice combinatorial optimization under distributed adversary attacks is a compelling and underexplored problem, since multi-agent systems exhibit a large number of remote control variables that can influence in an unprecedented way the cost-effectiveness of distributed optimization heuristics. This paper unravels for the first time the trajectories of distributed optimization from resilience to vulnerability, and finally to collapse under varying adversary influence. Using real-world data to emulate over 28 billion multi-agent optimization scenarios, we exhaustively assess how the number of agents with different adversarial severity and network positioning influences optimization performance, including the influence on Pareto optimal points. With this novel large-scale dataset, made openly available as a benchmark, we disentangle how optimization remains resilient to adversaries and which adversary conditions are required to make optimization vulnerable or collapsed. These new findings can provide new insights for designing self-healing strategies for fault-tolerance and fault-correction in adversarial distributed optimization that have been missing so far.</description>

      <title>Conceptualizing educational opportunity hoarding: the emergence of hoarding without hoarders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.14653v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Social scientists increasingly use the concept of opportunity hoarding to explain the formation of Black-White educational inequalities. However, this concept is often loosely defined, leading to varied interpretations of the inequality-producing mechanisms it captures. To bring clarity to this valuable sociological concept, this theoretical paper, informed by the concept's original definition and existing empirical research, proposes a more precise definition of opportunity hoarding and formalizes it through a computational model. For concreteness, the model focuses on one context: how White families can hoard access to advanced high school coursework from Black students attending the same school. Through simulations, the paper highlights the necessary and sufficient conditions under which the hoarding of advanced course-taking opportunities emerges. Results demonstrate that, in contrast to traditional accounts, White actors do not need to engage in exclusionary behaviors to hoard valuable resources. Rather, through the byproduct of network segregation and class inequalities, opportunity hoarding can emerge even when individuals act in race-neutral ways -- a process I conceptualize as hoarding without hoarders.</description>

      <title>Multi-Agent Security Tax: Trading Off Security and Collaboration Capabilities in Multi-Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19145v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As AI agents are increasingly adopted to collaborate on complex objectives, ensuring the security of autonomous multi-agent systems becomes crucial. We develop simulations of agents collaborating on shared objectives to study these security risks and security trade-offs. We focus on scenarios where an attacker compromises one agent, using it to steer the entire system toward misaligned outcomes by corrupting other agents. In this context, we observe infectious malicious prompts - the multi-hop spreading of malicious instructions. To mitigate this risk, we evaluated several strategies: two "vaccination" approaches that insert false memories of safely handling malicious input into the agents' memory stream, and two versions of a generic safety instruction strategy. While these defenses reduce the spread and fulfillment of malicious instructions in our experiments, they tend to decrease collaboration capability in the agent network. Our findings illustrate potential trade-off between security and collaborative efficiency in multi-agent systems, providing insights for designing more secure yet effective AI collaborations.</description>

      <title>Offline Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning via Score Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05968v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Offline cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) faces unique challenges due to distributional shifts, particularly stemming from the high dimensionality of joint action spaces and the presence of out-of-distribution joint action selections. In this work, we highlight that a fundamental challenge in offline MARL arises from the multi-equilibrium nature of cooperative tasks, which induces a highly multimodal joint behavior policy space coupled with heterogeneous-quality behavior data. This makes it difficult for individual policy regularization to align with a consistent coordination pattern, leading to the policy distribution shift problems. To tackle this challenge, we design a sequential score function decomposition method that distills per-agent regularization signals from the joint behavior policy, which induces coordinated modality selection under decentralized execution constraints. Then we leverage a flexible diffusion-based generative model to learn these score functions from multimodal offline data, and integrate them into joint-action critics to guide policy updates toward high-reward, in-distribution regions under a shared team reward. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple particle environments and Multi-agent MuJoCo benchmarks consistently. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to explicitly address the distributional gap between offline and online MARL, paving the way for more generalizable offline policy-based MARL methods.</description>
