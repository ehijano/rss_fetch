      <title>Experimental Learning of a Hyperelastic Behavior with a Physics-Augmented Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent development of Physics-Augmented Neural Networks (PANN) opens new opportunities for modeling material behaviors. These approaches have demonstrated their efficiency when trained on synthetic cases. This study aims to demonstrate the effectiveness of training PANN using real experimental data for modeling hyperelastic behavior. The approach involved two uni-axial experiments equipped with digital image correlation and force sensors. The tests achieved axial deformations exceeding 200% and presented non-linear responses. Twenty loading steps extracted from one experiment were used to train the PANN. The model architecture was optimized based on results from a validation dataset, utilizing equilibrium gap loss computed on six loading steps. Finally, 544 loading steps from the first experiment and 80 steps from a second independent experiment were used for testing purposes. The PANN model effectively captured the hyperelastic behavior across and beyond the training loads, showing superior performance compared to the standard Neo-Hookean model when assessed using various evaluation metrics. Training PANN with experimental mechanical data shows promising results, outperforming traditional modeling approaches.</description>

      <title>Fast Spot Order Optimization to Increase Dose Rates in Scanned Particle Therapy FLASH Treatments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advent of ultra-high dose rate irradiation, known as FLASH radiation therapy, has shown promising potential in reducing toxicity while maintaining tumor control. However, the clinical translation of these benefits necessitates efficient treatment planning strategies. This study introduces a novel approach to optimize proton therapy for FLASH effects using traveling salesperson problem (TSP) heuristics. We applied these heuristics to optimize the arrangement of proton spots in treatment plans for 26 prostate cancer patients, comparing the performance against conventional sorting methods and global optimization techniques. Our results demonstrate that TSP-based heuristics significantly enhance FLASH coverage to the same extent as the global optimization technique, but with computation times reduced from hours to a few seconds. This approach offers a practical and scalable solution for enhancing the effectiveness of FLASH therapy, paving the way for more effective and personalized cancer treatments. Future work will focus on further optimizing run times and validating these methods in clinical settings.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty Decomposition and Error Margin Detection of Homodyned-K Distribution in Quantitative Ultrasound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Homodyned K-distribution (HK-distribution) parameter estimation in quantitative ultrasound (QUS) has been recently addressed using Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs). BNNs have been shown to significantly reduce computational time in speckle statistics-based QUS without compromising accuracy and precision. Additionally, they provide estimates of feature uncertainty, which can guide the clinician's trust in the reported feature value. The total predictive uncertainty in Bayesian modeling can be decomposed into epistemic (uncertainty over the model parameters) and aleatoric (uncertainty inherent in the data) components. By decomposing the predictive uncertainty, we can gain insights into the factors contributing to the total uncertainty. In this study, we propose a method to compute epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties for HK-distribution parameters ($\alpha$ and $k$) estimated by a BNN, in both simulation and experimental data. In addition, we investigate the relationship between the prediction error and both uncertainties, shedding light on the interplay between these uncertainties and HK parameters errors.</description>

      <title>Modeling water radiolysis with Geant4-DNA: Impact of the temporal structure of the irradiation pulse under oxygen conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The differences in H2O2 production between conventional (CONV) and ultra-high dose rate (UHDR) irradiations in water radiolysis are still not fully understood. The lower levels of this radiolytic species, as a critical end product of water radiolysis, are particularly relevant for investigating the connection between the high-density energy deposition during short-duration physical events (ionizations or excitations) and biological responses of the FLASH effect. In this study, we developed a new Geant4-DNA chemistry model to simulate radiolysis considering the time structure of the irradiation pulse at different absorbed doses to liquid water of 0.01, 0.1, 1, and 2 Gy under 1 MeV electron irradiation. The model allows the description of the beam's temporal structure, including the pulse duration, the pulse repetition frequency, and the pulse amplitude for the different beam irradiation conditions through a wide dose rate range, from 0.01 Gy/s up to about 105 Gy/s, at various oxygen concentrations. The preliminary results indicate a correlation between the temporal structure of the pulses and a significant reduction in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) at different dose rates.</description>

      <title>Non-maximal entanglement of photons from positron-electron annihilation demonstrated using a novel plastic PET scanner</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08574v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the state-of-the-art Positron Emission Tomography (PET), information about the polarization of annihilation photons is not available. Current PET systems track molecules labeled with positron-emitting radioisotopes by detecting the propagation direction of two photons from positron-electron annihilation. However, annihilation photons carry more information than just the site where they originated. Here we present a novel J-PET scanner built from plastic scintillators, in which annihilation photons interact predominantly via the Compton effect, providing information about photon polarization in addition to information on photon direction of propagation. Theoretically, photons from the decay of positronium in a vacuum are maximally entangled in polarization. However, in matter, when the positron from positronium annihilates with the electron bound to the atom, the question arises whether the photons from such annihilation are maximally entangled. In this work, we determine the distribution of the relative angle between polarization orientations of two photons from positron-electron annihilation in a porous polymer. Contrary to prior results for positron annihilation in aluminum and copper, where the strength of observed correlations is as expected for maximally entangled photons, our results show a significant deviation. We demonstrate that in porous polymer, photon polarization correlation is weaker than for maximally entangled photons but stronger than for separable photons. The data indicate that more than 40% of annihilations in Amberlite resin lead to a non-maximally entangled state. Our result indicates the degree of correlation depends on the annihilation mechanism and the molecular arrangement. We anticipate that the introduced Compton interaction-based PET system opens a promising perspective for exploring polarization correlations in PET as a novel diagnostic indicator.</description>
