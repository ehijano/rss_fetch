      <title>Path-monochromatic bounded depth rooted trees in (random) tournaments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An edge-colored rooted directed tree (aka arborescence) is path-monochromatic if every path in it is monochromatic. Let $k,\ell$ be positive integers. For a tournament $T$, let $f_T(k)$ be the largest integer such that every $k$-edge coloring of $T$ has a path-monochromatic subtree with at least $f_T(k)$ vertices and let $f_T(k,\ell)$ be the restriction to subtrees of depth at most $\ell$. It was proved by Landau that $f_T(1,2)=n$ and proved by Sands et al. that $f_T(2)=n$ where $|V(T)|=n$. Here we consider $f_T(k)$ and $f_T(k,\ell)$ in more generality, determine their extremal values in most cases, and in fact in all cases assuming the Caccetta-H\"aggkvist Conjecture. We also study the typical value of $f_T(k)$ and $f_T(k,\ell)$, i.e., when $T$ is a random tournament.</description>

      <title>Remarks on the conjectures of Capparelli, Meurman, Primc and Primc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a sequence of two papers, S. Capparelli, A. Meurman, A. Primc, M. Primc (CMPP) and then M. Primc put forth three remarkable sets of conjectures, stating that the generating functions of coloured integer partition in which the parts satisfy restrictions on the multiplicities admit simple infinite product forms. While CMPP related one set of conjectures to the principally specialised characters of standard modules for the affine Lie algebra $\mathrm{C}_n^{(1)}$, finding a Lie-algebraic interpretation for the remaining two sets remained an open problem. In this paper, we use the work of Griffin, Ono and the fourth author on Rogers-Ramanujan identities for affine Lie algebras to solve this problem, relating the remaining two sets of conjectures to non-standard specialisations of standard modules for $\mathrm{A}_{2n}^{(2)}$ and $\mathrm{D}_{n+1}^{(2)}$. We also use their work to formulate conjectures for the bivariate generating function of one-parameter families of CMPP partitions in terms of Hall-Littlewood symmetric functions. We make a detailed study of several further aspects of CMPP partitions, obtaining (i) functional equations for bivariate generating functions which generalise the well-known Rogers-Selberg equations, (ii) a partial level-rank duality in the $\mathrm{A}_{2n}^{(2)}$ case, and (iii) (conjectural) identities of the Rogers-Ramanujan type for $\mathrm{D}_3^{(2)}$.</description>

      <title>Genus and crosscap of Normal subgroup based power graphs of finite groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $H$ be a normal subgroup of a group $G$. The normal subgroup based power graph $\Gamma_H(G)$ of $G$ is the simple undirected graph with vertex set $V(\Gamma_H(G))= (G\setminus H)\cup \{e\}$ and two distinct vertices $a$ and $b$ are adjacent if either $aH = b^m H$ or $bH=a^nH$ for some $m,n \in \mathbb{N}$. In this paper, we continue the study of normal subgroup based power graph and characterize all the pairs $(G,H)$, where $H$ is a non-trivial normal subgroup of $G$, such that the genus of $\Gamma_H(G)$ is at most $2$. Moreover, we determine all the subgroups $H$ and the quotient groups $\frac{G}{H}$ such that the cross-cap of $\Gamma_H(G)$ is at most three.</description>

      <title>Generalised Checkerboard Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A series of integral lattices parametrised by integers $k,m,n$ are introduced and investigated, where $n$ is the rank of the lattice, including the root lattices described in a uniform way and unimodular lattices such as the Niemeier lattices of type $A_{24}$ and $D_{24}$. The lattices are characterised by means of a sublattice isomorphic to the root lattice of type $A_{n-1}$. A sufficient condition for existence of an orthogonal $k$-frame of such a lattice is given in terms of symmetric $2$-designs.</description>

      <title>Macdonald characters from a new formula for Macdonald polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new operator $\Gamma$ on symmetric functions, which enables us to obtain a creation formula for Macdonald polynomials. This formula provides a connection between the theory of Macdonald operators initiated by Bergeron, Garsia, Haiman and Tesler, and shifted Macdonald polynomials introduced by Knop, Lassalle, Okounkov and Sahi.
  We use this formula to introduce a two-parameter generalization of Jack characters, which we call Macdonald characters. Finally, we provide a change of variables in order to formulate several positivity conjectures related to these generalized characters. Our conjectures extend some important open problems on Jack polynomials, including some famous conjectures of Goulden and Jackson.</description>

      <title>$A_\alpha$-energy of graphs formed by some unary operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G $ be a graph on $p$ vertices with adjacency matrix $A(G)$ and degree matrix $D(G)$. For each $\alpha \in [0, 1]$, the $A_\alpha$-matrix is defined as $A_\alpha (G) = \alpha D(G) + (1 - \alpha)A(G)$. In this paper, we compute the $A_\alpha$-characteristic polynomial, $A_\alpha$-spectra and $A_\alpha$-energy of some non-regular graphs obtained from unary operations on graphs like middle graph, central graph, m-splitting, and closed splitting graph. Also, we determine the $A_\alpha$-energy of regular graphs like m-shadow, closed shadow, extended bipartite double graph, iterated line graph and m-duplicate graph. Furthermore, we identified some graphs that are $A_\alpha$-equieneregetic and $A_\alpha$-borderenergetic.</description>

      <title>On combinatorial structure and algebraic characterizations of distance-regular digraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma=\Gamma(A)$ denote a simple strongly connected digraph with vertex set $X$, diameter $D$, and let $\{A_0,A:=A_1,A_2,\ldots,A_D\}$ denote the set of distance-$i$ matrices of $\Gamma$. Let $\{R_i\}_{i=0}^D$ denote a partition of $X\times X$, where $R_i=\{(x,y)\in X\times X\mid (A_i)_{xy}=1\}$ $(0\le i\le D)$. The digraph $\Gamma$ is distance-regular if and only if $(X,\{R_i\}_{i=0}^D)$ is a commutative association scheme. In this paper, we describe the combinatorial structure of $\Gamma$ in the sense of equitable partition, and from it we derive several new algebraic characterizations of such a graph, including the spectral excess theorem for distance-regular digraph. Along the way, we also rediscover all well-known algebraic characterizations of such graphs.</description>

      <title>Matchings in the hypercube with specified edges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a matching $M$ in the hypercube $Q^n$, the \emph{profile} of $M$ is the vector $\boldsymbol{x}=(x_1,\ldots, x_n) \in \mathbb{N}^n$ such that $M$ contains $x_i$ edges whose endpoints differ in the $i$th coordinate. If $M$ is a perfect matching, then it is clear that $||\boldsymbol{x}||_1 = 2^{n-1}$ and it is easy to show that each $x_i$ must be even. Verifying a special case of a conjecture of Balister, Gy{\H{o}}ri, and Schelp, we show that these conditions are also sufficient.</description>

      <title>Thin Simplices via Modular Arithmetic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The local $h^*$-polynomial is a natural invariant of a lattice polytope appearing in Ehrhart theory and Hodge theory. In this work, we study the question posed in [GKZ94] concerning the classification of lattice simplices with vanishing local $h^*$-polynomial. Such simplices are called thin. We relate this question to linear codes and hyperplane arrangements over finite rings. This allows us to obtain a complete classification of the $4$-dimensional thin simplices, extending the previously known results in dimensions up to $3$.</description>

      <title>Growth diagram proofs for the Littlewood identities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The (dual) Cauchy identity has an easy algebraic proof utilising a commutation relation between the up and (dual) down operators. By using Fomin's growth diagrams, a bijective proof of the commutation relation can be "bijectivised" to obtain RSK like correspondences. In this paper we give a concise overview of this machinery and extend it to Littlewood type identities by introducing a new family of relations between these operators, called projection identities. Thereby we obtain infinite families of bijections for the Littlewood identities generalising the classical ones. We believe that this approach will be useful for finding bijective proofs for Littlewood type identities in other settings such as for Macdonald polynomials and their specialisations, alternating sign matrices or vertex models.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing a pseudotree from the distance matrix of its boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A vertex $v$ of a connected graph $G$ is said to be a boundary vertex of $G$ if for some other vertex $u$ of $G$, no neighbor of $v$ is further away from $u$ than $v$. The boundary $\partial(G)$ of $G$ is the set of all of its boundary vertices. The distance matrix $\hat{D}_G$ of the boundary of a graph $G$ is the square matrix of order $\kappa$, being $\kappa$ the order of $\partial(G)$, such that for every $i,j\in \partial(G)$, $[\hat{D}_G]_{ij}=d_G(i,j)$. Given a square matrix $\hat{B}$ of order $\kappa$, we prove under which conditions $\hat{B}$ is the distance matrix $\hat{D}_T$ of the set of leaves of a tree $T$, which is precisely its boundary. We show that if $G$ is either a tree or a unicyclic graph with girth $g\geq 5$ vertices, then $G$ is uniquely determined by the distance matrix $\hat{D}_{G}$ of the boundary of $G$ and we also conjecture that this statement holds for every connected graph. Moreover, two algorithms for reconstructing a tree and a unicyclic graph from the distance matrix of their boundaries are given, whose time complexities in the worst case are, respectively, $O(\kappa n)$ and $O(n^2)$.</description>

      <title>Bijections on pattern avoiding inversion sequences and related objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The number of inversion sequences avoiding two patterns $101$ and $102$ is known to be the same as the number of permutations avoiding three patterns $2341$, $2431$, and $3241$. This sequence also counts the number of Schr\"{o}der paths without triple descents, restricted bicolored Dyck paths, $(101,021)$-avoiding inversion sequences, and weighted ordered trees. We provide bijections to integrate them together by introducing $F$-paths. Moreover, we define three kinds of statistics for each of the objects and count the number of each object with respect to these statistics. We also discuss direct sums of each object.</description>

Abstract: We show that the Combinatorial Invariance Conjecture for Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials due to Lusztig and to Dyer, its parabolic analog due to Marietti, and a refined parabolic version that we introduce, are equivalent. We use this to give a new proof of Marietti's conjecture in the case of lower Bruhat intervals and to prove several new cases of the parabolic conjectures.</description>

      <title>Odometers in non-compact spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define an odometer in the Baire space. That is the non-compact space of one sided sequences of natural numbers. We go on to prove that it is topologically conjugated to the dyadic odometer restricted to an appropriate non-compact subset of the space of one sided sequences on two symbols. We extend the action of the odometer to finite words. It turns out that, arranging the finite words in appropriate binary tree, this extension runs through the tree from left-right and top-down. Several well known binary trees made out of rational numbers, such as the Kepler tree or the Calkin and Wilf tree, are recovered in this way. Indeed, it suffices to identify finite words with rational numbers by means of certain continued fractions. The odometric action allow us to recover, in a unified way, several counting results for the rational numbers. Moreover, associated to certain interval maps with countably many branches we construct their corresponding odometers. Explicit formulas are provided in the cases of the Gauss map (continued fractions) and the Renyi map (backward continued fractions).</description>

      <title>The Low-Degree Hardness of Finding Large Independent Sets in Sparse Random Hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the algorithmic task of finding large independent sets in Erdos-Renyi $r$-uniform hypergraphs on $n$ vertices having average degree $d$. Krivelevich and Sudakov showed that the maximum independent set has density $\left(\frac{r\log d}{(r-1)d}\right)^{1/(r-1)}$. We show that the class of low-degree polynomial algorithms can find independent sets of density $\left(\frac{\log d}{(r-1)d}\right)^{1/(r-1)}$ but no larger. This extends and generalizes earlier results of Gamarnik and Sudan, Rahman and Virag, and Wein on graphs, and answers a question of Bal and Bennett. We conjecture that this statistical-computational gap holds for this problem.
  Additionally, we explore the universality of this gap by examining $r$-partite hypergraphs. A hypergraph $H=(V,E)$ is $r$-partite if there is a partition $V=V_1\cup\cdots\cup V_r$ such that each edge contains exactly one vertex from each set $V_i$. We consider the problem of finding large balanced independent sets (independent sets containing the same number of vertices in each partition) in random $r$-partite hypergraphs with $n$ vertices in each partition and average degree $d$. We prove that the maximum balanced independent set has density $\left(\frac{r\log d}{(r-1)d}\right)^{1/(r-1)}$ asymptotically. Furthermore, we prove an analogous low-degree computational threshold of $\left(\frac{\log d}{(r-1)d}\right)^{1/(r-1)}$. Our results recover and generalize recent work of Perkins and the second author on bipartite graphs.
  While the graph case has been extensively studied, this work is the first to consider statistical-computational gaps of optimization problems on random hypergraphs. Our results suggest that these gaps persist for larger uniformities as well as across many models. A somewhat surprising aspect of the gap for balanced independent sets is that the algorithm achieving the lower bound is a simple degree-1 polynomial.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a link between open positroid varieties in the Grassmannians $G(k,n)$ and certain moduli spaces of complexes of vector bundles over Kodaira cycle $C^n$, using the shifted Poisson structure on the latter moduli spaces and relating them to the standard Poisson structure on $G(k,n)$. This link allows us to solve a classification problem for extensions of vector bundles over $C^n$. Based on this solution we further classify the symplectic leaves of all positroid varieties in $G(k,n)$ with respect to the standard Poisson structure. Moreover, we get an explicit description of the moduli stack of symplectic leaves of $G(k,n)$ with the standard Poisson structure as an open substack of the stack of vector bundles on $C^n$.</description>

Abstract: We give an algorithm that, given graphs $G$ and $H$, tests whether $H$ is a minor of $G$ in time ${\cal O}_H(n^{1+o(1)})$; here, $n$ is the number of vertices of $G$ and the ${\cal O}_H(\cdot)$-notation hides factors that depend on $H$ and are computable. By the Graph Minor Theorem, this implies the existence of an $n^{1+o(1)}$-time membership test for every minor-closed class of graphs.
  More generally, we give an ${\cal O}_{H,|X|}(m^{1+o(1)})$-time algorithm for the rooted version of the problem, in which $G$ comes with a set of roots $X\subseteq V(G)$ and some of the branch sets of the sought minor model of $H$ are required to contain prescribed subsets of $X$; here, $m$ is the total number of vertices and edges of $G$. This captures the Disjoint Paths problem, for which we obtain an ${\cal O}_{k}(m^{1+o(1)})$-time algorithm, where $k$ is the number of terminal pairs. For all the mentioned problems, the fastest algorithms known before are due to Kawarabayashi, Kobayashi, and Reed [JCTB 2012], and have a time complexity that is quadratic in the number of vertices of $G$.
  Our algorithm has two main ingredients: First, we show that by using the dynamic treewidth data structure of Korhonen, Majewski, Nadara, Pilipczuk, and Soko{\l}owski [FOCS 2023], the irrelevant vertex technique of Robertson and Seymour can be implemented in almost-linear time on apex-minor-free graphs. Then, we apply the recent advances in almost-linear time flow/cut algorithms to give an almost-linear time implementation of the recursive understanding technique, which effectively reduces the problem to apex-minor-free graphs.</description>

      <title>Balanced two-type annihilation: mean-field asymptotics</title>

Abstract: We consider an interacting particle system where equal-sized populations of two types of particles move by random walk steps on a graph, the two types may have different speeds, and meetings of opposite-type particles result in annihilation. The key quantity of interest is the expected extinction time. Even for the mean-field setting of complete graphs, the correct order of magnitude was not previously known. Under essentially optimal assumptions on the starting configuration, we determine not only the order of magnitude but also the asymptotics: the expected extinction time on $K_{2n}$ is $(2+o(1))n\log n$, independently of the relative speeds of the two types.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a general framework for multi-type interacting particle systems on graphs, where particles move one at a time by random walk steps, different types may have different speeds, and may interact, possibly randomly, when they meet. We study the equilibrium time of the process, by which we mean the number of steps taken until no further interactions can occur. Under a rather general framework, we obtain high probability upper and lower bounds on the equilibrium time that match up to a constant factor and are of order $n\log n$ if there are order $n$ vertices and particles. We also obtain similar results for the balanced two-type annihilation model of chemical reactions; here, the balanced case (equal density of types) does not fit into our general framework and makes the analysis considerably more difficult. Our models do not admit any exact solution as for integrable systems or the duality approach available for some other particle systems, so we develop a variety of combinatorial tools for comparing processes in the absence of monotonicity.</description>

      <title>Hardness of circuit and monotone diameters of polytopes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Circuit diameter of polytopes was introduced by Borgwardt, Finhold and Hemmecke as a fundamental tool for the study of circuit augmentation schemes for linear programming and for estimating combinatorial diameters. Determining the complexity of computing the circuit diameter of polytopes was posed as an open problem by Sanit\`a as well as by Kafer, and was recently reiterated by Borgwardt, Grewe, Kafer, Lee and Sanit\`a.
  In this paper, we solve this problem by showing that computing the circuit diameter of a polytope given in halfspace-description is strongly NP-hard. To prove this result, we show that computing the combinatorial diameter of the perfect matching polytope of a bipartite graph is NP-hard. This complements a result by Sanit\`a (FOCS 2018) on the NP-hardness of computing the diameter of fractional matching polytopes and implies the new result that computing the diameter of a $\{0,1\}$-polytope is strongly NP-hard, which may be of independent interest. In our second main result, we give a precise graph-theoretic description of the monotone diameter of perfect matching polytopes and use this description to prove that computing the monotone (circuit) diameter of a given input polytope is strongly NP-hard as well.</description>

Abstract: Diaconis and Gamburd computed moments of secular coefficients in the CUE ensemble. We use the characteristic map to give a new combinatorial proof of their result. We also extend their computation to moments of traces of symmetric powers, where the same result holds but in a wider range.
  Our combinatorial proof is inspired by gcd matrices, as used by Vaughan and Wooley and by Granville and Soundararajan. We use these CUE computations to suggest a conjecture about moments of characters sums twisted by the Liouville (or by the M\"obius) function, and establish a version of it in function fields.
  The moral of our conjecture (and its verification in function fields) is that the Steinhaus random multiplicative function is a good model for the Liouville (or for the M\"obius) function twisted by a random Dirichlet character.
  We also evaluate moments of secular coefficients and traces of symmetric powers, without any condition on the size of the matrix. As an application we give a new formula for a matrix integral that was considered by Keating, Rodgers, Roditty-Gershon and Rudnick in their study of the $k$-fold divisor function.</description>

      <title>Analytic aspects of $q,r$-analogue of poly-Stirling numbers of both kinds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.06674v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Stirling numbers of type $B$ of the second kind count signed set partitions. In this paper we provide new combinatorial and analytical identities regarding these numbers as well as Broder's $r$-version of these numbers. Among these identities one can find recursions, explicit formulas based on the inclusion-exclusion principle, and also exponential generating functions.
  These Stirling numbers can be considered as members of a wider family of triangles of numbers that are characterized using results of Comtet and Lancaster.
  We generalize these theorems, which present equivalent conditions for a triangle of numbers to be a triangle of generalized Stirling numbers, to the case of the $q,r$-poly Stirling numbers, which are $q$-analogues of the restricted Stirling numbers defined by Broder and having a polynomial value appearing in their defining recursion. There are two ways to do this and these ways are related by a nice identity.</description>

      <title>Directed Acyclic Outerplanar Graphs Have Constant Stack Number</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.04732v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The stack number of a directed acyclic graph $G$ is the minimum $k$ for which there is a topological ordering of $G$ and a $k$-coloring of the edges such that no two edges of the same color cross, i.e., have alternating endpoints along the topological ordering. We prove that the stack number of directed acyclic outerplanar graphs is bounded by a constant, which gives a positive answer to a conjecture by Heath, Pemmaraju and Trenk [SIAM J. Computing, 1999]. As an immediate consequence, this shows that all upward outerplanar graphs have constant stack number, answering a question by Bhore et al. [Eur. J. Comb., 2023] and thereby making significant progress towards the problem for general upward planar graphs originating from Nowakowski and Parker [Order, 1989]. As our main tool we develop the novel technique of directed $H$-partitions, which might be of independent interest. We complement the bounded stack number for directed acyclic outerplanar graphs by constructing a family of directed acyclic 2-trees that have unbounded stack number, thereby refuting a conjecture by N\"ollenburg and Pupyrev [GD 2023].</description>

      <title>Random planar trees and the Jacobian conjecture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.08221v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a probabilistic approach to the celebrated Jacobian conjecture, which states that any Keller map (i.e. any polynomial mapping $F\colon \mathbb{C}^n \to \mathbb{C}^n$ whose Jacobian determinant is a nonzero constant) has a compositional inverse which is also a polynomial. The Jacobian conjecture may be formulated in terms of a problem involving labellings of rooted trees; we give a new probabilistic derivation of this formulation using multi-type branching processes. Thereafter, we develop a simple and novel approach to the Jacobian conjecture in terms of a problem involving shuffling subtrees of $d$-Catalan trees, i.e. planar $d$-ary trees. We also show that, if one can construct a certain Markov chain on large $d$-Catalan trees which updates its value by randomly shuffling certain nearby subtrees, and in such a way that the stationary distribution of this chain is uniform, then the Jacobian conjecture is true. Finally, we use the local limit theory of large random trees to show that the subtree shuffling conjecture is true in a certain asymptotic sense, and thereafter use our machinery to prove an approximate version of the Jacobian conjecture, stating that inverses of Keller maps have small power series coefficients for their high degree terms.</description>

Abstract: We study geometric and topological properties of infinite graphs that are quasi-isometric to a planar graph of bounded degree. We prove that every locally finite quasi-transitive graph excluding a minor is quasi-isometric to a planar graph of bounded degree. We use the result to give a simple proof of the result that finitely generated minor-excluded groups have Assouad-Nagata dimension at most 2 (this is known to hold in greater generality, but all known proofs use significantly deeper tools). We also prove that every locally finite quasi-transitive graph that is quasi-isometric to a planar graph is $k$-planar for some $k$ (i.e. it has a planar drawing with at most $k$ crossings per edge), and discuss a possible approach to prove the converse statement.</description>

      <title>Note on k-Planar and Min-k-Planar Drawings of Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.11610v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The k-planar graphs, which are (usually with small values of k such as 1, 2, 3) subject to recent intense research, admit a drawing in which edges are allowed to cross, but each one edge is allowed to carry at most k crossings. In recently introduced [Binucci et al., GD 2023] min-k-planar drawings of graphs, edges may possibly carry more than k crossings, but in any two crossing edges, at least one of the two must have at most k crossings. In both concepts, one may consider general drawings or a popular restricted concept of drawings called simple (sometimes also `good'). In a simple drawing, every two edges are allowed to cross at most once, and any two edges which share a vertex are forbidden to cross. While, regarding the former concept, it is for k&lt;=3 known (but not widely known) that every general k-planar graph admits a simple k-planar drawing and this ceases to be true for any k&gt;=4, the difference between general and simple drawings in the latter concept is more striking. We prove that graphs with a min-k-planar drawing but no simple min-k-planar drawing exist for every k&gt;=2, and for every k&gt;=3 there even is a graph with a min-3-planar drawing but no simple min-k-planar drawing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.09941v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a poly-time algorithm for the $k$-edge-connected spanning subgraph ($k$-ECSS) problem that returns a solution of cost no greater than the cheapest $(k+10)$-ECSS on the same graph. Our approach enhances the iterative relaxation framework with a new ingredient, which we call ghost values, that allows for high sparsity in intermediate problems.
  Our guarantees improve upon the best-known approximation factor of $2$ for $k$-ECSS whenever the optimal value of $(k+10)$-ECSS is close to that of $k$-ECSS. This is a property that holds for the closely related problem $k$-edge-connected spanning multi-subgraph ($k$-ECSM), which is identical to $k$-ECSS except edges can be selected multiple times at the same cost. As a consequence, we obtain a $\left(1+O\left(\frac{1}{k}\right)\right)$-approximation algorithm for $k$-ECSM, which resolves a conjecture of Pritchard and improves upon a recent $\left(1+O\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{k}}\right)\right)$-approximation algorithm of Karlin, Klein, Oveis Gharan, and Zhang. Moreover, we present a matching lower bound for $k$-ECSM, showing that our approximation ratio is tight up to the constant factor in $O\left(\frac{1}{k}\right)$, unless $P=NP$.</description>

      <title>Ramanujan Bigraphs</title>

Abstract: In their seminal paper, Lubotzky, Phillips and Sarnak (LPS) defined the notion of regular Ramanujan graphs and gave an explicit construction of infinite families of $(p+1)$-regular Ramanujan Cayley graphs, for infinitely many $p$. In this paper we extend the work of LPS and its successors to bigraphs (biregular bipartite graphs), in several aspects: we investigate the combinatorial properties of various generalizations of the notion of Ramanujan graphs, define a notion of Cayley bigraphs, and give explicit constructions of infinite families of $(p^3+1,p+1)$-regular Ramanujan Cayley bigraphs, for infinitely many $p$.
  Both the LPS graphs and our ones are arithmetic, arising as quotients of Bruhat-Tits trees by congruence subgroups of arithmetic lattices in a $p$-adic group, $PGL_2(\mathbb{Q}_p)$ for LPS and $PU_3(\mathbb{Q}_p)$ for us. In both cases the Ramanujan property relates to the Generalized Ramanujan Conjecture (GRC), on the respective groups. But while for $PGL_2$ the GRC holds unconditionally, this is not so in the case of $PU_3$. We find explicit cases where the GRC does and does not hold, and use this to construct arithmetic non-Ramanujan Cayley bigraphs as well, and prove that nevertheless they satisfy the Sarnak-Xue density hypothesis.
  On the combinatorial side, we present a pseudorandomness characterization of Ramanujan bigraphs, and a more general notion of biexpanders. We also show that the graphs we construct exhibit the cutoff phenomenon with bounded window size for the mixing time of non-backtracking random walks, either as a consequence of the Ramanujan property, or the density hypothesis. Finally, we present some other applications of our work: super golden gates for $PU_3$, Ramanujan and non-Ramanujan complexes of type $\tilde{A}_2$, optimal strong approximation for $p$-arithmetic subgroups of $PSU_3$ and vanishing of Betti numbers of Picard modular surfaces.</description>

      <title>The golf model on $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$ and on $\mathbb{Z}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13380v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a particle model, that we call the $\textit{golf model}$. Initially, on a graph $G$, balls and holes are placed at random on some distinct vertices. Balls then move one by one, doing a random walk on $G$, starting from their initial vertex and stopping at the first empty hole they encounter, filling it. On finite graphs, under reasonable assumptions (if there are more holes than balls, and if the Markov chain characterizing the random walks is irreducible) a final configuration is reached almost surely. In the paper, we are mainly interested in ${\bf H}^1$, the set of remaining holes. We give the distribution of ${\bf H}^1$ on $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$, and describe a phase transition on the largest distance between two consecutive holes when the number of remaining holes has order $\sqrt{n}$. We show that the model on $\mathbb{Z}$ is well-defined when every vertex contains either a ball with probability $d_{\sf b}$, a hole with probability $d_{\sf h}$, or nothing, independently from the other vertices, as long as $d_{\sf b} \leq d_{\sf h}$, and we describe the law of ${\bf H}^1$ in this case.</description>
