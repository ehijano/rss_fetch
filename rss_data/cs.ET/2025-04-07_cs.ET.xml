      <title>Haphazard Inputs as Images in Online Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The field of varying feature space in online learning settings, also known as haphazard inputs, is very prominent nowadays due to its applicability in various fields. However, the current solutions to haphazard inputs are model-dependent and cannot benefit from the existing advanced deep-learning methods, which necessitate inputs of fixed dimensions. Therefore, we propose to transform the varying feature space in an online learning setting to a fixed-dimension image representation on the fly. This simple yet novel approach is model-agnostic, allowing any vision-based models to be applicable for haphazard inputs, as demonstrated using ResNet and ViT. The image representation handles the inconsistent input data seamlessly, making our proposed approach scalable and robust. We show the efficacy of our method on four publicly available datasets. The code is available at https://github.com/Rohit102497/HaphazardInputsAsImages.</description>

      <title>Linear Decomposition of the Majority Boolean Function using the Ones on Smaller Variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A long-investigated problem in circuit complexity theory is to decompose an $n$-input or $n$-variable Majority Boolean function (call it $M_n$) using $k$-input ones ($M_k$), $k &lt; n$, where the objective is to achieve the decomposition using fewest $M_k$'s. An $\mathcal{O}(n)$ decomposition for $M_n$ has been proposed recently with $k=3$. However, for an arbitrary value of $k$, no such construction exists even though there are several works reporting continual improvement of lower bounds, finally achieving an optimal lower bound $\Omega(\frac{n}{k}\log k)$ as provided by Lecomte et. al., in CCC '22. In this direction, here we propose two decomposition procedures for $M_n$, utilizing counter trees and restricted partition functions, respectively. The construction technique based on counter tree requires $\mathcal{O}(n)$ such many $M_k$ functions, hence presenting a construction closest to the optimal lower bound, reported so far. The decomposition technique using restricted partition functions present a novel link between Majority Boolean function construction and elementary number theory. These decomposition techniques close a gap in circuit complexity studies and are also useful for leveraging emerging computing technologies.</description>

      <title>A Memristive Based Design of a Core Digital Circuit for Elliptic Curve Cryptography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.14358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.14358v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The new emerging non-volatile memory (NVM) devices known as memristors could be the promising candidate for future digital architecture, owing to their nanoscale size and its ability to integrate with the exciting CMOS technology. In this paper, a combination of memristor devices and CMOS transistors are working together to form a hybrid CMOS-memristor circuit for XAX- Module, a core element for the finite field multiplier. The proposed design was implemented using Pt /TaOx/Ta memristor device and simulated in Cadence Virtuoso. The simulation results demonstrate the design functionality. The proposed module appears to be efficient in terms of layout area, delay and power consumption since the design utilizes the hybrid CMOS/memristor gates.</description>
