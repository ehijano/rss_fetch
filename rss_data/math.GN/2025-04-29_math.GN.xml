      <title>Ordinal Decompositions and Extreme Selections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper contains two natural constructions of extreme hyperspace selections generated by special ordinal decompositions of the underlying space. These constructions are very efficient not only in simplifying arguments but also in clarifying the ideas behind several known results. They are also crucial in obtaining some new results for such extreme selections. This is achieved by using special sets called clopen modulo a point. Such sets are naturally generated by a relation between closed sets and points of the space with respect to a given hyperspace selection.</description>

      <title>A characterization of proper actions with bornology and coarse geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 1961, Palais showed that every smooth proper Lie group action on a smooth manifold admits a compatible Riemannian metric on the manifold such that the action becomes isometric. In 2006, Yoshino studied a continuous proper action of a locally compact Hausdorff group on a locally compact Hausdorff space, and showed that the space carries a compatible uniform structure making the action equi continuous in an appropriate setting. In this paper, we focus on bornological proper actions on bornological spaces and prove that the space admits a compatible coarse structure such that the action becomes equi controlled.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness of Hahn-Banach extensions in locally convex spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We intend to study the uniqueness of the Hahn-Banach extensions of linear functionals on a subspace in locally convex spaces. Various characterizations are derived when a subspace $Y$ has an analogous version of property-U (introduced by Phelps) in a locally convex space, referred to as the property-SNP. We characterize spaces where every subspace has this property. It is demonstrated that a subspace $M$ of a Banach space $E$ has property-U if and only if the subspace $M$ of the locally convex space $E$ endowed with the weak topology has the property-SNP, mentioned above. This investigation circles around exploring the potential connections between the family of seminorms and the unique extension of functionals previously mentioned. We extensively studied this property on the spaces of continuous functions on Tychonoff spaces endowed with the topology of pointwise convergence.</description>

      <title>Fibrewise compactifications and generalised limits in commutative and noncommutative topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce fibrewise compactifications in both the setting of locally compact Hausdorff spaces and continuous maps, and the parallel setting of $C^*$-algebras and nondegenerate multiplier-valued $*$-homomorphisms. In both situations, we use fibrewise compactifications to define regulated limits. In the topological setting, regulated limits extend classical inverse limits so that the resulting limit space remains locally compact; examples include the path spaces of directed graphs. In the operator-algebraic setting, regulated limits realise a direct-limit construction for multiplier-valued $*$-homomorphisms; examples include the cores of relative Cuntz-Pimsner algebras.</description>

      <title>Cauchy convergence in V-normed categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09032v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Building on the notion of normed category as suggested by Lawvere, we introduce notions of Cauchy convergence and cocompleteness which differ from proposals in previous works. Key to our approach is to treat them consequentially as categories enriched in the monoidal-closed category of normed sets. Our notions largely lead to the anticipated outcomes when considering individual metric spaces as small normed categories, but they can be challenging when considering some large categories, like those of semi-normed or normed vector spaces and all linear maps, or of generalized metric spaces and all mappings. These are the key example categories discussed in detail in this paper. Working with a general commutative quantale V as a value recipient for norms, rather than only with Lawvere's quantale of the extended real half-line, we observe that the categorically atypical structure gap between objects and morphisms in the example categories is already present in the underlying normed category of the enriching category of V-normed sets. To show that this normed category and, in fact, all presheaf categories over it, are Cauchy cocomplete, we assume the quantale V to satisfy a couple of light alternative extra properties. Of utmost importance to the general theory is the fact that our notion of normed colimit is subsumed by the notion of weighted colimit of enriched category theory. With this theory we are able to prove that all V-normed categories have correct-size Cauchy cocompletions. We also prove a Banach Fixed Point Theorem for contractive endofunctors of Cauchy cocomplete normed categories.</description>

      <title>On the topology of real algebraic stacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02720v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by questions arising in the theory of moduli spaces in real algebraic geometry, we develop a range of methods to study the topology of the real locus of a Deligne-Mumford stack over the real numbers. As an application, we verify in several cases the Smith-Thom type inequality for stacks that we conjectured in an earlier work. This requires combining techniques from group theory, algebraic geometry, and topology.</description>

      <title>Topological groupoids with involution and real algebraic stacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02760v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To a topological groupoid endowed with an involution, we associate a topological groupoid of fixed points, generalizing the fixed-point subspace of a topological space with involution. We prove that when the topological groupoid with involution arises from a Deligne-Mumford stack over $\mathbb{R}$, this fixed locus coincides with the real locus of the stack. This provides a topological framework to study real algebraic stacks, and in particular real moduli spaces. Finally, we propose a Smith-Thom type conjecture in this setting, generalizing the Smith-Thom inequality for topological spaces endowed with an involution.</description>
