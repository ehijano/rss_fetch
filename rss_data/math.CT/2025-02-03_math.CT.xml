      <title>Projective Presentations of Lex Modalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modalities in homotopy type theory are used to create and access subuniverses of a given type universe. These have significant applications throughout mathematics and computer science, and in particular can be used to create universes in which certain logical principles are true. We define presentations of topological modalities, which act as an internalisation of the notion of a Grothendieck topology. A specific presentation of a modality gives access to a surprising amount of computational information, such as explicit methods of determining membership of the subuniverse via internal sheaf conditions. Furthermore, assuming all terms of the presentation satisfy the axiom of choice, we are able to describe generic and powerful computational tools for modalities. This assumption is validated for presentations given by representables in presheaf categories. We deduce a local choice principle, and an internal reconstruction of Kripke-Joyal style reasoning. We use the local choice principle to show how to relate cohomology between universes, showing that a certain class of abelian groups has cohomolgoy stable between universes. We apply the methods to a prominent example, a type theory axiomatising the classifying topos of an algebraic theory, which specialises to give type theories for synthetic algebraic geometry and synthetic higher category theory.We apply the sheaf conditions to show that several presentations of interest are subcanonical, and apply the cohomology methods to show that quasi-coherent modules have cohomology stable between the Zariski, \'etale and fppf toposes.</description>

      <title>What is Connectivity?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore a taxonomy of connectivity for space-like structures. It is inspired by isolating posets of connected pieces of a space and examining its embedding in the ambient space. The taxonomy includes in its scope all standard notions of connectivity in point-set and point-free contexts, such as connectivity in graphs and hypergraphs (as well as k-connectivity in graphs), connectivity and path-connectivity in topology, and connectivity of elements in a frame.</description>

      <title>Logical Aspects of Virtual Double Categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17869v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This thesis deals with two main topics: virtual double categories as semantics environments for predicate logic, and a syntactic presentation of virtual double categories as a type theory. One significant principle of categorical logic is bringing together the semantics and the syntax of logical systems in a common categorical framework. This thesis is intended to propose a double-categorical method for categorical logic in line with this principle. On the semantic side, we investigate virtual double categories as a model of predicate logic and illustrate that this framework subsumes the existing frameworks properly. On the syntactic side, we develop a type theory called FVDblTT that is designed as an internal language for virtual double categories.</description>

      <title>String Diagrams for Graded Monoidal Theories with an Application to Imprecise Probability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18404v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this technical report we introduce string diagrams for graded symmetric monoidal categories. Our approach includes a definition of graded monoidal theory and the corresponding freely generated syntactic category. Also, we show how an axiomatic presentation for the graded theory may be modularly obtained from one for the grading theory and one for the base category. The Para construction on monoidal actegories is a motivating example for our framework. As a case study, we show how to axiomatize a variant of the graded category ImP, recently introduced by Liell-Cock and Staton to model imprecise probability.</description>
