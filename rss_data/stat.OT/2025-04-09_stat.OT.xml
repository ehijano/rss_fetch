Abstract: A strong sense of classroom community is associated with many positive learning outcomes and is a critical contributor to undergraduate students' persistence in STEM, particularly for women and students of color. This chapter describes a mixed-methods investigation into the relationship between classroom community and course attributes in introductory undergraduate mathematics and statistics courses, mediated by student demographics. The project was motivated by and conducted amid the Covid-19 pandemic: data were collected from online courses in the 2021-21 academic year and from hybrid and in-person courses in the 2021-22 academic year. Quantitative data was gathered from both students and instructors and analyzed using structural equation modeling. The primary instrument was the validated Classroom Community Scale - Short Form. These quantitative results are complemented and contextualized by thematic and textual analyses of focus group data, gathered using a newly developed protocol piloted during the 2021-22 academic year. All data comes from a highly selective private university in the United States. Preliminary practical implications of the study include the value of synchronous participation in fostering connectedness and the importance of attending to students' personal identities in understanding their experiences of belonging.</description>
