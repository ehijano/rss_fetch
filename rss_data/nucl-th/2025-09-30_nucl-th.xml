      <title>Shape polarization and coexistence of high-$K$ three-quasiparticle states in odd-mass $N=106$ isotones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Three-quasiparticle $K$-isomeric states in odd-mass $N=106$ isotones within the $A\sim 180$ mass region are systematically investigated using configuration-constrained potential energy surface calculations. The calculations successfully reproduce the excitation energies and deformations of known high-$K$ isomers in the nuclei from $^{175}$Tm to $^{181}$Re. For the nuclei closer to the $Z=82$ shell closure ($^{183}$Ir, $^{185}$Au, and $^{187}$Tl), predictions for the configurations of observed and yet-to-be-observed isomers are provided. The results reveal strong shape polarization, where the three-quasiparticle states are driven to larger deformations compared to the often shape-soft or spherical ground states. A particularly rich spectrum of shape coexistence is predicted in $^{187}$Tl, where several high-$K$ three-quasiparticle configurations with distinct prolate, oblate, and triaxial shapes are found to coexist at similar excitation energies. Notably, the oblate-deformed $K^{\pi}=29/2^+$ configuration at $E_x = 1839$ keV is proposed to be responsible for a long-lived isomer. This study provides a comprehensive picture of shape evolution and coexistence in high-$K$ multi-quasiparticle states, offering valuable insights for future experimental research.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the impact of pre-equilibrium evolution on the charm quark $R_{AA}$ and $v_2$ in Pb+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV. We observe that there is significant diffusion in the pre-equilibrium evolution, but there is no measurable effect on the final state observables.</description>

      <title>Multi-strangeness matter from ab initio calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hypernuclei and hypernuclear matter connect nuclear structure in the strangeness sector with the astrophysics of neutron stars, where hyperons are expected to emerge at high densities and affect key astrophysical observables. We present the first {\em ab initio} calculations that simultaneously describe single- and double-$\Lambda$ hypernuclei from the light to medium-mass range, the equation of state for $\beta$-stable hypernuclear matter, and neutron star properties. Despite the formidable complexity of quantum Monte Carlo~(QMC) simulations with multiple baryonic degrees of freedom, by combining nuclear lattice effective field theory with a newly developed auxiliary-field QMC algorithm we achieve the first sign-problem free {\em ab initio} QMC simulations of hypernuclear systems containing an arbitrary number of neutrons, protons, and $\Lambda$ hyperons, including all relevant two- and three-body interactions. This eliminates reliance on the symmetry-energy approximation, long used to interpolate between symmetric nuclear matter and pure neutron matter. Our unified calculations reproduce hyperon separation energies, yield a neutron star maximum mass consistent with observations, predict tidal deformabilities compatible with gravitational-wave measurements, and give a trace anomaly in line with Bayesian constraints. By bridging the physics of finite hypernuclei and infinite hypernuclear matter within a single {\em ab initio} framework, this work establishes a direct microscopic link between hypernuclear structure, dense matter composition, and the astrophysical properties of neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Initial spin fluctuations in heavy-ion collisions and where to find them</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collective spin phenomena in the final states of heavy-ion collisions are typically understood to originate from vorticity and shear in the quark-gluon plasma. Here, we ask whether spin could already be present in the initial condition of the collisions. In particular, we argue that if a spin density exists at the beginning of the QGP expansion, it should experience event-by-event fluctuations due to the finite number of participant nucleons. In this contribution, we propose a simple model of fluctuating spin initial conditions for event-by-event spin hydrodynamics based on the Glauber Monte Carlo paradigm. We postulate that, if the net spin of the events is conserved from the initial to the final state, then initial state fluctuations of spin should manifest in specific spin correlations of $\Lambda$ hyperons. Within our picture, we predict that this signal is much larger in central O+O collisions than in central Pb+Pb collisions.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic moments of ground and excited states calculated in heavy odd-N open-shell nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within nuclear DFT, we calculated spectroscopic magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole moments in various quasiparticle configurations of odd-$N$, even-$Z$, $83\leq{}N\leq125$ nuclei ranging from gadolinium to osmium. By tagging the blocked quasiparticles with single-particle states of semi-magic dysprosium isotope, we efficiently calculated 22 prolate and 22 oblate states in each of the 154 nuclei, and we tracked them across the entire major neutron shell. We compared this extensive set of theoretical results with experimental data available for 82 states in the region. Breaking the rotational, time-reversal, and signature symmetries, we aligned the intrinsic angular momenta along the axis of axial symmetry, thereby enabling the full shape and spin self-consistent polarizations. The spectroscopic moments were then obtained by restoring the rotational symmetry. We conducted a detailed analysis of the pattern of agreement and disagreement between theory and experiment in individual nuclei. For the magnetic dipole moments, the agreement with data varies and is characterized by an overall average and RMS deviations of 0.11$\mu_N$ and 0.35$\mu_N$, respectively. For the electric quadrupole moments, a good corresponding agreement of 0.16b and 0.29b was observed.</description>

      <title>Nuclear state and level densities of actinides with the shell-model Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of heavy open-shell nuclei requires model spaces that are too large for the direct diagonalization approaches of conventional shell-model calculations. The shell-model Monte Carlo (SMMC) method enables calculations of the thermal properties of heavy nuclei in very large model spaces. Here, we extend the SMMC method to the actinides. Fifteen even-even and odd-mass actinides $^{232}$Th, $^{\textrm{234-239}}$U, $^{\textrm{240-243}}$Pu, $^{\textrm{246-248}}$Cm, and $^{250}$Cf are studied using a single-particle model space that is larger than one major shell each for protons and neutrons, with a total dimension of the many-particle space as large as $10^{32}$. We use spin projection methods to calculate nuclear level densities and average $s$-wave neutron resonance spacings, both of which are found to be in good agreement with recent experiments.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal effective field theory and its applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We review recent applications of nonlocal effective field theory, focusing in particular on nonlocal chiral effective theory and nonlocal quantum electrodynamics (QED), as well as an extension of nonlocal effective theory to curved spacetime. For the chiral effective theory, we discuss the calculation of generalized parton distributions (GPDs) of the nucleon at nonzero skewness, along with the corresponding gravitational (or mechanical) form factors, within the convolution framework. In the QED application, we extend the nonlocal formulation to construct the most general nonlocal QED interaction, in which both the propagator and fundamental QED vertex are modified due to the nonlocal Lagrangian, while preserving the Ward-Green-Takahashi identities. For consistency with the modified propagator, a solid quantization is proposed, and the nonlocal QED is applied to explain the lepton $g-2$ anomalies without the introduction of new particles or interactions. Finally, with an extension of the chiral effective action to curved spacetime, we investigate the nonlocal energy-momentum tensor and gravitational form factors of the nucleon with a nonlocal pion-nucleon interaction.</description>

      <title>Bulk viscosity from neutron decays to dark baryons in neutron star matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The possibility of neutron decay into dark particles has been proposed as a way to resolve a growing discrepancy between two different measurements of the neutron lifetime. The most popular formulation is a dark sector consisting of a dark baryon $\chi$ and a dark scalar $\phi$, where a neutron in vacuum decays about 1% of the time via the channel $n\rightarrow \chi+\phi$. In this work, we consider the effect of this additional neutron decay channel on transport in neutrons star mergers. We find that the neutron dark decay rate in medium is quite slow, and thus the dark baryons modify the dense matter equation of state in a way that decreases the Urca bulk viscosity by, at most, a factor of 2-3. However, if the neutron dark decay was to occur more rapidly, then the bulk viscosity at merger temperatures of tens of MeV would be strongly enhanced, potentially rapidly damping oscillations in merger environments and therefore providing a signature of slowly equilibrating matter in the merger.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.26374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The effective kinetic theory (EKT) of QCD provides a possible picture of various non-equilibrium processes in heavy- and light-ion collisions. While there have been substantial advances in simulating the EKT in simple systems with enhanced symmetry, eventually, event-by-event simulations will be required for a comprehensive phenomenological modeling. As of now, these simulations are prohibitively expensive due to the numerical complexity of the Monte Carlo evaluation of the collision kernels. In this talk, we show how the evaluation of the collision kernels can be performed using neural networks paving the way to full event-by-event simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.26379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We obtain the collision kernel and related dipole cross section during the initial nonequilibrium stages in heavy-ion collisions. These quantities are a crucial input for jet quenching calculations. We further compute the gluon splitting rates in the AMY formalism resulting from this nonequilibrium kernel. Comparing with thermal and commonly used forms, we find that particularly the gluon splitting rate for parton energies of the order of the hard effective temperature significantly differs from these approximations.</description>

      <title>Precision measurement and modelling of the threshold-free 210Pb \beta spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Beta decay is a fundamental process that governs nuclear stability and serves as a sensitive probe of the weak interaction and possible physics beyond the Standard Model of particle physics. However, precise measurements of complete \beta decay spectra, particularly at low energies, remain experimentally and theoretically challenging. Here we report a high-precision, threshold-free measurement of the full \beta decay spectrum of 210Pb to excited states of 210Bi, using a transition-edge sensor (TES)-based micro-calorimeter. This approach enables the detection of \beta particle energies from 0 keV up to their endpoint by coincidence summing with subsequent de-excitation energy, thereby eliminating reconstruction artifacts near zero energy that have traditionally limited low-energy spectral accuracy. To our knowledge, this is the first complete, high-precision \beta decay spectrum from 0 keV. The data resolve theoretical uncertainties associated with the atomic quantum exchange (AQE) effect. An accompanying ab initio theoretical framework, incorporating atomic, leptonic, and nuclear components, predicts a statistically significant (7.2 {\sigma}) enhancement in \beta emission probability near zero energy, in agreement with the measurement and in contrast to models that omit AQE corrections. These results provide a new benchmark for \beta decay theory at low energies, deepen our understanding of the weak interaction, and establish a critical foundation for searches for new physics, including dark matter interactions and precision studies of neutrinos.</description>

      <title>The Physics of Jet Quenching in Perturbative QCD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.26394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hard processes in collider experiments typically produce QCD jets, which have long served as precision tests of QCD in the vacuum. More recently, heavy-ion programs at RHIC and the LHC have offered a novel perspective on jets, establishing them as unique probes of strongly interacting matter. Experimental observations, including the suppression of high-$p_T$ hadrons and jets, provide compelling evidence for the formation of a new state of matter and its strong coupling to energetic partons.
  These advances have motivated new theoretical approaches to jet quenching that go beyond standard perturbative techniques, aiming to elucidate the mechanisms of energy dissipation and thermalization of energetic partons in the quark-gluon plasma. This review highlights recent progress, beginning with a unified description of medium-induced radiation across the Landau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal regime and its role in turbulent gluon cascades. We then examine radiative corrections that renormalize the transport coefficient $\hat q$, the mechanism of color decoherence in multi-parton systems, and nonlinear QCD evolution equations for jet energy loss. Finally, we confront this framework with experimental measurements, underscoring the need for precision phenomenology to fully exploit the rich data sets from RHIC and the LHC.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.26456v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electromagnetic (EM) probes such as photons and dileptons provide direct insight into the space-time evolution of the hot and dense matter formed in heavy-ion collisions. Being unaffected by strong interactions, they serve as penetrating messengers from all collision stages, from pre-equilibrium dynamics to the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) and hadronic phases. This contribution summarises recent experimental results on direct-photon and dilepton production from RHIC and LHC experiments, as well as at lower energies. Particular emphasis is given to the ongoing 'direct-photon puzzle', the study of universal scaling of direct-photon production over a large range of collision systems and energies. Recent dielectron measurements from ALICE, STAR, and HADES, as well as new experimental developments at the LHC, are presented, along with perspectives for future facilities.</description>

Abstract: Isospin symmetry is well fulfilled in the QCD vacuum, as evidenced by small mass differences of isospin partners and suppressed isospin-violating decays. Recently, the NA61/SHINE collaboration reported an unexpectedly large isospin-violating charged-to-neutral kaon ratio in Ar-Sc heavy-ion collisions (HIC).Using a quark recombination approach, we introduce a function of kaon multiplicities that reduces to unity in the isospin-symmetric limit independently of the scattering energy and type of nuclei. Using this quantity, we show that nucleus-nucleus collisions violate isospin sizably (at the $6.4\sigma$--level), while proton-proton data on kaon multiplicities do not. We predict other isospin-violating enhancements in HIC, such as the proton-to-neutron ratio $p/n \sim 1.2$ and the hyperon ratio $\Sigma^{+}/\Sigma^{-}\sim1.4$. Finally, we extend the approach to antiquarks in the initial state, useful for e.g. pion-nucleus scattering reactions.</description>

Abstract: Techniques from artificial intelligence and machine learning are increasingly employed in nuclear theory, however, the uncertainties that arise from the complex parameter manifold encoded by the neural networks are often overlooked. Epistemic uncertainties arising from training the same network multiple times for an ensemble of initial weight sets offer a first insight into the confidence of machine learning predictions, but they often come with a high computational cost. Instead, we apply a single-model uncertainty quantification method called {\Delta}-UQ that gives epistemic uncertainties with one-time training. We demonstrate our approach on a 2-feature model of nuclear binding energies per nucleon with proton and neutron number pairs as inputs. We show that {\Delta}-UQ can produce reliable and self-consistent epistemic uncertainty estimates and can be used to assess the degree of confidence in predictions made with deep neural networks.</description>

      <title>The DNA of nuclear models: How AI predicts nuclear masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08370v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Obtaining high-precision predictions of nuclear masses, or equivalently nuclear binding energies, $E_b$, remains an important goal in nuclear-physics research. Recently, many AI-based tools have shown promising results on this task, some achieving precision that surpasses the best physics models. However, the utility of these AI models remains in question given that predictions are only useful where measurements do not exist, which inherently requires extrapolation away from the training (and testing) samples. Since AI models are largely black boxes, the reliability of such an extrapolation is difficult to assess. We present an AI model that not only achieves cutting-edge precision for $E_b$, but does so in an interpretable manner. For example, we find that (and explain why) the most important dimensions of its internal representation form a double helix, where the analog of the hydrogen bonds in DNA here link the number of protons and neutrons found in the most stable nucleus of each isotopic chain. Furthermore, we show that the AI prediction of $E_b$ can be factorized and ordered hierarchically, with the most important terms corresponding to well-known symbolic models (such as the famous liquid drop). Remarkably, the improvement of the AI model over symbolic ones can almost entirely be attributed to an observation made by Jaffe in 1969 based on the structure of most known nuclear ground states. The end result is a fully interpretable data-driven model of nuclear masses based on physics deduced by AI.</description>

      <title>Nuclear transitions on demand</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11794v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I show a way to tune photo-nuclear cross section effectively and therefore achieve nuclear transitions "on demand". The method is based on combinatorial enhancement of multiphoton processes under intense conditions. Taking advantage of recent advances in high-power laser systems (HPLS) and nuclear structure calculations, efficient control of nuclear transitions up to E4 in multipolarity can be reached today. The same idea can be extended to the search for rare transitions and hidden states, which applies to the $\gamma$-beams generated from conventional sources as well.</description>

      <title>Unified exact WKB framework for resonance -- Zel'dovich/complex-scaling regularization and rigged Hilbert space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02301v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a unified framework for analyzing quantum mechanical resonances using the exact WKB method. The non-perturbative formulation based on the exact WKB method works for incorporating the Zel'dovich regularization, the complex scaling method, and the rigged Hilbert space. While previous studies have demonstrated the exact WKB analysis in bound state problems, our work extends its application to quasi-stationary states. By examining the inverted Rosen--Morse potential, we illustrate how the exact WKB analysis captures resonant phenomena in a rigorous manner. We explore the equivalence and complementarity of different well-established regularizations \`a la Zel'dovich and complex scaling within this framework. Also, we find the most essential regulator of functional analyticity and construct a modified Hilbert space of the exact WKB framework for resonance, which is called the rigged Hilbert space. This offers a deeper understanding of resonant states and their analytic structures. Our results provide a concrete demonstration of the non-perturbative accuracy of exact WKB methods in unstable quantum systems.</description>
