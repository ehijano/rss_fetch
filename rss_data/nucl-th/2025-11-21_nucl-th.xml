      <title>Ab initio calculations of monopole sum rules: From finite nuclei to infinite nuclear matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute moments of the isoscalar monopole response of N = Z closed-shell nuclei based on chiral nucleon-nucleon plus three-nucleon interactions. We employ the random phase approximation (RPA) and two ab initio many-body approaches, the in-medium similarity renormalization group (IMSRG) and coupled-cluster theory (CC). In the IMSRG framework, the moments are obtained as ground-state expectation values, whereas in the CC approach, they are evaluated through excited-state calculations. We find good agreement between the IMSRG and CC results across all nuclei studied. RPA provides a reasonable approximation to the correlated methods if the interaction is soft. From the calculated moments, we extract average energies of the monopole response, compute finite-nucleus incompressibilities, and estimate the incompressibility of symmetric nuclear matter by a fit to a leptodermous expansion. Our extrapolated values are lower than those obtained in nuclear matter calculations with the same interactions, but the values are consistent with phenomenological ranges.</description>

      <title>Post-Supernova Accretion of Light Elements onto a New-Born Neutron Star and NS 1987A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We model early accretion of light elements, He, C, and O, onto a new-born neutron star using the public stellar evolution code MESA, simulating what may happen during the first few years of its life. We find that, under the appropriate conditions, significant amounts of these elements can be accreted up to densities of 10^9 g/cc without triggering a nuclear explosion that would convert them into heavy elements. These results help to understand observations that favor light elements in the atmospheres of young cooling neutron stars, as the one found in the supernova remnant Cassiopeia A, and also add support to the recent indications for the presence of a neutron star, NS 1987A, in the remnant of SN 1987A.</description>

      <title>Neutron star heating vs. HST observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16507v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Passively cooling neutron stars (NSs) should reach undetectably low surface temperatures $T_s&lt;10^4$ K in less than $10^7$ yr. However, HST observations have revealed likely thermal UV emission from the Gyr-old millisecond pulsars PSR~J0437$-$4715 and PSR~J2124$-$3358, and from the $\sim10^{7-8}$ yr-old classical pulsars PSR~B0950$+$08 and PSR~J0108$-$1431, implying $T_s\sim10^5$ K and the need for heating mechanisms. We compute the thermal evolution of these NSs including rotochemical heating (RH) in the core with normal or Cooper-paired matter, vortex creep (VC) in the inner crust, and crustal heating through nuclear reactions, and compare the results with observations and with the upper limit for PSR~2144$-$3933. No single mechanism explains all sources. The high temperature of PSR~J0437$-$4715 can be reproduced by RH with a large Cooper pairing gap $\Delta_i\sim1.5$ MeV for either neutrons or protons, but this requires an unrealistically short initial period $P_0\lesssim1.8$ ms to activate the same mechanism in PSR~B0950$+$08. Conversely, the latter can be explained by RH with modified Urca reactions in normal matter or by VC with an excess angular momentum $J\sim3\times10^{43}$ erg,s, but these models underpredict PSR~J0437$-$4715. A model combining RH with a large pairing gap and VC matches both pulsars and is consistent with the upper limits for the remaining three. It further predicts that their temperatures should lie close to these limits, suggesting that deeper or broader-wavelength observations would provide a strong test of this scenario.</description>

      <title>A critical assessment of the current implementations of the Generator Coordinate Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02173v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The generator coordinate method (GCM) was introduced in nuclear physics by Wheeler and independently by Peierls and their collaborators in 1950's and it is still one of the mostly used approximations for treating nuclear large amplitude collective motion (LACM). GCM was inspired by similar methods introduced in molecular and condensed matter physics in the late 1920's, after the Schr\"odinger equation became the tool of choice to describe quantum phenomena. The interest in the 1983 extension of GCM suggested by Reinhard, Cusson and Goeke, which includes the internal excitations (absent in the initial GCM formulation), was revived in recent years. Unfortunately this newer version of time-dependent GCM (TDGCM) framework has flaws, which prevents it from describing correctly many anticipated features, in particular interference and entanglement, which can play an important role in fission and many-nucleon transfer reactions. I present here an alternative formulation, the enhanced GCM (eGCM), which is free of difficulties encountered in previous GCM implementations and which is relevant for fission and many-nucleon transfer in heavy-ion reactions, and which can be used in either static or time-dependent eGCM formulations. In the eGCM framework the corresponding many-body waves functions have a much more complex structure and this framework is equivalent to a configuration interaction (CI) approach in the continuum for nuclear reactions. eGCM is aimed to be used in the microscopic description of heavy-ion reactions and fission in particular.</description>

      <title>Quadrupole Strength in Isobaric Triplets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.15375v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dependence of the $E2$ matrix elements on isospin projection $T_z$ is linked to the conservation of the isospin symmetry. To study this conjecture, we calculated the ${B(E2: 2^+ \rightarrow 0^+)}$ rates for the even-even $T=1$ mirror nuclei with $42$ $\leq$ $A$ $\leq$ $98$ within nuclear density functional theory, employing the generalized Bohr Hamiltonian, and carrying out angular momentum projection. We demonstrated that collective effects are crucial for describing experimental data near the $N=Z$ line without invoking explicit beyond-Coulomb isospin symmetry-breaking corrections. We also determined the $B(E2\downarrow)$ values for odd-odd $T_z=0$ nuclei $^{70}Br$ and $^{78}Y$ in doubly-blocked configurations. We discussed the requirements for accurately describing isobaric analog states and emphasized how current theoretical results should be interpreted within the study of isospin symmetry across isospin triplets.</description>

      <title>Color superconductivity under neutron-star conditions at next-to-leading order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03834v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The equation of state of deconfined strongly interacting matter at high densities remains an open question, with effects from quark pairing in the preferred color-flavor-locked (CFL) ground state possibly playing an important role. Recent studies suggest that at least large pairing gaps in the CFL phase are incompatible with current astrophysical observations of neutron stars. At the same time, it has recently been shown that in two-flavor quark matter, subleading corrections from pairing effects can be much larger than would be na\"ively expected, even for comparatively small gaps. In the present Letter, we compute next-to-leading-order corrections to the pressure of quark matter in the CFL phase arising from the gap and the strong coupling constant, incorporating neutron-star equilibrium conditions and current state-of-the-art perturbative QCD results. We find that the corrections are again quite sizable, and they allow us to constrain the CFL gap in the quark energy spectrum to $\Delta_{\rm CFL} \lesssim 140~{\rm MeV}$ at a baryon chemical potential $\mu_{\rm B} = 2.6~{\rm GeV}$, even when allowing for a wide range of possible behaviors for the dependence of the gap on the chemical potential.</description>

      <title>Sakai-Sugimoto Model in an Off-Shell: Chiral Lagrangian to All Orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10575v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Sakai-Sugimoto holographic model is famous for implementing the approximate chiral symmetry of QCD and reproducing the Chiral Lagrangian in a top-down approach. In this manuscript, we revisit the model in a formalism that is somewhat different from the original work by Sakai and Sugimoto: We start by identifying boundary degrees of freedom and splitting the bulk equations of motion into dynamical ones and constraints. The former are then solved to all orders in derivatives of the boundary fields. The constraints are left unsolved, leaving the dynamical degrees of freedom off-shell. This approach enables us to systematically derive the effective action of the boundary theory. The derived effective action is very rich in physics: it contains an $U(N_f)$ multiplet of massless pseudoscalars interacting (via trilinear and higher terms) with towers of massive (axial-)vector mesons. In contrast to the previous studies, our effective action is non-local. The original Chiral Lagrangian is recovered as its local expansion in small $\pi$-meson momenta (derivative expansion). We particularly zoom in on the values of four derivative terms couplings, the low energy constants, and compare those with the ones reported in the literature.</description>

      <title>$f$-mode oscillations in hot Neutron Stars: Effect of hyperons and neutrino trapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03288v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present an equation of state formalism for hot Neutron Stars (NSs) which consistently includes the effects of finite temperature, hyperons as well as neutrino trapping, relevant for the study of proto-neutron stars, binary neutron star mergers and supernova explosions. Within a non-linear relativistic mean field description, the framework allows for a systematic variation of nuclear parameters within the range allowed by uncertainties in nuclear experimental data, ensuring compatibility with nuclear theory, astrophysical and heavy-ion data. We then investigate the role of nuclear and hypernuclear parameters as well as thermal effects on NS macroscopic properties and $f$-mode oscillations in hot neutron stars within Cowling approximation. Our results reveal that in hyperonic neutron stars with trapped neutrinos, the saturation nuclear density shows moderate to strong correlation with NS astrophysical observables. We also investigate whether thermal effects break universal relations and provide fit relations for hot NS configurations in the neutrino-trapped regime.</description>

      <title>Re-optimization of a deep neural network model for electron-carbon scattering using new experimental data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.00996v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an updated deep neural network model for inclusive electron-carbon scattering. Using the bootstrap model [Phys.Rev.C 110 (2024) 2, 025501] as a prior, we incorporate recent experimental data, as well as older measurements in the deep inelastic scattering region, to derive a re-optimized posterior model. We examine the impact of these new inputs on model predictions and associated uncertainties. Finally, we evaluate the resulting cross-section predictions in the kinematic range relevant to the Hyper-Kamiokande and DUNE experiments.</description>
