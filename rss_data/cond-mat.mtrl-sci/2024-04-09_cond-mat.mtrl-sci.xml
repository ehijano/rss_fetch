      <title>Evidence for charge mediated coupling in Fe-Ga/PMN-PT composite multiferroic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an experimental study of the magnetoelectric coupling (MEC) in the Fe-Ga/PMN-PT thin film multiferroic composite by means of x-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) and ferromagnetic resonance (FMR). Our measurements show evidence for a charge mediated coupling mechanism, suggested by the asymmetric magnetic remanence (M$_{rem}$) behaviour under opposite electric fields ($\pm$ E) and the asymmetric resonance field (H$_r$) in the FMR measurements. Also, the FMR measurements reveal a perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA), that can be related to an interface charge effect. and it is tunable by E field. Ab initio calculations support the existence of a charge mediated coupling at the Fe-Ga/PMN-PT interface.</description>

      <title>Possible charge density wave induced lattice distortion in ferromagnetic FeGe film</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Binary compound FeGe hosts multiple structures, where skyrmion lattice emerges in the chiral B20 phase and antiferromagnet with charge density wave shows up in the hexagonal phase. Here, we synthesized monoclinic FeGe films which are ferromagnetic with Curie temperature as high as 800 K. By low temperature transmission electron microscope, lattice reconstructions in both real and reciprocal space were captured at 100 K whereas no observable transition was observed in either transport nor magnetic characterizations. We infer the lattice distortion may be induced by charge density wave. Our work suggests FeGe films an ideal platform for understanding the intertwining of charge density wave, lattice distortion and magnetism, and paves the way to the tuning charge density wave by means of lattice engineering.</description>

      <title>Formation and Microwave Losses of Hydrides in Superconducting Niobium Thin Films Resulting from Fluoride Chemical Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconducting Nb thin films have recently attracted significant attention due to their utility for quantum information technologies. In the processing of Nb thin films, fluoride-based chemical etchants are commonly used to remove surface oxides that are known to affect superconducting quantum devices adversely. However, these same etchants can also introduce hydrogen to form Nb hydrides, potentially negatively impacting microwave loss performance. Here, we present comprehensive materials characterization of Nb hydrides formed in Nb thin films as a function of fluoride chemical treatments. In particular, secondary-ion mass spectrometry, X-ray scattering, and transmission electron microscopy reveal the spatial distribution and phase transformation of Nb hydrides. The rate of hydride formation is determined by the fluoride solution acidity and the etch rate of Nb2O5, which acts as a diffusion barrier for hydrogen into Nb. The resulting Nb hydrides are detrimental to Nb superconducting properties and lead to increased power-independent microwave loss in coplanar waveguide resonators. However, Nb hydrides do not correlate with two-level system loss or device aging mechanisms. Overall, this work provides insight into the formation of Nb hydrides and their role in microwave loss, thus guiding ongoing efforts to maximize coherence time in superconducting quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Ferroelectric metals in van der Waals bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The combination of metallicity and ferroelectricity breaks traditional boundaries, paving new avenues for innovative electronic materials and devices. This breakthrough is particularly notable, as metallicity and ferroelectricity have traditionally been considered mutually exclusive physical properties. In this work, starting with non-polar metallic single layers, we propose a general scheme for designing 2D ferroelectric metals (FEMs) based on van der Waals interaction. By first-principles calculations, we further substantiate the feasibility of the design scheme in real materials such as FeSe and H-MnTe2. Notably, this scheme unveils unique metallic ferroelectricity, characterized by reversing polarization through interlayer sliding. Furthermore, the combination of inherent magnetism with sliding ferroelectricity leads to multiferroicity. The investigated design scheme and observed phenomena have broad applicability across 2D materials. Our results not only pave the way for research in 2D FEMs but also offer promising prospects for foundational studies of coupled physical phenomena in 2D lattices.</description>

      <title>Insights on induced magnetic moments and spin textures in synthetic ferrimagnetic Pt/Co/Gd heterolayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To develop new devices based on synthetic ferrimagnetic (S-FiM) heterostructures, understanding the material's physical properties is pivotal. Here, the induced magnetic moment (IMM), magnetic exchange-coupling, and spin textures were investigated at room-temperature in Pt/Co/Gd multilayers using a multiscale approach. The magnitude and direction of the IMM were interpreted experimentally and theoretically in the framework of both X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) and density functional theory (DFT). The results demonstrate that the IMM transferred by Co across the Gd paramagnetic (PM) thickness leads to a flipped spin state (FSS) within the Gd layers, in which their magnetic moments couple antiparallel/parallel with the ferromagnetic (FM) Co near/far from the Co/Gd interface, respectively. For the Pt, in both Pt/Co and Gd/Pt interfaces the IMM follows the same direction as the Co magnetic moment, with negligible IMM in the Gd/Pt interface. Additionally, zero-field spin spirals were imaged using scanning transmission X-ray microscopy (STXM), while micromagnetic simulations employed to unfold the interactions stabilizing the FiM configurations, where the existence of a sizable Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction is demonstrated to be crucial for the formation of those spin textures. Our outcomes may add fundamental physical and technological aspects for using FiM films in antiferromagnetic spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Non-volatile spin transport in a single domain multiferroic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Antiferromagnets have attracted significant attention in the field of magnonics, as promising candidates for ultralow-energy carriers for information transfer for future computing. The role of crystalline orientation distribution on magnon transport has received very little attention. In multiferroics such as BiFeO$_3$ the coupling between antiferromagnetic and polar order imposes yet another boundary condition on spin transport. Thus, understanding the fundamentals of spin transport in such systems requires a single domain, a single crystal. We show that through Lanthanum(La) substitution, a single ferroelectric domain can be engineered with a stable, single-variant spin cycloid, controllable by an electric field. The spin transport in such a single domain displays a strong anisotropy, arising from the underlying spin cycloid lattice. Our work shows a pathway to understand the fundamental origins of spin transport in such a single domain multiferroic.</description>

      <title>Quantification of the strong, phonon-induced Urbach tails in \b{eta}-Ga2O3 and their implications on electrical breakdown</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In ultrawide bandgap (UWBG) nitride and oxide semiconductors, increased bandgap (Eg) correlates with greater ionicity and strong electron-phonon coupling. This limits mobility through polar optical phonon scattering, localizes carriers via polarons and self-trapping, broadens optical transitions via dynamic disorder, and modifies the breakdown field. Herein, we use polarized optical transmission spectroscopy from 77-633 K to investigate the Urbach energy (Eu) for many orientations of Fe- and Sn-doped \b{eta}-Ga2O3 bulk crystals. We find Eu values ranging from 60-140 meV at 293 K and static (structural defects plus zero-point phonons) disorder contributes more to Eu than dynamic (finite temperature phonon-induced) disorder. This is evidenced by lack of systematic Eu anisotropy, and Eu correlating more with X-ray diffraction rocking-curve broadening than with Sn-doping. The lowest measured Eu are ~10x larger than for traditional semiconductors, pointing out that band tail effects need to be carefully considered in these materials for high field electronics. We demonstrate that, because optical transmission through thick samples is sensitive to sub-gap absorption, the commonly-used Tauc extraction of bandgap from transmission through Ga2O3 greater than 1-3 micro meter thick is subject to errors. Combining our Eu(T) from Fe-doped samples with Eg(T) from ellipsometry, we extract a measure of an effective electron-phonon coupling indicating increases in weighted 2nd order deformation potential with temperature and a larger value for E parallel b than E parallel c. The large electron-phonon coupling in beta-Ga2O3 suggests that theories of electrical breakdown for traditional semiconductors need expansion to account not just for lower scattering time but also for impact ionization thresholds fluctuating in both time and space.</description>

      <title>AlphaCrystal-II: Distance matrix based crystal structure prediction using deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computational prediction of stable crystal structures has a profound impact on the large-scale discovery of novel functional materials. However, predicting the crystal structure solely from a material's composition or formula is a promising yet challenging task, as traditional ab initio crystal structure prediction (CSP) methods rely on time-consuming global searches and first-principles free energy calculations. Inspired by the recent success of deep learning approaches in protein structure prediction, which utilize pairwise amino acid interactions to describe 3D structures, we present AlphaCrystal-II, a novel knowledge-based solution that exploits the abundant inter-atomic interaction patterns found in existing known crystal structures. AlphaCrystal-II predicts the atomic distance matrix of a target crystal material and employs this matrix to reconstruct its 3D crystal structure. By leveraging the wealth of inter-atomic relationships of known crystal structures, our approach demonstrates remarkable effectiveness and reliability in structure prediction through comprehensive experiments. This work highlights the potential of data-driven methods in accelerating the discovery and design of new materials with tailored properties.</description>

      <title>Site-ordering/disordering-induced magnetic textures in a vdW ferromagnet by competing global and broken inversion-symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fe5GeTe2 single crystals can be divided into nonquenched (NQ) and quench-cooled (QC) phases with different magnetic properties. A comprehensive understanding of the magnetic property variations in the NQ and QC phases is imperative for guiding Fe5GeTe2 towards spintronics applications; however, it remains elusive. Here, we report a real-space study on the structural and magnetic properties of these two magnetic phases using cryogenic magnetic force microscopy and scanning tunneling microscopy. The thermal history introduces disorder and order to the Fe(1) sites, resulting in the NQ and QC phases exhibiting global and broken inversion symmetry, respectively. The observed magnetic domain transitions (branching to labyrinthine) in the spin reorientation process and the distinct 3D spin textures stabilized by magnetic dipolar interaction observed in field-dependent studies allow the NQ phase to exhibit a more resilient global magnetic state. In contrast, the QC phase exhibits enhanced magnetic anisotropy, resulting in a higher TC. Meanwhile, the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) introduced by the broken inversion symmetry causes the QC phase to exhibit a localized magnetic state: no domain transformation occurs during spin reorientation, and irregular domain states are observed in field-related studies. Our work provides an important reference for understanding the complex magnetic properties in Fe5GeTe2.</description>

      <title>Microscopic Insights into Fatigue Mechanism in Wurtzite Ferroelectric Al0.65Sc0.35N: Oxygen Infiltration Enabled Grain Amorphization Spanning Boundary to Bulk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the first time, the fatigue behavior involving external oxygen in highly Sc-doped AlN ferroelectric film was observed using transmission electron microscope techniques. Despite increasing the Sc composition in AlScN film contributes to reducing the device operation voltage, the inherent affinity of Sc for oxygen introduces instability in device performance. In this study, oxygen incorporation at top electrode edges and grain boundaries accompanied with an increase in current leakage and the disappearance of ferroelectric properties, was observed in nanoscale after long-term field cycling. This observation indicates the emergence of non-ferroelectric and even amorphous states. This presented work revealed solid experimental evidence of an oxygen-involved fatigue mechanism, providing valuable insights into the physical nature of the ferroelectric properties of AlScN films.</description>

      <title>Optical absorption window in Na$_3$Bi based three-dimensional Dirac electronic system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detailed theoretical study of the optoelectronic properties of a Na$_3$Bi-based three-dimensional Dirac electronic system (3DDES). The optical conductivity is evaluated using the energy-balance equation derived from a Boltzmann equation, where the electron Hamiltonian is taken from a simplified $\mathbf{k}\cdotp \mathbf{p}$ approach. We find that for short-wavelength irradiation, the optical absorption in Na$_3$Bi is mainly due to inter-band electronic transitions. In contrast to the universal optical conductance observed for graphene, the optical conductivity for Na$_3$Bi based 3DDES depends on the radiation frequency but not on temperature, carrier density and electronic relaxation time. In the radiation wavelength regime of about 5 $\mu m&lt;\lambda&lt;$ 200 $\mu m$, an optical absorption window is found. This is similar to what is observed in graphene. The position and width of the absorption window depend on the direction of the light polarization and sensitively on temperature, carrier density, and electronic relaxation time. Particularly, we demonstrate that the inter-band optical absorption channel can be switched on and off by applying the gate voltage. This implies that similar to graphene, Na$_3$Bi based 3DDES can also be applied in infrared electro-optical modulators. Our theoretical findings are helpful in gaining an in-depth understanding of the basic optoelectronic properties of recently discovered 3DDESs.</description>

      <title>Electronic origin of solute effects on the mobility of screw dislocation in bcc molybdenum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In body-centered cubic (bcc) metals such as molybdenum, screw dislocations often exhibit non-Schmid behavior, moving in directions unpredicted by the Schmid law. The mobility of these dislocations is notably influenced by the presence of solute atoms within the alloy matrix. In this study, employing first-principles calculations, we delve into the electronic origins of these influences.Initially, we construct both single atomic column and triple atomic column models to simulate the formation of screw dislocations with solute atoms. Our investigation reveals that tantalum (Ta) and tungsten (W) increase the formation energy of solute-dislocation complexes, in contrast to osmium (Os), iridium (Ir), and platinum (Pt). Subsequently, employing a comprehensive screw dislocation dipole model under shear deformation, we explore the combined effects of solute atoms and deformation on dislocation core movement. Our findings demonstrate that Ta and W, positioned as first nearest neighbors, reduce the stress required to move dislocation cores away from corresponding dislocation dipoles. Conversely, Os, Ir, and Pt exhibit an attractive effect on dislocation cores, lowering the energy barrier for screw dislocation formation and enticing dislocation cores towards these solute atoms.</description>

      <title>Eliminating the spin-down critical angle in polarizing neutron optics for expanding the polarization bandwidth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polarized neutron scattering is a very important analysis technique for studies of magnetism, spintronics, and high-sensitivity measurements, among others, offering invaluable information. Yet, the efficiency of such experiments rely on the performance of the polarizing neutron optics to provide high reflectivity and polarization. Presently, state-of-the-art polarizers like Fe/Si supermirrors are not able to polarize neutrons at low scattering angles in a monochromatic beam or able to polarize neutrons with a variety of wavelengths as for a non-monochromatic beam. To overcome this limitation, it is suggested to use Co/Ti multilayers on Ti substrates owing to their favorable scattering length density characteristics. It is shown that this approach enables a wavelength bandwidth several times larger than achievable with state-of-the-art materials on Si or glass substrates. Consequently, enabling the possibility of polarizing neutrons across an extended wavelength range, including those with very high wavelengths.</description>

      <title>Chemically homogeneous boron carbide 10B/11B isotope modulated neutron interference mirrors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel type of neutron interference mirrors based on a chemically homogeneous BxC (x&gt;4) matrix with internal high precision 10B/11B isotope modulation. Simulations predict that these mirrors exhibit very high neutron reflectivities for a small number of bilayer periods. This is experimentally confirmed by neutron reflectivity measurements of mirrors synthesized by ion-assisted magnetron sputter deposition. For example, a 120 nm thick multilayer consisting of just 20 bilayer periods of 10B5.7C/11B5.7C, with a periodicity of 61.5 {\AA}, exhibits a neutron reflectivity of 13 percent at an incidence angle of 4.7 deg for neutrons with a wavelength of 4.825 {\AA}. This is attributed to a high scattering length density contrast between the layers with an interface width &lt;5 {\AA}. Structural analyses by X-ray diffraction, X-ray reflectivity, and transmission electron microscopy demonstrate that the 10B5.7C/11B5.7C multilayer mirrors are composed of amorphous, chemically homogenous B5.7C, without any internal chemical modulation. The data show that 10BxC/11BxC multilayer mirrors have the potential for higher neutron reflectivities at higher q-values using fewer and thinner layers, compared to todays state-of-the-art chemically modulated neutron multilayer mirrors.</description>

Abstract: Light-matter interaction at the nanoscale in magnetic alloys and heterostructures is a topic of intense research in view of potential applications in high-density magnetic recording. While the element-specific dynamics of electron spins is directly accessible to resonant x-ray pulses with femtosecond time structure, the possible element-specific atomic motion remains largely unexplored. We use ultrafast electron diffraction to probe the temporal evolution of lattice Bragg peaks of FePt nanoparticles embedded in a carbon matrix following excitation by an optical femtosecond laser pulse. The diffraction interference between Fe and Pt sublattices enables us to demonstrate that the Fe mean-square vibration amplitudes are significantly larger that those of Pt as expected from their different atomic mass. Both are found to increase as energy is transferred from the laser-excited electrons to the lattice. Contrary to this intuitive behavior, we observe a laser-induced lattice expansion that is larger for Pt than for Fe atoms during the first picosecond after laser excitation. This effect points to the strain-wave driven lattice expansion with the longitudinal acoustic Pt motion dominating that of Fe.</description>

      <title>Near-critical dark opalescence in out-of-equilibrium SF$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The first-order phase transition between the liquid and gaseous phases ends at a critical point. Critical opalescence occurs at this singularity. Discovered in 1822, it is known to be driven by diverging fluctuations in the density. During the past two decades, boundaries between the gas-like and liquid-like regimes have been theoretically proposed and experimentally explored. Here, we show that fast cooling of near-critical sulfur hexafluoride (SF$_6$), in presence of Earth's gravity, favors dark opalescence, where visible photons are not merely scattered, but also absorbed. When the isochore fluid is quenched across the critical point, its optical transmittance drops by more than three orders of magnitude in the whole visible range, a feature which does not occur during slow cooling. We show that transmittance shows a dip at 2eV near the critical point, and the system can host excitons with binding energies ranging from 0.5 to 4 eV. The spinodal decomposition of the liquid-gas mixture, by inducing a periodical modulation of the fluid density, can provide a scenario to explain the emergence of this platform for coupling between light and matter. The possible formation of excitons and polaritons points to the irruption of quantum effects in a quintessentially classical context.</description>

      <title>Time-resolved magneto-optical Kerr effect in the altermagnet candidate MnTe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: {\alpha}-MnTe is an antiferromagnetic semiconductor with above room temperature TN = 310 K, which is promising for spintronic applications. Recently, it was predicted to be an altermagnet, containing bands with momentum-dependent spin splitting; time-resolved experimental probes of magnetism in MnTe are therefore important both for understanding the magnetic structure and potential device applications. We investigate ultrafast spin dynamics in epitaxial MnTe(001)/InP(111) thin films using the time-resolved magneto-optical Kerr effect. At room temperature, we observe an oscillation mode at 55 GHz that does not appear at zero magnetic field. Combining field, polarization, and temperature dependence, we identify this mode as an acoustic phonon-coupled magnon, likely originating from inverse stimulated Raman scattering. Additionally, we observe two optical phonons at 3.6 THz and 4.2 THz, which broaden and redshift with increasing temperature.</description>

      <title>Morphological stability of electrostrictive thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A large electric field is typically present in anodic or passive oxide films. Stresses induced by such a large electric field are critical in understanding the breakdown mechanism of thin oxide films and improving their corrosion resistance. In this work, we consider electromechanical coupling through the electrostrictive effect. A continuum model incorporating lattice misfit and electric field-induced stresses is developed. We perform a linear stability analysis of the full coupled model and show that, for typical oxides, neglecting electrostriction underestimates the film's instability, especially in systems with a large electric field. Moreover, a region where electrostriction can potentially provide a stabilizing effect is identified, allowing electrostriction to enhance corrosion resistance. We identified an equilibrium electric field intrinsic to the system and the corresponding equilibrium film thickness. The film's stability is very sensitive to the electric field: a 40 percent deviation from the equilibrium electric field can change the maximum growth rate by nearly an order of magnitude. Moreover, our model reduces to classical morphological instability models in the limit of misfit-only, electrostatic-only, and no-electrostriction cases. Finally, the effect of various parameters on the film's stability is studied.</description>

      <title>A Fast Analytical Model for Predicting Battery Performance Under Mixed Kinetic Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The prediction of battery rate performance traditionally relies on computation-intensive numerical simulations. While simplified analytical models have been developed to accelerate the calculation, they usually assume battery performance to be controlled by a single rate-limiting process, such as solid diffusion or electrolyte transport. Here, we propose an improved analytical model that could be applied to battery discharging under mixed control of mass transport in both solid and electrolyte phases. Compared to previous single-particle models extended to incorporate the electrolyte kinetics, our model is able to predict the effect of salt depletion on diminishing the discharge capacity, a phenomenon that becomes important in thick electrodes and/or at high rates. The model demonstrates good agreement with the full-order simulation over a wide range of cell parameters and offers a speedup of over 600 times at the same time. Furthermore, it could be combined with gradient-based optimization algorithms to very efficiently search for the optimal battery cell configurations while numerical simulation fails at the task due to its inability to accurately evaluate the derivatives of the objective function. The high efficiency and the analytical nature of the model render it a powerful tool for battery cell design and optimization.</description>

      <title>Solute strengthening and softening from screw dislocation in BCC tantalum: A first-principles study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Improving the high-temperature performance and low-temperature plasticity of tantalum (Ta) alloys is a significant scientific challenge. We employed first-principles calculations to study the interaction between screw dislocations and solute atoms in the body centered cubic (BCC) structure of Ta, with a particular focus on solid solution softening and strengthening. We analyzed the impact of various solute elements on the generalized stacking fault energy (GSFE), energy barriers within the single-atom column displacement model, and their interaction with screw dislocations. The results indicate that Hf and Zr, either individually or in combination, exhibit notable solute softening effects in BCC Ta, significantly reducing GSFE, energy barriers, and interaction energies. In contrast, Nb shows relative insensitivity to solute effects, while Mo, W, and Ir demonstrate solute strengthening effects. The calculations suggest that the interaction energy between screw dislocations and solute atoms is a reliable indicator for predicting strengthening and softening effects. Additionally, we extend these predictions to ternary alloys, demonstrating that the strengthening and softening phenomena in these materials can be explained through the electronic work function at the electronic level.</description>

      <title>The geometry of high-dimensional phase diagrams: II. The duality between closed and open chemical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In our ambition to construct high-dimensional phase diagrams featuring any thermodynamic variable on its axes, here we examine the duality between extensive and intensive conjugate variables in equilibrium thermodynamics. This duality manifests from the distinction between closed and open boundary conditions of a thermodynamic system, to the relationship between the Internal Energy and its Legendre transformations, to the point-line duality in calculating convex hulls versus half-space intersections. Here we focus on the duality relationships of chemical work, with extensive composition variables, N, and intensive chemical potentials, {\mu}. In particular, we explore mixed composition-chemical potential diagrams for oxynitride synthesis, lithium-ion cathode stability, and oxidation of high-entropy alloys. We further illustrate how chemical potential diagrams reveal the driving forces for non-equilibrium growth and dissolution kinetics.</description>

      <title>Quasicrystal bulk and surface energies from density functional theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Are quasicrystals stable or metastable? Density functional theory (DFT) is often used to evaluate thermodynamic stability, but quasicrystals are long-range aperiodic and their energies cannot be calculated using conventional ab initio methods. Here, we perform first-principles calculations on quasicrystal nanoparticles of increasing sizes, from which we can directly extrapolate their bulk and surface energies. Using this technique, we determine with high confidence that the icosahedral quasicrystals ScZn7.33 and YbCd5.7 are ground-state phases--revealing that translational symmetry is not a necessary condition for the T = 0 K stability of inorganic solids. Although we find the ScZn7.33 quasicrystal to be thermodynamically stable, we show on a mixed thermodynamic and kinetic phase diagram that its solidification from the melt is nucleation-limited, which illustrates why even stable materials may be kinetically challenging to grow. Our techniques here broadly open the door to first-principles investigations into the structure-bonding-stability relationships of aperiodic materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase boundaries on high-dimensional phase diagrams are also high-dimensional objects, and can represent phase coexistence between numerous phases simultaneously. On a 2D temperature-pressure phase diagram, phase boundaries are 1D lines separating two phases, with a slope given by the Clausius-Clapeyron relation, dP/dT = {\Delta}S/{\Delta}V. Here, we derive a parametric form of the Clausius-Clapeyron relation that readily scales to high-dimensional phase boundaries. The gradient of a phase boundary guides us on how to increase or decrease the relative stability of a target compound, meaning this generalized Clausius-Clapeyron relation enables us to engineer relative stability with respect to multiple thermodynamic conditions simultaneously. Using this approach, we analyze the acid stability of manganese oxide catalysts on a 4-dimensional Pourbaix diagram with axes of pH, redox potential, nanoparticle size, and aqueous [K+] ion concentration.</description>

Abstract: Rock weathering is a common phenomenon in most engineering applications, such as underground storage or geothermal energy. This work offers a discrete element modelization of the problem considering cohesive granular material and debonding effect. Oedometer conditions are applied during the weathering and the evolution of the coefficient of lateral earth pressure, a proxy of the state of stress, is tracked. Especially, the influence of the degree of cementation, the confining pressure, the initial value of k0 and the history of load are investigated. It has been emphasized that the granular media aims to reach an attractor configuration. And the grain reorganization occurring is divided into two main phenomena: the collapse of the unstable chain forces (stable only thanks to the cementation) and the softening of the grains.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the nanomorphology of HfN thin films by ultrafast reciprocal space mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hafnium Nitride (HfN) is a promising and very robust alternative to gold for applications of nanoscale metals. Details of the nanomorphology related to variations in strain states and optical properties can be crucial for applications in nanophotonics and plasmon-assisted chemistry. We use ultrafast reciprocal space mapping (URSM) with hard x-rays to unveil the nanomorphology of thin HfN films. Static high-resolution x-ray diffraction reveals a twofold composition of the thin films being separated into regions with identical lattice constant and similar out-of-plane but hugely different in-plane coherence lengths. URSM upon femtosecond laser excitation reveals different transient strain dynamics for the two respective Bragg peak components. This unambiguously locates the longer in-plane coherence length in the first 15\,nm of the thin film adjacent to the substrate. The transient shift of the broad diffraction peak displays the strain dynamics of the entire film, implying that the near-substrate region hosts nanocrystallites with small and large coherence length, whereas the upper part of the film grows in small columnar grains. Our results illustrate that URSM is a suitable technique for non-destructive investigations of the depth-resolved nanomorphology of nanostructures.</description>

      <title>Air-Water Interface-Assisted Synthesis and Charge Transport Characterization of Quasi-2D Polyacetylene Films with Enhanced Electron Mobility via Ring-Opening Polymerization of Pyrrole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Water surfaces catalyze some organic reactions more effectively, making them unique for 2D organic material synthesis. This report introduces a new synthesis method via surfactant-monolayer-assisted interfacial synthesis on water surfaces for ring-opening polymerization of pyrrole, producing distinct polypyrrole derivatives with polyacetylene backbones and ionic substitutions. The synthesis result in quasi 2D polyacetylene (q2DPA) film with enhanced charge transport behavior. We employed time-of-flight photoconductivity (TOFP) measurements using pulsed laser light of tunable wavelength for photoexcitation of the charge carriers within the q2DPA film. The charge transport was measured in the lateral direction as a function of external bias voltage ranging from 0 V to 200 V. We observed high electron mobility ({\mu}) of q2DPA reaching values of 375 cm2 V-1 s-1 at bias voltage Vb = -20V and photon energy of 3.8 eV.</description>

      <title>SrRuO3 under tensile strain: Thickness-dependent electronic and magnetic properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The burgeoning fields of spintronics and topological electronics require materials possessing a unique combination of properties: ferromagnetism, metallicity, and chemical stability. SrRuO3 (SRO) stands out as a compelling candidate due to its exceptional combination of these attributes. However, understanding its behavior under tensile strain, especially its thickness-dependent changes, remains elusive. This study employs machine-learning-assisted molecular beam epitaxy to investigate SRO films with thicknesses from 1 to 10 nm. This work complements the existing focus on compressive-strained SRO, opening a new avenue for exploring its hitherto concealed potential. Using soft X-ray magnetic circular dichroism, we uncover an intriguing interplay between film thickness, electronic structure, and magnetic properties. Our key findings reveal an intensified localization of Ru 4d t2g-O 2p hybridized states at lower thicknesses, attributed to the weakened orbital hybridization. Furthermore, we find a progressive reduction of magnetic moments for both Ru and O ions as film thickness decreases. Notably, a non-ferromagnetic insulating state emerges at a critical thickness of 1 nm, marking a pivotal transition from the metallic ferromagnetic phase. These insights emphasize the importance of considering thickness-dependent properties when tailoring SRO for next-generation spintronic and topological electronic devices.</description>

      <title>Giant photocaloric effects across a vast temperature range in ferroelectric perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solid-state cooling presents an energy-efficient and environmentally friendly alternative to traditional refrigeration technologies that rely on thermodynamic cycles involving greenhouse gases. However, conventional caloric effects face several challenges that impede their practical application in refrigeration devices. Firstly, operational temperature conditions must align closely with zero-field phase transition points; otherwise, the required driving fields become excessively large. But phase transitions occur infrequently near room temperature. Additionally, caloric effects typically exhibit strong temperature dependence and are sizeable only within relatively narrow temperature ranges. In this study, we employ first-principles simulation methods to demonstrate that light-driven phase transitions in polar oxide perovskites have the potential to overcome such limitations. Specifically, for the prototypical ferroelectric KNbO$_{3}$ we illustrate the existence of giant photocaloric effects induced by light absorption ($\Delta S_{\rm PC} \sim 100$~J~K$^{-1}$~kg$^{-1}$ and $\Delta T_{\rm PC} \sim 10$~K) across a vast temperature range of several hundred Kelvin, encompassing room temperature. These findings are expected to be generalizable to other materials exhibiting similar polar behavior.</description>

      <title>Prediction of topotactic transition from black to blue phosphorus induced by surface Br adsorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on first-principles calculations, we propose a potential access to the yet unrealized freestanding blue phosphorus (blueP) through transformation of black phosphorus (blackP) induced by surface bromine (Br) adsorption. Formation of the Br-P bonds disrupts the original sp3 configurations in blackP, generates unpaired pz electrons and induces a structural transformation that results in blueP formation by re-pairing the pz orbitals. Ab initio molecular dynamics simulations confirm that randomly adsorbed Br adatoms on bilayer blackP spontaneously diffuse into specific patterns to render the emergence of the blueP phase. The expected obtainment Br-passivated blueP nanoribbons exhibit tunable band gaps in a wide range and high carrier mobilities of the order of 1000 cm2V-1s-1. This study provides an opportunity to fabricate blueP through the conversion from blackP by tuning its surface chemistry.</description>

      <title>Towards an understanding of particle-scale flaws and microstructure evolution in cold-spray via accumulation of single particle impacts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cold spray coatings are the sum of countless individual bonding events between single particles impacting on top of one another at high velocities. Thus, the collective behavior of microparticles must be considered to elucidate the origins of coating flaws at the scale of the particles and larger, or the dynamic evolution of the overall coating microstructure. Laser-induced particle impact testing (LIPIT) has been extensively used to study single-particle impacts, and in this work is adapted to study the accumulation of numerous particles with knowledge of each individual particle's impact parameters (particle size, velocity). The method reproducibly deposits stacks of gold particles (&gt;20 particles) with different characteristic spectra of impact velocity. The quantitative single-particle data are analyzed in a correlative manner to the structure and flaws in the resulting stacks, providing some first semi-quantitative connections between, e.g., strain and recrystallization, or aberrant particle characteristics and defects. The results highlight opportunities for the study of many-particle phenomena in microparticle impact--from interaction of particles in cold spray to multi-step erosion processes--with a quantitative view of the behavior of single particles.</description>

Abstract: Density functional theory (DFT) is a powerful tool for predicting the electronic band structures of functional materials. However, it is often difficult to intuit how major band structure features$-$such as band gap magnitude, location of band extrema, effective masses, etc.$-$arise from the underlying crystal chemistry of a material. Band structure is represented in reciprocal space, but arises from the orbital and bonding interactions between atoms in real space. Here, we present a conceptual and computable framework to extract chemical bonding origins of DFT-calculated band structure features. As a key example, we explain here the indirect band gap of silicon, which profoundly impacts its properties for use in photovoltaics and electronics. Even in this basic semiconductor material, our approach leads to new insights to understand and engineer its conduction band minimum position. These calculation techniques can be broadly applied to reveal the crystal chemistry origins of electronic structure features in other optical, electronic, and magnetic materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The efficiency and stability of halide perovskite-based solar cells and light-emitting diodes directly depend on the intricate dynamics of solid-solid crystallization[1-23]. In this study, we employ a multi-scale approach using random phase approximation, density functional theory, machine learning potentials, reduced charge force fields, and both enhanced sampling biased and brute-force unbiased molecular dynamics simulations to understand the solid-solid phase transitions in cesium lead iodide perovskite. Our simulations uncover that the direct phase transition from the non-perovskite to the perovskite involves the formation of stacked-faulted and low-dimensional intermediate structures. Through extensive large-scale all-atom simulations encompassing up to 650,000 atoms, we observe that solid-solid crystallization may require the formation of a sufficiently large critical nucleus to grow into a faceted perovskite crystal. Based on simulations, we determine that utilizing (100)-faceted seeded crystallization could offer a promising path for manufacturing high-performance and stable perovskite solar cells.</description>

      <title>Significant Photoluminescence Improvements from Bulk Germanium-Based Thin Films with Ultra-low Threading Dislocation Densities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bulk Ge crystals, characterized by significantly lower threading dislocation densities (TDD) than their epitaxial counterparts, emerge as optimal candidates for studying and improving Ge laser performance. Our study focused on the Ge thickness and TDD impacts on Ge's photoluminescence (PL). The PL peak intensity of a bulk Ge sample (TDD = 6000 cm^(-2), n-doping = 10^16 cm^(-3)) experiences a remarkable 32-fold increase as the thickness is reduced from 535 to 2 micron. This surpasses the PL peak intensity of a 0.75 micron thick epi-Ge on Si (biaxial tensile strain= 0.2 %, n-doping = 10^19 cm^(-3)) by a factor of 2.5. Furthermore, the PL peak intensity of a 405 micron thick zero-TDD bulk Ge sample (n-doping = 5 * 10^17 cm^(-3)) is ten times that of the 0.75 micron thick epi-Ge, rising to twelve times when thinned to 1 micron. The TDD reduction method is highly effective, which relaxes the requirements of high n-doping and stress in enhancing Ge laser performance and thus reduces the side effects of high optical absorption, high non-radiative recombination, bandgap narrowing, and large footprints associated with these two techniques.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanotechnology's impact on semiconductor industry advancement, particularly through the engineering of nanostructures like nanowires, opens new possibilities for material functionality due to the tunable physical properties of nanostructures compared to bulk materials. This paper presents a comprehensive study on group IV semiconductors and their binaries across four polytypes: 2H, 3C, 4H, and 6H, focusing on their optoelectronic application potential. Deep understanding of these polytypes is particularly relevant for nanowire-based technologies. Through first principles modeling, we examine the structural and electronic properties of these materials, emphasizing their band structure, stability, and the feasibility for light-emitting applications. We use a generalized Ising model to discuss materials stability and tendency for polytypism. We also determine relative band edge positions and employ a six $k\cdot p$ model for a detailed understanding of the materials' electronic properties. Due to the comprehensive nature of this study, we provide insight on the chemical trends present in all of the studied properties. Our theoretical predictions align well with existing experimental data, suggesting new avenues for nanostructure-based device development. The discussion extends to the implications of these findings for the fabrication of optoelectronic devices with the studied IV-IV materials, highlighting the challenges and opportunities for future research in nanowire synthesis and their application.</description>

Abstract: In the recent work "Non-reciprocal topological solitons in active metamaterials" (see arXiv:2312.03544v1), for an analytical understanding of the system under consideration, the authors derive an ordinary differential equation for the sine-Gordon (anti)soliton velocity, with the perturbation theory in the adiabatic approximation, via the inverse scattering transform formalism, see Eq. (3) in their work. Here we note that the latter equation for the (anti)soliton velocity also follows from an energy balance approach.</description>

      <title>Self-referencing photothermal common-path interferometry to measure absorption of Si3N4 membranes for laser-light sails</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Laser-light sails are a spacecraft concept wherein lightweight "sails" are propelled to high speeds by lasers with high intensities. The sails must comprise materials with low optical loss, to minimize the risk of laser damage. Stoichiometric silicon nitride (Si$_3$N$_4$) is a candidate material with low loss in the near infrared, but the precise absorption coefficient has not been characterized in the membrane form-factor needed for sails. We use photothermal common-path interferometry (PCI), a sensitive pump-probe technique, to measure the absorption coefficient of stoichiometric and nonstoichiometric silicon nitride. To calibrate PCI measurements of membranes, we developed a self-referencing technique where a measurement is performed twice: once on a bare membrane, and a second time with a monolayer of graphene deposited on the membrane. The absorption of the sample with graphene can be measured by both PCI and more-conventional spectroscopic techniques, enabling the calibration of the PCI measurement. We find that with an absorption coefficient of (2.09 $\pm$ 0.76) $\times$ 10$^{-2}$ cm$^{-1}$ at 1064 nm, Si$_3$N$_4$ is a suitable laser-sail material for laser intensities as high as ~10 GW/m$^{2}$, which have been proposed for some laser-sail missions, while silicon-rich SiN$_x$ (x~1), with an absorption coefficient of 7.94 $\pm$ 0.50 cm$^{-1}$, is unlikely to survive such high laser intensities.</description>

      <title>Theory of local $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ topological markers for finite and periodic two-dimensional systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The topological phases of two-dimensional time-reversal symmetric insulators are classified by a $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ topological invariant. Usually, the invariant is introduced and calculated by exploiting the way time-reversal symmetry acts in reciprocal space, hence implicitly assuming periodicity and homogeneity. Here, we introduce two space-resolved $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ topological markers that are able to probe the local topology of the ground-state electronic structure also in the case of inhomogeneous and finite systems. The first approach leads to a generalized local spin-Chern marker, that usually remains well-defined also when the perpendicular component of the spin, $S_{z}$, is not conserved. The second marker is solely based on time-reversal symmetry, hence being more general. We validate our markers on the Kane-Mele model both in periodic and open boundary conditions, also in presence of disorder and including topological/trivial heterojunctions.</description>

      <title>Quantized perfect transmission in graphene nanoribbons with random hollow adsorbates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Impurities exist inevitably in two-dimensional materials as they spontaneously adsorb onto the surface during fabrication, usually exerting detrimental effects on electronic transport. Here, we focus on a special type of impurities that preferentially adsorb onto the hollow regions of graphene nanoribbons (GNRs), and study how they affect the quantum transport in GNRs. Contrary to previous knowledge that random adatoms should localize electrons, the so-called Anderson localization, noteworthy quantized conductance peaks (QCPs) are observed at specific electron energies. These QCPs are remarkably robust against variations in system size, GNR edge, and adatom properties, and they can reappear at identical energies following an arithmetic sequence of device width. Further investigation of wavefunction reveals a unique transport mode at each QCP energy which transmits through disordered GNRs reflectionlessly, while all the others become fully Anderson localized, indicating the survival of quantum ballistic transport in the localized regime. Our findings highlight the potential utility of hollow adatoms as a powerful tool to manipulate the conductivity of GNRs, and deepen the understanding of the interplay between impurities and graphene.</description>

      <title>Photon Many-body Dispersion: an Exchange-correlation Functional for Strongly Coupled Light-matter Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce an electron-photon exchange-correlation functional for quantum electrodynamical density-functional theory (QEDFT). The approach, photon MBD (pMBD), is inspired by the many-body dispersion (MBD) method for weak intermolecular interactions, which is generalized to include both electronic and photonic (electromagnetic) degrees of freedom on the same footing. We demonstrate that pMBD accurately captures effects that arise in the context of strong light-matter interactions, such as anisotropic electron-photon interactions, beyond single-photon effects, and cavity modulated van der Waals interactions. Moreover, we show that pMBD is computationally efficient and allows simulations of large complex systems coupled to optical cavities.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocal Nonlinear Responses in the Nonequilibrium States: Moving Charge Density Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The incommensurate charge density wave states (CDWs) can exhibit steady motion in the flow limit after depinning, behaving as a nonequilibrium system with time-dependent states. Since the moving CDW, like an electric current, breaks both time-reversal and inversion symmetries, one may speculate the emergence of nonreciprocal nonlinear responses from such motion. However, the moving CDW order parameter is intrinsically time-dependent in the lab frame, and it is known to be challenging to evaluate the responses of such a time-varying system. In this work, following the principle of Galilean relativity, we resolve this time-dependent hard problem in the lab frame by mapping the system to the comoving frame with static CDW states through the Galilean transformation. We explicitly show that the nonreciprocal nonlinear responses would be generated by the movement of CDW states through violating Galilean relativity. Our work demonstrates not only nonreciprocal nonlinear responses in nonequilibrium states but also the application of Galilean transformation in simplifying time-dependent problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Masers have the potential to transform medical sensing and boost qubit readout detection due to their superb low-noise amplification. The negatively-charged nitrogen vacancy (NV-) diamond maser is the only continuous-wave solid-state maser discovered at room temperature, however it suffers from requiring large and bulky magnets which prevent its more widespread use. We present a significant reduction in size of the entire diamond maser using a much lighter and small-footprint electromagnet, reducing the weight from an immovable 2000 kilograms to a portable 30 kilograms. We achieve a maximum maser output power near -80 dBm, ten times higher than the first implementation, and have discovered techniques to reduce the magnetic field strength required for masing by precise manipulation of the spin orientation. With the diamond maser now shrunk to a size that can fit on a lab benchtop, we have brought continuous-wave room temperature masers away from the confines of research laboratories and closer to transforming readouts in quantum computing, frequency standards and quantum-limited medical sensing.</description>

Abstract: Fusion of lipid bilayers in membranes is important in processes from vesicle-cell interactions (as in drug delivery) to exosome-cell signaling, while transient transmembrane electric fields are known to occur spontaneously. Two contacting phosphatidylcholine (PC) lipid membranes are known to fuse into one under external electric fields, suggesting that the interaction between them is modified by the field as they approach, prior to the fusion event. Here we measure directly the adhesion energy between dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) and between distearoylphosphatidylcholine (DSPC) surface layers attached to solid substrates both without and with a transmembrane electric field. We find a marked pressure-dependent adhesion behavior in the electric field, which we attribute to fusion intermediates that are formed, shedding new light on membrane electro-fusion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bernal-stacked tetralayer graphene (4LG) exhibits intriguing low-energy properties, featuring two massive subbands and showcasing diverse features of topologically distinct, anisotropic Fermi surfaces, including Lifshitz transitions and trigonal warping. Here, we study the influence of the band structure on electron dynamics within 4LG using transverse magnetic focusing. Our analysis reveals two distinct focusing peaks corresponding to the two subbands. Furthermore, we uncover a pronounced dependence of the focusing spectra on crystal orientations, indicative of an anisotropic Fermi surface. Utilizing the semiclassical model, we attribute this orientation-dependent behavior to the trigonal warping of the band structure. This phenomenon leads to variations in electron trajectories based on crystal orientation. Our findings not only enhance our understanding of the dynamics of electrons in 4LG, but also offer a promising method for probing anisotropic Fermi surfaces in other materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active optical waveguides combine light source and waveguides together in an individual component, which are essential for the integrated photonic chips. Although 1D luminescent materials based optical waveguides were extensively investigated, 2D waveguides allow photons to flow within a plane and serve as an ideal component for the ultracompact photonic circuits. Nevertheless, light guiding in 2D planar structures normally relies on the precise control of molecular orientation, which is complicated and low yield. Here, we report a strategy to guide polarized light in 2D microflakes by making use of the out-of-plane (OP) orientation of self-trapped excitons in as-synthesized 2D perovskite microplates. A space confined crystallization method is developed to synthesize 2D perovskite microflakes with dominated broad self-trapped excitons emission at room temperature, which are highly OP orientated with a percentage of the OP component over 85%. Taking advantages of the negligible absorption coefficient and improved coupling efficiency of OP orientated self-trapped exciton emission to the planar waveguide mode of the as-synthesized perovskite microflakes, we have achieved a broadband polarized light guiding with a full width at half maximum over 120 nm. Our findings provide a promising platform for the development of ultracompact photonic circuits.</description>

      <title>Zincophilic armor: Phytate ammonium as a multifunctional additive for enhanced performance in aqueous zinc-ion batteries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Corrosion and the formation of by-products resulting from parasitic side reactions, as well as random dendrite growth, pose significant challenges for aqueous zinc-ion batteries (AZIBs). In this study, phytate ammonium is introduced into the traditional dilute Zinc sulfate electrolyte as a multi-functional additive. Leveraging the inherent zincophilic nature of the phytic anion, a protective layer is formed on the surface of the zinc anode. This layer can effectively manipulate the deposition process, mitigate parasitic reactions, and reduce the accumulation of detrimental by-products. Additionally, the competitive deposition between dissociated ammonium ions and Zn2+ promotes uniform deposition, thereby alleviating dendrite growth. Consequently, the modified electrolyte with a lower volume addition exhibits superior performance. The zinc symmetric battery demonstrates much more reversible plating/stripping, sustaining over 2000 hours at 5 mA cm-2 and 1 mA h cm-2. A high average deposition/stripping efficiency of 99.83% is achieved, indicating the significant boosting effect and practical potential of our strategy for high-performance aqueous zinc-ion batteries.</description>

      <title>Effect of collective spin excitation on electronic transport in topological spin texture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop an efficient real-time simulation method for the spin-charge coupled system in the velocity gauge. This method enables us to compute the real-time simulation for the two-dimensional system with the complex spin texture. We focus on the effect of the collective excitation of the localized spins on the electronic transport properties of the non-trivial topological state in real space. To investigate this effect, we calculate the linear optical conductivity by calculating the real-time evolution of the Kondo lattice model on the triangular lattice, which hosts an all-in/all-out magnetic structure. In the linear conductivity spectra, we observe multiple peaks below the bandgap regime, attributed to the resonant contributions of collective modes similar to the skyrmionic system, alongside broadband modifications resulting from off-resonant spin dynamics. The result shows that the collective excitation, similar to the skyrmionic system, influences the optical response of the electron systems based on symmetry analysis. We elucidate the interference between the contributions from the different spin excitations to the optical conductivity in the multiple spin texture, pointing out the mode-dependent electrical activity. We show the complex interplay between the complex spin texture and the itinerant electrons in the two-dimensional spin-charge coupled system.</description>

      <title>Nanomolecular OLED Pixelization Enabling Electroluminescent Metasurfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Miniaturization of light-emitting diodes (LEDs) can enable high-resolution augmented and virtual reality displays and on-chip light sources for ultra-broadband chiplet communication. However, unlike silicon scaling in electronic integrated circuits, patterning of inorganic III-V semiconductors in LEDs considerably compromises device efficiencies at submicrometer scales. Here, we present the scalable fabrication of nanoscale organic LEDs (nano-OLEDs), with the highest array density (&gt;84,000 pixels per inch) and the smallest pixel size (~100 nm) ever reported to date. Direct nanomolecular patterning of organic semiconductors is realized by self-aligned evaporation through nanoapertures fabricated on a free-standing silicon nitride film adhering to the substrate. The average external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) extracted from a nano-OLED device of more than 4 megapixels reach up to 10%. At the subwavelength scale, individual pixels act as electroluminescent meta-atoms forming metasurfaces that directly convert electricity into modulated light. The diffractive coupling between nano-pixels enables control over the far-field emission properties, including directionality and polarization. The results presented here lay the foundation for bright surface light sources of dimension smaller than the Abbe diffraction limit, offering new technological platforms for super-resolution imaging, spectroscopy, sensing, and hybrid integrated photonics.</description>

      <title>Vortex matching at 6 T in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$ thin films by imprinting a 20 nm-periodic pinning array with a focused helium ion beam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Controlled engineering of vortex pinning sites in copper-oxide superconductors is a critical issue in manufacturing devices based on magnetic flux quanta. To address this, we employed a focused He-ion beam (He-FIB) to irradiate thin YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$ films and create ultradense hexagonal arrays of defects with lattice spacings as small as 20 nm. Critical current and magnetoresistance measurements demonstrate efficient pinning by an unprecedentedly high matching field of 6 T visible in a huge temperature range from the critical temperature $T_c$ down to 2 K. These results show that He-FIB irradiation provides excellent opportunities for the development and application of superconducting fluxonic devices based on Abrikosov vortices. In particular, our findings suggest that such devices can operate at temperatures far below $T_c$, where superconductivity is robust.</description>

      <title>Multiple Floquet Chern insulator phases in the spin-charge coupled triangular-lattice ferrimagnet: Crucial roles of higher-order terms in the high-frequency expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the effects of photoirradiation with circularly polarized light on the Dirac half-metal state induced by the ferrimagnetic order in a triangular Kondo-lattice model. Our analysis based on the Floquet theory reveals that two types of Floquet Chern insulator phases appear as photoinduced nonequilibrium steady states and that these two phases can be experimentally detected and distinguished by measurements of the Hall conductivity. It is elucidated that these rich nonequilibrium topological phases come from higher-order terms in the high-frequency expansion called Brillouin-Wigner expansion, which is in striking contrast to usually discussed Floquet Chern insulator phases originating from the lowest-order terms of the expansion. So far, the lattice electron models on simple non-multipartite lattices such as triangular lattices and square lattices have not been regarded as targets of the Floquet engineering because the lowest-order terms of the high-frequency expansion for Floquet effective Hamiltonians cancel each other to vanish in these systems. Our findings of the Floquet Chern insulator phases in a triangular Kondo-lattice model are expected to expand the range of potential models and even materials targeted by the Floquet engineering.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bound states in the continuum (BICs) are spatially localized states with energy embedded in the continuum spectrum of extended states. The combination of BICs physics and nontrivial band topology theory giving rise to topological BICs, which are robust against disorders and meanwhile of the merit of conventional BICs, is attracting wide attention recently. Here, we report valley edge states as topological BICs, which appear at domain wall between two distinct valley topological phases. The robustness of such BICs is demonstrated. The simulations and experiments show great agreement. Our findings of valley related topological BICs shed light on both BICs and valley physics, and may foster innovative applications of topological acoustic devices.</description>

      <title>Implementation of the bilayer Hubbard model in a moir\'e heterostructure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Moir\'e materials provide a unique platform for studies of correlated many-body physics of the Fermi-Hubbard model on triangular spin-charge lattices. Bilayer Hubbard models are of particular significance with regard to the physics of Mott insulating states and their relation to unconventional superconductivity, yet their experimental implementation in moir\'e systems has so far remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate the realization of a staggered bilayer triangular lattice of electrons in an antiparallel MoSe$_{2}$/WS$_{2}$ heterostructure. The bilayer lattice emerges due to strong electron confinement in the moir\'e potential minima and the near-resonant alignment of conduction band edges in MoSe$_{2}$ and WS$_{2}$. As a result, charge filling proceeds layer-by-layer, with the first and second electron per moir\'e cell consecutively occupying first the MoSe$_{2}$ and then the WS$_{2}$ layer. We describe the observed charging sequence by an electrostatic model and provide experimental evidence of spin correlations on the vertically offset and laterally staggered bilayer lattice, yielding absolute exciton Land\'e factors as high as $600$ at lowest temperatures. The bilayer character of the implemented spin-charge lattice allows for electrostatic tunability of Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida magnetism, and establishes antiparallel MoSe$_{2}$/WS$_{2}$ heterostructures as a viable platform for studies of bilayer Hubbard model physics with exotic magnetic phases on frustrated lattices.</description>

Abstract: Resonance-like molecular excitations have been discovered in a series of pyrochlore antiferromagnets, yet their origins and relationships with the coexisting magnon excitations remain a puzzle. Here, by incorporating the spin-lattice coupling and the consequent four-spin interactions through the site-phonon model, we accomplish a unified description of the molecular and magnon excitations, revealing the molecular modes as statistical approximations of the dispersive magnon excitations. Our work demonstrates a general approach to understand exotic spin dynamics in magnetoelastic systems.</description>

      <title>Higher Landau-Level Analogues and Signatures of Non-Abelian States in Twisted Bilayer MoTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent experimental discovery of fractional Chern insulators at zero magnetic field in moir\'e superlattices has sparked intense interests in bringing Landau level physics to flat Chern bands. In twisted MoTe$_2$ bilayers (tMoTe$_2$), recent theoretical and experimental studies have found three consecutive flat Chern bands at twist angle $\sim 2^\circ$. In this work, we investigate whether higher Landau level physics can be found in these consecutive Chern bands. At twist angles $2.00^\circ$ and $1.89^\circ$, we identify four consecutive $C = 1$ bands for the $K$ valley in tMoTe$_2$. By constructing Wannier functions directly from density functional theory (DFT) calculations, a six-orbital model is developed to describe the consecutive Chern bands, with the orbitals forming a honeycomb lattice. Exact diagonalization on top of Hartree-Fock calculations are carried out with the Wannier functions. Especially, when the second moir\'e miniband is half-filled, signatures of non-Abelian states are found. Our Wannier-based approach in modelling moir\'e superlattices is faithful to DFT wave functions and can serve as benchmarks for continuum models. The possibility of realizing non-Abelian anyons at zero magnetic field also opens up a new pathway for fault-tolerant quantum information processing.</description>

Abstract: We theoretically investigate the properties of magnetically-levitated superconducting rotors confined in anti-Helmholtz traps, for application in magnetomechanical experiments. We study both the translational modes and a librational mode. The librational mode gives an additional degree of freedom that levitated spheres do not have access to. We compare rotors of different shapes: ellipsoids, cylinders and cuboids. We find that the stable orientations of the rotors depend on the rotors' aspect ratios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2106.09999v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A change of orbital state alters the coupling between ions and their surroundings drastically. Orbital excitations are hence key to understand and control interaction of ions. Rare-earth (RE) elements with strong magneto-crystalline anisotropy (MCA) are important ingredients for magnetic devices. Thus, control of their localized 4f magnetic moments and anisotropy is one major challenge in ultrafast spin physics. With time-resolved X-ray absorption and resonant inelastic scattering experiments, we show for Tb metal that 4f-electronic excitations out of the ground state multiplet occur after optical pumping. These excitations are driven by inelastic 5d-4f-electron scattering, alter the 4f-orbital state and consequently the MCA with important implications for magnetization dynamics in 4f-metals, and more general for the excitation of localized electronic states in correlated materials.</description>

Abstract: The presence of small hematite (Fe2O3) clusters at low coverage on titanium dioxide (TiO2) surface has been observed to enhance photocatalytic activity, while excess loading of hematite is detrimental. We conduct a comprehensive density functional theory study of Fe2O3 clusters adsorbed on the anatase TiO2 (101) surface to investigate the effect of Fe2O3 on TiO2. Our study shows that TiO2 exhibits improved photocatalytic properties with hematite clusters at low coverage, as evidenced by a systematic study conducted by increasing the number of cluster adsorbates. The adsorption of the clusters generates impurity states in the band gap improving light absorption and consequently affecting the charge transfer dynamics. Furthermore, the presence of hematite clusters enhances the activity of TiO2 in the hydrogen evolution reaction. The Fe valence mixing present in some clusters leads to a significant increase in H2 evolution rate compared with the fixed +3 valence of Fe in hematite. We also investigate the effect of oxygen defects and find extensive modifications in the electronic properties and local magnetism of the TiO2 - Fe2O3 system, demonstrating the wide-ranging effect of oxygen defects in the combined system.</description>

      <title>Abundant surface-semimetal phases in three-dimensional obstructed atomic insulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.01713v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Three-dimensional obstructed atomic insulators (OAIs) are characterized by the appearance of floating surface states (FSSs) at specific surfaces. Benefiting from this feature, our study here shows the presence of abundant surface-semimetal phases in 3D OAIs. The symmetries of obstructed Wannier charge centers ensure the degeneracy of such FSSs at high-symmetry points or invariant lines in the surface Brillouin zone. Utilizing topological quantum chemistry theory, we identify a carbon allotrope with a body-centered tetragonal structure, named bct-C20, as an ideal candidate for realizing different kinds of surface-semimetal phases. For the (001)surface of bct-C20, there are four in-gap FSSs, and these four FSSs form two kinds of surface Dirac cones, i.e., topological Dirac cones with linear dispersion and symmetry-enforced quadratic Dirac cones. The band topology of a surface Dirac cone is captured by the effective surface Hamiltonian and the emergence of hinge states. Moreover, the existence of the surface-nodal-line state is also discussed. This work reports an approach to obtain d-dimensional semimetal phases from the surface states of (d + 1)-dimensional systems, which is of great significance for the studies in revealing topological states and their practical applications in high-dimensional crystals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.11505v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum-well resonance is achieved through partial confinement in magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs), which provides an additional operable degree of freedom to regulate quantum-well levels. Using Al/Fe/MgO/Fe/Al and Ag/Al/Fe/MgO/Fe/Al/Ag MTJs as examples, via first-principles calculations, we demonstrate that the partial confinement of $\Delta_1$ electron at Al/Fe interface and the full confinement at Fe/MgO interface combine to produce quantum-well resonances in Fe. The quantum-well levels of Fe can be periodically adjusted by two degrees of freedom: Fe and Al thickness. The oscillation period obtained from conductance $G_{\uparrow\uparrow}$ is 2.13 ML Fe (9 ML Al), close to 2.25 ML Fe (8.33 ML Al) calculated by bcc-Fe (fcc-Al) band. The combination of long and short periods enables quantum-well levels to be finely adjusted. An ultrahigh optimistic TMR effect of $3.05\times10$$^5$\% is achieved. Our results provides a new path for designing and applying quantum-well resonances in spintronics devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17596v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nickel (Ni) is a magnetic transition metal with two allotropic phases, stable face-centered cubic (FCC) and metastable hexagonal close-packed (HCP), widely used in structural applications. Magnetism affects many mechanical and defect properties, but spin-polarized density functional theory (DFT) calculations are computationally inefficient for studying material behavior requiring large system sizes and/or long simulation times. Here we develop a "magnetism-hidden" machine-learning Deep Potential (DP) model for Ni without a descriptor for magnetic moments, using training datasets derived from spin-polarized DFT calculations. The "magnetism-hidden" DP-Ni model exhibits high transferability and representability for a wide-range of FCC and HCP properties, including (finite-temperature) lattice parameters, elastic constants, phonon spectra, and many defects. As an example of its applicability, we investigate the Ni FCC-HCP allotropic phase transition under (high-stress) uniaxial tensile loading. The DP model for magnetic Ni facilitates accurate large-scale atomistic simulations for complex mechanical behavior and serves as a foundation for developing interatomic potentials for Ni-based superalloys and other multi-principal component alloys.</description>

      <title>The Influence of Chemical Strains on the Electrocaloric Response, Polarization Morphology, Tetragonality and Negative Capacitance Effect of Ferroelectric Core-Shell Nanorods and Nanowires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06797v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire (LGD) approach we proposed the analytical description of the chemical strains influence on the spontaneous polarization and electrocaloric response in ferroelectric core-shell nanorods. We postulate that the nanorod core presents a defect-free single-crystalline ferroelectric material, and the elastic defects are accumulated in the ultra-thin shell, where they can induce tensile or compressive chemical strains. The finite element modeling (FEM) based on the LGD approach reveals transitions of domain structure morphology induced by the chemical strains in the BaTiO3 nanorods. Namely, tensile chemical strains induce and support the single-domain state in the central part of the nanorod, while the curled domain structures appear near the unscreened or partially screened ends of the rod. The vortex-like domains propagate toward the central part of the rod and fill it entirely, when the rod is covered by a shell with compressive chemical strains above some critical value. The critical value depends on the nanorod sizes, aspect ratio, and screening conditions at its ends. Both analytical theory and FEM predict that the tensile chemical strains in the shell increase the nanorod polarization, lattice tetragonality, and electrocaloric response well-above the values corresponding to the bulk material. The physical reason of the increase is the strong electrostriction coupling between the mismatch-type elastic strains induced in the core by the chemical strains in the shell. Comparison with the earlier XRD data confirmed an increase of tetragonality ratio in tensiled BaTiO3 nanorods compared to the bulk material.</description>

Abstract: Optical excitation of chiral phonons plays a vital role in studying the phonon-driven magnetic phenomena in solids. Transition metal dichalcogenides host chiral phonons at high symmetry points of the Brillouin zone, providing an ideal platform to explore the interplay between chiral phonons and valley degree of freedom. Here, we investigate the helicity-resolved magneto-Raman response of monolayer MoS2 and identify a doubly degenerate Brillouin-zone-center chiral phonon mode at ~270 cm-1. Our wavelength- and temperature-dependent measurements show that this chiral phonon is activated through the resonant excitation of A exciton. Under an out-of-plane magnetic field, the chiral phonon exhibits giant Zeeman splitting, which corresponds to an effective magnetic moment of ~2.5mu_B. Moreover, we carry out theoretical calculations based on the morphic effects in nonmagnetic crystals, which reproduce the linear Zeeman splitting and Raman cross-section of the chiral phonon. Our study provides important insights into lifting the chiral phonon degeneracy in an achiral covalent material, paving a new route to excite and control chiral phonons.</description>

      <title>The geometry of high-dimensional phase diagrams: I. Generalized Gibbs Phase Rule</title>

Abstract: Significance Statement
  Phase diagrams are essential tools of the materials scientist, showing which phases are at equilibrium under a set of applied thermodynamic conditions. Essentially all phase diagrams today are two dimensional, typically constructed with axes of temperature-pressure or temperature-composition. For many modern materials, it would be valuable to construct phase diagrams that include additional forms of thermodynamic work--such as elastic, surface, electromagnetic or electrochemical work, etc.--which grows the free energy of materials into higher (&gt;3) dimensions. Here, we extend Gibbs' original arguments on phase coexistence to derive a generalized Phase Rule, based in the combinatorial geometry of high-dimensional convex polytopes. The generalized Phase Rule offers a conceptual and geometric foundation to describe phase boundaries on high-dimensional phase diagrams, which are relevant for understanding the stability of modern materials in complex chemical environments.
  Abstract We revisit Gibbs arguments on the equilibrium of heterogeneous substances and show that phase coexistence regions in high-dimensional Internal Energy space, U(S,Xi,...,Xj), are simplicial convex polytopes--which are N-dimensional analogues of triangles and tetrahedra. In the first of this three-part series, we examine how the combinatorial relationships between the vertices and facets of simplicial polytopes leads to a generalized high-dimensional description of Gibbs' Phase Rule. Because Gibbs' Phase Rule describes the nature of phase boundaries on phase diagrams, this isomorphism between the physical principles of equilibrium thermodynamics and the geometry of simplicial polytopes provides the foundation to construct generalized phase diagrams, which can exist in any dimension, with any intensive or extensive thermodynamic variable on the axes.</description>

      <title>Neural Network Kinetics for Exploring Diffusion Multiplicity and Chemical Ordering in Compositionally Complex Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.02957v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion involving atom transport from one location to another governs many important processes and behaviors such as precipitation and phase nucleation. Local chemical complexity in compositionally complex alloys poses challenges for modeling atomic diffusion and the resulting formation of chemically ordered structures. Here, we introduce a neural network kinetics (NNK) scheme that predicts and simulates diffusion-induced chemical and structural evolution in complex concentrated chemical environments. The framework is grounded on efficient on-lattice structure and chemistry representation combined with neural networks, enabling precise prediction of all path-dependent migration barriers and individual atom jumps. Using this method, we study the temperature-dependent local chemical ordering in a refractory Nb-Mo-Ta alloy and reveal a critical temperature at which the B2 order reaches a maximum. Our atomic jump randomness map exhibits the highest diffusion heterogeneity (multiplicity) in the vicinity of this characteristic temperature, which is closely related to chemical ordering and B2 structure formation. The scalable NNK framework provides a promising new avenue to exploring diffusion-related properties in the vast compositional space within which extraordinary properties are hidden.</description>

      <title>Partial molecular orbitals in face-sharing 3$d$ manganese trimer: Comparative studies on Ba$_{4}$TaMn$_{3}$O$_{12}$ and Ba$_{4}$NbMn$_{3}$O$_{12}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.14640v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a molecular orbital candidate Ba$_{4}$TaMn$_{3}$O$_{12}$ with a face-sharing octahedra trimer, by comparing it with a related compound Ba$_{4}$NbMn$_{3}$O$_{12}$. The synthesis of the polycrystalline powder is optimized by suppressing the secondary impurity phase via x-ray diffraction. Magnetic susceptibility measurements on the optimized samples reveal a weak magnetic hysteresis with magnetic transitions consistent with heat capacity results. The effective magnetic moments from susceptibility indicate a strongly coupled $S=2$ antiferromagnetic trimer at around room temperature, whereas the estimated magnetic entropy from heat capacity suggests the localized $S=3/2$ timer. These results can be explainable by a partial molecular orbital state, in which three $t_{2g}$ electrons are localized in each Mn ion and one $e_{g}$ electron is delocalized over two-end Mn ions of the trimer based on density functional theory calculations. This unconventional 3$d$ orbital state is comprehended as a consequence of competition between the hybrid interatomic orbitals within the Mn trimer and the local moment formation by on-site Coulomb correlations.</description>

      <title>Magnetic field induced partially polarized chiral spin liquid in a transition metal dichalcogenide moir\'e system</title>

Abstract: As one of the most intriguing states of matter, the chiral spin liquid (CSL) has attracted much scientific interest while its existence and mechanism in crystalline strongly correlated systems remain hotly debated. On the other hand, strong correlation driven emergent phenomena can be realized in twisted transition metal dichalcogenide bilayers with a tremendously tunable large length scale providing a new platform for the emergence of CSLs. We focus on a strongly correlated model relevant to heterobilayer $\textrm{WSe}_{2}/\textrm{MoSe}_{2}$ and investigate the Mott insulating phase at half filling under an out-of-plane magnetic field. Considering both its orbital and spin Zeeman effects we identify three conventionally ordered phases including a $120^{\circ}$ N\'{e}el phase, a stripe phase, and an up-up-down phase. For intermediate fields an emergent quantum spin liquid phase is identified with partial spin polarization. We further characterize its topological nature as the $\nu$ = 1/2 Laughlin CSL through the topological entanglement spectrum and quantized spin pumping under spin flux insertion. In addition, we map out the quantum phase diagram for different twisted angles in an experimentally accessible parameter regime.</description>

      <title>Chiral kinematic theory and converse vortical effects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.07064v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Response theories in condensed matter typically describe the response of an electron fluid to external electromagnetic fields, while perturbations on neutral particles are often designed to mimic such fields. Here, we study the response of fermions to a space-time-dependent velocity field, thereby sidestepping the issue of a gauge charge. We first develop a semiclassical chiral kinematic theory that contains a subtle modification of the phase space measure due to the interplay between the Berry curvature and fluid rotation. The theory immediately predicts a converse vortical effect, defined as an orbital magnetization driven by linear velocity. It receives contributions from magnetic moments on the Fermi surface and Berry curvature of the occupied bands, with the latter stemming from the modified measure. Then, transcending semiclassics via a complementary Kubo formalism reveals that the uniform limit of a clean system receives only the Berry curvature contribution, thus asserting the importance of the modified measure, while other limits sense the Fermi surface magnetic moments too. We propose CoSi as a candidate material, and we suggest conducting magnetometry measurements on a sample under a thermal gradient to detect the effect. Overall, our study sheds light on the effects of a space-time-dependent velocity field on electron fluids and paves the way for exploring quantum materials using new probes and perturbations.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear optical diode effect in a magnetic Weyl semimetal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.15603v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diode effects are of great interest for both fundamental physics and modern technologies. Electrical diode effects (nonreciprocal transport) have been observed in Weyl systems. Optical diode effects arising from the Weyl fermions have been theoretically considered but not probed experimentally. Here, we report the observation of a nonlinear optical diode effect (NODE) in the magnetic Weyl semimetal CeAlSi, where the magnetization introduces a pronounced directionality in the nonlinear optical second-harmonic generation (SHG). We show demonstrate a six-fold change of the measured SHG intensity between opposite propagation directions over a bandwidth exceeding 250 meV. Supported by density-functional theory, we establish the linearly dispersive bands emerging from Weyl nodes as the origin of this broadband effect. We further demonstrate current-induced magnetization switching and thus electrical control of the NODE. Our results advance ongoing research to identify novel nonlinear optical/transport phenomena in magnetic topological materials and further opens new pathways for the unidirectional manipulation of light.</description>

      <title>Bioinspired multi-asymmetric magnetized surfaces for tailoring energy-free liquid manipulation and 3-DOF solid transportation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.16740v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Through the utilization of smart materials and well-designed structures, functional surfaces have been developed to enable small-scale liquid/solid manipulation tasks, thereby facilitating crucial applications in the fields of microfluidics, soft robotics, and biomedical engineering. However, the design of functional systems with flexible, tunable, and multimodal liquid/solid manipulation capabilities remains a challenging endeavor. Here, inspired by asymmetric structural features in natural plants and metachrony in cross-scale biological systems, I report a magnetic-responsive functional surface that can achieve rich liquid operations under static magnetic fields, while also enabling the transportation of solids with multiple degrees of freedom (DOFs) under dynamic magnetic fields. The presence of curvature pillars on the surface, combined with their magnetic-driven tilt/gradient arrangement, imparts liquids with multi-directional spreading modes based on the asymmetry of Laplace pressure. I elucidate the mechanisms governing these liquid spreading modes and subsequently develop compelling liquid operations, such as adjustable anti-gravity climbing, spontaneous modal shifts in liquid transport, and liquid mixing. Furthermore, the dynamic metachronal motion of the magnetic pillars can be harnessed for solid object transportation. I illustrate the synchronous/asynchronous transport modes of the surface and propose a novel strategy for achieving 3-DOF solid transportation by coordinating the arrangement of objects and employing magnetic actuation strategies. This study presents a new design concept for application-oriented manipulation surfaces, which hold significant potential for extensive engineering applications.</description>

      <title>Discovery of smectic charge and pair-density-wave orders in topological monolayer 1T$^\prime$-MoTe$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.11101v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electronic liquid-crystal phases are observed in numerous strongly-correlated systems including high-temperature superconductors. However, identifying these exotic phases and understanding their interplay with superconductivity in topological materials remain challenging. Here we employ a cryogenic scanning tunneling microscopy to discover a smectic (stripe) charge order (CO) and a primary pair-density-wave (PDW) in topological monolayer 1T$^\prime$-MoTe$_2$. The two orders are spatially modulated unidirectionally at the same wavevector, but have a marked spatial phase difference of about 2$\pi$/5. Importantly, the primary PDW state features a two-gap superconductivity below the transition temperature of 6.0 K and induces another unique particle-hole-symmetric CO at twice the PDW wavevector. Combining these results and our density functional calculations, we reveal that the two smectic orders are primarily driven by nesting behaviors between electron and hole pockets. Our findings establish monolayer 1T$^\prime$-MoTe$_2$ as a topological paradigm for exploring electronic smecticity, which intertwines with multiple preexisting symmetry-breaking states.</description>

      <title>Analytical Modeling of Acoustic Exponential Materials and Physical Mechanism of Broadband Anti-Reflection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.03538v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spatially exponential distributions of material properties are ubiquitous in many natural and engineered systems, from the vertical distribution of the atmosphere to acoustic horns and anti-reflective coatings. These media seamlessly interface different impedances, enhancing wave transmission and reducing internal reflections. This work advances traditional transfer matrix theory by integrating analytical solutions for acoustic exponential materials, which possess exponential density and/or bulk modulus, offering a more accurate predictive tool and revealing the physical mechanism of broadband anti-reflection for sound propagation in such non-uniform materials. Leveraging this method, we designed an acoustic dipole array that effectively mimics exponential mass distribution. Through experiments with precisely engineered micro-perforated plates, we demonstrate an ultra-low reflection rate of about 0.86% across a wide frequency range from 420 Hz to 10,000 Hz. Our modified transfer matrix approach underpins the design of exponential materials, and our layering strategy for stacking acoustic dipoles suggests a pathway to more functional gradient acoustic metamaterials.</description>

      <title>Accurate Hyperfine Tensors for Solid State Quantum Applications: Case of the NV Center in Diamond</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.03983v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The decoherence of point defect qubits is often governed by the electron spin-nuclear spin hyperfine interaction that can be parameterized by using ab inito calculations in principle. So far most of the theoretical works have focused on the hyperfine interaction of the closest nuclear spins, while the accuracy of the predictions for distinct nuclear spins is barely discussed. We demonstrate for the case of the NV center in diamond that the absolute relative error of the computed hyperfine parameters can exceed 100\% in VASP for weakly coupled nuclear spins. To overcome this issue, we implement an alternative method and report on significantly improved hyperfine values with $O$(1\%) relative mean error at all distances. The provided accurate hyperfine data for the NV center enables high-precision simulation of NV quantum nodes for quantum information processing and positioning of nuclear spins by comparing experimental and theoretical hyperfine data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.12209v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We test the performance of self-consistent GW and several representative implementations of vertex corrected G0W0 (G0W0{\Gamma}). These approaches are tested on benchmark data sets covering full valence spectra (first ionization potentials and some inner valence shell excitations). For small molecules, when comparing against state of the art wave function techniques, our results show that performing full self-consistency in the GW scheme either systematically outperforms vertex corrected G0W0 or gives results of at least the same quality. Moreover, the G0W0{\Gamma} results in additional computational cost when compared to G0W0 or self-consistent GW and the G0W0{\Gamma} dependency on the starting mean-filed solution is frequently larger than the magnitude of the vertex correction. Consequently, for molecular systems self-consistent GW performed on imaginary axis and then followed by modern analytical continuation techniques offers a more reliable approach to make predictions of IP spectra.</description>

Abstract: Crystals are the foundation of numerous scientific and industrial applications. While various learning-based approaches have been proposed for crystal generation, existing methods seldom consider the space group constraint which is crucial in describing the geometry of crystals and closely relevant to many desirable properties. However, considering space group constraint is challenging owing to its diverse and nontrivial forms. In this paper, we reduce the space group constraint into an equivalent formulation that is more tractable to be handcrafted into the generation process. In particular, we translate the space group constraint into two parts: the basis constraint of the invariant logarithmic space of the lattice matrix and the Wyckoff position constraint of the fractional coordinates. Upon the derived constraints, we then propose DiffCSP++, a novel diffusion model that has enhanced a previous work DiffCSP by further taking space group constraint into account. Experiments on several popular datasets verify the benefit of the involvement of the space group constraint, and show that our DiffCSP++ achieves promising performance on crystal structure prediction, ab initio crystal generation and controllable generation with customized space groups.</description>

Abstract: Decades ago, Gurzhi proposed that if momentum-conserving collisions prevail among heat-carrying phonons in insulators and charge-carrying electrons in metals, hydrodynamic features will become detectable. In this paper, we will review the experimental evidence emerging in the last few years supporting this viewpoint and raising new questions. The focus of the paper will be bulk crystals without (or with a very dilute concentration) of mobile electrons and steady-state thermal transport. We will also discuss the possible link between this field of investigation and other phenomena, such as the hybridization of phonon modes and the phonon thermal Hall effect.</description>

      <title>Vortex formation and exotic superconducting states in field-cooled Sn-Pb solders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01719v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Formation of vortices is a typical phenomenon of type-II superconductors under magnetic fields (H). In contrast, type-I superconductors do not host vortices because of their Meissner state. As rare cases, vortices have been observed in intermediate states of type-I superconductors; in addition, the recent observation of type-II superconductivity with vortices in a (originally type-I) Pb crystal film at extremely low temperature (T) under H has opened new pathway to study vortex physics. However, thermodynamic characteristics of such type-II-like superconducting states with vortices in originally type-I element superconductors have not been detected because of the lack of bulk example. In this study, we investigated superconducting states of phase-separated Sn-Pb solders using specific heat and magnetization to reveal magnetic-flux-trapping mechanisms. Here, we show that Sn islands in the Sn-Pb solders exhibit type-II-like superconducting states with vortices when the solders host extremely high magnetic fluxes after field cooling. Furthermore, with increasing T, the amount of trapped flux decreases, and the driving force of the magnetic flux changes from type-II superconducting states of Sn to supercurrent of Pb regions surrounding the Sn islands. The field-cooled Sn-Pb solders are rich in physics of bulk vortex formation and anomalously enhanced supercurrent in element (originally type-I) superconductors.</description>
