      <title>Magnetic Reconnection on a Klein Bottle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new boundary condition for simulations of magnetic reconnection based on the topology of a Klein bottle. When applicable, the new condition is computationally cheaper than fully periodic boundary conditions, reconnects more flux than systems with conducting boundaries, and does not require assumptions about regions external to the simulation as is necessary for open boundaries. The new condition reproduces the expected features of reconnection, but cannot be straightforwardly applied in systems with asymmetric upstream plasmas.</description>

      <title>Nonparametric Statistics on Magnetic Properties at the Footpoints of Erupting Magnetic Flux Ropes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is under debate whether the magnetic field in the solar atmosphere carries neutralized electric currents; particularly, whether a magnetic flux rope (MFR), which is considered the core structure of coronal mass ejections, carries neutralized electric currents. Recently Wang et al. (2023, ApJ, 943, 80) studied magnetic flux and electric current measured at the footpoints of 28 eruptive MFRs from 2010 to 2015. Because of the small sample size, no rigorous statistics has been done. Here, we include 9 more events from 2016 to 2023 and perform a series of nonparametric statistical tests at a significance level of 5\%. The tests confirm that there exist no significant differences in magnetic properties between conjugated footpoints of the same MFR, which justifies the method of identifying the MFR footpoints through coronal dimming. The tests demonstrate that there exist no significant differences between MFRs with pre-eruption dimming and those with only post-eruption dimming. However, there is a medium level of association between MFRs carrying substantial net current and those produce pre-eruption dimming, which can be understood by the Lorentz-self force of the current channel. The tests also suggest that in estimating the magnetic twist of MFRs, it is necessary to take into account the spatially inhomogeneous distribution of electric current density and magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Reinterpretation of the Fermi acceleration of cosmic rays in terms of the ballistic surfing acceleration in supernova shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The applicability of first-order Fermi acceleration in explaining the cosmic ray spectrum has been reexamined using recent results on shock acceleration mechanisms from the Multiscale Magnetospheric mission in Earth's bow shock. It is demonstrated that the Fermi mechanism is a crude approximation of the ballistic surfing acceleration (BSA) mechanism. While both mechanisms yield similar expressions for the energy gain of a particle after encountering a shock once, leading to similar power-law distributions of the cosmic ray energy spectrum, the Fermi mechanism is found to be inconsistent with fundamental equations of electrodynamics.
  It is shown that the spectral index of cosmic rays is determined by the average magnetic field compression rather than the density compression, as in the Fermi model. It is shown that the knee observed in the spectrum at an energy of 5x10^{15} eV could correspond to ions with a gyroradius comparable to the size of shocks in supernova remnants. The BSA mechanism can accurately reproduce the observed spectral index s = -2.5 below the knee energy, as well as a steeper spectrum, s = -3, above the knee. The acceleration time up to the knee, as implied by BSA, is on the order of 300 years.
  First-order Fermi acceleration does not represent a physically valid mechanism and should be replaced by ballistic surfing acceleration in applications or models related to quasi-perpendicular shocks in space. It is noted that BSA, which operates outside of shocks, was previously misattributed to shock drift acceleration (SDA), which operates within shocks.</description>

      <title>Flux rope modeling of the 2022 Sep 5 CME observed by Parker Solar Probe and Solar Orbiter from 0.07 to 0.69 au</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10810v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As both Parker Solar Probe (PSP) and Solar Orbiter (SolO) reach heliocentric distances closer to the Sun, they present an exciting opportunity to study the structure of CMEs in the inner heliosphere. We present an analysis of the global flux rope structure of the 2022 September 5 CME event that impacted PSP at a heliocentric distance of only 0.07 au and SolO at 0.69 au. We compare in situ measurements at PSP and SolO to determine global and local expansion measures, finding a good agreement between magnetic field relationships with heliocentric distance, but significant differences with respect to flux rope size. We use PSP/WISPR images as input to the ELEvoHI model, providing a direct link between remote and in situ observations; we find a large discrepancy between the resulting modeled arrival times, suggesting that the underlying model assumptions may not be suitable when using data obtained close to the Sun, where the drag regime is markedly different in comparison to larger heliocentric distances. Finally, we fit the SolO/MAG and PSP/FIELDS data independently with the 3DCORE model and find that many parameters are consistent between spacecraft, however, challenges are apparent when reconstructing a global 3D structure that aligns with arrival times at PSP and Solar Orbiter, likely due to the large radial and longitudinal separations between spacecraft. From our model results, it is clear the solar wind background speed and drag regime strongly affect the modeled expansion and propagation of CMEs and need to be taken into consideration.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Regularization of Parker Sonic Critical Point in Parker's Unsteady Solar Wind Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13838v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents the first ever systematic theoretical formulation addressing the long-standing open issue of regularization of the singularity associated with the Parker sonic critical point in the linear perturbation problem for Parker's unsteady solar wind model. This development recognizes the necessity to go outside the framework of the linear perturbation problem and incorporate the dominant nonlinearities in this dynamical system. This task is accomplished by constructing a whole new theoretical formulation of Parker's unsteady solar wind model based on the potential flow theory in ideal gas dynamics, which provides an appropriate optimal theoretical framework for this purpose. The stability of Parker's steady solar wind solution is shown to extend also to the neighborhood of the Parker sonic critical point by going to the concomitant nonlinear problem.</description>

      <title>Energetic Electrons Accelerated and Trapped in a Magnetic Bottle above a Solar Flare Arcade</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00109v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Where and how flares efficiently accelerate charged particles remains an unresolved question. Recent studies revealed that a "magnetic bottle" structure, which forms near the bottom of a large-scale reconnection current sheet above the flare arcade, is an excellent candidate for confining and accelerating charged particles. However, further understanding its role requires linking the various observational signatures to the underlying coupled plasma and particle processes. Here we present the first study combining multiwavelength observations with data-informed macroscopic magnetohydrodynamics and particle modeling in a realistic eruptive flare geometry. The presence of an above-the-loop-top magnetic bottle structure is strongly supported by the observations, which feature not only a local minimum of magnetic field strength but also abruptly slowing down plasma downflows. It also coincides with a compact hard X-ray source and an extended microwave source that bestrides above the flare arcade. Spatially resolved spectral analysis suggests that nonthermal electrons are highly concentrated in this region. Our model returns synthetic emission signatures that are well matched to the observations. The results suggest that the energetic electrons are strongly trapped in the magnetic bottle region due to turbulence, with only a small fraction managing to escape. The electrons are primarily accelerated by plasma compression and facilitated by a fast-mode termination shock via the Fermi mechanism. Our results provide concrete support for the magnetic bottle as the primary electron acceleration site in eruptive solar flares. They also offer new insights into understanding the previously reported small population of flare-accelerated electrons entering interplanetary space.</description>
