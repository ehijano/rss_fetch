      <title>GPU acceleration of LCAO basis set first-principle calculations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: First-principles calculation software is of significant importance to material research and development, serving as a fundamental resource for analyzing the microscopic structure and properties of materials. Nevertheless, limitations on the scale of computations and the associated cost restrict the applicability of first-principles calculation within the materials field. The rapid development of heterogeneous computing, particularly General-Purpose Graphics Processing Units (GPGPUs), have heralded new prospects for the enhancement and cost-effectiveness of scientific computing. Utilizing GPGPUs, this paper boost the existing algorithms in Atomic-orbital Based Ab-initio Computation at UStc (ABACUS), a first-principles calculation software grounded on the linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO) basis set, with an overarching objective of increasing computation speed. The effectiveness of the computational acceleration has been clearly demonstrated through calculations on twisted bilayer graphene systems, spanning a wide range of scales, with systems as large as 10,444 carbon atoms.</description>

      <title>High-order accurate structure-preserving finite volume schemes on adaptive moving meshes for shallow water equations: Well-balancedness and positivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper develops high-order accurate, well-balanced (WB), and positivity-preserving (PP) finite volume schemes for shallow water equations on adaptive moving structured meshes. The mesh movement poses new challenges in maintaining the WB property, which not only depends on the balance between flux gradients and source terms but is also affected by the mesh movement. To address these complexities, the WB property in curvilinear coordinates is decomposed into flux source balance and mesh movement balance. The flux source balance is achieved by suitable decomposition of the source terms, the numerical fluxes based on hydrostatic reconstruction, and appropriate discretization of the geometric conservation laws (GCLs). Concurrently, the mesh movement balance is maintained by integrating additional schemes to update the bottom topography during mesh adjustments. The proposed schemes are rigorously proven to maintain the WB property by using the discrete GCLs and these two balances. We provide rigorous analyses of the PP property under a sufficient condition enforced by a PP limiter. Due to the involvement of mesh metrics and movement, the analyses are nontrivial, while some standard techniques, such as splitting high-order schemes into convex combinations of formally first-order PP schemes, are not directly applicable. Various numerical examples validate the high-order accuracy, high efficiency, WB, and PP properties of the proposed schemes.</description>

      <title>Robust DG Schemes on Unstructured Triangular Meshes: Oscillation Elimination and Bound Preservation via Optimal Convex Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) schemes on unstructured meshes offer the advantages of compactness and the ability to handle complex computational domains. However, their robustness and reliability in solving hyperbolic conservation laws depend on two critical abilities: suppressing spurious oscillations and preserving intrinsic bounds or constraints. This paper introduces two significant advancements in enhancing the robustness and efficiency of DG methods on unstructured meshes for general hyperbolic conservation laws, while maintaining their accuracy and compactness. First, we investigate the oscillation-eliminating (OE) DG methods on unstructured meshes. These methods not only maintain key features such as conservation, scale invariance, and evolution invariance but also achieve rotation invariance through a novel rotation-invariant OE (RIOE) procedure. Second, we propose, for the first time, the optimal convex decomposition for designing efficient bound-preserving (BP) DG schemes on unstructured meshes. Finding the optimal convex decomposition that maximizes the BP CFL number is an important yet challenging problem.While this challenge was addressed for rectangular meshes, it remains an open problem for triangular meshes. This paper successfully constructs the optimal convex decomposition for the widely used $P^1$ and $P^2$ spaces on triangular cells, significantly improving the efficiency of BP DG methods.The maximum BP CFL numbers are increased by 100%--200% for $P^1$ and 280.38%--350% for $P^2$, compared to classic decomposition. Furthermore, our RIOE procedure and optimal decomposition technique can be integrated into existing DG codes with little and localized modifications. These techniques require only edge-neighboring cell information, thereby retaining the compactness and high parallel efficiency of original DG methods.</description>

      <title>High-Order Oscillation-Eliminating Hermite WENO Method for Hyperbolic Conservation Laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes high-order accurate, oscillation-eliminating Hermite weighted essentially non-oscillatory (OE-HWENO) finite volume schemes for hyperbolic conservation laws. The OE-HWENO schemes apply an OE procedure after each Runge--Kutta stage, dampening the first-order moments of the HWENO solution to suppress spurious oscillations without any problem-dependent parameters. This OE procedure acts as a filter, derived from the solution operator of a novel damping equation, solved exactly without discretization. As a result, the OE-HWENO method remains stable with a normal CFL number, even for strong shocks producing highly stiff damping terms. To ensure the method's non-oscillatory property across varying scales and wave speeds, we design a scale- and evolution-invariant damping equation and propose a dimensionless transformation for HWENO reconstruction. The OE-HWENO method offers several advantages over existing HWENO methods: the OE procedure is efficient and easy to implement, requiring only simple multiplication of first-order moments; it preserves high-order accuracy, local compactness, and spectral properties. The non-intrusive OE procedure can be integrated seamlessly into existing HWENO codes. Finally, we analyze the bound-preserving (BP) property using optimal cell average decomposition, relaxing the BP time step-size constraint and reducing decomposition points, improving efficiency. Extensive benchmarks validate the method's accuracy, efficiency, resolution, and robustness.</description>

      <title>Simulating fluid flows with quantum computing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The applications and impact of high fidelity simulation of fluid flows are far-reaching. They include settling some long-standing and fundamental questions in turbulence. However, the computational resources required for such efforts are extensive. Here, we explore the possibility of employing the recent computing paradigm of quantum computing to simulate fluid flows. The lure of this new paradigm is the potentially exponential advantage in memory and speed, in comparison with classical computing. This field has recently witnessed a considerable uptick in excitement and contributions. In this work, we give a succinct discussion of the progress made so far, with focus on fluid flows, accompanied by an enumeration of challenges that require sustained efforts for progress. Quantum computing of fluid flows has a promising future, but the inherently nonlinear nature of flows requires serious efforts on resolving various bottlenecks, and on synthesising progress on theoretical, numerical and experimental fronts. We present certain critical details that have not yet attracted adequate attention.</description>

      <title>The shape of convection in 2D and 3D global simulations of stellar interiors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Theoretical descriptions of convective overshooting often rely on a one-dimensional parameterization of the flow called the filling factor for convection. Several definitions of the filling factor have been developed, based on: (1) the percentage of the volume, (2) the mass flux, and (3) the convective flux that moves through the boundary. We examine these definitions of the filling factor with the goal of establishing their ability to explain differences between 2D and 3D global simulations of stellar interiors that include fully compressible hydrodynamics and realistic microphysics for stars. We study pairs of identical two- and three-dimensional global simulations of stars produced with MUSIC, a fully compressible, time-implicit hydrodynamics code. We examine (1) a $3 M_\odot$ red giant star near the first dredge-up point, (2) a $1 M_\odot$ pre-main-sequence star with a large convection zone, (3) the current sun, and (4) a $20 M_\odot$ main-sequence star with a large convective core. Our calculations of the filling factor based on the volume percentage and the mass flux indicate asymmetrical convection near the surface for each star with an outer convection zone. However, near the convective boundary, convective flows achieve inward-outward symmetry; for 2D and 3D simulations, these filling factors are indistinguishable. A filling factor based on the convective flux is contaminated by boundary-layer-like flows, making theoretical interpretation difficult. We present two new alternatives to these standard definitions, which compare flows at two different radial points. The first is the penetration parameter of Anders et al. (2022). The second is a new statistic, the plume interaction parameter. We demonstrate that both of these parameters capture systematic differences between 2D and 3D simulations around the convective boundary.</description>

      <title>Space-time adaptive ADER-DG finite element method with LST-DG predictor and a posteriori sub-cell ADER-WENO finite-volume limiting for multidimensional detonation waves simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The space-time adaptive ADER-DG finite element method with LST-DG predictor and a posteriori sub-cell ADER-WENO finite-volume limiting was used for simulation of multidimensional reacting flows with detonation waves. The presented numerical method does not use any ideas of splitting or fractional time steps methods. The modification of the LST-DG predictor has been developed, based on a local partition of the time step in cells in which strong reactivity of the medium is observed. This approach made it possible to obtain solutions to classical problems of flows with detonation waves and strong stiffness, without significantly decreasing the time step. The results obtained show the very high applicability and efficiency of using the ADER-DG-PN method with a posteriori sub-cell limiting for simulating reactive flows with detonation waves. The numerical solution shows the correct formation and propagation of ZND detonation waves. The structure of detonation waves is resolved by this numerical method with subcell resolution even on coarse spatial meshes. The smooth components of the numerical solution are correctly and very accurately reproduced by the numerical method. Non-physical artifacts of the numerical solution, typical for problems with detonation waves, such as the propagation of non-physical shock waves and weak detonation fronts ahead of the main detonation front, did not arise in the results obtained. The results of simulating rather complex problems associated with the propagation of detonation waves in significantly inhomogeneous domains are presented, which show that all the main features of detonation flows are correctly reproduced by this numerical method. It can be concluded that the space-time adaptive ADER-DG-PN method with a posteriori sub-cell ADER-WENO finite-volume limiting is perfectly applicable to simulating complex reacting flows with detonation waves.</description>

      <title>Space-time adaptive ADER-DG finite element method with LST-DG predictor and a posteriori sub-cell WENO finite-volume limiting for simulation of non-stationary compressible multicomponent reactive flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The space-time adaptive ADER finite element DG method with a posteriori correction technique of solutions on subcells by the finite-volume ADER-WENO limiter was used to simulate non-stationary compressible multicomponent reactive flows. The multicomponent composition of the reacting medium and the reactions occurring in it were described by expanding the original system of Euler equations by a system of non-stationary convection-reaction equations. The use of this method to simulate high stiff problems associated with reactions occurring in a multicomponent medium requires the use of the adaptive change in the time step. The solution of the classical problem related to the formation and propagation of a ZND detonation wave is carried out. It was shown that the space-time adaptive ADER finite element DG method with a posteriori correction technique of solutions on subcells by the finite-volume ADER-WENO limiter can be used to simulate flows without using of splitting in directions and fractional step methods.</description>

      <title>Arbitrary high order ADER-DG method with local DG predictor for solutions of initial value problems for systems of first-order ordinary differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An adaptation of the arbitrary high order ADER-DG numerical method with local DG predictor for solving the IVP for a first-order non-linear ODE system is proposed. The proposed numerical method is a completely one-step ODE solver with uniform steps, and is simple in algorithmic and software implementations. It was shown that the proposed version of the ADER-DG numerical method is A-stable and L-stable. The ADER-DG numerical method demonstrates superconvergence with convergence order 2N+1 for the solution at grid nodes, while the local solution obtained using the local DG predictor has convergence order N+1. It was demonstrated that an important applied feature of this implementation of the numerical method is the possibility of using the local solution as a solution with a subgrid resolution, which makes it possible to obtain a detailed solution even on very coarse coordinate grids. The scale of the error of the local solution, when calculating using standard representations of single or double precision floating point numbers, using large values of the degree N, practically does not differ from the error of the solution at the grid nodes. The capabilities of the ADER-DG method for solving stiff ODE systems characterized by extreme stiffness are demonstrated. Estimates of the computational costs of the ADER-DG numerical method are obtained.</description>

Abstract: An essential step in building a quantum computer system is combining two qubits. Previous theoretical analyses of this element have been based primarily on the short schematic matrix approaches. In the present work we extend the investigation to the combination of two qubits by implementing the Dirac picture method as a theoretical framework. We conduct simulations, using parameters of grAl qubits, to demonstrate the feasibility of driving two qubits into an even-balanced quantum state. The research highlights the effectiveness of the Dirac picture method in achieving the desired state, enabling improved control of entangled states and advanced quantum computing research. The simulation results and the theoretical calculations agree within of 0.2%, and the two examples at section IV, show a good agreement to the level of 6% error from the even balanced state</description>

      <title>Accelerating Molecular Dynamics through Informed Resetting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a procedure for enhanced sampling of molecular dynamics simulations through informed stochastic resetting. Many phenomena, such as protein folding and crystal nucleation, occur over time scales that are inaccessible using standard simulation methods. We recently showed that stochastic resetting can accelerate molecular simulations that exhibit broad transition time distributions. However, standard stochastic resetting does not exploit any information about the reaction progress. Here, we demonstrate that an informed resetting protocol leads to greater accelerations than standard stochastic resetting, both for molecular dynamics and Metadynamics simulations. This is achieved by resetting only when a certain condition is met, e.g., when the distance from the target along the reaction coordinate is larger than some threshold. We then employ recently obtained theoretical results to identify the condition that leads to the greatest acceleration and to infer the unbiased mean transition time from accelerated simulations. Our work significantly extends the applicability of stochastic resetting for enhanced sampling of molecular simulations.</description>

      <title>Theory of optical spinpolarization of axial divacancy and nitrogen-vacancy defects in 4H-SiC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The neutral divacancy and the negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy defects in 4H-silicon carbide (SiC) are two of the most prominent candidates for functioning as room-temperature quantum bits (qubits) with telecommunication-wavelength emission. Nonetheless, the pivotal role of electron-phonon coupling in the spinpolarization loop is still unrevealed. In this work, we theoretically investigate the microscopic magneto-optical properties and spin-dependent optical loops utilizing the first-principles calculations. First, we quantitatively demonstrate the electronic level structure, assisted by symmetry analysis. Moreover, the fine interactions, including spin-orbit coupling and spin-spin interaction, are fully characterized to provide versatile qubit functional parameters. Subsequently, we explore the electron-phonon coupling, encompassing dynamics- and pseudo-Jahn--Teller effects in the intersystem crossing transition. In addition, we analyze the photoluminescence PL lifetime based on the major transition rates in the optical spinpolarization loop. We compare two promising qubits with similar electronic properties, but their respective rates differ substantially. Finally, we detail the threshold of ODMR contrast for further optimization of the qubit operation. This work not only reveals the mechanism underlying the optical spinpolarization but also proposes productive avenues for optimizing quantum information processing tasks based on the ODMR protocol.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study on enhancing the thermoelectric (TE) performance of bilayer graphene (BLG) through irradiation with arbitrarily polarized light, focusing on $AA$- and $AB$-stacked configurations with zigzag edges. Utilizing a combination of tight-binding theory and density functional theory (DFT), we systematically analyze the impact of light irradiation on electronic and phononic transport properties. Light irradiation alters the electronic hopping parameters, creating an asymmetric transmission function, which significantly increases the Seebeck coefficient, thereby boosting the overall {\it figure of merit} (FOM). For the phononic contribution, DFT calculations reveal that $AB$-stacked BLG exhibits lower lattice thermal conductivity compared to $AA$-stacked, attributed to enhanced anharmonic scattering and phonon group velocity. The combined analysis shows that FOM exceeds unity in both stacking types, with notable improvements near the irradiation-induced gap. Additionally, we explore the dependence of FOM on the system dimensions and temperature, demonstrating that light-irradiated BLG holds great promise for efficient thermoelectric energy conversion and waste heat recovery. Our results show favorable responses over a wide range of irradiation parameters. These findings provide crucial insights into optimizing BLG for advanced TE applications through light-induced modifications.</description>

      <title>J-UBIK: The JAX-accelerated Universal Bayesian Imaging Kit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many advances in astronomy and astrophysics originate from accurate images of the sky emission across multiple wavelengths. This often requires reconstructing spatially and spectrally correlated signals detected from multiple instruments. To facilitate the high-fidelity imaging of these signals, we introduce the universal Bayesian imaging kit (UBIK). Specifically, we present J-UBIK, a flexible and modular implementation leveraging the JAX-accelerated NIFTy.re software as its backend. J-UBIK streamlines the implementation of the key Bayesian inference components, providing for all the necessary steps of Bayesian imaging pipelines. First, it provides adaptable prior models for different sky realizations. Second, it includes likelihood models tailored to specific instruments. So far, the package includes three instruments: Chandra and eROSITA for X-ray observations, and the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) for the near- and mid-infrared. The aim is to expand this set in the future. Third, these models can be integrated with various inference and optimization schemes, such as maximum a posteriori estimation and variational inference. Explicit demos show how to integrate the individual modules into a full analysis pipeline. Overall, J-UBIK enables efficient generation of high-fidelity images via Bayesian pipelines that can be tailored to specific research objectives.</description>

      <title>Localization-delocalization transition for light particles in turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10630v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Small bubbles in fluids raise to the surface due to Archimede's force. Remarkably, in turbulent flows this process is severely hindered by the presence of vortex filaments, which act as moving potential wells, dynamically trapping light particles and bubbles. Quantifying the statistical weights and roles of vortex filaments in turbulence is, however, still an outstanding experimental and computational challenge due to their small scale, fast chaotic motion, and transient nature. Here we show that, under the influence of a modulated oscillatory forcing, the collective bubble behaviour switches from a dynamically localized (insulator) to a delocalized (conductor) state. Additionally, we find that by varying the forcing frequency and amplitude, a remarkable resonant phenomenon between light particles and small-scale vortex filamenents emerges, likening particle behavior to a forced damped oscillator. We discuss how these externally actuated bubbles can be used as a new type of microscopic probes to investigate the space-time statistical properties of the smallest turbulence scales, allowing to quantitatively measure physical characteristics of vortex filaments. We develop a superposition model that is in excellent agreement with the simulation data of the particle dynamics which reveals the fraction of localized/delocalized particles as well as characteristics of the potential landscape induced by vortices in turbulence. Our approach paves the way to innovative ways to accurately measure turbulent properties and to the possibility to control light particles and bubble motions in turbulence with potential applications to wave breaking, medical imaging, drug/gene delivery, chemical reactions, wastewater treatment, and industrial mixing.</description>

      <title>Thermal fluid closures and pressure anisotropies in numerical simulations of plasma wakefield acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19635v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of plasma-based acceleration processes with collisionless particle dynamics and non negligible thermal effects. We aim at assessing the applicability of fluid-like models, obtained by suitable closure assumptions applied to the relativistic kinetic equations, thus not suffering of statistical noise, even in presence of a finite temperature. The work here presented focuses on the characterization of pressure anisotropies, which crucially depend on the adopted closure scheme, and hence are useful to discern the appropriate thermal fluid model. To this aim, simulation results of spatially resolved fluid models with different thermal closure assumptions are compared with the results of particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations at changing temperature and amplitude of plasma oscillations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07998v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reservoir computing (RC) is known as a powerful machine learning approach for learning complex dynamics from limited data. Here, we use RC to predict highly stochastic dynamics of cell shapes. We find that RC is able to predict the steady state climate from very limited data. Furthermore, the RC learns the timescale of transients from only four observations. We find that these capabilities of the RC to act as a dynamic twin allows us to also infer important statistics of cell shape dynamics of unobserved conditions.</description>

      <title>Machine-Learning-Based Construction of Molecular Potential and Its Application in Exploring the Deep-Lying-Orbital Effect in High-Order Harmonic Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12627v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Creating soft-Coulomb-type (SC) molecular potential within single-active-electron approximation (SAE) is essential since it allows solving time-dependent Schr\"odinger equations with fewer computational resources compared to other multielectron methods. The current available SC potentials can accurately reproduce the energy of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO), which is sufficient for analyzing nonlinear effects in laser-molecule interactions like high-order harmonic generation (HHG). However, recent discoveries of significant effects of deep-lying molecular orbitals call for more precise potentials to analyze them. In this study, we present a fast and accurate method based on machine learning to construct SC potentials that simultaneously reproduce various molecular features, including energies, symmetries, and dipole moments of HOMO, HOMO-1, and HOMO-2. We use this ML model to create SC SAE potentials of the HCN molecule and then comprehensively analyze the fingerprints of lower-lying orbitals in HHG spectra emitted during the H-CN stretching. Our findings reveal that HOMO-1 plays a role in forming the second HHG plateau. Additionally, as the H-C distance increases, the plateau structure and the smoothness of HHG spectra are altered due to the redistribution of orbital electron density. These results are in line with other experimental and theoretical studies. Lastly, the machine learning approach using deconvolution and convolution neural networks in the present study is so general that it can be applied to construct molecular potential for other molecules and molecular dynamic processes.</description>

      <title>Exact scattering cross section for lattice-defect scattering of phonons using the atomistic Green's function method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17004v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The use of structurally complex lattice defects, such as functional groups, embedded nanoparticles, and nanopillars, to generate phonon scattering is a popular approach in phonon engineering for thermoelectric applications. However, the theoretical treatment of this scattering phenomenon remains a formidable challenge, especially with regard to the determination of the scattering cross sections and rates associated with such lattice defects. Using the extended atomistic Green's function (AGF) method, we describe how the numerically exact mode-resolved scattering cross section $\sigma $ can be computed for a phonon scattered by a single lattice defect. We illustrate the generality and utility of the AGF-based treatment with two examples. In the first example, we treat the isotopic scattering of phonons in a harmonic chain of atoms . In the second example, we treat the more complex problem of phonon scattering in a carbon nanotube (CNT) containing an encapsulated C60 molecule which acts as a scatterer of the CNT phonons. The application of this method can enable a more precise characterization of lattice-defect scattering and result in a more controlled use of nanostructuring and lattice defects in phonon engineering for thermoelectric applications.</description>
