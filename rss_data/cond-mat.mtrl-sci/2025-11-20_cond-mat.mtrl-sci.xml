      <title>Automated laboratory x-ray diffractometer and fluorescence spectrometer for high-throughput materials characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing importance of artificial intelligence and machine learning in materials research has created demand for automated, high-throughput characterization techniques capable of generating large data sets rapidly. We describe here a new instrument for simultaneous x-ray diffraction and x-ray fluorescence spectroscopy optimized for high-throughput studies of combinatorial specimens. A bright, focused, high-energy x-ray beam 24 keV) combined with a pixel array area detector allows rapid, spatially-resolved (250 {\mu}m) transmission diffraction measurements through thick (100 {\mu}m) specimens of structural metals with exposure times as short as 1 s. Simultaneously, a silicon drift detector records x-ray fluorescence from the specimen for spatially-resolved measurement of composition. Specimen handling is fully automated, with a robot inside the x-ray enclosure manipulating the sample for measurements at different locations. Data orchestration is also automated, with data streamed off the instrument and processed autonomously. In this paper we assess the performance of the instrument in terms of throughput, resolution, and signal-to-noise ratio, and provide an example of its capabilities through a combinatorial study of Cu-Ti alloys to demonstrate rapid data set creation.</description>

      <title>Hydrothermal Synthesis of Ultra-high Aspect Ratio $\beta$-NaYF Disks via Methyliminodiacetic Acid (MIDA)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hexagonal $\beta$-phase of sodium yttrium fluoride (NaYF) is a leading host material for lanthanide upconversion and anti-Stokes fluorescence laser refrigeration based on its low phonon energies and high upconversion efficiency. Recently experiments have been proposed to use this material as an optically-levitated sensor of high-frequency gravitational waves. In order to maximize signal-to-noise in this experiment, the NaYF sensor must have both a two-dimensional, disk-like morphology and also a large mass. Here we report a novel hydrothermal process based on the chelation ligand methylimidodiacetic acid (MIDA) to realize hexagonal $\beta$-NaYF prisms with corner-to-corner diameters up to 44 $\mathrm{\mu m}$ while keeping the height around 1 $\mathrm{\mu m}$. The surface quality is comparable to particles synthesized with EDTA based on atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements. Unlike particles synthesized with EDTA the $\beta$-NaYF particles show no lensing based on curvature of the hexagonal basal plane. Single crystal X-ray diffraction data were refined to the P-62c (#190) space group which to the best of our knowledge has not been reported in the literature. One of six 44 $\mathrm{\mu m}$ $\beta$-NaYF disks doped with 10% ytterbium showed laser refrigeration of ($-4.9 \pm 1.0$) K suggesting future applications in both levitated optomechanics and microoptics.</description>

      <title>Photoemission tomography of excitons in 2D systems: momentum-space signatures of correlated electron-hole wave functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The momentum-space signatures of excitons can be experimentally accessed through time-resolved (pump-probe) photoelectron spectroscopy. In this work, we develop a computational framework for exciton photoemission orbital tomography (exPOT) in periodic systems, enabling the simulation and interpretation of experimental observables within many-body perturbation theory. By connecting the $GW$+Bethe-Salpeter Equation (BSE) approach to photoemission tomography, our formalism captures exciton photoemission in periodic systems, explicitly incorporating photoemission matrix element effects induced by the probe pulse. The correlated nature of electrons and holes introduces distinct consequences for excitonic photoemission, including a dependence on pump pulse polarization. Using the prototypical two-dimensional material hexagonal boron nitride, we demonstrate these effects and show how our framework extends to excitons with finite center-of-mass momentum, making it well-suited to studying momentum-dark excitons. This provides valuable insights into the microscopic nature of excitonic phenomena in quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Third-Body Stabilization of Supercritical CO2 in CO Oxidation: Development and Application of a New ReaxFF Force Field for the CO/O/CO2 System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supercritical CO2 (scCO2) plays a crucial role as a solvent in separation processes, advanced power cycles, and green chemical and materials processing. Nonetheless, the atomistic comprehension of how the dense scCO2 matrix influences the fundamental combustion of carbon monoxide (CO) is still insufficiently explored. Experimental studies and traditional molecular dynamics (MD) simulations frequently fail to detect the highly reactive, transient intermediates, such as atomic oxygen (O), that drive these reactions. To fill this knowledge gap, we have developed a novel ReaxFF reactive force field for the CO2/CO/O system. To effectively model CO2 crystal properties, intermolecular interactions, bond energies, and critical reaction energy barriers, the force field parameters were calibrated using data obtained from the density functional theory and second-order Moller-Plesset calculations. The force field was able to reproduce the cohesive energy of the CO2 crystal, the pressure characteristics of bulk scCO2, and the structural properties of liquid and scCO2, as documented by experiments, ab-initio MD, and prominent non-reactive models. The force field was subsequently applied to study the CO + O = CO2 reaction. In a dilute gas-phase environment, the reaction exhibits inefficiency as the newly formed CO2 rapidly dissociates back due to substantial kinetic energy acquired from the exothermic reaction. Conversely, in a dense scCO2 environment, the surrounding CO2 matrix acts as an efficient third body, stabilizing the emerging CO2 product by dissipating its excess energy via molecular collisions. As such, this ReaxFF force field facilitates a unique, large-scale reactive MD description of radical chemistry in scCO2 and establishes a mechanistic foundation for third-body stabilization in dense reactive environments.</description>

      <title>Electric-Field-Dependent Thermal Conductivity in Fresh and Aged Bulk Single Crystalline $\mathrm{BaTiO_3}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active thermal management requires advances in thermal switching materials, whose thermal conductivity responds to external stimuli. The electric field, as one of the most convenient and effective stimuli, has shown great potential in tuning the thermal conductivity of ferroelectric materials. While previous studies on electric-field-induced ferroelectric thermal switching have primarily focused on thin films and bulk solid solutions with strong extrinsic interface and defect scatterings, bulk single crystals, which can offer clear insights into intrinsic thermal switching mechanisms, have received comparatively less attention. Here, we demonstrate electric-field-induced thermal switching in bulk single-crystalline $\mathrm{BaTiO_3}$ (BTO) at room temperature and elucidate the critical role of domain evolution and aging in governing heat transport. Using a customized steady-state platform with in-situ electric fields up to $\pm$10 kV/cm, we observe a modulation of thermal conductivity up to 35% in fresh BTO driven by polarization reorientation and domain restructuring. First-principles finite-temperature lattice-dynamics calculations confirm that the switching behavior primarily originates from anisotropic phonon transport associated with domain configuration rather than strain-induced changes in phonon velocities. We further reveal that both ambient aging and controlled thermal aging can enhance the switching contrast through the formation and alignment of defect dipoles that modulate phonon-defect scattering. These results establish defect-domain interactions as a powerful design parameter for ferroelectric thermal switches and demonstrate a versatile experimental platform for exploring field-tunable heat transport and phase behavior in bulk functional materials.</description>

      <title>Pressure-Induced Reversal of Thermal Anisotropy in Bi2O2Se</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bi2O2Se is an emerging semiconductor with intrinsically low thermal conductivity, making it a promising material for thermoelectric applications. Hydrostatic pressure can effectively tunes the thermal conductivity, with various pressure-dependent trends reported. However, its impact on thermal anisotropy, particularly in the highly anisotropic Bi2O2Se, remains poorly understood. Here, we report a pressure-driven reversal of thermal anisotropy: k_z &lt; k_x at 0 GPa transforms into k_z &gt; k_x at 60 GPa without phase transition. This stems from distinct phonon dispersions along the x- and z-directions under pressure, leading to a reshaped group velocity landscape. Below 10 meV, vz &gt; vx at both pressures, with a much greater advantage at 60 GPa. Above 10 meV, vx &gt; vz at 0 GPa; however, the difference nearly vanishes at 60 GPa. These changes result from anisotropic lattice compression, with the z-axis shrinking more significantly than the x-axis and suppressing the lone pair activity of Bi atoms. This study calls for revisiting the pressure dependence of thermal conductivity anisotropy and provides insights for pressure-driven thermal switching applications.</description>

      <title>A Novel Strategy to Strengthen Directionally Solidified Superalloy Through Grain Boundary Simplified Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional strategies for enhancing creep resistance often rely on grain boundary strengthening, yet this approach can inadvertently promote premature grain boundary fracture. This study presents a subtractive alloy design strategy for nickel-based directionally solidified superalloys (DS superalloy) through elimination of conventional grain boundary strengthening elements (C, B, Zr) and the strategy improves the creep performance by 60% rivaling 2nd generation single crystal superalloys. Through characterization of heat-treated and heat-exposed microstructures, we confirm the suppression of deleterious grain boundary phases. Creep tests and fracture analysis reveal a critical transition in failure mechanism: the removal of these elements shifts the fracture mode from transgranular to intergranular. Our discussion comprehensively links this microstructural engineering to the underlying creep deformation mechanisms, showing that the enhanced performance stems from stabilization of {\gamma} channel and phase interfaces within grains, as well as strengthening of grain boundaries through serration. This work establishes a novel materials design principle that decouples grain boundary strengthening from elemental additions, offering transformative potential for next-generation high-efficiency turbine blade applications.</description>

      <title>Integrating Atomic Scale Catalyst Design with Transport Engineering for Stable and Efficient CO2 Electrolysis to CO in a Membrane Electrode Assembly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrochemical CO2 reduction (CO2R) offers a promising approach to decarbonize chemical manufacturing through production of carbon-neutral fuels. However, insufficient performance and instability of membrane electrode assembly (MEA) reactors limit commercial viability, with both metrics directly impacted by the CO2R catalysts. Here we develop an atomically dispersed nickel-nitrogen-carbon (Ni-NC) catalyst through a scalable synthesis approach using two different carbon supports. When using carbon nanotubes as the support, the resulting Ni-NCNT electrode achieves a partial current density toward CO of 558 mA cm-2 with 92 percent Faradaic efficiency toward CO at a cell voltage of 3.2 V and an energy efficiency of 39 percent toward CO at a total current density of 607 mA cm-2. The MEA demonstrates stable operation at 100 mA cm-2 over 210 hours, outperforming previously reported Ni-NC catalysts. Focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM) tomography illustrates the key role of catalyst support on the performance of the electrode. COMSOL Multiphysics simulations using 3D reconstructed images of the catalyst layers from FIB-SEM tomography demonstrate that the higher CO2R performance of the Ni-NCNT electrode is due to improved CO2 diffusion and a more uniform current-density distribution compared to the Ni-NCB electrode prepared with carbon black as the support. The stability and performance of the Ni-NCNT compare favorably to state-of-the-art Ag-based catalysts, while bottom-up cost analysis estimates the purchase cost of the Ni-NCNT catalyst to be about 589 USD per kg, substantially lower than the 1900 USD per kg estimated for Ag-based catalysts.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic in-plane lattice thermal conductivity in bilayer ReS2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The significantly weak interlayer coupling strength and puckered structure provide the novel layer-tolerant and anisotropic features in two-dimensional (2D) ReS2. These unique features offer an opportunity to modulate the optoelectronic, vibrational, and transport properties along different lattice directions in ReS2. Here, using first-principles density functional theory (DFT), we investigated the thermal transport properties of ReS2 in AA and AB stacking orders. The anisotopic ratios for lattice thermal conductivities (\k{appa}) are found to be 1.08 and 1.12 for AA and AB stacking, respectively. This anisotropic nature remains intact even at higher temperatures up to 1000K, demonstrating anisotropic robustness. Lower symmetry in AB stacking leads to higher phonon scattering, which results in lower group velocity, smaller phonon lifetime, and thereby lower \k{appa} along both directions as compared to AA stacking. The strong breathing and shear Raman modes in AB stacking indicate stronger layer coupling, further confirming the dominant contribution of acoustic modes towards thermal transport. The findings underscore that the stacking-order-driven preferential heat flow in ReS2 and opens up a new dimension for optimizing device performance.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning Assisted Prediction of Electrochemical Lithiation State in Spinel Lithium Titanium Oxide Thin Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) based framework have evolved rapidly and generated considerable interests for predicting the properties of materials. In this work, we utilize ML-DL framework to predict the electrochemical lithiation state and associated electrical conductivity of spinel Li4Ti5O12 (LTO) thin films using Raman spectroscopy data. Raman spectroscopy, with its rapid, non-destructive, and high-resolution capabilities, is leveraged to monitor dynamic electrochemical changes in LTO films. A comprehensive dataset of 3,272 Raman spectra, representing lithiation states from 0% to 100%, was collected and preprocessed using advanced techniques including cosmic ray removal, smoothing, baseline correction, normalization, and data augmentation. Classical machine learning models such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), and Random Forest (RF) were evaluated alongside a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). While traditional models achieved moderate to high accuracy, they struggled with generalization and noise sensitivity. In contrast, the CNN demonstrated superior performance, achieving over 99.5% accuracy and robust predictions on unseen samples. The CNN model effectively captured non-linear spectral features and showed resilience to experimental variability. This pipeline not only enables accurate lithiation state classification but also facilitates conductivity estimation, offering a scalable approach for real-time battery material characterization and potential extension to other spectroscopic datasets.</description>

      <title>Effects of Interactions and Defect Motion on Ramp Reversal Memory in Locally Phase Separated Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ramp-reversal memory (RRM) effect in metal-insulator transition metal oxides (TMOs), a non-volatile resistance change induced by repeated temperature cycling, has attracted considerable interest in neuromorphic computing and non-volatile memory devices. Our previously introduced defect motion model successfully explained RRM in vanadium dioxide (VO$_2$), capturing observed critical temperature shifts and memory accumulation throughout the sample. However, this approach lacked interactions between metallic and insulating domains, whereas the RRM only appears when TMOs are brought into the metal-insulator coexistence regime. Here, we extend our model by combining the Random Field Ising Model with defect diffusion-segregation, thereby enabling accurate hysteresis modeling while predicting the relationship between RRM and domain interactions. Our simulations demonstrate that maximum RRM occurs when the turnaround temperature approaches the warming branch inflection point, consistent with experimental observations on VO$_2$. Most significantly, we find that increasing nearest-neighbor interactions enhances the maximum memory effect, thus providing a clear mechanism for optimizing RRM performance. Since our model employs minimal assumptions, we predict that RRM should be a widespread phenomenon in materials exhibiting patterned phase coexistence of electronic domains. This work not only advances fundamental understanding of memory behavior in TMOs but also establishes a much-needed theoretical framework for optimizing device applications.</description>

      <title>Wannier based analysis of the direct-indirect bandgap transition by stacking MoS$_2$ layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molybdenum disulfide (MoS$_2$), a layered van der Waals material, has attracted considerable attention as a promising alternative to graphene for applications in field-effect transistors and nanophotonic devices because of its sizable band gap, high carrier mobility, large on/off ratio, and strong photoluminescence efficiency. A particularly intriguing property of MoS$_2$ is the transition of its band gap character with layer thickness: while the monolayer exhibits a direct gap, the band gap becomes indirect in multilayer and bulk forms. To clarify the microscopic mechanism behind this transition, we performed first-principles calculations combined with Wannier-based modeling, focusing on the roles of atomic orbitals and interlayer interactions. While orbitals oriented perpendicular to the plane -- such as Mo-$d_{z^2}$ and S-$p_z$ -- have been considered the primary contributors, our analysis reveals that in-plane $p_x$ and $p_y$ orbitals of S atoms also play a significant role. These findings highlight the importance of both out-of-plane and in-plane orbital contributions in governing the electronic structure of layered MoS$_2$, providing deeper insight into its band gap engineering for future device applications.</description>

      <title>Why Physics Still Matters: Improving Machine Learning Prediction of Material Properties with Phonon-Informed Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) methods have become powerful tools for predicting material properties with near first-principles accuracy and vastly reduced computational cost. However, the performance of ML models critically depends on the quality, size, and diversity of the training dataset. In materials science, this dependence is particularly important for learning from low-symmetry atomistic configurations that capture thermal excitations, structural defects, and chemical disorder, features that are ubiquitous in real materials but underrepresented in most datasets. The absence of systematic strategies for generating representative training data may therefore limit the predictive power of ML models in technologically critical fields such as energy conversion and photonics. In this work, we assess the effectiveness of graph neural network (GNN) models trained on two fundamentally different types of datasets: one composed of randomly generated atomic configurations and another constructed using physically informed sampling based on lattice vibrations. As a case study, we address the challenging task of predicting electronic and mechanical properties of a prototypical family of optoelectronic materials under realistic finite-temperature conditions. We find that the phonons-informed model consistently outperforms the randomly trained counterpart, despite relying on fewer data points. Explainability analyses further reveal that high-performing models assign greater weight to chemically meaningful bonds that control property variations, underscoring the importance of physically guided data generation. Overall, this work demonstrates that larger datasets do not necessarily yield better GNN predictive models and introduces a simple and general strategy for efficiently constructing high-quality training data in materials informatics.</description>

      <title>Dynamic precipitation during high-pressure torsion of a magnesium-manganese alloy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An ultrafine grained magnesium alloy has been produced through room temperature high-pressure torsion (HPT) of solutionised Mg-1.35 wt.%Mn. Dynamic precipitation of nanometer-scale Mn particles occurred during deformation. These particles populated the grain boundaries, acting as pinning sites which allowed the alloy to develop a grain size of 140 nm after 0.5 rotations. Further HPT deformation resulted in a gradual increase in grain size with no increase in precipitate size. Despite the extensive deformation applied, the alloy did not develop a bimodal grain structure and retained a grain size of 230 nm after 10 complete rotations, demonstrating the stability and effectiveness of these pinning particles.</description>

      <title>Ab initio calculations of the thermoelectric figure of merit, within the relaxation time approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a computational framework, based on the VASP and phono3py computer codes, to obtain the thermoelectric figure of merit from the electron-phonon and phonon-phonon interactions using finite displacements in supercells. Several numerical techniques are developed for efficiency.
  The method is applied to several thermoelectric materials. We found different behaviors for the lifetimes of the electrons in PbTe, PbSe, and in compounds of the half-Heusler and magnesium silicide family. This is traced back to the different frequencies of the phonons involved in the scattering around the Fermi level. They have a lower frequency in PbTe and PbSe.
  The magnitude of the thermoelectric figures of merit we computed compare well with experiments, but the agreement is far from perfect. The role of the defects, not explicitly considered in our calculations, but abundant in thermoelectric materials, is discussed as a possible explanation. It is also shown that the choice of the exchange-correlation functional can strongly impact the results.</description>

      <title>Photoluminescence Mapping of Mobile and Fixed Defects in Halide Perovskite Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metal halide perovskites exhibit coupled electronic and ionic properties that determine their photovoltaic performance and operational stability. Understanding and quantifying ionic transport are therefore essential for advancing perovskite optoelectronics. Conventional electrical methods such as impedance spectroscopy require fully integrated devices, and their interpretation is often complicated by interfacial and contact effects, limiting the ability to isolate intrinsic ionic behavior. Here, a localized adaptation of intensity-modulated photoluminescence spectroscopy (IMPLS) is utilized to optically probe lateral ionic transport in perovskite films. The frequency-dependent photoluminescence response is measured under controlled carrier injection levels and correlated with the photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY). The proposed diffusion model indicates that mobile ionic defects laterally migrate from high light intensity regions, giving rise to characteristic photoluminescence modulations. Ionic diffusion coefficients extracted from IMPLS agree well with literature values obtained from electrical measurements. Importantly, IMPLS mapping separates mobile and immobile defect contributions through a defect contrast coefficient (DCC), which quantifies the normalized difference between the area-averaged photoluminescence intensity and phase data. This work ultimately demonstrates that localized IMPLS provides a contact-free means to extract lateral ion diffusion coefficients while spatially distinguishing defect types across the sample.</description>

      <title>Mechanistic study of mixed lithium halides solid state electrolytes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.15402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lithium halides with the general formula Li$_x$M$_y$X$_6$, where M indicates transition metal ions and X halide anions are very actively studied as solid-state electrolytes, because of relatively low cost, high stability and Li conductivity. The structure and properties of these halide-based solid electrolytes (HSE) can be tuned by alloying, e.g. using different halides and/or transition metals simultaneously. The large chemical space is difficult to sample by experiments, making simulations based on broadly applicable machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) a promising approach to elucidate structure-property relations, and facilitate the design of better-performing compositions. Here we focus on the Li$_3$YCl$_{6x}$Br$_{6(1-x)}$ system, for which reliable experimental data exists, and use the recently-developed PET-MAD universal MLIP to investigate the structure of the alloy, the interplay of crystalline lattice, volume and chemical composition, and its effect on Li conductivity. We find that the distribution of Cl and Br atoms is only weakly correlated, and that the primary effect of alloying is to modulate the lattice parameter -- although it can also trigger transition between different lattice symmetries. By comparing constant-volume and constant-pressure simulations, we disentangle the effect of lattice parameter and chemical composition on the conductivity, finding that the two effects compensate each other, reducing the overall dependency of conductivity on alloy composition. We also study the effect of Y-In metal substitution finding a small increase in the conductivity for the C2/m phase at 25\% In content, and an overall higher conductivity for the P$\bar{3}$m1 phase.</description>

      <title>Mode selectivity in electron promoted vibrational relaxation of chemisorbed hydrogen on molybdenum and tungsten surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electron-phonon coupling in atoms and molecules adsorbed at metal surfaces gives rise to finite vibrational linewidths in infrared or electron energy loss spectra. When it is the dominant contribution to the vibrational lifetime, it manifests itself in the form of a Fano line shape. Here, we report the linewidths of vibrational modes of chemisorbed hydrogen on the (100) and (110) surfaces of molybdenum and tungsten calculated from first-order time-dependent perturbation theory. For those modes with a Fano line shape, our results are in good agreement with the experiment. We further observe that the coupling strength between vibrations and electrons depends on the nature of the mode: for Lorentzian-shaped peaks, the experimental linewidths are always larger than those predicted based on pure electron-phonon coupling. The calculated linewidths exhibit a strong coverage dependence, decreasing towards higher coverages. This finding has important implications for nonadiabatic energy dissipation in hydrogen dynamics at metal surfaces. While electron-hole pair excitation is the dominant energy-transfer mechanism between hydrogen and pristine metal surfaces, other channels for energy dissipation, such as adsorbate-adsorbate interactions, may become more significant on metal surfaces densely covered with hydrogen.</description>

      <title>Rheology of dense vibrated granular flows: non-monotonic response controlled by granular temperature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.14859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the rheology of dense granular materials subjected to vertical vibration using numerical simulations of a stress-imposed vane rheometer. The effective viscosity increases with confining pressure, decreases with vibration amplitude, and exhibits a non-monotonic dependence on frequency: weakening is observed at intermediate frequencies but is lost at high frequencies. We show that the rheological response is governed by the balance between grain-scale agitation energy and the stabilizing effect of confinement. This framework reconciles previously observed trends in viscosity and friction weakening and emphasizes the central role of energy injection and dissipation in determining granular flow properties under vibration.</description>

      <title>5d-mediated indirect exchange and effective spin Hamiltonians in Ce triangular-lattice delafossites</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.14904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Anisotropic intersite exchange interactions in frustrated rare-earth magnets are difficult to assess both theoretically and experimentally. Here, we propose an ab initio force-theorem framework combining the quasi-atomic Hubbard-I approach to 4f correlations with a static mean-field treatment of the on-site intershell Coulomb interaction between rare-earth 4f and 5d states to simultaneously capture both 4f superexchange and 5d-mediated indirect exchange. Applying it to the triangular lattice Ce delafossites CsCeSe$_2$, KCeS$_2$, and RbCeO$_2$, we find that the indirect exchange dominates in the selenide, the superexchange in the oxide, while both mechanisms contribute almost equally in the sulfide. The magnetic exciation spectra of CsCeSe$_2$ and KCeS$_2$ evaluated from the calculated spin Hamiltonains are in good qualitative and quantitative agreement with experimental data.</description>

      <title>Origin of metal-insulator transition in rare-earth Nickelates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rare-earth nickelates RNiO3 (R=rare-earth element) exhibit three kinds of phase transitions with decreasing temperature: a structural transition from a pseudo-cubic to a monoclinic phase, a metal- insulator transition (MIT), and a magnetic transition from a paramagnetic state to an ordered one. The first two occur at the same temperature, which has led to a consensus that the MIT is driven by lattice distortions. We show here that the primary driving force for the MIT is magnetic; however because of the unusual d7 configuration of Ni, additional flexibility in spin configurations are also needed which symmetry-lowing structural deformations make possible. The latter enable Ni to disproportionate into two kinds: a high-spin and a low-spin configuration, which allow the system to reduce its unfavorable orbital moment and also open a gap.</description>

      <title>Spin-quenching in molecule-transition-metal-dichalcogenide heterostructure through inverse proximity effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A functional heterostructure is central to integrated circuitry in quantum photonics, optoelectronics, neuromorphic computing, spintronics, and straintronics. Recently, heterostructures combining 2D magnets and nonmagnetic transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have been explored. In these, electron and hole wavefunctions are localized in 2D magnets but delocalized in TMDs. When combined, a proximity induced magnetic inter layer exciton can emerge, with energy differing by 20 to 30 meV from intra layer excitons and being two orders of magnitude darker, making it hard to detect and functionalize. Using a high fidelity ab initio many body diagrammatic approach, we show that functionality can be significantly enhanced in a transition metal molecule TMD interface. The molecular exciton exhibits charge transfer character and is extended, unlike the localized Frenkel excitation in 2D magnets. Moreover, the degree of localization and magnetic moment can be tuned by varying the molecular orientation relative to the TMD. This changes the proximity to the magnetic ion, altering screening and enabling a pathway to quench the ion's spin moment. This inverse proximity effect tunes the energies, spin states, and brightness of molecular and inter layer magnetic excitons, a mechanism absent in 2D magnet TMD systems. We also identify conditions under which the interlayer exciton becomes well separated and brighter than intra layer excitons, making it promising for protocols that probe and manipulate magnetic excitonic states.</description>

      <title>Long-Range Magnetic Order in Structurally Embedded Mesospin Metamaterials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.15483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Engineered assemblies of interacting magnetic elements-magnetic metamaterials-provide a powerful route to tailor collective magnetic order and dynamics. By structuring matter at the mesoscale, they bridge atomic magnetism and macroscopic functionality, enabling emergent behaviour inaccessible in conventional materials. However, realizing large-area metamaterials that combine high morphological uniformity with intrinsic long-range order has remained challenging, largely due to the structural disorder inherent to lithographic fabrication. Here we demonstrate a scalable route to structurally and magnetically coherent metamaterials by embedding iron-ions to form mesospins within a non-magnetic thin film palladium host matrix. Using controlled implantation, we realize morphologically uniform arrays that spontaneously develop extended antiferromagnetic order in the as-fabricated state - without the need of external annealing or field cycling. Resonant X-ray scattering and microscopy reveal sharp magnetic Bragg peaks modulated by the mesospin form factor, evidencing long-range antiferromagnetic order coupled to structural coherence. This embedded architecture establishes a platform for exploring coherent spin-photon interactions and functional X-ray scattering in magnetic metamaterials free from lithographic topography and disorder.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.15526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In conventional superconductors, bulk physical properties typically degrade as the film thickness approaches the two-dimensional (2D) limit. Here in the (111) oriented LaAlO3/KTaO3 (LAO/KTO) heterostructure, we demonstrate experimental evidence that reducing the conducting layer thickness at the interface significantly enhances superconducting transition temperature Tc, in direct contrast to conventional wisdom. From the sum frequency generation (SFG) spectroscopy and superconducting upper-critical field measurements, both the trigonal symmetry and spin orbit scattering are enhanced with the increased Tc. We attribute the enhanced superconductivity (SC) to the synergic interplay between spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and trigonal crystal field, resulting in an enhanced electron-phonon coupling. Furthermore, we show the existence of unconventional SC: the approaching linear temperature dependence of normal state resistance with increasing Tc and the existence of a quantum critical point (QCP) near the superconducting phase. Our findings provide important insight into the underlying mechanism of the strong orientation-dependent KTO interface SC.</description>

Abstract: Quaternary mixed-metal M(II)2M(III)Ch2X3 chalcohalides are an emerging material class for photovoltaic absorbers that combines the beneficial optoelectronic properties of lead-based halide perovskites with the stability of metal chalcogenides. Inspired by the recent discovery of lead-free mixed-metal chalcohalides materials, we utilized a combination of density functional theory and machine learning to determine compositional trends and chemical design rules in the lead-free and lead-based materials spaces. We explored a total of 54 M(II)2M(III)Ch2X3 materials with M(II) = Sn, Pb, M(III) = In, Sb, Bi, Ch = S, Se, Te, and X = Cl, Br, I per phase (Cmcm, Cmc21 , and P21/c). The P21/c phase is the equilibrium phase at low temperatures, followed by Cmc21 and Cmcm. The fundamental band gaps in Cmcm and Cmc21 are smaller than those in P21/c, but direct band gaps are more common in Cmcm and Cmc21. The effective electron masses in P21/c are significantly larger compared to Cmcm and Cmc21, while the effective hole masses are nearly the same across all three phases. Using random forest regression, we found that the two electron acceptor sites (Ch and X) are crucial in shaping the properties of mixed-metal chalcohalide compounds. Furthermore, the electron donor sites (M(II) and M(III)) can be used to finetune the material properties to desired applications. These design rules enable precise tailoring of mixed-metal chalcohalide compounds for a variety of applications.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate wide-field optical microscopy of the pressure distribution at approximately 20 GPa in a diamond anvil cell (DAC), using nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in nanodiamonds (NDs) as quantum sensors. Pressure and non-hydrostaticity maps are obtained by fitting optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) spectra with models incorporating hydrostatic and uniaxial stress conditions. Two methods for introducing NDs with a pressure-transmitting medium are compared, revealing that the embedding approach affects the degree of non-hydrostaticity. This ND-based technique offers a powerful imaging platform for probing pressure-induced phenomena and is extendable to other physical quantities such as magnetic fields.</description>

  to elevate the VBM by introducing cation states that hybridize with O-2$p$ orbitals
  or lie energetically above the O-2$p$ level.
  Nevertheless, the $p$-type oxides reported to date exhibit limited hole mobilities.
  To expand the search space, it is essential to accurately understand the intrinsic difficulty
  of introducing holes into O-2$p$-dominated bands.
  Accordingly, we evaluated 845 oxides to identify those
  in which holes can be doped into O-2$p$-dominated bands.
  Our high-throughput screening revealed CaCdO$_2$ as the only promising exemplar,
  in which the VBM is slightly hybridized with deep-lying Cd-3$d$ states.
  Our screening suggests that hole doping into O-2$p$-dominated bands is extremely difficult
  and thus reinforces the effectiveness of the traditional ``VBM-raising strategy.''</description>

      <title>Flexoelectric Polarization Enhancement in Paraelectric $\mathrm{BaHfO_3}$ via Strain Gradient Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19690v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Flexoelectricity - polarization induced by strain gradients - offers a route to polar functionality in centrosymmetric dielectrics, where traditional piezoelectric effects are absent. This study investigates the flexoelectric effect in epitaxial $\mathrm{BaHfO_3}$ (BHO) thin films, a centrosymmetric and paraelectric perovskite. While a large lattice mismatch induces defect-driven relaxation, a coherently grown BHO film undergoes elastic relaxation, forming intrinsic strain gradients exceeding $10^5\ \mathrm{m}^{-1}$. A 29-fold enhancement in spontaneous polarization is observed at an electric field of $4\ \mathrm{MV\,cm}^{-1}$ for BHO exhibiting a strain gradient compared to relaxed BHO. This enhancement is attributed to flexoelectric coupling, which is isolated from ferroelectric and piezoelectric contributions due to the centrosymmetric nature and the absence of phase transitions in BHO. The findings establish a clear link between engineered strain gradients and enhanced polarizability in oxide thin films, offering a benchmark system for deconvoluting the flexoelectric effect from other polar effects. These results provide a basis for exploiting flexoelectricity in dielectric devices and advance the fundamental understanding of strain-coupled phenomena in functional oxides.</description>

Abstract: We explore machine learning techniques for predicting Curie temperatures of magnetic materials using the NEMAD database. By augmenting the dataset with composition-based and domain-aware descriptors, we evaluate the performance of several machine learning models. We find that the Extra Trees Regressor delivers the best performance reaching an R^2 score of up to 0.85 $\pm$ 0.01 (cross-validated) for a balanced dataset. We employ the k-means clustering algorithm to gain insights into the performance of chemically distinct material groups. Furthermore, we perform the SHAP analysis to identify key physicochemical drivers of Curie behavior, such as average atomic number and magnetic moment. By employing explainable AI techniques, this analysis offers insights into the model's predictive behavior, thereby advancing scientific interpretability.</description>

      <title>Machine-learning interatomic potentials achieving CCSD(T) accuracy for systems with extended covalent networks and van der Waals interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14306v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) enable large-scale atomistic simulations at moderate computational cost while retaining ab initio accuracy. MLIPs trained on coupled-cluster data, particularly CCSD(T), have emerged a promising route to achieve chemical accuracy beyond the limits of density functional theory (DFT) and to incorporate non-empirical van der Waals (vdW) interactions. Most existing approaches are, however, still not straightforwardly applicable for systems with extended covalent networks such as covalent organic frameworks (COFs) due to the limited availability of CCSD(T) for periodic systems. Here we present a methodology to train MLIPs with CCSD(T) accuracy for these systems. The approach uses the {\Delta}-learning method with a dispersion-corrected tight-binding baseline. This strategy enables training on compact molecular fragments while preserving transferability toward the periodic systems. Dispersion interactions are accounted for by adding vdW-bound multimers in the training set, and the combination with a vdW-aware tight-binding baseline allows the formally local MLIP to attain CCSD(T)-level accuracy even for systems dominated by long-range vdW forces. The resulting potential yields root-mean-square energy errors below 0.4 meV/atom on training and test sets and reproduces electronic total atomization energies, bond lengths, harmonic vibrational frequencies, and inter-molecular interaction energies for benchmark molecular systems. We apply the method to a prototypical quasi-two-dimensional COF composed of carbon and hydrogen. The COF structure, inter-layer binding energies, and hydrogen absorption are analyzed at CCSD(T) accuracy. The developed methodology opens a practical route to large-scale atomistic simulations for systems with extended covalent networks and vdW interactions with chemical accuracy.</description>

      <title>A Local-Phase Framework for the BaTi_{1-x}Zr_xO_3$ Phase Diagram: From Ferroelectricity to Dipolar Glass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08662v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We apply a first-principles-based atomistic model to investigate the BaTi(1-x)Zr(x)O3 phase diagram, focusing on both macroscopic and local structural changes. Our approach, which combines molecular dynamics with machine learning techniques, accurately captures the influence of Ti and Zr cations on their local environment and its evolution with composition and temperature. The computed phase diagram shows excellent agreement with existing experimental and theoretical data. Beyond reproducing known results, our analysis reveals that the behavior of the solid solution across different compositions and temperatures can be understood in terms of coexisting Ti cells with different symmetries, whose stability depends on the local B-site configuration. This local-phase-based approach provides a unified description of the distinct regions of the solid solution, including ferroelectric, relaxor, and dipolar glass phases, and captures the continuous evolution from one regime to another. Our findings demonstrate how atomic-level distortions drive the complex macroscopic behavior of the material.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.09486v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A comprehensive experimental and physics informed neural network numerical inverse diffusion analysis is conducted in technologically important NiAlTi ternary and NiCoFeAlTi quinary solid solutions for estimating and extracting composition dependent diffusion coefficients. A systematic variation of tracer, intrinsic and interdiffusion coefficients with composition could be estimated in the ternary solid solution. Following, the possibility of producing Al Ti constant PB diffusion profiles keeping constant Ni, Co, Fe in the quinary system is demonstrated. The estimation of diffusion coefficients of all the elements at the Kirkendall marker plane of a single diffusion couple profile is elaborated. PINN optimisation parameters are established using self and impurity diffusion coefficients in Ni and tracer diffusion coefficients at the Kirkendall marker plane. The reliability of optimized parameters is validated by comparing with the interdiffusion coefficients estimated from binary NiTi, NiAl and PB diffusion profiles, indicating extendibility to even lower order systems.</description>

      <title>Structural effects of boron doping in diamond crystals for gamma-ray light-source applications: Insights from molecular dynamics simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13045v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Boron-doped diamond crystals (BDD, C$_{1-x}$B$_{x}$) exhibit exceptional mechanical strength, electronic tunability, and resistance to radiation damage. This makes them promising materials for use in gamma-ray crystal-based light sources. To better understand and quantify the structural distortions introduced by doping, which are critical for maintaining channelling efficiency, we perform atomistic-level molecular dynamics simulations on periodic C$_{1-x}$B$_{x}$ systems of various sizes. These simulations allow the influence of boron concentration on the lattice constant and the (110) and (100) inter-planar distances to be evaluated over the concentration range from pure diamond (0%) to 5% boron at room temperature (300 K). Linear relationships between both lattice constant and inter-planar distance with increasing dopant concentration are observed, with a deviation from Vegard's Law. This deviation is larger than that reported by other theoretical and computational studies; however, this may be attributed to an enhanced crystal quality over these studies, a vital aspect when considering gamma-ray crystal light source design. The methodology presented here incorporates several refinements to closely reflect the conditions of microwave plasma chemical vapour deposition (MPCVD) crystal growth. Validation of the methodology is provided through a comprehensive statistical analysis of the structure of our generated crystals. These results enable reliable atomistic modelling of doped diamond crystals and support their use in the design and fabrication of periodically bent structures for next-generation gamma-ray light source technologies.</description>

      <title>Extending targeted phonon excitation to modulate bulk systems : a study on thermal conductivity of Boron Arsenide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07934v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conventional thermal conductivity modulation approaches typically rely on nano-structural modifications and can only achieve irreversible alternation. Despite being a pioneering quantum strategy for dynamical and reversible thermal conductivity modulation, targeted phonon excitation has been confined to two-dimensional systems, and its effectiveness in three-dimensional systems remains unknown. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of targeted phonon excitation for modulating the thermal conductivity in three-dimensional system by taking bulk boron arsenide (BAs) as a representative material. By combining first-principles calculations with the Boltzmann transport equation, an enhancement up to 2% and a suppression up to 35% relative to the intrinsic thermal conductivity were achieved through targeted phonon excitation. Notably, the modulation effect also exhibited an obvious dependence on excitation intensity, and an opposite modulation effect was observed for specific phonon frequency range. Computational analysis reveals that the non-monotonic modulation tendency under different excitation intensities stems from the competition between the increase in phonon population and the enhancement of phonon scattering, particularly through the reconfiguration of splitting (emission) processes in three-phonon scattering. This work extends the applicability of targeted phonon excitation to 3D systems, provides insights into phonon engineering mechanisms, and lays the foundation for dynamic thermal management and phonon devices.</description>

      <title>The phase-field model of fracture incorporating Mohr-Coulomb, Mogi-Coulomb, and Hoek-Brown strength surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04627v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Classical phase-field theories of brittle fracture capture toughness-controlled crack growth but do not account for the material's strength surface, which governs fracture nucleation in the absence of cracks. The phase-field formulation of Kumar et al. (2020) proposed a blueprint for incorporating the strength surface while preserving toughness-controlled propagation by introducing a nucleation driving force and presented results for the Drucker-Prager surface. Following this blueprint, Chockalingam (2025) recently derived a general driving-force expression that incorporates arbitrary strength surfaces. The present work implements this driving force within a finite-element framework and incorporates representative strength surfaces that span diverse mathematical and physical characteristics-the Mohr-Coulomb, 3D Hoek-Brown, and Mogi-Coulomb surfaces. Through simulations of canonical fracture problems, the formulation is comprehensively validated across fracture regimes, capturing (i) nucleation under uniform stress, (ii) crack growth from large pre-existing flaws, and (iii) fracture governed jointly by strength and toughness. While the strength surfaces examined here already encompass a broad range of brittle materials, the results demonstrate the generality and robustness of the proposed driving-force construction for materials governed by arbitrary strength surfaces.</description>

      <title>Effect of Misfit and Threading Dislocations on Surface Energies of PbTe-PbSe Interfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.07182v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work quantifies the effect of misfit and threading dislocations on the surface (interfacial) energies of PbTe-PbSe interfaces, with the defect structures of the interfaces being obtained from atomistic and multiscale simulations of their manufacturing processes. Simulation results show that direct bonding produces semi-coherent interfaces with two-dimensional misfit dislocation networks, while heteroepitaxial processes produce complex three-dimensional dislocation structures with both misfit and threading dislocations. Surface energies at these interfaces were determined by computing the interaction energies across these interfaces. Compared with coherent interfaces, directly bonded interfaces exhibit up to ~23% lower surface energy, while the surface energies of epitaxially grown interfaces can be nearly 50% lower. The results demonstrate the significant effects of dislocations, which are unavoidable during the manufacturing processes of lattice mismatched heterostructures, on surface (interfacial) energy.</description>

      <title>Visible and Terahertz Nonlinear Responses in the Topological Noble Metal Dichalcogenide PdTe2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.11493v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonlinear processes can offer pathways to next-generation sensors and frequency mixing devices to overcome modern imaging, detection, and communication challenges. In this article, we report on strong second and third-order nonlinear optical responses in visible and terahertz (THz) light in single crystals of the noble metal dichalcogenide PdTe2. We find that buried conduction and valence topological surface states of PdTe2 lead to resonant enhancement of optical second-harmonic generation. On the other hand, although the nonlinear responses obtained with THz excitation are not close to this resonance, they can be clearly observed in reflection geometry, even in the presence of broadband excitation, where optical filters are not necessary to observe the odd-order higher harmonic gain. By carefully considering the radiative photocurrent framework of stimulated THz emission, we are able to extract fingerprints of both second- and third-order processes in the THz regime, and show that PdTe2 is a promising material candidate for radio frequency rectification, frequency mixing, and beam focusing.</description>

      <title>Hyperelastic stability landscape: A check for HILL stability of isotropic, incompressible hyperelasticity depending on material parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13792v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we describe a uniform and standardized approach for analytically verifying the stability of isotropic, incompressible hyperelastic material models. Here, we address stability as fulfillment of the Hill's condition - i.e. the positive definiteness of the material modulus in the Kirchhoff stress - log-strain relation. For incompressible material behavior, all mathematically and mechanically possible deformations lie within a range bounded, on the one hand, by uniaxial states and, on the other hand, by biaxial states; shear {deformation} states lie in between. This becomes particularly clear when the possible states are represented in the invariant plane. This very representation is now also used to visualize the regions of unstable material behavior depending on the selected strain energy function and the respective data set of material parameters. This demonstrates how, for some constellations of energy functions, with appropriate selection or calibration of parameters, stable and unstable regions can be observed. If such cases occur, it is no longer legitimate to use them to initiate, for example, finite element simulations. This is particularly striking when, for example, a fit appears stable in uniaxial tension, but the same parameter set for shear states results in unstable behavior without this being specifically investigated. The presented approach can reveal simple indicators for this.</description>

      <title>Evidence of Memory Effects in the Dynamics of Two-Level System Defect Ensembles Using Broadband, Cryogenic Transient Dielectric Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18263v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two-level system (TLS) defects in dielectrics cause decoherence in superconducting circuits, yet their origin, frequency distribution, and dipole moments remain poorly understood. Current probes, primarily based on qubits or resonators, require complex fabrication and measure defects only within narrow frequency bands and limited mode volumes, restricting insight into TLS behavior in isolated materials and interfaces. We introduce Broadband Cryogenic Transient Dielectric Spectroscopy (BCTDS), a broadband 3D waveguide technique that enables probing of TLS ensembles at cryogenic temperatures. Complementary to the dielectric dipper method, this approach probes a broader spectrum and reveals interference of drive-induced sidebands in TLS ensembles. The broadband, power-tunable nature of BCTDS makes it well suited for studying dressed-state physics in driven TLS ensembles, including multi-photon processes and sideband-resolved dynamics. By analyzing Fourier-transformed time-domain signals, BCTDS reveals eigen-mode frequencies of undriven TLS ensembles through characteristic V-shaped features and uncovers memory effects arising from interactions and broadband excitation. The modular method can be applied throughout device fabrication, informing mitigation strategies and advancing the design of low-loss materials with broad implications for quantum technologies and materials science.</description>

      <title>Molecular dynamics simulations reveal internal tension in native state collagen fibrils</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.14261v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Collagen fibrils are the building block of many biological tissues, which viability depend on the fibrils properties. Altered properties of collagen fibrils are central to the appearance of many diseases, and physiological or native properties must be reproduced for tissue engineering. Yet, the self-assembly, the structure, and therefore the properties of collagen fibrils remain elusive. One main reason is the extreme sensitivity of the fibrils to their environmental conditions, and in particular hydration which is only loosely bound by experimental measurements. Furthermore, mechanics are an integral part of the self-assembly process and may result in internal stresses in collagen fibrils in native conditions. Here, we propose to investigate internal stresses in collagen fibrils by means of molecular dynamics simulations of the collagen microfibril model. Our simulations reveal the quantitative evolution of internal stresses in collagen fibrils with hydration. We establish a value of native hydration of collagen fibrils at 0.78 g/g based on an absence of cross-sectional stresses. In turn, we determine a quantitative estimate of internal longitudinal stresses in collagen fibrils in native conditions of 210 MPa. We find that internal longitudinal stresses are caused by an over-extended protein backbone rather than partial hydration, which appears remnant of the local forces driving collagen self-assembly. We also demonstrate the consequences of internal longitudinal stresses on the mechanical properties of collagen fibrils, which the absence of induces more than a 20% decrease in the Young's modulus. Overall, our findings provide insights into the native structure and properties of collagen fibrils. More than ever, collagen fibrils appear to be assembled via an out-of-equilibrium process key for the synthesis of viable tissues.</description>
