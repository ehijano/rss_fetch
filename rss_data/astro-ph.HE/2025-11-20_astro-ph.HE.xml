      <title>First Mid-infrared Detection and Modeling of a Flare from Sgr A*. II. Mid-IR Spectral Energy Distribution and Millimeter Polarimetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: S. D. von Fellenberg et al. (2025a, Paper I) reported the first mid-infrared detection of a flare from Sgr A*. The JWST/MIRI/MRS observations were consistent with an orbiting hotspot undergoing electron injection with a spectrum that subsequently breaks from synchrotron cooling. However, mid-infrared extinction measurements appropriate for these data were not yet determined, and therefore the temporal evolution of the absolute spectral index remained unknown. This work applies new Galactic Center extinction measurements to the flare observations. The evolution of the spectral index after the peak is fully consistent with that reported in Paper I with a maximum absolute mid-infrared spectral index $\alpha_{\rm{MIR}}=0.45\pm0.01_{\rm{stat}}\pm0.08_{\rm{sys}}$ during the second mid-infrared flare peak, matching the known near-infrared spectral index during bright states ($\alpha_{\rm{NIR}}\approx0.5$). There was a near-instantaneous change in the mid-infrared spectral index of $\Delta\alpha_{\rm{MIR}}=0.33\pm0.06_{\rm{stat}}\pm0.11_{\rm{sys}}$ at the flare onset. We propose this as a quantitative definition for this infrared flare's beginning, physically interpreted as the underlying electron distribution's transition into a hard power-law distribution. This paper also reports the SMA millimeter polarization during the flare, which shows a small, distorted, but overall clockwise-oriented Stokes Q--U loop during the third mid-infrared peak. Extrapolating the mid-infrared flux power law to the millimeter yields a variable flux consistent with the observed 220 GHz emission. These results, together with the Paper I modeling, plausibly suggest a single hotspot produced both the mid-infrared and millimeter variability during this event. However, additional flares are required to make a general statement about the millimeter and mid-infrared connection.</description>

      <title>Large Language Model Driven Analysis of General Coordinates Network (GCN) Circulars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The General Coordinates Network (GCN) is NASA's time-domain and multi-messenger alert system. GCN distributes two data products - automated ``Notices,'' and human-generated ``Circulars,'' that report the observations of high-energy and multi-messenger astronomical transients. The flexible and non-structured format of GCN Circulars, comprising of more than 40500 Circulars accumulated over three decades, makes it challenging to manually extract observational information, such as redshift or observed wavebands. In this work, we employ large language models (LLMs) to facilitate the automated parsing of transient reports. We develop a neural topic modeling pipeline with open-source tools for the automatic clustering and summarization of astrophysical topics in the Circulars database. Using neural topic modeling and contrastive fine-tuning, we classify Circulars based on their observation wavebands and messengers. Additionally, we separate gravitational wave (GW) event clusters and their electromagnetic (EM) counterparts from the Circulars database. Finally, using the open-source Mistral model, we implement a system to automatically extract gamma-ray burst (GRB) redshift information from the Circulars archive, without the need for any training. Evaluation against the manually curated Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory GRB table shows that our simple system, with the help of prompt-tuning, output parsing, and retrieval augmented generation (RAG), can achieve an accuracy of 97.2 % for redshift-containing Circulars. Our neural search enhanced RAG pipeline accurately retrieved 96.8 % of redshift circulars from the manually curated database. Our study demonstrates the potential of LLMs, to automate and enhance astronomical text mining, and provides a foundation work for future advances in transient alert analysis.</description>

      <title>Radio properties of the quasi-periodic eruption source RXJ1301.9+2747 at parsec scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) are repeating soft X-ray flares associated with galactic nuclei. Several recent works have found evidence that the accretion flow in the galactic nuclei of QPEs is of recent origin, and that it is unlike canonical active galactic nuclei (AGN). A precursor tidal disruption event has been observed in a few cases. In this work we report new radio observations of the QPE host galaxy RXJ\,1301.9+2747 taken at 5.0\,GHz with the High Sensitivity Array (HSA), to complement archival 1.7\,GHz observations reported previously. Our new observations confirm the presence of a highly compact radio source in RXJ\,1301.9+2747, which is smaller than $0.9\times0.4~\mathrm{pc}$ at 5.0\,GHz. The nonsimultaneous very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) compact flux of the source is consistent with a negative spectral index, and thus is similar to the larger non-VLBI scale radio spectral index. Contrary to earlier results at 1.7\,GHz, we find the 5\,GHz emission offset from the optical Gaia position, which may be due to dust extinction in the host galaxy. In addition, there is a significant offset between the 1.7 and 5.0\,GHz data, which may result from astrophysical uncertainties in the calibration source. This sheds new light on the elusive properties of the radio-detected QPE sources. Consistent with previous results, our observations disfavor a star formation or jet-core-region origin of the radio emission. We cannot rule out a reconnection-driven scenario for the radio emission, but we favor a remnant jet or outflow scenario. This is overall in agreement with the radio properties of radio-detected QPE sources at lower angular resolution.</description>

      <title>Tidal Disruption Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stars that orbit too close to a black hole can be ripped apart by strong tides, producing a type of luminous transient event called a ``tidal disruption event" (TDE). Tidal disruption events of stars by supermassive black holes (SMBHs) provide windows into the nuclei of galaxies at size scales that are difficult to observe directly outside our own galactic neighborhood. They provide a unique opportunity to study these supermassive black holes under feeding conditions that change dramatically over ~week-month timescales, and that regularly reach super-Eddington mass inflow rates. Their light curves are dependent on the properties of the disrupting black hole, and can be used to help constrain the lower mass end of the SMBH mass function -- a region of parameter space that is difficult to access with classic dynamical mass measurements.</description>

      <title>SN 2023taz: Implications for the UV Diversity of Superluminous Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) are some of the brightest explosions in the Universe representing the extremes of stellar deaths. At the upper end of their distribution is SN\,2023taz, one of the most luminous SLSNe discovered to date with a peak absolute magnitude of $M_{g,\rm{peak}}=-22.75 \pm 0.03$ and a lower limit for energy radiated of $E=2.9 \times 10^{51}$\,erg. Magnetar model fits reveal individual parameter values typical of the SLSN population, but the combination of a low $B$-field and ejecta mass with a short spin period places SN\,2023taz in a unusual region of parameter space, accounting for its extreme luminosity. The optical data around peak are consistent with a temperature of $\sim$17\,000\,K but SN\,2023taz shows a surprising deficit in the UV compared to other events in this temperature range. We find no indication of dust extinction that could plausibly explain the UV deficit. The lower level of UV flux is reminiscent of the absorption seen in lower-luminosity events like SN\,2017dwh, where Fe-group elements are responsible for the effect. However, in the case of SN\,2023taz, there is no evidence for a larger amount of Fe-group elements which could contribute to line blanketing. Comparing to SLSNe with well-observed UV spectra, an underlying temperature of $8000-9000$\,K would match the UV spectral slope, but is not consistent with the optical colour temperatures of these events. The most likely explanation is enhanced absorption by intermediate-mass elements, challenging previous findings that SLSNe exhibit similar UV absorption line equivalent widths. This highlights the need for expanded UV spectroscopic coverage of SLSNe, especially at early times, to build a framework for interpreting their diversity and to enable classification at higher redshifts where optical observations will exclusively probe rest-frame UV emission.</description>

      <title>Simulations of a Conducting Sphere Moving through Magnetized Plasma: Alfv\'en Wings, Slow Magnetosonic Wings, and Drag Force</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plasma-mediated interaction between astrophysical objects can play an important role and produce electromagnetic radiation in various binary systems, ranging from planet-moon and star-planet systems to binary compact objects. We perform 3D magnetohydrodynamic numerical simulations to study an ideal magnetized plasma flowing past an unmagnetized conducting sphere. Such flow generates magnetic disturbances and produces a drag force on the sphere, and we explore the corresponding drag coefficient as a function of the flow speed relative to Alfv\'en speed and the $\beta$ parameter of the background plasma. We find that the drag is generally well-described by the Alfv\'en wing model, but we also show that slow magnetosonic waves provide a correction through their own wing-like features. These give rise to a nontrivial dependence of the drag coefficient on the plasma $\beta$, as well as enhanced drag as the flow speed approaches the Alfv\'en speed.</description>

      <title>Constraining the Jet Energetics of the Transient X-ray Binaries MAXI J1348-630 and MAXI J1820+070 through Calorimetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations aimed at identifying potential jet-ISM interaction sites in the vicinity of the transient black hole X-ray binaries MAXI J1348-630 and MAXI J1820+070, both of which have recently undergone an outburst, and displayed powerful large scale jets. Using this dataset, we construct molecular line emission maps. By analyzing the morphological, spectral, and kinematic properties of the detected emission, we identify a molecular structure that provides compelling evidence for a jet-driven cavity in the local environment of MAXI J1348-630 but find no significant emission in the local environment of MAXI J1820+070. We use the properties of the detected molecular emission surrounding MAXI J1348-630 to constrain the jet power, finding our results to be consistent with other independent studies of this source, and further validating the utility of astrochemistry for constraining jet energetics. Additionally, our findings provide the first assessment on the formation timescales for jet-ISM interaction regions in the transient black hole X-ray binary population.</description>

      <title>Hyperaccretion-driven relativistic jets from massive collapsars in active galactic nucleus disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The observable characteristics of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) embedded in the accretion disk of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are mainly determined by the jet propagation within the disk. In the massive collapsar scenario, we consider that the mass and metallicity of progenitor stars can significantly affect the jet durations and luminosities, which in turn influence whether the jet can break out from AGN disks. For the cases with low metallicity, massive stars tend to keep their massive envelopes. Thus the hyperaccretion of these envelopes onto the newborn black holes (BHs) can prolong the activity duration of the central engine, thereby allowing the jets to potentially break out from the disks. For successful jets, we further study their prompt emission and afterglows for different supermassive BHs and locations and discuss the detectability of these signals by instruments such as \emph{Swift} and Einstein Probe. Future related observations will help constrain the structure, components, and evolutionary history of AGN disks and the massive stars embedded within them.</description>

      <title>Measuring the crust-superfluid coupling time-scale for 105 UTMOST pulsars with a Kalman filter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Crust-superfluid coupling plays an important role in neutron star rotation, particularly with respect to timing noise and glitches. Here, we present new timing-noise-based estimates of the crust-superfluid coupling time-scale \(\tau\) for 105 radio pulsars in the UTMOST dataset, by Kalman filtering the pulse times of arrival. The 105 objects are selected because they favor a two-component, crust-superfluid model over a one-component model with log Bayes factor \(\ln \mathfrak{B}_{\rm BF} \geq 5\). The median estimate of \(\tau\) ranges from \(10^{4.6\pm0.4}\)\,s for PSR J2241$-$5236 to \(10^{7.7^{+0.7}_{-0.4}}\)\,s for PSR J1644$-$4559 among 28 out of 105 objects with sharply peaked \(\tau\) posteriors. A hierarchical Bayesian analysis is performed on 101 out of 105 objects that are canonical (i.e.\ neither recycled nor magnetars) and reside in the populous core of the \(\Omega_{\rm c}\)-\(\dot{\Omega}_{\rm c}\) plane. It returns the population-level scaling \(\tau \propto \Omega_{\rm c}^{0.19^{+0.50}_{-0.52}} |\dot{\Omega}_{\rm c}|^{0.18^{+0.18}_{-0.19}}\), where \(\Omega_{\rm c}\) and \(\dot{\Omega}_{\rm c}\) are the angular velocity and spin-down rate of the crust respectively. The variances of the stochastic crust and superfluid torques are also estimated hierarchically, with \(Q_{\rm c} \propto \Omega_{\rm c}^{1.23^{+0.80}_{-0.75}} |\dot{\Omega}_{\rm c}|^{0.49^{+0.27}_{-0.32}}\) and \(Q_{\rm s} \propto \Omega_{\rm c}^{0.71^{+0.76}_{-0.78}} |\dot{\Omega}_{\rm c}|^{1.27^{+0.30}_{-0.28}}\) respectively. Implications for the physical origin of crust-superfluid coupling, e.g.\ through mutual friction, are discussed briefly.</description>

      <title>Electron Cyclotron Maser Emission as the Driving Mechanism in Long-Period Radio Transients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-period radio transients (LPRTs) are highly polarised, coherent radio sources with periods of minutes to hours and bursts typically lasting 10-100s. We argue that electron cyclotron maser emission (ECME) explains their narrow duty cycles and polarisation properties. In this picture, a rotating oblique magnetosphere beams radiation into a thin, hollow emission cone whose surface lies almost perpendicularly to the local magnetic field. The observed very narrow pulses arise when the line of sight skims the cone. Broader profiles and weak leading or trailing components occur when multiple azimuths along the emission ring satisfy the maser resonance condition. The observed isotropic-equivalent luminosities of ~10^{30}-10^{31} erg s^{-1} correspond to modest intrinsic powers once strong ECME beaming is taken into account, which is readily achievable through accretion from the interstellar medium.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Phase shifts of black hole mergers in AGN Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ground-based gravitational wave (GW) detectors have discovered about 200 compact object mergers. The astrophysical origins of these events are highly debated, and it is possible that at least a fraction of them originate from dynamical environments. Among these, the disks of active galactic nuclei (AGN) are particularly interesting as promising environments, as some observed properties may be more readily produced there. When compact objects merge in these environments, acceleration from the central supermassive black hole (SMBH) or nearby companions is inevitable. Such acceleration induces a phase shift in the observed GW waveforms, which can serve as a useful tool to distinguish the underlying merging environments for each GW event. In this paper, we investigate the expected distribution of such acceleration-induced GW phase shifts, using a semi-analytical model combined with a one-dimensional AGN population synthesis code. We find significant contributions from three-body interactions involving a nearby third object. Our results indicate that the GW phase shift is likely to be larger compared to other channels, making it distinguishable by future GW facilities such as TianQin, DECIGO, Taiji, Einstein Telescope, and Cosmic Explorer. Interestingly, a notable fraction of mergers in fact exhibit a significant GW phase shift ($\gtrsim~{\rm 1\ rad}$) at frequencies above $10~{\rm Hz}$, which could even be detectable by current GW detectors such as LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA. Additionally, if gas-hardening during three-body interactions is taken into account, the GW frequency can be boosted to $\gtrsim 10~{\rm Hz}$, potentially further aiding in the detection of the phase shift.</description>

      <title>A Method for Gamma-Ray Energy Spectrum Inversion and Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate spectral analysis of high-energy astrophysical sources often relies on comparing observed data to incident spectral models convolved with the instrument response. However, for Gamma-Ray Bursts and other high-energy transient events observed at high count rates, significant distortions (e.g., pile-up, dead time, and large signal trailing) are introduced, complicating this analysis. We present a method framework to address the model dependence problem, especially to solve the problem of energy spectrum distortion caused by instrument signal pile-up due to high counting rate and high-rate effects, applicable to X-ray, gamma-ray, and particle detectors. Our approach combines physics-based Monte Carlo (MC) simulations with a model-independent spectral inversion technique. The MC simulations quantify instrumental effects and enable correction of the distorted spectrum. Subsequently, the inversion step reconstructs the incident spectrum using an inverse response matrix approach, conceptually equivalent to deconvolving the detector response. The inversion employs a Convolutional Neural Network, selected for its numerical stability and effective handling of complex detector responses. Validation using simulations across diverse input spectra demonstrates high fidelity. Specifically, for 27 different parameter sets of the brightest gamma-ray bursts, goodness-of-fit tests confirm the reconstructed spectra are in excellent statistical agreement with the input spectra, and residuals are typically within $\pm 2\sigma$. This method enables precise analysis of intense transients and other high-flux events, overcoming limitations imposed by instrumental effects in traditional analyses.</description>

      <title>Explosions in the Empty: A Survey of Transients in Local Void Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic analysis of transient astrophysical events -- including supernovae (SNe), gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), and fast radio bursts (FRBs) -- in void and non-void galaxies within the local universe ($0.005 &lt; z &lt; 0.05$). Cosmic voids, defined by low galaxy densities and characterized by minimal environmental interactions, offer a natural laboratory for isolating the impact of large-scale underdensities on stellar evolution and transient production. Using multi-wavelength data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, the Sternberg Astronomical Institute Supernova Catalogue, and high-energy space observatories, we compare transient occurrence rates and host galaxy properties across environments. We find that core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) are significantly more common in void galaxies, indicating that massive star formation remains active in underdense regions. In contrast, Type Ia supernovae are less frequent in voids, consistent with a scarcity of older stellar populations. Notably, we identify a short-duration GRB hosted by a void galaxy, demonstrating that compact object mergers can occur in isolated environments. Additionally, we find no FRBs associated with void galaxies. Taken together, these results show that cosmic voids exert a measurable influence on the star formation history of galaxies and hence on the production of transients.</description>

      <title>Advancing Identification method of Gamma-Ray Bursts with Data and Feature Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are challenging to identify due to their transient nature, complex temporal profiles, and limited observational datasets. We address this with a one-dimensional convolutional neural network integrated with an Adaptive Frequency Feature Enhancement module and physics-informed data augmentation. Our framework generates 100,000 synthetic GRB samples, expanding training data diversity and volume while preserving physical fidelity-especially for low-significance events. The model achieves 97.46% classification accuracy, outperforming all tested variants with conventional enhancement modules, highlighting enhanced domain-specific feature capture. Feature visualization shows model focuses on deep-seated morphological features and confirms the capability of extracting physically meaningful burst characteristics. Dimensionality reduction and clustering reveal GRBs with similar morphologies or progenitor origins cluster in the feature space, linking learned features to physical properties. This perhaps offers a novel diagnostic tool for identifying kilonova- and supernova-associated GRB candidates, establishing criteria to enhance multi-messenger early-warning systems. The framework aids current time-domain surveys, generalizes to other rare transients, and advances automated detection in large-volume observational data.</description>

      <title>Probing the disk-jet coupling in M87</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Recent GMVA observations of M 87 at event horizon scales revealed a ring-like structure which is 50% larger at 86 GHz than the ring observed by the Event Horizon Telescope at 230 GHz. Aims. In this paper, we study a possible origin of the increased ring size at 86 GHz. We specifically aim to study the role the nonthermal electron population plays in the observed event horizon scales. Methods. We carry out 3D general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations followed by radiative transfer calculations. We incorporate into the latter synchrotron emission from both thermal and nonthermal electrons. To better compare our results to observations, we generate synthetic interferometric data adjusted to the properties of the observing arrays. We fit geometrical models to this data in Fourier space through Bayesian analysis to monitor the variable ring size and width over the simulated time span of years. Results. We find that the 86 GHz ring is always larger than the 230 GHz ring, which can be explained by the increased synchrotron self-absorption at 86 GHz and the mixed emission from both the accretion disk and the jet footpoints, as well as flux arcs ejected from a magnetized disk. We find agreement with the observations, particularly within the error range of the observational value of M/D for M 87. Conclusions. We show that state-of-the art 3D GRMHD simulations combined with thermal and nonthermal emitting particles can explain the observed frequency-dependent ring size in M 87. Importantly we found that MAD events triggered in the accretion disk can significantly increase the lower frequency ring sizes.</description>

      <title>Is There New Physics Beyond 30 TeV in the BOAT?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the GRB 221009A spectrum detected by LHAASO can be used to probe effects of quadratic subluminal Lorentz Invariance Violation (LIV) through the enhancement of the observed flux at the highest energies. In particular, we argue that excesses in the GRB 221009A data currently classified as non-detections at energies $E \gtrsim 30$ TeV warrant further investigation, as they may indicate a recovery of the intrinsic source spectrum consistent with the LIV-induced suppression of $\gamma\gamma \to e^-e^+$ interactions within the quadratic subluminal scenario. This would increase the accessible parameter space of the energy scale of new physics.</description>

      <title>Excess of diffuse gamma-ray emission detected from the galaxy cluster Abell 119 from 14-year Fermi-LAT Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxy clusters are among the most massive gravitationally bound systems in the Universe and are considered major reservoirs of high-energy cosmic rays, yet no conclusive $\gamma$-ray detection from them has been achieved. This non-detection may stem from limited sensitivity and source localization of current $\gamma$-ray instruments, as well as strong interactions of $\gamma$-rays with intervening material that restrict detectable signals to only a few nearby and dynamically active clusters. Motivated by these constraints, we selected a sample of nearby ($z&lt;0.05$) merging clusters and analyzed 14 years of \textit{Fermi}-LAT data. In this work, we present a detailed study of Abell 119 (A119), a merging cluster with significant X-ray luminosity and complex dynamics. Using \textit{Fermipy} and \textit{Fermi} Science Tools, we modeled all potential $\gamma$-ray sources and confirmed the 4FGL point sources 4FGL J0059.3$-$0152, 4FGL J0101.0$-$0059, and 4FGL J0059.2+0006 with significant TS values.s. It further reveals, a $\sim4\sigma$ excess of diffuse $\gamma$-ray emission offset by $\sim0.25^\circ$ from the cluster center, plausibly associated with the cluster halo. An extended model provides the best fit, yielding luminosity bounds of $\sim 12.21^{+2.74}_{-3.95}\times10^{42}\,\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}}$ and a particle spectral index of $\sim2.25^{+0.38}_{-0.13}$, consistent with earlier expectations for cluster-scale non-thermal emission. These results suggest a hadronic origin for the detected signal. Although the $\sim4\sigma$ excess is compelling, uncertainties in localization and instrumental limitations prevent a definitive detection. Nonetheless, the results highlight the potential for deeper cluster studies, and the estimated neutrino flux $E^{2}\phi_{\nu}\approx3\times10^{-10}\,\mathrm{GeV\,cm^{-2}\,s^{-1}\,sr^{-1}}$ motivates future observations with upcoming neutrino telescopes.</description>

      <title>Catching the 2021 {\gamma}-ray flare in the blazar TXS 2013+370</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $\gamma$-ray-loud blazar TXS 2013+370, a powerful multiwavelength emitter at $z = 0.859$, underwent an exceptional GeV outburst in late 2020-early 2021. In this work, we present full-polarization VLBI imaging at 22, 43, and 86 GHz together with contemporaneous single-dish monitoring (radio and $\gamma$-rays) to localize the high-energy dissipation site and probe the inner-jet structure and magnetic field topology. The images revealed a compact near-core knot at $r \simeq 40$-$60~\mu\mathrm{as}$ contemporaneously with the GeV flare and a flat, core-dominated spectrum ($\alpha \gtrsim -0.5$). The core has strong linear polarization and exhibits a $\sim 50^{\circ}$ EVPA rotation at 86 GHz; pixel-based and integrated fits yield a high, uniform rotation measure, ${\rm RM} = (7.8 \pm 0.2) \times 10^{4}~{\rm rad~m^{-2}}$, consistent with an external Faraday screen. Cross-correlation of Fermi-LAT and 15 GHz data shows a significant peak with the $\gamma$ rays leading by $\Delta t = (102 \pm 12)\,\mathrm{d}$; adopting $\beta_{\rm app} = 4.2 \pm 0.5$ and $\theta = 4.1^{\circ} \pm 0.2^{\circ}$ implies a de-projected separation $\Delta r_{\gamma-15} = (2.71 \pm 0.47)\,\mathrm{pc}$ and locates the GeV emission between the jet apex and $\sim 0.42$ pc ($1\sigma$ range) downstream. Our results do not uniquely pinpoint the emission site; rather, they support two valid scenarios. The $\gamma$-ray production may occur within the BLR ($\sim 0.07$pc), where external-Compton scattering of optical/UV photons produces the $\gamma$ rays, or beyond the BLR, reaching $\sim 0.42$ pc ($1\sigma$) within the inner parsecs, where external-Compton scattering of dusty-torus infrared photons dominates. Both scenarios are compatible within the allowed range of emission distances, while opacity-driven core shifts modulate the observed radio-$\gamma$ delay without requiring large relocations of the dissipation zone.</description>

      <title>The Relationship Between Emission Line and Continuum Luminosity and the Baldwin Effect in Blazars. I. The Case of the Mg II {\lambda}2798 {\AA} Emission Line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aims. This study investigates the relationship between the Mg II {\lambda}2798 {\AA} emission line and the 3000 {\AA} continuum luminosity, as well as the Baldwin Effect, in a sample of 40,685 radio-quiet (RQ) quasars and 441 Flat Spectrum Radio Quasars (FSRQs). Methods. We perform a comprehensive re-evaluation of the Mg II-3000 {\AA} correlation, explicitly accounting for dispersion introduced by AGN variability. After excluding &gt;3000 radio-loud sources, we employ a binning technique to mitigate variability effects, yielding a refined empirical relation. We also further examine the Non-Thermal Dominance (NTD) parameter, to investigate the dominant source of the continuum. Results. Our analysis reveals statistically significant differences in the slopes of the line-continuum luminosity relation between RQ quasars and FSRQs, with a parallel discrepancy in the Baldwin Effect. These findings imply either (1) intrinsic differences in the accretion disk spectra of RQ AGNs and FSRQs or (2) jet-induced continuum emission in FSRQs contributing to Broad Line Region (BLR) ionization. We also found that a substantial fraction of both RQ quasars (43.8\%) and blazars (55.5\%) exhibit NTD &lt; 1. For blazars, this suggests that the accretion disk alone cannot fully explain BLR ionization; while we interpret NTD &lt; 1 in radio-quiet quasars as a signature of several physical mechanisms: anomalies in the BLR structure (such as outflow or inflows), time lags between continuum and line variations, and the suppression of the UV continuum by a strong corona that diverts accretion power. Finally, we demonstrate that the Baldwin Effect emerges naturally from the line-continuum luminosity relationship, requiring no additional physical mechanism to explain its origin</description>

      <title>Delayed Wind Onset in Pa 30, the Remnant of Type Iax SN 1181</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pa 30 is the recently identified remnant of the historical supernova SN 1181, likely a Type Iax event, and a nebula surrounding the central white dwarf launching a fast wind ($\sim10^9~\cm~\s^{-1}$) is observed in optical and infrared bands. X-ray observations show that this wind collides with the surrounding material and produces a termination shock, and the observed extent of the shock indicates that the wind started blowing centuries after 1181 A.D. rather than immediately after the SN explosion. We propose that the wind is triggered by delayed ignition of fallback carbon-rich material on the WD surface and investigate the conditions that reproduce such delayed ignition. We show that producing delays of several centuries requires a relatively hot post-explosion WD core with a temperature $T_c \simeq 6\times10^8~\mathrm{K}$. This supports the pure-deflagration progenitor scenario for Type Iax SN 1181, which implies the presence of a He star companion inside Pa~30; we also discuss why such a potential He star has not been detected and its prospects for discovery by future observations.</description>

      <title>The Physics of Black Holes and Their Environments: Consequences for Gravitational Wave Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ten short years ago, we had the rare privilege of witnessing the onset of a renaissance in science: humanity finally succeeded in its arduous quest to directly detect gravitational waves. This breakthrough did not occur in a vacuum: it was the natural culmination of decades of research dedicated towards understanding the nature of gravitation based on Einstein's General Theory of Relativity. It is a story of false starts, perseverance, and remarkable insights, propelled as much by technological progress as by human curiosity. We now proudly live in the new golden age of gravitational physics. The detection of gravitational wave signals from the merger of binary black holes and neutron stars are becoming routine. Coupled with our theoretical understanding of phenomena in the strong gravity regime, black hole physics has become a precision science. The purpose of these lecture notes is to help the reader understand the language and framework of this rapidly evolving subject, and to develop the ability to interpret, think, and discuss ideas that lie at the confluence of gravitational wave astronomy and black hole physics. It is our hope that these notes will prepare students and colleagues for the next revolution when gravitational wave events become commonplace and we begin to observe unexpected features in the signal, indicating either surprising astrophysical scenarios or a strong need to modify the theoretical description of gravitational interactions. We provide first principles analysis of black hole and gravitational wave physics, and sometimes a very personal interpretation of results. We share with the readers a number of notebooks that will allow them to reproduce some of the most important results in the field, and could even help in carrying out state-of-the-art research. We also include a few original results that we think are helpful in understanding the broader picture.</description>

      <title>Low-frequency radio telescopes sensitivity to light dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ground-based radio telescopes are routinely used to search for light dark matter (DM) candidates such as axion-like particles or dark photons. These instruments face however inherent limitations to push the searches to masses below $10^{-7}$ eV, due to the effect of the Earth's ionosphere. The extant and planned space- or Moon-based radio telescopes motivate this study: We systematically investigate their sensitivity to resonant conversion of light DM into radio signals from three solar system targets: the Sun, the Earth, and Jupiter. The perspectives are especially encouraging for dark photon searches using the Sun as a target, and for axion-like particles conversion in Jupiter's magnetosphere.</description>

      <title>511 keV Gamma Ray Echo from Particle Decays in Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The formation of a hot and dense core in a core-collapse supernova (SN) can produce massive Beyond Standard Model (BSM) particles. These particles can decay in the stellar envelope, generating positrons either directly or through secondary processes involving neutrinos or photons. We show for the first time that such positrons regardless of their production channel, can thermalize and annihilate at rest with ambient electrons in the outer SN envelope, producing a characteristic echo of 511 keV gamma rays. For axion-like particles (ALPs), we derive bounds on the ALP-photon coupling ($G_{a \gamma}$) using Pioneer Venus Orbiter observations of SN 1987A. We also evaluate the sensitivity of upcoming MeV gap gamma-ray telescopes in the 511 keV range, such as COSI and AMEGO, for future Galactic SNe, which can improve existing constraints or enable ALP discovery. The echo signal is a generic prediction for any particle species that efficiently produces positrons near the stellar surface.</description>

      <title>A Neural Network Approach to Preferred Event Selection for Low-Latency Gravitational-Wave Alerts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14997v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration uses multiple independent search pipelines to detect gravitational waves, often resulting in multiple triggers (g-events) for a single astrophysical source. These triggers are grouped into superevents, raising a critical question for multimessenger astronomy: which g-event provides the most accurate sky localization for electromagnetic follow-up? Currently, the g-event with the highest signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is selected, under the assumption that it should provide the best estimators of the source's parameters, including its location on the sky. Analysis of simulated signals reveals systematic deviations from this expectation. In particular, a false-alarm rate (FAR)-based selector performs slightly better than the SNR-based method, but introduces pipeline biases. We present a neural network-based selector trained on simulated signals to identify the g-event with the minimum searched area -- a metric quantifying localization accuracy. The network uses information (detector SNRs, FAR, and chirp mass) from all of the triggers associated with each astrophysical source and is designed to be pipeline-agnostic. Our results show that the neural network outperforms both traditional selectors, achieving a mean searched area ~2% smaller than the SNR-based selector. Unlike FAR-based selection, the neural network preserves the underlying distribution of pipeline contributions, avoiding systematic biases toward specific pipelines. The network can be trained in approximately one minute on a few thousand events and performs event selection instantaneously, making it suitable for low-latency applications. These results demonstrate that machine learning can enhance multimessenger astronomy capabilities while maintaining fairness across detection pipelines. We recommend implementing this approach for future observing runs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.15127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive the flavor fractions $(\eta^{}_e , \eta^{}_\mu , \eta^{}_\tau)$ for ultrahigh-energy neutrinos originating from a remote astrophysical source by using their flavor ratios $(f^{}_e , f^{}_\mu , f^{}_\tau)$ observed at a neutrino telescope, and find that a potential divergence may appear in inferring the values of $\eta^{}_\mu$ and $\eta^{}_\tau$ as an unavoidable consequence of the approximate $\mu$-$\tau$ interchange symmetry of lepton flavor mixing. We illustrate such an effect by applying our formula to the IceCube all-sky neutrino flux data ranging from 5 TeV to 10 PeV in the naive assumption that the relevant sources have a common flavor composition. We show that only $\eta^{}_e$ and $\eta^{}_\mu + \eta^{}_\tau$ can be extracted from the measurements of $f^{}_e$, $f^{}_\mu$ and $f^{}_\tau$ if the $\mu$-$\tau$ flavor symmetry is exact, and the JUNO and Daya Bay precision antineutrino oscillation data will help a lot in this connection.</description>

      <title>Type Iax supernovae as a source of iron-rich silicate dust</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15349v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We model the formation of dust in the ejecta of Type Iax supernovae (SNe), which is a low-luminosity subclass of Type Ia SNe. A non-equilibrium chemical kinetic approach is adopted to trace the synthesis of molecules, molecular clusters, and dust grains in the ejecta of thermonuclear SNe. We find that Type Iax SNe provide conditions conducive to the formation of several O-rich dust species in the ejecta. Particularly, iron-rich silicates of chemical type FeSiO3, Fe2SiO4, and MgFeSiO4 are found to form in abundance, suggesting that the ejecta of low-luminosity thermonuclear SNe can be a site where a large fraction of iron is locked up in dust, unlike other stellar sources. The final mass of dust formed in the ejecta ranges between 10^{-5} and 10^{-4} Msun, where most of the dust forms between 1000 and 2000 days post-explosion. Apart from Fe-rich silicates, Mg-silicates, and silicon carbide are also formed in the ejecta of Type Iax SNe. When compared to the dust budget of typical Type Ia SNe, we find that the expected dust-to-ejecta mass ratio is one or two orders of magnitude larger in Type Iax SNe. We conclude that the ejecta of typical Type Ia SNe form a negligible amount of dust, in agreement with observation, while the low-luminosity subclass Type Iax SNe are potential producers of iron-rich silicates.</description>

      <title>Relativistic mean-field model with density- and isospin-density-dependent couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new hadronic EoS with hyperons built within the relativistic mean-field (RMF) formalism with baryon-density- and isospin-density-dependent couplings. Motivated by microscopic calculations showing density- and isospin-asymmetry-dependence of self-energies, we implement a new form for the baryon-meson couplings. The parameters for the couplings are constrained by a Bayesian analysis, which anchors the model to nuclear saturation properties, chiral effective field theory ($\chi$EFT) predictions for pure neutron matter, heavy-ion collision data, and HALQCD-based hyperon potential calculations at 3-momentum $|\mathbf{k}|=0$ in both isospin-symmetric and pure neutron matter. The resulting EoS satisfies neutron star mass-radius constraints from NICER and GW170817, providing another way to address the hyperon puzzle. The low-density part of the EoS is described via nuclear statistical equilibrium with modern mass tables (AME20/FRDM12, 8244 nuclei), providing a novel and complete general-purpose EoS for astrophysical simulations.</description>

      <title>Formation of neutron stars inside planetary nebulae via accretion-induced collapse and core-merger-induced collapse from white dwarf binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03985v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The formation of neutron stars (NSs) within planetary nebulae (PNe) has not been previously even mentioned in the literature. In this paper, I propose two possible formation channels for NSs inside PNe. First, using simulations performed with the MESA stellar evolution code, I present a scenario in which NSs form via the accretion-induced collapse (AIC) of oxygen-neon-magnesium (ONeMg) white dwarfs (WDs) inside PNe--referred to here as symbiotic nebulae. In the late evolutionary stages of ONeMg WD-red giant (or asymptotic giant branch) star binaries, substantial mass loss can occur through strong stellar winds or/and Roche-lobe overflow, potentially leading to the formation of nebulae surrounding central accreting WD binaries. These nebulae may be ionized by the hot cores of the giant stars or by the accreting WDs themselves. Under such conditions, the accreting WD may grow in mass to the Chandrasekhar limit and undergo collapse into a neutron star. NSs formed via this AIC channel are likely to retain WD companions, resulting in NS-WD binary systems, of which the Milky Way may host dozens. Second, through binary population synthesis modeling, I introduce another evolutionary pathway: the core-merger-induced collapse occurring during the common envelope evolution of ONeMg WD binaries. This process may result in the formation of a newborn NS within a PN-or, in some cases, a pulsar wind nebula.</description>

      <title>Isolated Binary Black Hole Formation and Merger Rates from Galaxy Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13318v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) collaboration has detected over 150 confirmed gravitational wave events through O4a. Binary black hole (BBH) systems represent the overwhelming majority of these observations. We construct a model for the population of the BBHs based on the distribution of metallicities in galaxies and state-of-the-art stellar evolution models implemented through the Stellar EVolution N-body (SEVN) code. We calculate the redshift evolution of the total merger rate of BBHs and the differential rates with respect to primary mass, secondary mass, and the mass ratio. We explore variations in the delay-time distribution's (DTD) power-law index and show that it affects the total merger rate's spectral shape, but primarily acts as an amplitude shift on the differential rates. When comparing to the primary mass distribution, our results indicate that either the average IMF in dwarf galaxies must be top heavy, or most of the 30-40 $\rm M_\odot$ black holes must be formed through a dynamical capture mechanism. For masses greater than about $50 \, \rm M_\odot$, the predicted number of BBH systems plummet to zero, revealing the well-known mass gap due to the pair instability mechanism and mass loss in binary systems.</description>

Abstract: We study the deflections of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays in several widely used models of the coherent Galactic magnetic field (GMF), including PT11 (Pshirkov et al. [1]), JF12 (Jansson and Farrar [2]), UF23 (Unger and Farrar [3]) and KST24 (Korochkin, Semikoz, and Tinyakov [4]). We propagate particles with rigidities of 5, 10, and 20 EV and analyze the differences in deflection predictions across these GMF models. We identify the GMF components responsible for deflections in various regions of the sky and discuss the uncertainties in modeling these components, as well as potential future improvements.</description>

      <title>Detection of a Type-C QPO during the soft-to-hard transition in Swift J1727.8-1613</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07938v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Timing analysis of accreting systems is key to probe the structure and dynamics around compact objects. In Black-Hole Low-Mass X-ray Binaries (BH LMXBs), the compact object accretes matter from a low-mass companion star via Roche Lobe overflow, forming an accretion disk, and occasionally exhibiting bright eruptions. The BH LMXB Swift J1727.8-1613 (hereafter J1727), recently underwent one of the brightest outbursts ever recorded in X-rays, in August 2023. This analysis aims to study the timing properties of J1727, in the decaying phase of its outburst, using high-time resolution XMM-Newton data. We analyzed J1727's power spectrum (PS) and cross spectrum (CS), which we modeled with Lorentzians. The PS reveals how the source's power is distributed across frequencies, and the Real and Imaginary parts of the CS compare the displacement of the light curves in different energy bands across the observations. Finally, we simultaneously derived the phase lags and the coherence, using a constant phase lag model. While the first (soft-state) observation does not show any strong variability, the two harder observations exhibit quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs). Because the QPO is more significantly detected in the Imaginary part of the CS than in the PS, we refer to it as the 'Imaginary QPO'. The QPO is more prominent in the soft 0.3-2 keV band than in the hard 2-12 keV band. As the source evolves towards the hard state, the Imaginary QPO shifts to lower frequencies, the broadband fractional rms amplitude in the 0.3-2 keV energy band increases, while the rms covariance of the Imaginary QPO decreases. Simultaneously, the phase lags increase and the coherence function drops at the Imaginary QPO frequency. In the elusive soft-to-hard transition of J1727, the first XMM-Newton observations of the source reveal an Imaginary QPO also detected in the PS, exhibiting the properties of a type-C QPO.</description>

      <title>The source of the cosmic-ray excess in the Centaurus region -- constraints on possible candidates, mass composition and cosmic magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06594v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The most significant excess in the arrival directions of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays with energies $\gtrsim40\,\mathrm{EeV}$ is found in the direction of several interesting source candidates, most prominently the nearby radio galaxy Centaurus A. Naturally, Cen A has been suspected to create the anisotropy - but very different scenarios have been proposed. This includes a subdominant source contribution in combination with isotropic background sources, as well as a scenario where Cen A supplies the whole cosmic-ray flux above the ankle. Recently, it was suggested that the overdensity could instead consist of strongly deflected events from the Sombrero galaxy. Thanks to the recent development of several models of the Galactic magnetic field, it is now possible to test these proposed scenarios explicitly. Leveraging the measured overdensity direction, significance, angular scale, and energy evolution, we place limits on the allowed signal fraction, the possible ejected charge number and the strength of the extragalactic magnetic field between the respective source and Earth. We find that the scenario of a subdominant source in the overdensity region requires the charge number to be $Z\lesssim6$ and the extragalactic magnetic field quantity $B/\mathrm{nG} \sqrt{L_c/\mathrm{Mpc}}$ to be between $~1$ and $~100$. For the Sombrero galaxy to be the source, the dominant charge number has to be around $Z=6$ with $1\lesssim B/\mathrm{nG} \sqrt{L_c/\mathrm{Mpc}}\lesssim20$. We find that a scenario where all the flux above $30\,\mathrm{EeV}$ is supplied by Cen A or M83 is possible for $20\lesssim B/\mathrm{nG} \sqrt{L_c/\mathrm{Mpc}}\lesssim30$ and a mixed composition - explaining both the Centaurus region excess and the distribution of the highest-energy events - however, another contributing source is possibly required in the energy range $&lt;30\,\mathrm{EeV}$.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Gaussian Methods for Robust Background Modeling in CALorimetric Electron Telescope (CALET) Gravitational-Wave Searches</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25893v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The search for gamma-ray counterparts to gravitational-wave events with the CALET Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (CGBM) requires accurate and robust background modeling. Previous CALET observing runs (O3 and O4) relied on averaged pre/post-event baselines or low-order polynomial fits, approaches that neglect correlated noise, temporal non-stationarity, and the propagation of background uncertainty into derived flux upper limits. These simplifications can lead to reduced sensitivity to faint or atypical transients. In this work, we present a novel Bayesian framework for background estimation based on Gaussian Process (GP) regression and change-point modeling. Our approach captures correlated structures in the detector background, quantifies predictive uncertainties, and propagates them into both detection statistics and Bayesian credible upper limits. We demonstrate, using archival CALET time-tagged event data and simulated signal injections, that our method improves sensitivity to weak short-duration bursts by up to an order of magnitude compared to traditional polynomial fits. This probabilistic background treatment enables a more physically robust interpretation of non-detections and offers a scalable, real-time compatible extension for future joint multi-messenger searches. All codes used in this paper are available at https://github.com/SMALLSCALEDEV/Bayesian-Gaussian-Approach-for-Background-Estimation-in-CALET-GW.</description>

      <title>XRISM Spectroscopy of the Stellar-mass Black Hole GRS 1915+105</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25089v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: GRS 1915$+$105 was the stellar-mass black hole that best reproduced key phenomena that are also observed in Type-1 active galactic nuclei. In recent years, however, it has evolved to resemble a Type-2 or Compton-thick AGN. Herein, we report on the first XRISM observation of GRS 1915$+$105. The high-resolution Resolve calorimeter spectrum reveals that a sub-Eddington central engine is covered by a layer of warm, Compton-thick gas. With the obscuration acting as a coronagraph, numerous strong, narrow emission lines from He-like and H-like charge states of Si, S, Ar, Ca, Cr, Mn, Fe, and Ni dominate the spectrum. Radiative recombination continuum (RRC) features are also observed, signaling that much of the emitting gas is photoionized. The line spectrum can be fit by three photoionized emission zones, with broadening and bulk velocities suggestive of an origin in the outer disk atmosphere and/or a slow wind at $r \simeq 10^{6}~GM/c^{2}$. The Fe XXV He-$\alpha$ and Fe XXVI Ly-$\alpha$ lines have a broad base that may indicate some emission from $r \sim 3\times 10^{3}~GM/c^{2}$. These results broadly support a picture wherein the current state in GRS 1915$+$105 is due to obscuration by the irradiated outer disk. This could arise through disk thickening if the Eddington fraction is higher than inferred, but it is more likely due to a warped, precessing disk that has brought the outer disk into the line of sight. We discuss the strengths and weaknesses of this interpretation and our modeling, and possible explanations of some potentially novel spectral features.</description>

      <title>Kerr Black Hole Shadows in Dispersive Plasma: Frequency-Dependent Geodesics and Shadow Distortions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.06466v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The black hole shadow, a direct probe of the event horizon's gravitational influence, has been observationally confirmed by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT). While theoretical models of shadows in vacuum are mature, real astrophysical black holes like M87* and Sgr A* are enveloped in plasma, which can alter photon trajectories through dispersion. Current understanding, based on foundational work, indicates that only specific plasma distributions allow for an analytical treatment via the separation of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation. In this work, we build upon this framework to systematically investigate the propagation of light rays in Kerr spacetime surrounded by a pressureless, non-magnetized cold plasma. We explicitly derive the separability condition, identifying the exact class of plasma densities that permit a generalized Carter constant. For these models, we compute the photon regions and shadow boundaries, characterizing how the shadow's size and shape deviate from the vacuum case in a frequency-dependent manner. Our results provide analytical benchmarks for the distortion of shadows in dispersive media and determine the critical plasma frequency beyond which the shadow is erased, offering a direct link between observable shadow features and the properties of the ambient plasma environment and providing a foundation for studying more dynamic, non-separable plasma distributions.</description>

      <title>A Novel Density Profile for Isothermal Cores of Dark Matter Halos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11945v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel analytic density profile for halos in self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) models, which accurately captures the isothermal-core configuration, i.e. where both the density and velocity dispersion profiles exhibit central plateaus in the halo innermost region. Importantly, the profile retains a simple and tractable functional form. We demonstrate analytically how our density profile satisfies the aforementioned conditions, with comparisons to other contemporary functional choices. We further validate the profile using idealized N-body simulations, showing that it provides excellent representations of both the density and velocity dispersion profiles across a broad range of evolutionary stages, from the early thermalization phase to the late core-collapse regime. As a result of its accuracy and simplicity, the proposed profile offers a robust framework for analyzing halo evolution in a variety of SIDM scenarios. It also holds practical utility in reducing simulation needs and in generating initial conditions for simulations targeting the deep core-collapse regime.</description>

      <title>Detector Response to Gravitational Wave Polarizations in Gravitational Quantum Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01809v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an analysis of gravitational wave polarization modes within Gravitational Quantum Field Theory (GQFT), a unified theoretical framework reconciling general relativity and quantum field theory. In the six fundamental polarization: two tensors ($+, \times$), two vectors (x, y), and two scalars (breathing, longitudial) modes of gravitational wave, two tensors and breathing are favored by GQFT. Their distinctive detection signatures in space-based interferometers like LISA and Taiji can be verified. Using first-order orbital dynamics in the Solar System Barycenter frame, we identify three novel observational features: (1) characteristic interference patterns between polarization modes, (2) provide a model-independent response function, and (3) sky-position-dependent optimal detection methods. Our approach provides complete sky coverage through polarization mapping while remaining fully compatible with existing mission designs, notably avoiding the need for challenging direct breathing-mode measurements. The results are presented through comprehensive sky maps, offering both theoretical insights into gravitational wave polarization and practical tools for future detectors. This work establishes a new paradigm for testing fundamental gravity theories through their unique polarization fingerprints</description>

      <title>Understanding large-scale dynamos in unstratified rotating shear flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03660v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We combine simulations with new analyses that overcome previous pitfalls to explicate how nonhelical mean-field dynamos grow and saturate in unstratified, magnetorotationally driven turbulence. Shear of the mean radial magnetic field amplifies the azimuthal component. Radial fields are regenerated by velocity fluctuations that induce shear of radial magnetic fluctuations, followed by Lorentz and Coriolis forces that source a negative off-diagonal component in the turbulent diffusivity tensor. We present a simple schematic to illustrate this dynamo growth. A different part of the Lorentz force forms a third-order correlator in the mean electromotive force that saturates the dynamo.</description>

      <title>Measuring spin precession from massive black hole binaries with gravitational waves: insights from time-domain signal morphology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14573v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Robustly measuring binary black hole spins via gravitational waves is key to understanding these systems' astrophysical origins, but remains challenging -- especially for high-mass systems, whose signals are short and dominated by the merger. Nonetheless, events like GW190521 show that strong spin precession can indeed be gleaned. In this work, we track how spin precession imprints on simulated high-mass binary black hole signals cycle-by-cycle using time-domain inference. We investigate a suite of signals, all with the same spins and (near-unity) mass ratio -- yielding identical spin evolution -- but different signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), total masses, and extrinsic angles, all of which affect the observed waveform morphology. We truncate each signal at various times and infer source parameters using only the data before or after each cutoff. The resultant posterior allows us to identify which time segments of each signal inform its spin precession constraints. We find that at a sufficiently high post-peak SNR ($\sim 20$), spin precession can be constrained by the NRSur7dq4 waveform model when just the post-peak data (i.e., ringdown) are visible. Similarly, at a large enough pre-cutoff SNR ($\sim 10$), spin precession can be constrained using only pre-peak data (i.e., inspiral); this occurs for signals with detector-frame total mass $\lesssim 100 M_{\odot}$ at GW190521's full-signal SNR. Finally, we vary the inclination, polarization, and phase angles, finding that their configuration need not be fine-tuned to measure spin precession, even for very high-mass and short signals with two to three observable cycles. We do not find that the same morphological features consistently drive precession constraints: in some signals, precession inference hinges on the relationship between a loud merger and quiet pre-merger cycle, as was the case for GW190521, but this is not generically true.</description>

      <title>A waveform and time digitization mainboard prototype for the hybrid digital optical module of TRIDENT neutrino experiment</title>

Abstract: The TRIDENT (Tropical Deep-sea Neutrino Telescope) experiment is a next-generation underwater neutrino observatory planned for deployment in the West Pacific Ocean, designed to detect astrophysical neutrinos through Cherenkov radiation. The full-scale detector will consist of approximately 1000 vertical strings, each equipped with 20 hybrid digital optical modules (hDOMs) containing both photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) and silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) for comprehensive light detection. This paper presents a custom-designed digitization mainboard prototype for the hDOM, featuring simultaneous 32-channel PMT waveform digitization at 125 MS/s using commercial analog-to-digital converters and 56-channel high-precision time measurement through field-programmable gate array -implemented time-to-digital converters. The system demonstrates excellent performance in single photoelectron (PE) detection with clear pedestal separation, maintains linear response up to 240 PEs, and achieves sub-nanosecond timing resolution for PMT or SiPM pulse edges.</description>

      <title>Dance to Demise -- How Massive Stars May Form Dense Circumstellar Shells Before Explosion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04497v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the evolution of red supergiant (RSG) progenitors of core-collapse supernovae (SNe) with initial masses between $12$ and $20~\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$, focusing on effects of enhanced mass loss due to pulsation-driven instabilities in their envelopes and subsequent dynamical ejections during advanced stages of nuclear burning. Using time-dependent mass loss rates from detailed Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) stellar evolution models, including prescriptions for both pulsation-driven superwinds and shock-induced ejections, we construct the circumstellar medium (CSM) before the SN explosion. We calculate resulting CSM density profiles and column densities considering the radiation-driven acceleration of the stellar wind. Our models produce episodes of enhanced mass loss $\sim 10^{-4}-10^{-2}~ \mathrm{M}_{\odot}~\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ in the last centuries-decades before explosion forming dense CSM ($\gtrsim10^{-15}~\mathrm{g~cm}^{-3}$ at distances $\lesssim10^{15}~\mathrm{cm}$) - consistent with multi-wavelength observations of Type II SNe such as SN 2023ixf, SN 2020ywx, SN 2017hcc, SN 2005ip and SN 1998S. The formation of such dense CS shells, as predicted by our single star RSG models, provides a natural explanation for observed flash-ionization signatures, X-ray and radio emission, and has important implications for dust formation around Type II SNe.</description>

      <title>Lightweight posterior construction for gravitational-wave catalogs with the Kolmogorov-Arnold network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18698v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural density estimation has seen widespread applications in the gravitational-wave (GW) data analysis, which enables real-time parameter estimation for compact binary coalescences and enhances rapid inference for subsequent analysis such as population inference. In this work, we explore the application of using the Kolmogorov-Arnold network (KAN) to construct efficient and interpretable neural density estimators for lightweight posterior construction of GW catalogs. By replacing conventional activation functions with learnable splines, KAN achieves superior interpretability, higher accuracy, and greater parameter efficiency on related scientific tasks. Leveraging this feature, we propose a KAN-based neural density estimator, which ingests megabyte-scale GW posterior samples and compresses them into model weights of tens of kilobytes. Subsequently, analytic expressions requiring only several kilobytes can be further distilled from these neural network weights with minimal accuracy trade-off. In practice, GW posterior samples with fidelity can be regenerated rapidly using the model weights or analytic expressions for subsequent analysis. Our lightweight posterior construction strategy is expected to facilitate user-level data storage and transmission, paving a path for efficient analysis of numerous GW events in the next-generation GW detectors.</description>

      <title>A simple, flexible method for timing cross-calibration of space missions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13865v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The timing (cross-)calibration of astronomical instruments is often done by comparing pulsar times-of-arrival (TOAs) to a reference timing model. In high-energy astronomy, the choice of solar system ephemerides and source positions used to barycenter the photon arrival times has a significant impact on the procedure, requiring a full reprocessing of the data each time a new convention is used. Our method, developed as part of the activities of the International Astronomical Consortium for High Energy Calibration (IACHEC), adapts an existing pulsar solution to arbitrary JPL ephemerides and source positions by simulating geocentric TOAs and refitting timing models (implemented with PINT). We validate the procedure and apply it to thousands of observations of the Crab pulsar from 15 missions spanning 1996--2025, demonstrating inter-ephemeris TOA consistency at the $\lesssim5 \microsec$ level, using the DE200/FK5-based Jodrell Bank Monthly Ephemeris as a common reference. We release the TOAExtractor open-source tool and a TOA database to support future calibration and scientific studies. Instrument timing performance is broadly consistent with mission specifications; the X-ray-to-radio phase offset varies with energy and time at a level that is marginally consistent with the uncertainties of the radio ephemeris, motivating coordinated multiwavelength follow-up.</description>

      <title>A General Framework for the Spontaneous Scalarization of Regular Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01544v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the spontaneous scalarization of generic, static, and spherically symmetric regular black holes supported by nonlinear electrodynamics. Starting from an arbitrary seed metric, we employ the P-dual formalism to reconstruct the electromagnetic sector and subsequently couple a real scalar field nonminimally. As a worked example, we apply the framework to the regular Balart-Vagenas black hole, showing that scalarized and scalar-free branches can coexist in a region where the scalarized configurations are entropically preferred. We further assess possible observational imprints, finding percent-level deviations in both the shadow size and the fundamental scalar quasi-normal modes ($&lt; 10\%$ for small charge-to-mass ratios), indicating that current electromagnetic and gravitational-wave observations do not rule out these solutions. Our construction thus provides a general route to explore scalarization on top of nonlinear-electrodynamics-supported spacetimes, extending beyond specific Reissner-Nordstr\"om-like cases.</description>

      <title>Large-Scale Calculations of $\beta$-Decay Rates and Implications for $r$-Process Nucleosynthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02999v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nuclear $\beta$ decay is a key element of the astrophysical rapid neutron capture process ($r$-process). In this paper, we present state-of-the-art global $\beta$-decay calculations based on the quantified relativistic nuclear energy density functional theory and the deformed proton-neutron quasiparticle random-phase approximation. Our analysis considers contributions from allowed and first-forbidden transitions. We used two point-coupling functionals with carefully calibrated time-odd terms and isoscalar pairing strength. The new calculations display consistent results for both employed functionals, especially near the neutron drip line, suggesting slower $\beta$ decays past the $N=126$ neutron shell closure than in commonly used $\beta$-decay models. The new rates, along with the existing rates based on the latest non-relativistic calculations, are found to slow down the synthesis of heavy elements in the $r$-process and significantly reduce the contribution of neutron-induced fission.</description>
