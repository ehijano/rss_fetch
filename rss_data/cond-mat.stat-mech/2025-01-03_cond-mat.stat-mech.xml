      <title>Measurement-Induced Phase Transition in State Estimation of Chaotic Systems and the Directed Polymer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a solvable model of a measurement-induced phase transition (MIPT) in a deterministic but chaotic dynamical system with a positive Lyapunov exponent. In this setup, an observer only has a probabilistic description of the system but mitigates chaos-induced uncertainty through repeated measurements. Using a minimal representation via a branching tree, we map this problem to the directed polymer (DP) model on the Cayley tree, although in a regime dominated by rare events. By studying the Shannon entropy of the probability distribution estimated by the observer, we demonstrate a phase transition distinguishing a chaotic phase with reduced Lyapunov exponent from a strong-measurement phase where uncertainty remains bounded. Remarkably, the location of the MIPT transition coincides with the freezing transition of the DP, although the critical properties differ. We provide an exact universal scaling function describing entropy growth in the critical regime. Numerical simulations confirm our theoretical predictions, highlighting a simple yet powerful framework to explore measurement-induced transitions in classical chaotic systems.</description>

      <title>Spatial Correlation Unifies Nonequilibrium Response Theory for Arbitrary Markov Jump Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how systems respond to external perturbations is a fundamental challenge in physics, particularly for non-equilibrium and non-stationary processes. The fluctuation-dissipation theorem provides a complete framework for near-equilibrium systems, and various bounds are recently reported for specific non-equilibrium regimes. Here, we present an exact response equality for arbitrary Markov processes that decompose system response into spatial correlations of local dynamical events. This decomposition reveals that response properties are encoded in correlations between transitions and dwelling times across the network, providing a natural generalization of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem to generic non-equilibrium processes. Our theory unifies existing response bounds, extends them to time-dependent processes, and reveals fundamental monotonicity properties of the tightness of multi-parameter response inequalities. Beyond its theoretical significance, this framework enables efficient numerical evaluation of response properties from unperturbed trajectory data, offering practical advantages for studying complex networks and biological systems far from equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Fluctuations of topological charges in two-dimensional classical Heisenberg model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Binding and unbinding of vortices drives Kosterlitz-Thouless phase transition in two-dimensional XY model. Here we investigate whether similar mechanism works in two-dimensional Heisenberg model, by using the fluctuation of the topological charge inside a loop to characterize the nature of binding versus unbinding of defects. Through Monte Carlo simulations, we find that the fluctuation is proportional to the perimeter of the loop at low temperatures while to the area of the loop at high temperatures, implying binding of the defects at low temperatures and unbinding at high temperatures.</description>

      <title>Is there Kibble-Zurek scaling of topological defects in first-order phase transitions?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kibble-Zurek scaling is the scaling of the density of the topological defects formed via the Kibble-Zurek mechanism with respect to the rate at which a system is cooled across a continuous phase transition. Recently, the density of the topological defects formed via the Kibble-Zurek mechanism was computed for a system cooled through a first-order phase transition instead of the usual continuous transitions. Here we address the problem of whether such defects generated across a first-order phase transition exhibit Kibble-Zurek scaling similar to the case in continuous phase transitions. We show that any possible Kibble-Zurek scaling for the topological defects can only be a very rough approximation due to an intrinsic field for the scaling. However, complete universal scaling for other properties does exist.</description>

      <title>Tensor network method for solving the Ising model with a magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the two-dimensional square lattice Ising ferromagnet and antiferromagnet with a magnetic field by using tensor network method. Focusing on the role of guage fixing, we present the partition function in terms of a tensor network. The tensor has a different symmetry property for ferromagnets and antiferromagnets. The tensor network of the partition function is interpreted as a multiple product of the one-dimensional quantum Hamiltonian. We perform infinite density matrix renormalization group to contract the two-dimensional tensor network. We present the numerical result of magnetization and entanglement entropy for the Ising ferromagnet and antiferromagnet side by side. In order to determine the critical line in the parameter space of temperature and magnetic field, we use the half-chain entanglement entropy of the one-dimensional quantum state. The entanglement entropy precisely indicates the critical line forming the parabolic shape for the antiferromagnetic case, but shows the critical point for the ferromagnetic case.</description>

      <title>Partial versus total resetting for L\'evy flights in d dimensions: similarities and discrepancies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While stochastic resetting (or total resetting) is less young and more established concept in stochastic processes, partial stochastic resetting (PSR) is a relatively new field. PSR means that, at random moments in time, a stochastic process gets multiplied by a factor between 0 and 1, thus approaching but not reaching the resetting position. In this paper, we present new results on PSR highlighting the main similarities and discrepancies with total resetting. Specifically, we consider both symmetric $\alpha$-stable L\'evy processes (L\'evy flights) and Brownian motion with PSR in arbitrary d dimensions. We derive explicit expressions for the propagator and its stationary measure, and discuss in detail their asymptotic behavior. Interestingly, while approaching to stationarity, a dynamical phase transition occurs for the Brownian motion, but not for L\'evy flights. We also analyze the behavior of the process around the resetting position and find significant differences between PSR and total resetting.</description>

      <title>Characteristic oscillations in frequency-resolved heat dissipation of linear time-delayed Langevin systems: Approach from the violation of the fluctuation-dissipation relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-delayed effects are widely present in nature, often accompanied by distinctive nonequilibrium features such as negative apparent heat dissipation. To elucidate detailed structures of the dissipation, we study the frequency decompositions of the heat dissipation in linear time-delayed Langevin systems. We analytically solve Langevin equations with a single linear time-delayed feedback force and calculate the spectrum of the heat dissipation in the frequency domain using the Harada-Sasa equality, which relates the heat dissipation to the violation of the fluctuation-dissipation relation (FDR). We find a characteristic oscillatory behavior in the spectrum, which asymptotically oscillates sinusoidally with a decaying envelope proportional to the strength of the time-delayed force and the inverse of the frequency. We confirm the generality of the results by extending our analysis to systems with multiple delay times and continuously distributed delay times. Since the violation of FDR is experimentally accessible, our results suggest an experimental direction for detecting and analyzing detailed characteristics of dissipation in time-delayed systems.</description>

      <title>Sample shape dependence of magnetic noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zero-field magnetic noise, characterised by the magnetic autocorrelation function $S_s(t)$, has been observed, perhaps surprisingly, to depend on sample shape $s$. The reasons for this are identified and general expressions are derived that relate the autocorrelation functions for systems of different shape to an underlying `intrinsic' form. Assuming the flcutuatiopn-dissipation theorem, it is shown that, for any noise that relaxes monotonically, the effect of sample shape is to reduce both the noise amplitude and mean relaxation time by a factor of $1+N\chi_i$, where $N$ is the demagnetizing factor and $\chi_i$ the intrinsic susceptibility. In frequency space, where $S_s(t)$ Fourier transforms into the power spectrum $S_s(\omega)$, the above two factors combine to suppress the zero frequency amplitude of $S_s(\omega)$ by $(1+N\chi_i)^2$, while at high frequency, sample shape dependence becomes negligible. These results suggest simple and robust experimental tests of the fluctuation--dissipation theorem in magnetic systems that may be useful in distinguishing bulk from surface effects.</description>

      <title>Average mutual information for random fermionic Gaussian quantum states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Studying the typical entanglement entropy of a bipartite system when averaging over different ensembles of pure quantum states has been instrumental in different areas of physics, ranging from many-body quantum chaos to black hole evaporation. We extend such analysis to open quantum systems and mixed states, where we compute the typical mutual information in a bipartite system averaged over the ensemble of mixed Gaussian states with a fixed spectrum. Tools from random matrix theory and determinantal point processes allow us to compute arbitrary k-point correlation functions of the singular values of the corresponding complex structure in a subsystem for a given spectrum in the full system. In particular, we evaluate the average von Neumann entropy in a subsystem based on the level density and the average mutual information. Those results are given for finite system size as well as in the thermodynamic limit.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamics without Boost-Invariance from Kinetic Theory: From Perfect Fluids to Active Flocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive the hydrodynamic equations of perfect fluids without boost invariance [1] from kinetic theory. Our approach is to follow the standard derivation of the Vlasov hierarchy based on an a-priori unknown collision functional satisfying certain axiomatic properties consistent with the absence of boost invariance. The kinetic theory treatment allows us to identify various transport coefficients in the hydrodynamic regime. We identify a drift term that effects a relaxation to an equilibrium where detailed balance with the environment with respect to momentum transfer is obtained. We then show how the derivative expansion of the hydrodynamics of flocks can be recovered from boost non-invariant kinetic theory and hydrodynamics. We identify how various coefficients of the former relate to a parameterization of the so-called equation of kinetic state that yields relations between different coefficients, arriving at a symmetry-based understanding as to why certain coefficients in hydrodynamic descriptions of active flocks are naturally of order one, and others, naturally small. When inter-particle forces are expressed in terms of a kinetic theory influence kernel, a coarse-graining scale and resulting derivative expansion emerge in the hydrodynamic limit, allowing us to derive diffusion terms as infrared-relevant operators distilling different parameterizations of microscopic interactions. We conclude by highlighting possible applications.</description>

      <title>Community detection by simulated bifurcation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Community detection, also known as graph partitioning, is a well-known NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem with applications in diverse fields such as complex network theory, transportation, and smart power grids. The problem's solution space grows drastically with the number of vertices and subgroups, making efficient algorithms crucial. In recent years, quantum computing has emerged as a promising approach to tackling NP-hard problems. This study explores the use of a quantum-inspired algorithm, Simulated Bifurcation (SB), for community detection. Modularity is employed as both the objective function and a metric to evaluate the solutions. The community detection problem is formulated as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem, enabling seamless integration with the SB algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate that SB effectively identifies community structures in benchmark networks such as Zachary's Karate Club and the IEEE 33-bus system. Remarkably, SB achieved the highest modularity, matching the performance of Fujitsu's Digital Annealer, while surpassing results obtained from two quantum machines, D-Wave and IBM. These findings highlight the potential of Simulated Bifurcation as a powerful tool for solving community detection problems.</description>

      <title>Moments and saddles of heavy CFT correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the operator product expansion (OPE) of identical scalars in a conformal four-point correlator as a Stieltjes moment problem, and use Riemann-Liouville type fractional differential operators to transform the correlation function into a classical moment-generating function. We use crossing symmetry to derive leading and subleading relations between moments in $\Delta$ and $J_2 = \ell(\ell+d-2)$ in the ``heavy" limit of large external scaling dimension, and combine them with constraints from unitarity to derive two-sided bounds on moment sequences in $\Delta$ and the covariance between $\Delta$ and $J_2$. The moment sequences which saturate these bounds produce ``saddle point" solutions to the crossing equations which we identify as particular limits of correlators in a generalized free field (GFF) theory. This motivates us to study perturbations of heavy GFF four-point correlators by way of saddle point analysis, and we show that saddles in the OPE arise from contributions of fixed-length operator families encoded by a decomposition into deformed higher-spin conformal blocks. To apply our techniques, we consider holographic correlators of four identical single scalar fields perturbed by a bulk interaction, and use their first few moments to derive Gaussian weight-interpolating functions that predict the OPE coefficients of interacting double-twist operators in the heavy limit. We further compute tree-level perturbations on saddles in 1/2 BPS Wilson line defect correlators in planar $\mathcal{N} = 4$ SYM, making predictions about deformations of families of long operators.</description>

      <title>Towards the BBGKY hierarchy: a scheme beyond the Boltzmann equation and application to a weakly confined QCD gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In classical kinetic theory, the BBGKY hierarchy is an infinite chain of integro-differential equations that describes the full time-reversal-invariant (Liouville) system of interacting (quasi)-particles in terms of $N$-particle distribution functions. In this work, instead of truncating the hierarchy at the lowest level, as is done by the Boltzmann equation, we develop a scheme similar to the relaxation time approximation that is in principle able to account for the entire chain of equations. We then explicitly investigate its truncation at the second level of the BBGKY hierarchy and, within this scheme, study the spectra of conserved operator correlation functions in a gas of weakly confined hadrons. We also discuss how these higher levels account for parts of the operator spectra `deeper in the ultra-violet regime' and compare them to known results derived from the holographic duality.</description>

      <title>On the Wiedemann-Franz law violation in Graphene and quark-gluon plasma systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A comparative study of the thermodynamic and transport properties of the ultra-relativistic quark-gluon plasma (QGP) produced in Heavy ion collisions (HIC) with the "quasi-relativistic" massless electron-hole plasma in graphene sample has been performed. We observe that the enthalpy per net carrier density emerges as a useful physical quantity determining the hydrodynamic domain's transport variables. Lorenz ratio is defined as thermal to electrical conductivity ratio, normalized by temperature. In searching whether the Wiedemann-Franz (WF) law is obeyed or violated by checking the Lorenz ratio as one or deviated from one, we find that the Lorenz ratio determined from the fluid-based framework will always be responsible for the violation of the WF law. The reason is the proportional relation between Lorenz ratio and enthalpy per particle in the fluid. Based on the experimental observation, graphene, and QGP, both systems at low net charge density, exhibit WF law violation due to their fluid nature. However, graphene at high net charge density obeys the WF law, followed by metals with high Fermi energy or density. It indicates a fluid to the non-fluid transition of the graphene system from low to high-density domain. In this regard, the fluid or non-fluid aspect of QGP at high density is yet to be explored by future facilities like Compressed Baryonic matter (CBM) and Nuclotron-based Ion Collider fAcility (NICA) experiments.</description>

      <title>Quantum many-body dynamics for fermionic t-J model simulated with atom arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The fermionic t-J model has been widely recognized as a canonical model in understanding various strongly correlated phases like cuprate high-Tc superconductivity. Simulating this model with controllable quantum platforms offers new possibilities to probe high-Tc physics, yet suffering challenges. Here we propose a novel scheme to realize the t-J model in a programmable Rydberg-dressed tweezer array. By properly engineering the Rydberg-dressed dipole-dipole interaction and inter-tweezer couplings, a highly tunable fermionic t-J model with next-nearest-neighbour hopping terms is achieved. We particularly explore quantum many-body dynamics in the large J/t limit, a regime far beyond the conventional optical lattices and cuprates. Notably, we predict a nontrivial self-pinning effect enforced by local quantum entanglement that characterizes a novel type of Hilbert space fragmentation. This effect leads to the breakdown of Krylov restricted thermalization. Our prediction opens a new horizon in exploring exotic quantum many-body dynamics with t-J model in tweezer arrays, and shall also make a step towards simulating the high-Tc physics in cold atom systems.</description>

      <title>Extended Landauer-B\"{u}ttiker Formula for Current through Open Quantum Systems with Gain or Loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Landauer-B\"{u}ttiker formula, which characterizes the current flowing through a finite region connected to leads, has significantly advanced our understanding of transport. We extend this formula to describe particle and energy currents with gain or loss in the intermediate region by using the Lindblad-Keldysh formalism. Based on the derived formula, several novel effects induced by gain or loss in the current are discussed: the breaking of inversion symmetry in the gain and loss terms or in the system can lead to current generation; the anomalous phenomenon that disorder can induce current generation; the presence of gain and loss makes the thermal and electrical conductances continuous and ensures they follow the Wiedemann-Franz law even outside the energy band; the effect of bond loss-induced skin effect on current. This work deepens and extends our understanding of transport phenomena in open systems.</description>

      <title>Robustness of quantum many-body scars in the presence of Markovian bath</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A generic closed quantum many-body system will inevitably tend to thermalization, whose local information encoded in the initial state eventually scrambles into the full space, known as quantum ergodicity. A paradigmatic exception in closed quantum systems for strong ergodicity breaking is known as many-body localization, where strong disorder-induced localization prevents the occurrence of thermalization. It is generally recognized that a localized quantum system would be delocalized under dissipation induced by the environment. However, this consequence recently has received challenges where an exotic dissipation-induced localization mechanism is proposed, and transitions between localized and extended phases are found. In this Letter, we promote this mechanism to systems for weak ergodicity breaking hosting quantum many-body scars (QMBS). We find that the system relaxes to a steady state dominated by QMBS, and the dissipative dynamics exhibit dynamic revivals by suitably preparing an initial state. We point out an experimental realization of the controlled dissipation with a cold atomic setup. This makes the signature of ergodicity breaking visible over dissipative dynamics and offers potential possibilities for experimentally preparing stable QMBS with associated coherent dynamics.</description>

      <title>Critical Dynamics and Cyclic Memory Retrieval in Non-reciprocal Hopfield Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study Hopfield networks with non-reciprocal coupling inducing switches between memory patterns. Dynamical phase transitions occur between phases of no memory retrieval, retrieval of multiple point-attractors, and limit-cycle attractors. The limit cycle phase is bounded by two critical regions: a Hopf bifurcation line and a fold bifurcation line, each with unique dynamical critical exponents and sensitivity to perturbations. A Master Equation approach numerically verifies the critical behavior predicted analytically. We discuss how these networks could model biological processes near a critical threshold of cyclic instability evolving through multi-step transitions.</description>

      <title>Momentum tunnelling between nanoscale liquid flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The world of nanoscales in fluidics is the frontier where the continuum of fluid mechanics meets the atomic, and even quantum, nature of matter. While water dynamics remains largely classical under extreme confinement, several experiments have recently reported coupling between water transport and the electronic degrees of freedom of the confining materials. This avenue prompts us to reconsider nanoscale hydrodynamic flows under the perspective of interacting excitations, akin to condensed matter frameworks. Here we show, using a combination of many-body theory and molecular simulations, that the flow of a liquid can induce the flow of another liquid behind a separating wall, at odds with the prediction of continuum hydrodynamics. We further show that the range of this 'flow tunnelling' can be tuned through the solid's electronic excitations, with a maximum occurring when these are at resonance with the liquid's charge density fluctuations. Flow tunnelling is expected to play a role in global transport across nanoscale fluidic networks, such as lamellar graphene oxide or MXene membranes. It further suggests exploiting the electronic properties of the confining walls for manipulating liquids via their dielectric spectra, beyond the nature and characteristics of individual molecules.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The structural properties of packed soft-core particles provide a platform to understand the cross-pollinated physical concepts in solid-state- and soft-matter physics. Confined on spherical surface, the traditional differential geometry also dictates the overall defect properties in otherwise regular crystal lattices. Using molecular dynamics simulation of the Hertzian model as a tool, we report here the emergence of new types of disclination patterns: domain and counter-domain defects, when hexagonal and square patterns coexist. A new angle is presented to understand the incompatibility between tiling lattice shapes and the available spherical areal shapes, which is common in nature -- from molecular systems in biology to backbone construction in architectures.</description>

      <title>Slow dissipation and spreading in disordered classical systems: A direct comparison between numerics and mathematical bounds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.10572v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the breakdown of Anderson localization in the one-dimensional nonlinear Klein-Gordon chain, a prototypical example of a disordered classical many-body system. A series of numerical works indicate that an initially localized wave packet spreads polynomially in time, while analytical studies rather suggest a much slower spreading. Here, we focus on the decorrelation time in equilibrium. On the one hand, we provide a mathematical theorem establishing that this time is larger than any inverse power law in the effective anharmonicity parameter $\lambda$, and on the other hand our numerics show that it follows a power law for a broad range of values of $\lambda$. This numerical behavior is fully consistent with the power law observed numerically in spreading experiments, and we conclude that the state-of-the-art numerics may well be unable to capture the long-time behavior of such classical disordered systems.</description>

      <title>The Influence of Fractional Derivatives on Thermodynamic Properties by Studying the CPSEHP Interaction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.05508v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The parametric Nikiforov-Uvarov (N-U) method is employed in conjunction with a generalized fractional derivative (GFD) to investigate the energy eigenvalues and the total normalized wave function associated with the Coulomb plus screened exponential hyperbolic potential (CPSEHP) in terms of Jacobi polynomials. This potential exhibits maximum effectiveness at lower values of the screening parameter. To explore the thermal and superstatistical characteristics, the derived energy eigenvalues are directly incorporated into the partition function (Z) and subsequently used to determine other thermodynamic quantities, including vibrational mean energy (U), specific heat capacity (C), entropy (S), and free energy (F). Comparisons with previous studies are conducted. The classical case is recovered from the fractional case by setting alpha = beta = 1, consistent with prior work. Our results demonstrate that the fractional parameter plays a crucial role in governing the thermal and superstatistical properties within the framework of this model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01978v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The entropy production is commonly interpreted as measuring the distance from equilibrium. However, this explanation lacks a rigorous description due to the absence of a natural equilibrium measure. The present analysis formalizes this interpretation by expressing the entropy production of a Markov system as a divergence with respect to particular equilibrium dynamics. These equilibrium dynamics correspond to the closest reversible systems in the information-theoretic sense. This result yields new lower bounds for the entropy production and novel links between thermodynamics and information geometry.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal Patterns in Active Four-State Potts Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13962v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many types of spatiotemporal patterns have been observed under nonequilibrium conditions. Cycling through four or more states can provide specific dynamics, such as the spatial coexistence of multiple phases. However, transient dynamics have only been studied by previous theoretical models, since absorbing transition into a uniform phase covered by a single state occurs in the long-time limit. Here, we reported steady long-term dynamics using cyclic Potts models, wherein nucleation and growth play essential roles. Under the cyclic symmetry of the four states, the cyclic changes in the dominant phases and the spatial coexistence of the four phases are obtained at low and high flipping energies, respectively. Under asymmetric conditions, the spatial coexistence of two diagonal phases appears in addition to non-cyclic one-phase modes. The circular domains of the diagonal state are formed by the nucleation of other states, and they slowly shrink to reduce the domain boundary. When three-state cycling is added, competition between the two cycling modes changes the spatiotemporal patterns.</description>

Abstract: We consider systems of fermions evolved by non-interacting unitary circuits with correlated on-site potentials. When these potentials are drawn from the eigenvalue distribution of a circular random matrix ensemble, the single-particle sector exhibits chaotic dynamics. We study the corresponding many-body spectral statistics and show that the spectral form factor (SFF) can be computed \textit{exactly}. Due to the absence of interactions the SFF grows exponentially in time, a result which we demonstrate through simple arguments, scaling collapses, and closed-form evaluation of the SFF. We study the role of interactions by numerically analyzing a kicked Ising model and find that the SFF crosses over to a linear growth regime consistent with many-body random matrix universality. Our exact results for the SFF provide a baseline for future studies of the crossover between single-particle and many-body random matrix behavior.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08269v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The spectral form factor (SFF) is a powerful diagnostic of random matrix behavior in quantum many-body systems. We introduce a family of random circuit ensembles whose SFFs can be computed \textit{exactly}. These ensembles describe the evolution of non-interacting fermions in the presence of correlated on-site potentials drawn from the eigenvalue distribution of a circular ensemble. For disorder parameters drawn from the circular unitary ensemble (CUE), we derive an exact closed form for the SFF, valid for any choice of system size $L$ and integer time $t$. When the disorder is drawn from the circular orthogonal or symplectic ensembles (COE and CSE, respectively), we carry out the disorder averages analytically and reduce the computation of the SFF at integer times to a combinatorial problem amenable to transfer matrix methods. In each of these cases the SFF grows exponentially in time, which we argue is a signature of random matrix universality at the single-particle level. Finally, we develop matchgate circuit representations of our circuit ensembles, enabling their experimental realization in quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Endo-reversible Carnot engine: Extending the Yvon engine</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13925v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A famous paper [Am. J. Phys. 43, 22 (1975)] unveiled the efficiency at maximum power (EMP) of the endo-reversible Carnot heat engine, now commonly referred to as the Curzon-Ahlborn (CA) engine, pioneering finite-time thermodynamics. Historically, despite the significance of the CA engine, similar findings had emerged at an earlier time, such as the Yvon engine proposed by J. Yvon in 1955 sharing the exact same EMP. However, the special setup of the Yvon engine has circumscribed its broader influence. This paper extends the Yvon engine model to achieve a level of generality comparable to that of the CA engine. A rigorous comparison reveals that the extended Yvon engine and CA engine represent the steady-state and cyclic forms of the endo-reversible Carnot heat engine, respectively, and are equivalent. Our work provides a pedagogical example for the teaching of thermodynamics and engineering thermodynamics, given that the simple and lucid derivation of the extended Yvon engine helps students initiate their understanding of non-equilibrium thermodynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14011v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chemical affinities are responsible for driving active matter systems out of equilibrium. At the nano-scale, molecular machines interact with the surrounding environment and are subjected to external forces. The mechano-chemical coupling which arises naturally in these systems reveals a complex interplay between chemical and mechanical degrees of freedom with strong impact on their active mechanism. By considering various models far from equilibrium, we show that the tuning of applied forces give rise to a nonlinear response that causes a non-monotonic behaviour in the machines' activity. Our findings have implications in understanding, designing, and triggering such processes by controlled application of external fields, including the collective dynamics of larger non-equilibrium systems where the total dissipation and performance might be affected by internal and inter-particle interactions.</description>

      <title>Universal Upper Bound on Ergotropy and No-Go Theorem by the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11112v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the maximum extractable work (ergotropy) from a quantum many-body system is constrained by local athermality of an initial state and local entropy decrease brought about by quantum operations. The obtained universal upper bound on ergotropy implies that the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis prohibits work extraction from energy eigenstates by means of finite-time unitary operations. This no-go property implies that Planck's principle, a form of the second law of thermodynamics, holds even for pure quantum states. Our result bridges two independently studied concepts of quantum thermodynamics, the second law and thermalization, via intrasystem correlations in many-body systems as a resource for work extraction.</description>

Abstract: We initiate a novel application of the quantum-inverse scattering method for the 20-vertex model, building upon seminal work from Faddeev and Takhtajan on the study of Hamiltonian systems, with applications to crossing probabilities, 3D Poisson structure, triangular height functions, and integrability. In comparison to a previous work of the author in late $2023$ which characterized integrability of a Hamiltonian flow for the 6-vertex model from integrability of inhomogeneous limit shapes, formalized in a work of Keating, Reshetikhin and Sridhar, notions similar to those of integrability can be realized for the 20-vertex model by studying new classes of higher-dimensional L-operators. In comparison to two-dimensional L-operators expressed in terms of Pauli basis elements, three-dimensional L-operators provided by Boos and colleagues have algebraic, combinatorial, and geometric, qualities, all of which impact leading order approximations of correlations, products of L-operators, the transfer matrix, and the quantum monodromy matrix in finite volume. In comparison to the inhomogeneous 6-vertex model, the 20-vertex model does not enjoy as strong of an integrability property through the existence of suitable action-angle variables, which is of interest to further explore, possibly from information on limit shapes given solutions to the three-dimensional Euler-Lagrange equations.</description>

      <title>Higher-order triadic percolation on random hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14213v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a comprehensive theoretical framework combining percolation theory with nonlinear dynamics in order to study hypergraphs with a time-varying giant component. We consider in particular hypergraphs with higher-order triadic interactions that can upregulate or downregulate the hyperedges. Triadic interactions are a general type of signed regulatory interaction that occurs when a third node regulates the interaction between two other nodes. For example, in brain networks, the glia can facilitate or inhibit synaptic interactions between neurons. However, the regulatory interactions may not only occur between regulator nodes and pairwise interactions but also between regulator nodes and higher-order interactions (hyperedges), leading to higher-order triadic interactions. For instance, in biochemical reaction networks, the enzymes regulate the reactions involving multiple reactants. Here we propose and investigate higher-order triadic percolation on hypergraphs showing that the giant component can have a non-trivial dynamics. Specifically, we demonstrate that, under suitable conditions, the order parameter of this percolation problem, i.e., the fraction of nodes in the giant component, undergoes a route to chaos in the universality class of the logistic map. In hierarchical higher-order triadic percolation, we extend this paradigm in order to treat hierarchically nested triadic interactions demonstrating the non-trivial effect of their increased combinatorial complexity on the critical phenomena and the dynamical properties of the process. Finally, we consider other generalizations of the model studying the effect of considering interdependencies and node regulation instead of hyperedge regulation.</description>

      <title>Temperature mediated back-action in micro- and nanomechanical resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20063v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the thermally induced back-action effects in absorption-sensitive micro- and nanomechanical resonators. We propose a unified approach, enabling to simultaneously address both the effective dynamics and non-equilibrium phononic state, depending on the position of a punctual sensing (and heating) probe at the surface of the mechanical device. We present an analytical solution in terms of green functions for a unidimensional resonator whose thermomechanical deformation profile generally follows that of the mechanical losses. In particular, we find that both the dynamics and the mechanical fluctuations strongly depend on the loss distribution. The effect of the quantum fluctuations of the heat source is also discussed. Our approach provides the first steps towards a thorough, general platform for analyzing thermal back-action effects and their consequences, which may be of significance for future development in ultrasensitive nanomechanical research.</description>

      <title>Algebraic classification of Hietarinta's solutions of Yang-Baxter equations~:~invertible $4\times 4$ operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05375v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In order to examine the simulation of integrable quantum systems using quantum computers, it is crucial to first classify Yang-Baxter operators. Hietarinta was among the first to classify constant Yang-Baxter solutions for a two-dimensional local Hilbert space (qubit representation). Including the one produced by the permutation operator, he was able to construct eleven families of invertible solutions. These techniques are effective for 4 by 4 solutions, but they become difficult to use for representations with more dimensions. To get over this limitation, we use algebraic ans\"{a}tze to generate the constant Yang-Baxter solutions in a representation independent way. We employ four distinct algebraic structures that, depending on the qubit representation, replicate 10 of the 11 Hietarinta families. Among the techniques are partition algebras, Clifford algebras, Temperley-Lieb algebras, and a collection of commuting operators. Using these techniques, we do not obtain the $(2,2)$ Hietarinta class.</description>
