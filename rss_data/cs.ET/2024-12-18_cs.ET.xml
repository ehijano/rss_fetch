      <title>Investigating the Effect of Electrical and Thermal Transport Properties on Oxide-Based Memristors Performance and Reliability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving reliable resistive switching in oxide-based memristive devices requires precise control over conductive filament (CF) formation and behavior, yet the fundamental relationship between oxide material properties and switching uniformity remains incompletely understood. Here, we develop a comprehensive physical model to investigate how electrical and thermal conductivities influence CF dynamics in TaOx-based memristors. Our simulations reveal that higher electrical conductivity promotes oxygen vacancy generation and reduces forming voltage, while higher thermal conductivity enhances heat dissipation, leading to increased forming voltage. The uniformity of resistive switching is strongly dependent on the interplay between these transport properties. We identify two distinct pathways for achieving optimal High Resistance State (HRS) uniformity with standard deviation-to-mean ratios as low as 0.045, each governed by different balances of electrical and thermal transport mechanisms. For the Low Resistance State (LRS), high uniformity (0.009) can be maintained when either electrical or thermal conductivity is low. The resistance ratio between HRS and LRS shows a strong dependence on these conductivities, with higher ratios observed at lower conductivity values. These findings provide essential guidelines for material selection in RRAM devices, particularly for applications demanding high reliability and uniform switching characteristics.</description>

      <title>Noise-based Local Learning using Stochastic Magnetic Tunnel Junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brain-inspired learning in physical hardware has enormous potential to learn fast at minimal energy expenditure. One of the characteristics of biological learning systems is their ability to learn in the presence of various noise sources. Inspired by this observation, we introduce a novel noise-based learning approach for physical systems implementing multi-layer neural networks. Simulation results show that our approach allows for effective learning whose performance approaches that of the conventional effective yet energy-costly backpropagation algorithm. Using a spintronics hardware implementation, we demonstrate experimentally that learning can be achieved in a small network composed of physical stochastic magnetic tunnel junctions. These results provide a path towards efficient learning in general physical systems which embraces rather than mitigates the noise inherent in physical devices.</description>

      <title>Evolutionary Optimization for Designing Variational Quantum Circuits with High Model Capacity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in quantum computing (QC) and machine learning (ML) have garnered significant attention, leading to substantial efforts toward the development of quantum machine learning (QML) algorithms to address a variety of complex challenges. The design of high-performance QML models, however, requires expert-level knowledge, posing a significant barrier to the widespread adoption of QML. Key challenges include the design of data encoding mechanisms and parameterized quantum circuits, both of which critically impact the generalization capabilities of QML models. We propose a novel method that encodes quantum circuit architecture information to enable the evolution of quantum circuit designs. In this approach, the fitness function is based on the effective dimension, allowing for the optimization of quantum circuits towards higher model capacity. Through numerical simulations, we demonstrate that the proposed method is capable of discovering variational quantum circuit architectures that offer improved learning capabilities, thereby enhancing the overall performance of QML models for complex tasks.</description>

      <title>A Conceptual Model of Intelligent Multimedia Data Rendered using Flying Light Specks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A Flying Light Speck, FLS, is a miniature sized drone configured with light sources to illuminate 3D multimedia objects in a fixed volume, an FLS display. A swarm of FLSs may provide haptic interactions by exerting force back at a user's touch. This paper presents a conceptual model for the multimedia data to enable content-based queries. The model empowers users of an FLS display to annotate the illuminations by adding semantics to the data, extending a multimedia repository with information and knowledge. We present a core conceptual model and demonstrate its extensions for two diverse applications, authoring tools with entertainment and MRI scans with healthcare.</description>

      <title>Future Aspects in Human Action Recognition: Exploring Emerging Techniques and Ethical Influences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Visual-based human action recognition can be found in various application fields, e.g., surveillance systems, sports analytics, medical assistive technologies, or human-robot interaction frameworks, and it concerns the identification and classification of individuals' activities within a video. Since actions typically occur over a sequence of consecutive images, it is particularly challenging due to the inclusion of temporal analysis, which introduces an extra layer of complexity. However, although multiple approaches try to handle temporal analysis, there are still difficulties because of their computational cost and lack of adaptability. Therefore, different types of vision data, containing transition information between consecutive images, provided by next-generation hardware sensors will guide the robotics community in tackling the problem of human action recognition. On the other hand, while there is a plethora of still-image datasets, that researchers can adopt to train new artificial intelligence models, videos representing human activities are of limited capabilities, e.g., small and unbalanced datasets or selected without control from multiple sources. To this end, generating new and realistic synthetic videos is possible since labeling is performed throughout the data creation process, while reinforcement learning techniques can permit the avoidance of considerable dataset dependence. At the same time, human factors' involvement raises ethical issues for the research community, as doubts and concerns about new technologies already exist.</description>

      <title>Flight Patterns for Swarms of Drones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present flight patterns for a collision-free passage of swarms of drones through one or more openings. The narrow openings provide drones with access to an infrastructure component such as charging stations to charge their depleted batteries and hangars for storage. The flight patterns are a staging area (queues) that match the rate at which an infrastructure component and its openings process drones. They prevent collisions and may implement different policies that control the order in which drones pass through an opening. We illustrate the flight patterns with a 3D display that uses drones configured with light sources to illuminate shapes.</description>

      <title>Solving rescheduling problems in heterogeneous urban railway networks using hybrid quantum-classical approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.06763v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the applicability of hybrid quantum-classical heuristics for practical railway rescheduling management problems. We build an integer linear programming model and solve it with D-Wave's quantum-classical hybrid solver as well as with CPLEX for comparison. The proposed approach is demonstrated on a real-life heterogeneous urban network in Poland, including both single- and multi-track segments. All the requirements posed by the operator of the network are modeled. The computational results demonstrate the readiness for application and benefits of quantum-classical hybrid solvers in the realistic railway scenario: they yield acceptable solutions on time, which is a critical requirement in a rescheduling situation. In particular, CQM as a probabilistic heuristic solver provides a number of feasible, close-to-optimal solutions the dispatcher can choose from.</description>

      <title>Chatbots im Schulunterricht: Wir testen das Fobizz-Tool zur automatischen Bewertung von Hausaufgaben</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06651v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: [Study in German language.] This study examines the AI-powered grading tool "AI Grading Assistant" by the German company Fobizz, designed to support teachers in evaluating and providing feedback on student assignments. Against the societal backdrop of an overburdened education system and rising expectations for artificial intelligence as a solution to these challenges, the investigation evaluates the tool's functional suitability through two test series. The results reveal significant shortcomings: The tool's numerical grades and qualitative feedback are often random and do not improve even when its suggestions are incorporated. The highest ratings are achievable only with texts generated by ChatGPT. False claims and nonsensical submissions frequently go undetected, while the implementation of some grading criteria is unreliable and opaque. Since these deficiencies stem from the inherent limitations of large language models (LLMs), fundamental improvements to this or similar tools are not immediately foreseeable. The study critiques the broader trend of adopting AI as a quick fix for systemic problems in education, concluding that Fobizz's marketing of the tool as an objective and time-saving solution is misleading and irresponsible. Finally, the study calls for systematic evaluation and subject-specific pedagogical scrutiny of the use of AI tools in educational contexts.</description>
