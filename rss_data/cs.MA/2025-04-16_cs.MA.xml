      <title>COMBO: Compositional World Models for Embodied Multi-Agent Cooperation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10775v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the problem of embodied multi-agent cooperation, where decentralized agents must cooperate given only egocentric views of the world. To effectively plan in this setting, in contrast to learning world dynamics in a single-agent scenario, we must simulate world dynamics conditioned on an arbitrary number of agents' actions given only partial egocentric visual observations of the world. To address this issue of partial observability, we first train generative models to estimate the overall world state given partial egocentric observations. To enable accurate simulation of multiple sets of actions on this world state, we then propose to learn a compositional world model for multi-agent cooperation by factorizing the naturally composable joint actions of multiple agents and compositionally generating the video conditioned on the world state. By leveraging this compositional world model, in combination with Vision Language Models to infer the actions of other agents, we can use a tree search procedure to integrate these modules and facilitate online cooperative planning. We evaluate our methods on three challenging benchmarks with 2-4 agents. The results show our compositional world model is effective and the framework enables the embodied agents to cooperate efficiently with different agents across various tasks and an arbitrary number of agents, showing the promising future of our proposed methods.

      <title>Enhancing LLMs for Power System Simulations: A Feedback-driven Multi-agent Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16707v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The integration of experimental technologies with large language models (LLMs) is transforming scientific research. It positions AI as a versatile research assistant rather than a mere problem-solving tool. In the field of power systems, however, managing simulations -- one of the essential experimental technologies -- remains a challenge for LLMs due to their limited domain-specific knowledge, restricted reasoning capabilities, and imprecise handling of simulation parameters. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a feedback-driven, multi-agent framework. It incorporates three proposed modules: an enhanced retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) module, an improved reasoning module, and a dynamic environmental acting module with an error-feedback mechanism. Validated on 69 diverse tasks from Daline and MATPOWER, this framework achieves success rates of 93.13% and 96.85%, respectively. It significantly outperforms ChatGPT 4o, o1-preview, and the fine-tuned GPT-4o, which all achieved a success rate lower than 30% on complex tasks. Additionally, the proposed framework also supports rapid, cost-effective task execution, completing each simulation in approximately 30 seconds at an average cost of 0.014 USD for tokens. Overall, this adaptable framework lays a foundation for developing intelligent LLM-based assistants for human researchers, facilitating power system research and beyond.</description>

      <title>Inferring Short-Sightedness in Dynamic Noncooperative Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01017v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dynamic game theory is an increasingly popular tool for modeling multi-agent, e.g. human-robot, interactions. Game-theoretic models presume that each agent wishes to minimize a private cost function that depends on others' actions. These games typically evolve over a fixed time horizon, specifying how far into the future each agent plans. In practical settings, however, decision-makers may vary in foresightedness. We conjecture that quantifying and estimating each agent's foresightedness from online data will enable safer and more efficient interactions with other agents. To this end, we frame this inference problem as an \emph{inverse} dynamic game. We consider a specific parametrization of each agent's objective function that smoothly interpolates myopic and farsighted planning. Games of this form are readily transformed into parametric mixed complementarity problems; we exploit the directional differentiability of solutions to these problems with respect to their hidden parameters to solve for agents' foresightedness. We conduct two types of experiments: one with synthetically generated pedestrian motion at a crosswalk and the other with real-world intersection data involving people walking, biking, and driving vehicles. The results of these experiments demonstrate that explicitly inferring agents' foresightedness enables game-theoretic models to more accurately model agents' behavior. Specifically, our results show 33% more accurate prediction of foresighted behavior on average compared to the baseline in real-world scenarios.</description>
