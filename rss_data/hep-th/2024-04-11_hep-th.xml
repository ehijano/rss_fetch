      <title>Bootstrapping conformal defect operators on a line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a conformal field theory with cubic anisotropic symmetry in presence of a line defect. We compute the correlators of the low lying defect operators using Feynman diagrams and derive explicit expressions for the two, three and four point defect correlators at the cubic fixed point in $4-\epsilon$ dimensions to $O(\epsilon)$. We also compute the defect $g$-function for this setup and demonstrate that this is in agreement with the $g$-theorem, which states that the $g$-function is monotonic under the renormalisation group flow along the defect. Next, we focus on conformal bootstrap techniques to determine the CFT data associated with the defect operators, which is the main objective of the paper. We utilize the framework of crossing symmetric Polyakov bootstrap and compute the averaged CFT data to $O(\epsilon)$ up to a finite number of ambiguities. We unmix the CFT data for the double trace operators at $O(\epsilon)$ and use this to compute the $O(\epsilon^2)$ data. Finally, we study these defect correlators non-perturbatively using numerical methods and isolate them near the free theory limit close to four dimensions.</description>

      <title>On the Symmetry TFT of Yang-Mills-Chern-Simons theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Three-dimensional Yang-Mills-Chern-Simons theory has the peculiar property that its one-form symmetry defects have non-trivial braiding, namely they are charged under the same symmetry they generate, which is then anomalous. This poses a few puzzles in describing the corresponding Symmetry TFT in a four-dimensional bulk. First, the braiding between lines at the boundary seems to be ill-defined when such lines are pulled into the bulk. Second, the Symmetry TFT appears to be too trivial to allow for topological boundary conditions encoding all the different global variants. We show that both of these puzzles can be solved by including endable (tubular) surfaces in the class of bulk topological operators one has to consider. In this way, we are able to reproduce all global variants of the theory, with their symmetries and their anomalies. We check the validity of our proposal also against a top-down holographic realization of the same class of theories.</description>

      <title>Constraining the UV with the electroweak effective action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By considering an arbitrary bare action describing BSM physics, we use the Barvinsky-Vilkovisky resummation to obtain the most general non-local electroweak effective action at second order in the field strength. We also include the contribution of the functional measure to the effective action, which is found to modify the Higgs potential by shifting its vacuum value. The resulting effective action provides one-loop corrections to the $W$ and $Z$ boson masses, ultimately leading to the most general expression for the $\rho$ parameter at one-loop. The functional measure plays a pivotal role as it allows the parameterization of $\rho$ in inverse powers of the scale of new physics, while containing non-local form factors. The comparison of $\rho$ with the latest data leads to several constraints on the UV particle spectra of BSM models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a first principles derivation of the microscopic entropy of a very general class of supersymmetric, rotating and accelerating black holes in AdS$_4$. This is achieved by analysing the large-$N$ limit of the spindle index and completes the construction of the first example of a holographic duality involving supersymmetric field theories defined on orbifolds with conical singularities.</description>

      <title>Quantum Charged Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the framework of braneworld holography, we construct a quantum charged black hole that is localized on a three-dimensional anti-de Sitter brane and incorporates quantum backreaction effects from the boundary field theory. The field on the brane consists of higher curvature gravitation coupled with a nonlinear electromagnetic field, and it does not exhibit conformal symmetry. We also investigate the thermodynamics of these quantum charged black holes from three distinct perspectives: a pure bulk description, where the bulk gravitation interacts with a brane; a brane description, where local dynamical gravitation is subject to quantum backreaction from the dual quantum conformal field; a boundary description, where the degrees of freedom for defect quantum conformal matters are considered. In so doing we obtain doubly holographic formulations of both the first law of thermodynamics and the Smarr (energy) relations.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal modes of a nonsingular spherically symmetric black hole effective model with holonomy corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We calculate the quasinormal modes of a nonsingular spherically symmetric black hole effective model with holonomy corrections. The model is based on quantum corrections inspired by loop quantum gravity. It is covariant and results in a spacetime that is regular everywhere with a parameter-dependent black bounce.
  Perturbations of these black holes due to massless scalar and electromagnetic fields have been previously calculated and some intriguing results were observed. For some modes, the frequency versus minimum-radius parameter trajectories were found to spiral and self-intersect in the complex plane. In addition, the spectrum of overtones has real frequencies that oscillate with increasing overtone number, and may even vanishing for some overtones.
  We have calculated the quasinormal modes for all massless spin perturbations, including spin-1/2, and axial- and polar-gravitational. We find that the trajectory-spirals are restricted to scalar perturbations and observe some interesting overtone behaviour for gravitational perturbations. The amount of isospectrality violation in the gravitational quasinormal mode spectra is also examined.</description>

      <title>Entanglement suppression and low-energy scattering of heavy mesons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently entanglement suppression was proposed to be one possible origin of emergent symmetries. Here we test this conjecture in the context of heavy meson scatterings. The low-energy interactions of $D^{(*)}\bar D^{(*)}$ and $D^{(*)} D^{(*)}$ are closely related to the hadronic molecular candidates $X(3872)$ and $T_{cc}(3875)^+$, respectively, and can be described by a nonrelativistic effective Lagrangian manifesting heavy-quark spin symmetry, which includes only constant contact potentials at leading order. We explore entanglement suppression in a tensor-product framework to treat both the isospin and spin degrees of freedom. Using the $X(3872)$ and $T_{cc}(3875)^+$ as inputs, we find that entanglement suppression indeed leads to an emergent symmetry, namely, a light-quark spin symmetry, and as such the $D^{(*)}\bar D^{(*)}$ or $D^{(*)} D^{(*)}$ interaction strengths for a given total isospin do not depend on the total angular momentum of light (anti)quarks. The $X(3872)$ and $T_{cc}(3875)^+$ are predicted to have five and one isoscalar partner, respectively, while the corresponding partner numbers derived solely from heavy-quark spin symmetry are three and one, respectively. The predictions need to be confronted with experimental data and lattice QCD results to further test the entanglement suppression conjecture.</description>

      <title>Higgs Alignment from Multicritical-Point Principle in Two Higgs Doublet Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In models with non-minimal Higgs sectors, enforcing (near) Higgs alignment, necessary to prevent significant deviations in the Higgs boson coupling from the standard model prediction, causes a serious fine-tuning problem. We demonstrate that the Higgs alignment is naturally deduced from the multicritical point principle (MPP) in the general two Higgs doublet model. Furthermore, we discuss the possibility of realizing the Yukawa alignment from the MPP, which is necessary to prevent flavor-changing neutral currents mediated by Higgs bosons at tree level.</description>

      <title>Ladder Symmetries and Love Numbers of Reissner--Nordstr\"om Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well known that asymptotically flat black holes in general relativity have vanishing tidal Love numbers. In the case of Schwarzschild and Kerr black holes, this property has been shown to be a consequence of a hidden structure of ladder symmetries for the perturbations. In this work, we extend the ladder symmetries to non-rotating charged black holes in general relativity. As opposed to previous works in this context, we adopt a more general definition of Love numbers, including quadratic operators that mix gravitational and electromagnetic perturbations in the point-particle effective field theory. We show that the calculation of a subset of those couplings in full general relativity is affected by an ambiguity in the split between source and response, which we resolve through an analytic continuation. As a result, we derive a novel master equation that unifies scalar, electromagnetic and gravitational perturbations around Reissner--Nordstr\"om black holes. The equation is hypergeometric and can be obtained from previous formulations via nontrivial field redefinitions, which allow to systematically remove some of the singularities and make the presence of the ladder symmetries more manifest.</description>

      <title>Most general Type-D Black Hole and Accelerating Reissner-Nordstrom-NUT-(A)dS</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Plebanski-Demianski metric is commonly thought to describe the most general Type D black hole in general relativity (possibly coupled with Maxwell electromagnetism), but it fails to describe the elusive accelerating spacetimes with gravitomagnetic mass without angular momentum. We propose a very general type D metric, stemming from a binary black hole system, which represents a novel branch of the type D spacetimes: accelerating Kerr-Newman-NUT black hole with cosmological constant. It has straightforward limits to all the known type D black holes in the Einstein-Maxwell theory and in particular to the accelerating Reissner-Nordstrom-NUT solution, yet unknown in the literature.</description>

      <title>On the central singularity of the BTZ geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nature of the central singularity of the BTZ geometries -- stationary vacuum solutions of 2+1 gravity with negative cosmological constant $\Lambda=-\ell^{-2}$ and $SO(2)\times \mathbb{R}$ isometry -- is discussed. The essential tool for this analysis is the holonomy operator on a closed path (i.e., Wilson loop) around the central singularity. The study considers the holonomies for the Lorentz and AdS$_3$ connections. The analysis is carried out for all values of the mass $M$ and angular momentum $J$, namely, for black holes ($M \ell \ge |J|$) and naked singularities ($M \ell &lt; |J|$). In general, both Lorentz and AdS$_3$ holonomies are nontrivial in the zero-radius limit revealing the presence of delta-like singularity at the origin in the curvature and torsion two-forms. However, in the cases $M\pm J/\ell=-n_{\pm}^2$, with $n_{\pm} \in \mathbb{N}$, recently identified in \cite{GMYZ} as BPS configurations, the AdS$_3$ holonomy reduces to the identity. Nevertheless, except for the AdS$_{3}$ spacetime ($M=-1$, $J=0$), all BTZ geometries have a central singularity which is not revealed by local operations.</description>

Abstract: A direct reformulation of the Hamiltonian formalism in terms of the intrinsic geometry of infinitely prolonged differential equations is obtained. Concepts of spatial equation and spatial-gauge symmetry of a Lagrangian system of equations are introduced. A non-covariant canonical variational principle is proposed and demonstrated using the Maxwell equations as an example. A covariant canonical variational principle is formulated. The results obtained are applicable to any variational equations, including those that do not originate in physics.</description>

      <title>Non-extensive Effects on the QCD Equation of State and Fluctuations of Conserved Charges within Polyakov Quark Meson Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The influence of non-extensive Tsallis statistics on the hadron phase structure has been investigated using the Polyakov-quark-meson (PQM) model. The analysis examines the non-extensive effects on the temperature dependence of PQM order parameters, thermodynamic quantities related to the QCD equation of state, and fluctuations of conserved charges at varying chemical potentials. The results show that non-extensive effects have the most significant deviations near the crossover region. The pseudo-critical temperature $T_{\chi}(\mu_B)$ is not a universal constant and decreases with increasing non-extensive $q$ parameter. The chiral phase diagram of the PQM model indicates a decrease in the behavior of the ($T_{\chi}-\mu_B$) plane with increasing non-extensive $q$ parameter. The PQM model exhibits good qualitative agreement with lattice QCD calculations. Moreover, these findings suggest the existence of a Tsallis limit, which serves as an alternative to the Stefan-Boltzmann (SB) limit for the massless ideal gas. The critical endpoint (CEP) exhibits lower temperature but higher chemical potential with increasing non-extensive $q$ parameter. Overall, this study highlights the importance of non-extensive Tsallis statistics in characterizing the quark-hadron phase structure of the PQM model and contributes to a deeper understanding of non-extensive effects in the quark-hadron phase transition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We set up a formalism for calculating the energy density generated in a quantized massive scalar field in the course of the drastic change in spacetime geometry at the end of the inflationary era. The calculation relies on the notion of adiabatic vacuum. The Bogolubov coefficients are computed by employing the sudden approximation. After obtaining a general formula, we calculate explicitly the energy density generated in a particle species with $m/H \ll1$, where $m$ is the particle mass and $H$ is the Hubble constant during the inflationary epoch. We find the contribution of the long-wavelength modes to be $\propto H^5/m$. If such particles are very weakly interacting, they can come to dominate the total energy density in the Universe. Other cosmological implications are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Constraining Cosmological Physics with DESI BAO Observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The DESI year one observations can help probe new physics on cosmological scales. In light of the latest DESI BAO measurements, we constrain four popular cosmological scenarios including inflation, modified gravity, annihilating dark matter and interacting dark energy. Using a data combination of BICEP/Keck array, cosmic microwave background and DESI, we obtain the $1\sigma$ and $2\sigma$ constraints on the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r_{0.05}= 0.0176^{+0.0070}_{-0.0130}$ and $r_{0.05}=0.018^{+0.020}_{-0.017}$. Using the combination of cosmic microwave background and DESI, we find a $2.4\sigma$ evidence for gravitational theories beyond the general relativity, shrinks the dark matter annihilation cross-section by $12\%$ relative to cosmic microwave background, and obtain a $1.6\sigma$ hint of the positive interaction between dark matter and dark energy indicating that energy may be transferred from dark matter to dark energy in the dark sector of the universe. Future DESI observations could go a step further to explore the nature of inflation, dark matter and dark energy, and test the validity of general relativity on cosmological scales.</description>

Abstract: We study the homogeneous and anisotropic evolution of spacetime driven by perfect fluid with shear viscosity. We obtain exact solutions by considering the simplest form of the equation of state wherein the pressure and the shear stress are proportional to the energy density individually. The solutions represent Bianchi type-I cosmology of which the special case becomes Bianchi type-VII. We find that the initial singularity can be removed only for the Bianchi type-VII.</description>

      <title>Tidal Love numbers and approximate universal relations for fermion soliton stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fermion soliton stars are a consistent model of exotic compact objects which involve a nonlinear interaction between a real scalar field and fermions through a Yukawa term. This interaction results in an effective fermion mass that depends upon the vacuum structure in the scalar potential. In this work we investigate the tidal deformations of fermion soliton stars and compute the corresponding tidal Love numbers for different model parameters. Furthermore, we discuss the existence of approximate universal relations for the electric and magnetic tidal deformabilities of these stars, and compare them with other solutions of general relativity, such as neutron stars or boson stars. These relations for fermion soliton stars are less universal than for neutron stars, but they are sufficiently different from the ordinary neutron star case that a measurement of the electric and magnetic tidal Love numbers (as potentially achievable by next-generation gravitational wave detectors) can be used to disentangle these families of compact objects. Finally, we discuss the conditions for tidal disruption of fermion soliton stars in a binary system and estimate the detectability of the electromagnetic signal associated with such tidal disruption events.</description>

      <title>Friedmann equations of the fractal apparent horizon</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: From a fractal perspective, the entropy bound of gravitational systems undergoes changes. Furthermore, in the cosmological setting, the conservation law of a perfect fluid is also altered in such systems, affecting spatial elements like volume, area, and radius. By applying the first law of thermodynamics and deriving the Friedmann equations, we can gain insight into the evolution of such a fractal cosmos. However, observations continue to necessitate the existence of a dark energy source. To address this, in this article, we have created a novel fractal $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model and determined the fractal cosmological observables. We show that the spatial fractal dimension is two, and the age of the Universe is 13.91 Gyr, by fitting the model's parameters to cosmological data.</description>

      <title>Gravitational mode mixing around black holes in scalar-tensor theories with parity-violating terms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate black holes and gravitational perturbations when both the scalar Gauss-Bonnet and dynamical Chern-Simons gravity sectors coexist in addition to the Einstein-Hilbert term, and both sectors are coupled to a single canonically normalized scalar field. The presence of the scalar Gauss-Bonnet gravity sector allows the scalar field to possess a non-vanishing background solution, resulting in additional couplings between odd and even-type gravitational perturbations arising from the dynamical Chern-Simons gravity sector. We illustrate the impact of these even-odd gravitational couplings in gravitational perturbations around a static spherically symmetric black hole. Although the couplings between the odd and even-type gravitational perturbations are known to appear in purely tensorial gravity theories with higher curvature corrections, we demonstrate it in scalar-tensor theories.</description>

      <title>Observational features of reflection asymmetric black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Kerr spacetime is symmetric with respect to a well-defined equatorial plane. When testing the equatorial reflection symmetry of an isolated black hole, one is at the same time testing the Kerr hypothesis in General Relativity. In this work, we investigate the possible observational features when a Keplerian disk is surrounding a rotating black hole without reflection symmetry. When such symmetry is broken, generically, the photon trajectories around the black hole and the Keplerian orbits on the accretion disk are distorted vertically away from the equatorial plane by an amount that depends on their distance to the black hole. In the reflection asymmetric spacetime we are considering, these two kinds of orbits are distorted in opposite directions. Interestingly, while the size and shape of black hole shadows closely resemble those of Kerr black holes, distinct observational characteristics can emerge in the disk image and emission line profiles. When observing the disk edge-on, a pronounced concave shape may appear along its innermost edge on the incoming side. Furthermore, distinctive horn-like features might be observed on the spectral line profile at the blue-shifted side. These special features can serve as compelling indicators of the reflection asymmetry present in rotating black holes.</description>

      <title>Quantum Isotropic Universe in RQM Analogy: the Cosmological Horizon</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the quantum dynamics of the isotropic Universe in the presence of a free massless scalar field, playing the role of a physical clock. The Hilbert space is constructed via a direct analogy between the Wheeler-DeWitt equation in the minisuperspace and a relativistic scalar one in physical space. In particular, we show how the introduction of a "turning point" in the Universe evolution allows to overcome an intrinsic ambiguity in representing the expanding and collapsing Universe. In this way, the positive and negative frequencies are simply identified with time reversed states. The main subject of the present analysis is the construction of a horizon operator, whose quantum behavior is investigated when Polymer Quantum Mechanics is implemented to describe the asymptotic evolution near the initial singularity. The reason of this choice is motivated by the intrinsic spreading of localized wavepackets when the polymer dispersion relation governs the quantum dynamics. The evidence that the mean value of the quantum horizon operator follows its semiclassical behavior (corrected for polymerization) is a clear indication that a concept of causality can be restored also in the quantum cosmological picture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently it was shown that essentially all regular black hole models constructed so far can be obtained as solutions of vacuum gravity equations, upon considering an infinite series of quasi-topological higher curvature corrections. Here we show that such a construction can be upgraded to yield regular black holes with vanishing inner horizon surface gravity. In four dimensions, such a condition is necessary for the absence of classical instabilities associated with mass inflation on the inner horizon.</description>

      <title>Hilbert space representation for quasi-Hermitian position-deformed Heisenberg algebra and Path integral formulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Position deformation of a Heisenberg algebra and Hilbert space representation of both maximal length and minimal momentum uncertainties may lead to loss of Hermiticity of some operators that generate this algebra. Consequently, the Hamiltonian operator constructed from these operators are also not Hermitian. In the present paper, with an appropriate positive-definite Dyson map, we establish the Hermiticity of these operators by means of a quasi-similarity transformation. We then construct Hilbert space representations associated with these quasi-Hermitian operators that generate a quasi-Hermitian Heisenberg algebra. With the help of these representations we establish the path integral formulation of any systems in this quasi-Hermitian algebra. Finally, using the path integral of a free particle as an example, we demonstrate that the Euclidean propagator, action, and kinetic energy of this system are constrained by the standard classical mechanics limits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nilpotence variety for extended supersymmetric quantum mechanics is a cone over a quadric in projective space. The pure spinor correspondence, which relates the description of off-shell supermultiplets to the classification of modules over the corresponding hypersurface ring, reduces to a classical problem of linear algebra. Spinor bundles, which correspond to maximal Cohen-Macaulay modules, serve as basic building blocks. Koszul duality appears as a deformed version of the Bernstein-Gel'fand-Gel'fand correspondence that we make fully concrete. We illustrate in numerous examples the close relationship between these connections and the powerful graphical technology of Adinkras. We emphasize the role of R-symmetry for recovering higher-dimensional gauge and gravity multiplets.</description>

      <title>One-loop power spectrum in ultra slow-roll inflation and implications for primordial black hole dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07196v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We apply the in-in formalism to address the question of whether the size of the one-loop spectrum of curvature fluctuations in ultra-slow-roll inflation models designed for producing a large population of primordial black holes implies a breakdown of perturbation theory. We consider a simplified piece-wise description of inflation, in which the ultra-slow-roll phase is preceded and followed by slow-roll phases linked by transitional periods. We work in the $\delta\phi$-gauge, including all relevant cubic and quartic interactions and the necessary counterterms to renormalize the ultraviolet divergences, regularized by a cutoff. The ratio of the one-loop to the tree-level contributions to the spectrum of curvature perturbations is controlled by the duration of the ultra-slow-roll phase and of the transitions. Our results indicate that perturbation theory does not necessarily break in well-known models proposed to account for all the dark matter in the form of primordial black holes.</description>

Abstract: Q-balls are non-topological solitons arising in scalar field theories. Solutions for rotating Q-balls (and the related boson stars) have been shown to exist when the angular momentum is equal to an integer multiple of the Q-ball charge $Q$. Here we consider the possibility of classically long-lived metastable rotating Q-balls with small angular momentum, even for large charge, for all scalar theories that support non-rotating Q-balls. This is relevant for rotating extensions of Q-balls and related solitons such as boson stars as it impacts their cosmological phenomenology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.14181v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a framework for systematic study of symmetry transformations of sigma-model currents in a special situation, when symmetries have a well-defined projection onto the target space. We then apply this formalism to pure spinor sigma-models, and describe the resulting geometric structures in the target space (which in our approach includes the pure spinor ghosts). We perform a detailed study of the transformation properties of currents, using the formalism of equivariant cohomology. We clarify the descent procedure for the ''universal'' deformation corresponding to changing the overall scale of the worldsheet action. We also study the contact terms in the OPE of BRST currents, and derive some relations between currents and vertex operators which perhaps have not been previously acknowledged. We also clarify the geometrical meaning of the ''minimalistic'' BV action for pure spinors in AdS.</description>

Abstract: We study hairy black hole solutions in Einstein(--Maxwell)--scalar--Gauss--Bonnet theory. The scalar coupling function includes quadratic and quartic terms, so the gravitational action has a U(1) symmetry. We argued that when the effective mass of the scalar field is at the critical value, the non-hairy black holes transform into hairy black holes in a symmetry-broken vacuum via spontaneous symmetry breaking. These hairy black holes are stable under scalar perturbations, and the Goldstone bosons are trivial. Moreover, we found that the spontaneous symmetry breaking associated with local U(1) is unlikely to occur in this theory.</description>

      <title>Algebras and Hilbert spaces from gravitational path integrals: Understanding Ryu-Takayanagi/HRT as entropy without invoking holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.02189v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent works by Chandrasekaran, Penington, and Witten have shown in various special contexts that the quantum-corrected Ryu-Takayanagi (RT) entropy (or its covariant Hubeny-Rangamani-Takayanagi (HRT) generalization) can be understood as computing an entropy on an algebra of bulk observables. These arguments do not rely on the existence of a holographic dual field theory. We show that analogous-but-stronger results hold in any UV-completion of asymptotically anti-de Sitter quantum gravity with a Euclidean path integral satisfying a simple and familiar set of axioms. We consider a quantum context in which a standard Lorentz-signature classical bulk limit would have Cauchy slices with asymptotic boundaries $B_L \sqcup B_R$ where both $B_L$ and $B_R$ are compact manifolds without boundary. Our main result is then that (the UV-completion of) the quantum gravity path integral defines type I von Neumann algebras ${\cal A}^{B_L}_L$, ${\cal A}^{B_R}_{R}$ of observables acting respectively at $B_L$, $B_R$ such that ${\cal A}^{B_L}_L$, ${\cal A}^{B_R}_{R}$ are commutants. The path integral also defines entropies on ${\cal A}^{B_L}_L, {\cal A}^{B_R}_R$. Positivity of the Hilbert space inner product then turns out to require the entropy of any projection operator to be quantized in the form $\ln N$ for some $N \in {\mathbb Z}^+$ (unless it is infinite). As a result, our entropies can be written in terms of standard density matrices and standard Hilbert space traces. Furthermore, in appropriate semiclassical limits our entropies are computed by the RT-formula with quantum corrections. Our work thus provides a Hilbert space interpretation of the RT entropy. Since our axioms do not severely constrain UV bulk structures, they may be expected to hold equally well for successful formulations of string field theory, spin-foam models, or any other approach to constructing a UV-complete theory of gravity.</description>

Abstract: Solid partitions are the 4D generalization of the plane partitions in 3D and Young diagrams in 2D, and they can be visualized as stacking of 4D unit-size boxes in the positive corner of a 4D room. Physically, solid partitions arise naturally as 4D molten crystals that count equivariant D-brane BPS states on the simplest toric Calabi-Yau fourfold, $\mathbb{C}^4$, generalizing the 3D statement that plane partitions count equivariant D-brane BPS states on $\mathbb{C}^3$. In the construction of BPS algebras for toric Calabi-Yau threefolds, the so-called charge function on the 3D molten crystal is an important ingredient -- it is the generating function for the eigenvalues of an infinite tower of Cartan elements of the algebra. In this paper, we derive the charge function for solid partitions. Compared to the 3D case, the new feature is the appearance of contributions from certain 4-box and 5-box clusters, which will make the construction of the corresponding BPS algebra much more complicated than in the 3D.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.12357v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article aims to study the Lorentz/U(1) gauge symmetry-breaking electrodynamics in the framework of the Standard-Model Extension and analyze the Hamiltonian structure for the theory with a specific dimension $d\leq 4$ of Lorentz breaking operators. For this purpose, we consider a general quadratic action of the modified electrodynamics with Lorentz/gauge-breaking operators and calculate the number of independent components of the operators at different dimensions in gauge invariance and breaking. With this general action, we then analyze how the Lorentz/gauge symmetry-breaking can change the Hamiltonian structure of the theories by considering Lorentz/gauge-breaking operators with dimension $d\leq 4$ as examples. We show that the Lorentz-breaking operators with gauge invariance do not change the classes of the constraints of the theory and the number of the physical degrees of freedom of the standard Maxwell's electrodynamics. When the U(1) gauge symmetry-breaking operators are present, the theories in general lack first-class constraint and have one additional physical degree of freedom, compared to the standard Maxwell's electrodynamics.</description>

We discuss applications pertinent to gravitational bremsstrahlung and deep inelastic scattering in the saturation regime. After identifying the bases of master integrals, the latter are evaluated by means of the differential equation method. Finally, new results with exact dependence on the spacetime dimension D are presented.</description>

Abstract: With the aim of investigating the existence of an integrable elliptic deformation of strings on $\mathsf{AdS}_3 \times \mathsf{S}^3 \times \mathsf{T}^4$, we compute the tree-level worldsheet S-matrix of the elliptically-deformed bosonic sigma model on $\mathsf{AdS}_3 \times \mathsf{S}^3$ in uniform light-cone gauge. The resulting tree-level S-matrix is compatible with the integrability of the model and has interesting features, including a hidden $\mathsf{U}(1)$ symmetry not manifest in the Lagrangian. We find that it cannot be embedded in the known exact integrable R-matrices describing deformations of the undeformed $\mathsf{AdS}_3 \times \mathsf{S}^3 \times \mathsf{T}^4$ light-cone gauge S-matrix including fermions. Therefore, we construct embeddings of the deformed 6-d metric in type II supergravity with constant dilaton and homogeneous fluxes. The simplicity of these solutions suggests they are promising candidates to lead to an integrable string sigma model including fermions.</description>

      <title>Convergence of Ginzburg-Landau expansions: superconductivity in the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory and chiral symmetry breaking in the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16372v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the convergence of the Ginzburg-Landau (GL) expansion in the context of the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory for superconductivity and the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model for chiral symmetry breaking at finite temperature $T$ and chemical potential $\mu$. We present derivations of the all-order formulas for the coefficients of the GL expansions in both systems under the mean-field approximation. We show that the convergence radii for the BCS gap $\Delta$ and dynamical quark mass $M$ are given by $\Delta_\text{conv} = \pi T$ and $M_\text{conv} = \sqrt{\mu^2 + (\pi T)^2}$, respectively. We also discuss the implications of these results and the quantitative reliability of the GL expansion near the first-order chiral phase transition.</description>

      <title>Exploring duality symmetries, multicriticality and RG flows at $c = 2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.04166v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we study the realization of non-invertible duality symmetries along the toroidal branch of the $c=2$ conformal manifold. A systematic procedure to construct symmetry defects is implemented to show that all Rational Conformal Field Theories along this branch enjoy duality symmetries. Furthermore, we delve into an in-depth analysis of two representative cases of multicritical theories, were the toroidal branch meets various orbifold branches. For these particular examples, the categorical data and the defect Hilbert spaces associated to the duality symmetries are obtained by resorting to modular covariance. Finally, we study the interplay between these novel symmetries and the various exactly marginal and relevant deformations, including some representative examples of Renormalization Group flows where the infrared is constrained by the non-invertible symmetries and their anomalies.</description>

      <title>New construction of a charged dipole black ring by Harrison transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07589v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an exact solution for a non-BPS charged rotating black ring endowed with a dipole charge in the bosonic sector of five-dimensional minimal supergravity. Utilizing the electric Harrison transformation, we derive this solution by converting a five-dimensional vacuum solution into a charged solution within the realm of five-dimensional minimal supergravity. As the seed solution for the Harrison transformation, we use a vacuum solution of a rotating black ring possessing a Dirac-Misner string singularity. The resulting solution exhibits regularity, indicating the absence of curvature singularities, conical singularities, orbifold singularities, Dirac-Misner string singularities, and closed timelike curves both on and outside the horizon. This obtained solution carries mass, two angular momenta, an electric charge, and a dipole charge, with only three of these quantities being independent, similar to the charged rotating dipole black ring found previously by Elvang, Emparan and Figueras. However, aside from the vacuum case, these two solutions do not coincide. We discuss the difference between them in the phase space.</description>

      <title>Flux Quantization on 11-dimensional Superspace</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16456v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Flux quantization of the C-field in 11d supergravity is arguably necessary for the (UV-)completion of the theory, in that it determines the torsion charges carried by small numbers of M-branes. However, hypotheses about C-field flux-quantization ("models of the C-field") have previously been discussed only in the bosonic sector of 11d supergravity and ignoring the supergravity equations of motion. Here we highlight a duality-symmetric formulation of on-shell 11d supergravity on superspace, observe that this naturally lends itself to completion of the theory by flux quantization, and indeed that 11d super-spacetimes are put on-shell by carrying quantizable duality-symmetric super-C-field flux; the proof of which we present in detail.</description>

      <title>Flows in the Space of Interacting Chiral Boson Theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18242v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study interacting theories of $N$ left-moving and $\overline{N}$ right-moving Floreanini-Jackiw bosons in two dimensions. A parameterized family of such theories is shown to enjoy (non-manifest) Lorentz invariance if and only if its Lagrangian obeys a flow equation driven by a function of the energy-momentum tensor. We discuss the canonical quantization of such theories along classical stress tensor flows, focusing on the case of the root-$T \overline{T}$ deformation, where we obtain perturbative results for the deformed spectrum in a certain large-momentum limit. In the special case $N = \overline{N}$, we consider the quantum effective action for the root-$T \overline{T}$-deformed theory by expanding around a general classical background, and we find that the one-loop contribution vanishes for backgrounds with constant scalar gradients. Our analysis can also be interpreted via dual $U(1)$ Chern-Simons theories in three dimensions, which might be used to describe deformations of charged $\mathrm{AdS}_3$ black holes or quantum Hall systems.</description>

      <title>A local Generalized second law in crossed product constructions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00718v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we show a local generalized second law (the generalized entropy is nondecreasing) in crossed product constructions for maximally extended static and Kerr black holes using modular theory. The new ingredient is the use of results from a recent paper discussing the entropy of the algebra of operators in subregions of arbitrary spacetimes. These results rely on an assumption which we show is true in our setting. However, we do assume as in that paper, that the gravitational constraints are implemented on each partial Cauchy slice. In this version, we have also added a discussion on inclusion of an observer in the calculation. In the last part of the paper, we look at modular Hamiltonians of deformed half-spaces in a class of static spacetimes, including the Schwarzschild spacetime. These are computed using path integrals, and we primarily compute them to investigate whether these non-local modular Hamiltonians can be made local by subtracting off pieces from the algebra and its commutant, as has been surmised in the literature. Along the way, the averaged null energy condition (ANEC) also follows in this class of spacetimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00761v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study holographic volume complexity for various families of holographic cosmologies with Kasner-like singularities, in particular with $AdS$, hyperscaling violating and Lifshitz asymptotics. We find through extensive numerical studies that the complexity surface always bends in the direction away from the singularity and transitions from spacelike near the boundary to lightlike in the interior. As the boundary anchoring time slice approaches the singularity, the transition to lightlike is more rapid, with the spacelike part shrinking. The complexity functional has vanishing contributions from the lightlike region so in the vicinity of the singularity, complexity is vanishingly small, indicating a dual Kasner state of vanishingly low complexity, suggesting an extreme thinning of the effective degrees of freedom dual to the near singularity region. We also develop further previous studies on extremal surfaces for holographic entanglement entropy, and find that in the IR limit they reveal similar behaviour as complexity.</description>

      <title>Mapping Excited Gauged Q-balls</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03053v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Properties such as the radius, charge and energy of ${U}(1)$ gauged Q-balls are analytically complicated to characterize. A mapping relation is known between the ground state of gauged Q-balls and global Q-balls that reduces the complexity of the analysis of the ground state of gauged Q-balls. Extending the map to excited states is a powerful tool to determine the properties of the rest of gauged Q-ball solution space. In this article we explore the mapping relation extension to characterize numerically and analytically excited gauged Q-balls solutions and their properties. A feature of excited gauged Q-balls is acquiring a maximum number excited states and having a maximal size, which we analytically predict via the mapping relation. We show that analytical approximations of the charge and energy, in the thin-wall limit, can be extended to excited gauged Q-balls and discuss the types of instabilities of these states.</description>

Abstract: We study vector spaces associated to a family of generalized Euler integrals. Their dimension is given by the Euler characteristic of a very affine variety. Motivated by Feynman integrals from particle physics, this has been investigated using tools from homological algebra and the theory of $D$-modules. We present an overview and uncover new relations between these approaches. We also provide new algorithmic tools.</description>

      <title>Tuning the separability in noncommutative space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.13035v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the Separability of the noncommutative (NC) space coordinate degrees of freedom with the generalized Peres-Horodecki separability criterion (Simon's condition) for a bipartite Gaussian state. Non-symplectic nature of the transformation between the usual commutative space and NC space restricts the use of Simon's condition in NCS. We transform the NCS system to an equivalent Hamiltonian in commutative space through Bopp shift, which enables the utilization of the separability criterion in NC space. For afairly general study, we consider a bilinear Hamiltonian with time-dependent (TD) parameters, along with a TD external interaction, which is linear in field modes. The system is transformed into canonical form keeping the intrinsic symplectic structure ($Sp(4,\mathbb{R})$) intact. The solution of the TD-Schr\"{o}dinger equation is obtained with the help of Lewis-Riesenfeld invariant method (LRIM). Expectation values of the observables (thus the covariance matrix ) are constructed from the states obtained from LRIM. It turns out that the existence of the NC parameters in the oscillator determines the separability of the states. In particular, for isotropic oscillators, the separability condition for the bipartite Gaussian states depends on NC parameters. Moreover, anisotropic parameter values for the oscillator affects the separability. In other words, both the deformation parameters ($\theta,\;\eta$) and parameter values of the oscillator are important for the separability of bipartite states. Thus tuning the parameter values, one can destroy or recreate the separability of states. With the help of toy models, we have demonstrated TD-NC space parameters effect on separability.</description>

      <title>Separability transitions in topological states induced by local decoherence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.11879v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study states with intrinsic topological order subjected to local decoherence from the perspective of separability, i.e., whether a decohered mixed state can be expressed as an ensemble of short-range entangled (SRE) pure states. We focus on toric codes and the X-cube fracton state and provide evidence for the existence of decoherence-induced separability transitions that precisely coincide with the threshold for the feasibility of active error correction. A key insight is that local decoherence acting on the 'parent' cluster states of these models results in a Gibbs state. As an example, for the 2d (3d) toric code subjected to bit-flip errors, we show that the decohered density matrix can be written as a convex sum of SRE states for $p &gt; p_c$, where $p_c$ is related to the paramagnetic-ferromagnetic transition in the 2d (3d) random-field bond Ising model along the Nishimori line.</description>

Abstract: Feynman's diagrammatic series is a common language for a formally exact theoretical description of systems of infinitely-many interacting quantum particles, as well as a foundation for precision computational techniques. Here we introduce a universal framework for efficient summation of connected or skeleton Feynman diagrams for generic quantum many-body systems. It is based on an explicit combinatorial construction of the sum of the integrands by dynamic programming, at a computational cost that can be made only exponential in the diagram order on a classical computer and potentially polynomial on a quantum computer. We illustrate the technique by an unbiased diagrammatic Monte Carlo calculation of the equation of state of the $2D$ $SU(N)$ Hubbard model in an experimentally relevant regime, which has remained challenging for state-of-the-art numerical methods.</description>

Abstract: Quantum entanglement has long served as a foundational pillar in understanding quantum mechanics, with a predominant focus on two-particle systems. We extend the study of entanglement into the realm of three-body decays, offering a more intricate understanding of quantum correlations. We introduce a novel approach for three-particle systems by utilising the principles of entanglement monotone concurrence and the monogamy property. Our findings highlight the potential of studying deviations from the Standard Model and emphasise its significance in particle phenomenology. This work paves the way for new insights into particle physics through multi-particle quantum entanglement, particularly in decays of heavy fermions and hadrons.</description>

Abstract: Null cosmic strings are shown to disturb gravitational fields of massive bodies and create outgoing gravitational waves (GW). Perturbations of the metric caused by a straight null string and a point-like massive source are found as solutions to linearized Einstein equations on a flat space-time. An analytic approximation for their asymptotic at future null infinity is derived. A space-time created by the source and the string is shown to have asymptotically polyhomogeneous form. We calculate GW flux in such space-times and demonstrate that the averaged intensity of the radiation is maximal in the direction of the string motion. Opportunities to detect null string generated gravity waves are briefly discussed.</description>

Abstract: Weakly nonlocal (WNL) Quantum Field Theories (QFT's) may define a new class of UV-completions in particle physics and gravity, without introducing any new elementary particle. One problematic issue is how to realize spontaneous symmetry breaking without introducing an infinite tower of ghosts in the perturbative spectrum. In this letter, a WNL extension of the Standard Model (SM) is proposed: the Fuzzy Standard Model (FSM). It is a smooth deformation of the SM based on covariant star-products of fields. This new formalism realizes electroweak symmetry breaking without ghosts at tree-level. We suspect that the FSM might exhibit classicalization in the deep-UV, which could solve the electroweak hierarchy problem if it occurs at the TeV-scale.</description>

Abstract: Gravity models given by higher-order scalar curvature corrections are believed to bear important consequences. The Einstein-Bel-Robinson gravity, with quartic curvature modification, motivated Sajadi et al to explore static spherically symmetric black hole solutions with perturbative methods. In this paper, inspired by their work, we investigate AdS black hole shadows in EBR gravity. Moreover, we demonstrate how the gravity parameter alters the energy emission rate. Finally, we handle the same problem in the presence of plasma, since the black holes are thought to be surrounded by a medium that changes the geodesic of photons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.06780v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore a new action formulation of hyperfluids, fluids with intrinsic hypermomentum. Brown's Lagrangian for a relativistic perfect fluid is generalised by incorporating the degrees of freedom encoded in the hypermomentum tensor, namely by including connection-matter couplings. Quite interestingly, generic hyperfluids are imperfect, since hypermomentum induces such effects as bulk and shear viscosities as well as heat fluxes. The various coefficients that appear in the first order expansion of hydrodynamics can now be deduced from a Lagrangian formulation, given a geometrical interpretation and a suggested microscopic description in terms of hypermomentum. This connection between hypermomentum and dissipative fluids could shed new light on the physics of relativistic hydrodynamics. The applicability of the new formalism is demonstrated by exact cosmological solutions.</description>

Abstract: We report an implementation of the recursion method that addresses quantum many-body dynamics in the nonperturbative regime. The method essentially amounts to constructing a Lanczos basis in the space of operators and solving coupled Heisenberg equations in this basis. The reported implementation has two key ingredients: a computer-algebraic routine for symbolic calculation of nested commutators and a procedure to extrapolate the sequence of Lanczos coefficients according to the universal operator growth hypothesis. We apply the method to calculate infinite-temperature correlation functions for spin-$1/2$ systems on one- and two-dimensional lattices. In two dimensions the accessible timescale is large enough to essentially embrace the relaxation to equilibrium. The method allows one to accurately calculate transport coefficients. As an illustration, we compute the diffusion constant for the transverse-field Ising model on a square lattice.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal modes and bound states of massive scalar fields in wormhole spacetimes</title>

Abstract: In this work we explore the propagation of massive scalar fields on some wormhole backgrounds. On one side, we consider the Bronnikov-Ellis wormhole solution and wormhole geometries with a non-constant redshift function by introducing a gravitational mass $M$, which goes over into the Bronnikov-Ellis wormhole when the gravitational mass parameter vanishes. We employ the continued fraction method to calculate accurately the quasinormal frequencies of massive scalar fields, particularly focusing on low values of the angular number, and we show an anomalous behaviour of the decay rate of the quasinormal frequencies, for $n \geq \ell$. Also, we show that for a massive scalar field and $M \neq 0$ the effective potential allows potential wells for some values of the parameters which support bound states, which are obtained using the continued fraction method and they are characterized by having only a frequency of oscillation and they do not decay; however, for the Bronnikov-Ellis wormhole the effective potential do not support bound states. On the other side, we consider a wormhole geometry which is an exact solution of $f(R)$ modified gravity. For this geometry the quasinormal frequencies can be obtained analytically, being the longest-lived modes the ones with lowest angular number $\ell$. So, in this wormhole background the anomalous behaviour is avoided.</description>

      <title>Angular Momentum Memory Effect</title>

Abstract: Utilizing recent mathematical advances in proving stability of Minkowski spacetime with minimal decay rates and nonlinear stability of Kerr black holes with small angular momentum, we investigate the detailed asymptotic behaviors of gravitational waves generated in these spacetimes. Here we report and propose a new angular momentum memory effect along future null infinity. This accompanies Christodoulou's nonlinear displacement memory effect and the spin memory effect. The connections and differences to these effects are also addressed.</description>

      <title>Generation of narrow beams of super high-energy gamma quanta in the resonant inverse Compton-effect in the field of a strong x-ray wave</title>

Abstract: The article presents a theoretical study of Oleinik resonances in the process of scattering a gamma quantum by an ultrarelativistic electron in the field of a strong electromagnetic wave. It is shown that under resonant conditions, the scattering channels of the reaction effectively split into two first-order processes according to a fine structure constant such as the external field-stimulated Compton effect. And the annihilation channel of the reaction effectively decays into direct and reverse the external field-stimulated Breit-Wheeler processes. The significant dependence of the resonant energy of final particles and resonant cross sections on the outgoing angles of the final gamma quantum, the number of absorbed and emitted photons of the wave, as well as the characteristic quantum parameters of the problem is shown. These quantum parameters are determined by the ratio of the initial particle energies to the characteristic energies of the Compton effect and the Breit-Wheeler process. An unambiguous relationship between the outgoing angles of final electrons and gamma quanta has been obtained, which qualitatively distinguishes the resonant process from the non-resonant one. The cases when the energy of the initial electrons significantly exceeds the energy of the initial gamma quanta have been studied. The conditions under which the energy of high-energy initial electrons is converted into the energy of final gamma quanta are obtained. At the same time, the resonant differential cross-section of such a process significantly (by several orders of magnitude) exceeds the corresponding non-resonant cross-section. This theoretical study predicts a number of new physical effects that may explain the high-energy fluxes of gamma quanta born near neutron stars and magnetars.</description>

      <title>Quantum charges of harmonic oscillators</title>

Abstract: We discuss Riemannian geometry of one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator. Its wavefunction is a holomorphic section of the complex line bundle $L_{\sf{v}}$ over the phase space $\mathbb{R}^2$. We show that the energy eigenfunctions $\psi_n$ with $n\ge 1$, corresponding to the energy levels $E_n$, are complex coordinates on orbifolds $\mathbb{R}^2/\mathbb{Z}_n$ embedded into $L_{\sf{v}}$, where $\mathbb{Z}_n$ is the cyclic group of order $n$. In fact, $\psi_n (t,z)$ is a standing wave on $\mathbb{R}^2/\mathbb{Z}_n$, where $z$ is a complex coordinate on the phase space $\mathbb{R}^2\cong\mathbb{C}$. Oscillators are characterized by two quantum charges $(q_l^{}, q_{\sf{v}})=(n,1)$, where $q_l^{}=n$ is the winding number for the group U(1) acting on $\mathbb{R}^2/\mathbb{Z}_n$ and $q_{\sf{v}}^{}=1$ is the winding number for the U(1)-rotations on fibres of the bundle $L_{\sf{v}}\to\mathbb{R}^2$, and $E_n=\hbar\omega(q_l^{}+\frac{1}{2} q_{\sf{v}}).$ We also discuss "antioscillators" with opposite quantum charges and the same positive energy.</description>
