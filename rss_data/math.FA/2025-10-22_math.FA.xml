      <title>Pseudo- Riesz Bases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In~\cite{holub1994bases} Holub introduced the concept of near-Riesz bases, as frames that can be considered Riesz bases for computational purposes or that exhibit certain desirable properties of Riesz bases. In this paper, we introduce a generalization of near-Riesz bases that includes sequences which are not necessarily frames. We demonstrate that this broader class of sequences retains many of the desirable properties of near-Riesz bases and establish fundamental perturbation results for this new class.</description>

      <title>Cowen-Douglas operators on quaternionic Hilbert spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1978, M. J. Cowen and R. G. Douglas introduced a class of geometric operators (known as Cowen-Douglas class of operators) and associated a Hermitian holomorphic vector bundle to such operators. In this paper, after giving some basic properties of $S$-spectrum and right eigenvalues of bounded right linear operators on separable quaternionic Hilbert spaces, we generalize the class of Cowen-Douglas operators to the quaternionic Hilbert space via the $S$-spectrum and denote this class as $B_n^s(\Omega_q)$. Due to the lack of commutativity of quaternion multiplication, the quaternionic Cowen-Douglas operators are not trivial generalizations of the classical Cowen-Douglas operators. Each operator in $B_n^{s}(\Omega_q)$ corresponds to an $n$-dimensional Hermitian right holomorphic quaternionic vector bundle. We first establish a rigidity theorem for Hermitian right holomorphic quaternionic vector bundles. It is then proven that two operators in $B_n^{s}(\Omega_q)$ are quaternion unitarily equivalent if and only if the associate bundles are equivalent as Hermitian right holomorphic quaternionic vector bundles. In particular, we introduce canonical matrix representations of operators in $B_1^{s}(\Omega_q)$ and furthermore, we give the quaternion unitarily equivalent classification of $B_1^{s}(\Omega_q)$ by the canonical matrix representations. It is worth noting that curvature is a complete unitary invariant for the classical (complex) Cowen-Douglas operators, however, there exist two quaternionic Cowen-Douglas operators which have the same curvature but are not quaternion unitarily equivalent. In addition, we prove that the operators in $B_1^{s}(\Omega_q)$ are quaternion unitarily equivalent if and only if their complex representations are unitarily equivalent. Some relevant examples of the above results are also provided.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.19534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Morrey--Sobolev inequalities are established for functions in weighted Sobolev spaces on the $n$-dimensional half-space, where the weight is a power of the distance to the boundary, as well as for Sobolev spaces on the $n$-dimensional hyperbolic space. All the estimates are optimal up to a multiplicative constant.</description>

      <title>On the maximum purity of absolutely separable bipartite states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the problem of determining the maximum purity for absolutely separable and absolutely PPT quantum states. From the geometric viewpoint, this problem is equivalent to asking for the exact Euclidean radius of the smallest ball around the maximally mixed state that encompasses the set of all absolutely separable or absolutely PPT states. Our results provide an analytic solution for two qubit states. Based on numerical computation, we propose a conjectured maximum purity for absolutely separable qubit-qudit states and absolutely PPT qutrit-qudit states.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Toeplitz Operators with $BMO^1_{\alpha}$ operator-valued symbols on $\ell^2-$Valued Bergman Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As a class of compact operators on the $\ell^2-$valued Bergman space $A^2_\alpha (\mathbb B_n, \ell^2)$ on the unit ball $\mathbb B_n,$ we study Toeplitz operators with $BMO^1_\alpha (\mathbb B_n, \mathcal L(\ell^2))$ operator-valued symbols. First, we describe a method of restriction to a finite dimension which allows us to apply earlier results of Rahm and Wick; then we exhibit an explicit example of a compact Toeplitz operator on $A^2_\alpha (\mathbb B_n, \ell^2).$ Secondly, we apply two sufficient conditions for compactness established by Rahm in infinite dimension. The first condition is in terms of the Toeplitz algebra $\mathcal T_{L^\infty_{fin}},$ the second one is in terms of sufficiently localized operators and is implied by the first condition. To get the second condition, we additionally assume that the symbol and its adjoint belong to $BMO^1_\alpha (\mathbb B_n, \mathcal L(\ell^2, \ell^1)).$ Finally, inspired by Xia and Sadeghi-Zorboska, we ask the question of the validity of the reverse implication.</description>

      <title>The Nikodym and Grothendieck properties of Boolean algebras and rings related to ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For an ideal $\mathcal{I}$ in a $\sigma$-complete Boolean algebra $\mathcal{A}$, we show that if the Boolean algebra $\mathcal{A}\langle\mathcal{I}\rangle$ generated by $\mathcal{I}$ does not have the Nikodym property, then it does not have the Grothendieck property either. The converse however does not hold -- we construct a family of $\mathfrak{c}$ many pairwise non-isomorphic Boolean subalgebras of the power set $\wp(\omega)$ of the form $\wp(\omega)\langle\mathcal{I}\rangle$ which, when thought of as subsets of the Cantor space $2^\omega$, belong to the Borel class $\mathbb{F}_{\sigma\delta}$ and have the Nikodym property but not the Grothendieck property, and a family of $2^\mathfrak{c}$ many pairwise non-isomorphic non-analytic Boolean algebras of the form $\wp(\omega)\langle\mathcal{I}\rangle$ with the Nikodym property but without the Grothendieck property.
  Extending a result of Hern\'{a}ndez-Hern\'{a}ndez and Hru\v{s}\'{a}k, we show that for an analytic P-ideal $\mathcal{I}$ on $\omega$ the following are equivalent: 1) $\mathcal{I}$ is totally bounded, 2) $\mathcal{I}$ has the Local-to-Global Boundedness Property for submeasures, 3) $\wp(\omega)/\mathcal{I}$ contains a countable splitting family, 4) $\mbox{conv}\le_K\mathcal{I}$. Moreover, proving a conjecture of Drewnowski, Florencio, and Pa\'ul, we present examples of analytic P-ideals on $\omega$ with the Nikodym property but without the Local-to-Global Boundedness Property for submeasures (and so not totally bounded). Exploiting a construction of Alon, Drewnowski, and {\L}uczak, we also describe a family of $\mathfrak{c}$ many pairwise non-isomorphic ideals on $\omega$, induced by sequences of Kneser hypergraphs, which all have the Nikodym property but not the Nested Partition Property -- this answers a question of Stuart.
  Finally, Tukey reducibility of a class of ideals without the Nikodym property is studied.</description>

      <title>Partial Dynamical Systems of $L^p$-Spaces and their Stability Spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18828v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the convolution product and weak derivatives, we consider the partial dynamical systems of the locally convex $L^p(\Omega)$ spaces defined by the action of the smooth algebra $\mathscr{K}(\Omega)$ through its nets. Slice analysis is then employed to show that the Sobolev spaces $W^{k,p}(\Omega)$ are the stable states or space of these partial dynamical systems as limit spaces of the convolution actions of the smooth algebra $K(\Omega)$ on the Banach spaces $L^p(\Omega)$. Thus, the Sobolev spaces $W^{k,p}(\Omega)$ are closed subspaces of the $Lp(\Omega)$-spaces under convolution product and weak derivatives, with the weak derivative operators acting as equivariant maps of the slice spaces.</description>

      <title>Classical harmonic analysis viewed through the prism of noncommutative geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07750v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to bridge noncommutative geometry with classical harmonic analysis on Banach spaces, focusing primarily on both classical and noncommutative $\mathrm{L}^p$ spaces. Introducing a notion of Banach Fredholm module, we define new abelian groups, $\mathrm{K}^{0}(\mathcal{A},\mathscr{B})$ and $\mathrm{K}^{1}(\mathcal{A},\mathscr{B})$, of $\mathrm{K}$-homology associated with an algebra $\mathcal{A}$ and a suitable class $\mathscr{B}$ of Banach spaces, such as the class of $\mathrm{L}^p$-spaces. We establish index pairings of these groups with the $\mathrm{K}$-theory groups of the algebra $\mathcal{A}$. Subsequently, by considering (noncommutative) Hardy spaces, we uncover the natural emergence of Hilbert transforms, leading to Banach Fredholm modules and culminating in index theorems. Moreover, by associating each reasonable sub-Markovian semigroup of operators with a &lt;&lt;Banach noncommutative manifold&gt;&gt;, we explain how this leads to (possibly kernel-degenerate) Banach Fredholm modules, thereby revealing the role of vectorial Riesz transforms in this context. Overall, our approach significantly integrates the analysis of operators on $\mathrm{L}^p$-spaces into the expansive framework of noncommutative geometry, offering new perspectives.</description>

      <title>Cyclicity and iterated logarithms in the Dirichlet space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20298v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $D(\mu)$ denote a harmonically weighted Dirichlet space on the unit disc $\mathbb D$. We show that outer functions $f\in D(\mu)$ are cyclic in $D(\mu)$, whenever $\log f$ belongs to the Pick-Smirnov class $N^+(D(\mu))$. If $f$ has $H^\infty$-norm less than or equal to 1, then cyclicity can also be checked via iterated logarithms. For example, we show that such outer functions $f$ are cyclic, whenever $\log(1+ \log(1/f))\in N^+(D(\mu))$. This condition can be checked by verifying that $\log(1+ \log(1/f))\in D(\mu)$.
  If $f$ satisfies a mild extra condition, then the conditions also become necessary for cyclicity.</description>

      <title>Grushin Operator on Infinite Dimensional Homogeneous Lie Groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19697v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A collection of infinite dimensional complete vector fields $\left\{V_i\right\}_{i=1}^{\infty}$ acting on a locally convex manifolds $M$ on which a smooth positive measure $\mu$ is defined was considered. It was assumed that the vector fields generates an infinite dimensional Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ and satisfies H$\ddot{o}$rmander's condition. The sum of squares of Grushin operators related to the vector fields was examined and the operator is then considered as the generalized Grushin operator. The paramount proofs were Poincar$\acute{e}$ inequality, Gaussian two-bounded estimate for the related heat kernels and the doubling condition for the metric defined by the underlying vector fields.</description>

      <title>$(INV)$ condition and regularity of the inverse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18976v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $f \colon \Omega \to \Omega' $ be a Sobolev mapping of finite distortion between planar domains $\Omega $ and $\Omega'$, satisfying the $(INV)$ condition and coinciding with a homeomorphism near $\partial\Omega $. We show that $f$ admits a generalized inverse mapping $h \colon \Omega' \to \Omega$, which is also a Sobolev mapping of finite distortion and satisfies the $(INV)$ condition.
  We also establish a higher-dimensional analogue of this result: if a mapping $f \colon \Omega \to \Omega' $ of finite distortion is in the Sobolev class $W^{1,p}(\Omega, \mathbb{R}^n)$ with $p &gt; n-1$ and satisfies the $(INV)$ condition, then $f$ has an inverse in $W^{1,1}(\Omega', \mathbb{R}^n)$ that is also of finite distortion.
  Furthermore, we characterize Sobolev mappings satisfying $(INV)$ whose generalized inverses have finite $n$-harmonic energy.</description>

      <title>Harmonic Functions on Four Dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.17033v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper develops theory for a newly-defined bicomplex hyperbolic harmonic function with four real-dimensional inputs, in a way that generalizes the connection between real harmonic functions with two real-dimensional inputs and complex analytic functions. For example, every bicomplex hyperbolic harmonic function appears as this paper's newly-defined hyperbolic real part of a bicomplex analytic function, just as every real harmonic function with two real-dimensional inputs is the real part of a complex analytic function. In addition, this connection produces a unique (up to additive constant) and newly-defined hyperbolic harmonic conjugate function, just as every real harmonic function has a unique (up to additive constant) real harmonic conjugate. Finally, the paper determines a bicomplex Poisson kernel function that produces a corresponding integral representation for bicomplex harmonic functions, one that generalizes the complex harmonic function Poisson integral representation.</description>

      <title>On the singularities of the spectral shift function for some tight-binding models</title>

Abstract: We consider perturbed discrete tight-binding models in $\ell^2(\mathbb{Z_h},\mathcal{G})$ describing union of quantum particles with localized interactions, where $\mathbb{Z_h}$ is the 1D lattice $h\mathbb{Z_h}$, $h &gt; 0$, and $\mathcal G$ is a separable Hilbert space. The perturbations play the role of self-adjoint relatively compact (matrix-valued) electric potentials with $\mathcal B(\mathcal G)$-valued coefficients decaying polynomially at infinity. We analyze the Spectral Shift Function (SSF) associated to the pair of the perturbed and the unperturbed operators. On the one hand, we show that the SSF is bounded near the spectral thresholds of the essential spectrum if $\dim(\mathcal G) &lt; +\infty$. On the other hand, if $\dim(\mathcal G) = +\infty$, we show that it may have singularities at some thresholds points $\mu$ of the essential spectrum. In particular, new mechanisms allowing the SSF to have singularities at the thresholds are exhibited, based on the degeneracy of the spectrum of the unperturbed operator. Moreover, we give the main terms of the asymptotic behaviors of the SSF near $\mu$ described in terms of some explicit effective Berezin-Toeplitz type operators. These results are completed by Levinson type formulas and examples of eigenvalues asymptotics for power-like and exponential decay potentials.</description>

      <title>On cutoff via rigidity for high dimensional curved diffusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15969v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider overdamped Langevin diffusions in Euclidean space, with curvature equal to the spectral gap. This includes the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process as well as non Gaussian and non product extensions with convex interaction, such as the Dyson process from random matrix theory. We show that a cutoff phenomenon or abrupt convergence to equilibrium occurs in high-dimension, at a critical time equal to the logarithm of the dimension divided by twice the spectral gap. This cutoff holds for Wasserstein distance, total variation, relative entropy, and Fisher information. A key observation is a relation to a spectral rigidity, linked to the presence of a Gaussian factor. A novelty is the extensive usage of functional inequalities, even for short-time regularization, and the reduction to Wasserstein. The proofs are short and conceptual. Since the product condition is satisfied, an Lp cutoff hold for all p. We moreover discuss a natural extension to Riemannian manifolds, a link with logarithmic gradient estimates in short-time for the heat kernel, and ask about stability by perturbation. Finally, beyond rigidity but still for diffusions, a discussion around the recent progresses on the product condition for nonnegatively curved diffusions leads us to introduce a new curvature product condition.</description>

      <title>Smoothed Distance Kernels for MMDs and Applications in Wasserstein Gradient Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07820v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Negative distance kernels $K(x,y) := - \|x-y\|$ were used in the definition of maximum mean discrepancies (MMDs) in statistics and lead to favorable numerical results in various applications. In particular, so-called slicing techniques for handling high-dimensional kernel summations profit from the simple parameter-free structure of the distance kernel. However, due to its non-smoothness in $x=y$, most of the classical theoretical results, e.g. on Wasserstein gradient flows of the corresponding MMD functional do not longer hold true. In this paper, we propose a new kernel which keeps the favorable properties of the negative distance kernel as being conditionally positive definite of order one with a nearly linear increase towards infinity and a simple slicing structure, but is Lipschitz differentiable now. Our construction is based on a simple 1D smoothing procedure of the absolute value function followed by a Riemann-Liouville fractional integral transform. Numerical results demonstrate that the new kernel performs similarly well as the negative distance kernel in gradient descent methods, but now with theoretical guarantees.</description>

      <title>Observability of Schr\"odinger propagators on tori in rough settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23965v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: On tori of arbitrary dimensions, Schr\"odinger propagators with bounded potentials are conjectured to be observable from space-time domains of positive Lebesgue measure. We reduce this conjecture to certain integrability bounds for free Schr\"odinger waves, thereby proving the conjecture on the one-dimensional torus and producing new examples of observation domains. These bounds are far weaker than Bourgain's conjectured periodic Strichartz estimates, yet remain highly nontrivial.</description>
