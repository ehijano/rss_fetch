      <title>Hierarchy Selection: New team ranking indicators for cyclist multi-stage races</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, I report some investigation discussing team selection, whence hierarchy, through ranking indicators, for example when measuring professional cyclist team's sportive value, in particular in multistage races. A logical, it seems, constraint is introduced on the riders: they must finish the race. Several new indicators are defined, justified, and compared. These indicators are mainly based on the arriving place of (the best 3) riders instead of their time needed for finishing the stage or the race, - as presently classically used. A case study, serving as an illustration containing the necessary ingredients for a wider discussion, is the 2023 Vuelta de San Juan, but without loss of generality.
  It is shown that the new indicators offer some new viewpoint for distinguishing the ranking through the cumulative sums of the places of riders rather than their finishing times. On the other hand, the indicators indicate a different team hierarchy if only the finishing riders are considered. Some consideration on the distance between ranking indicators is presented.
  Moreover, it is argued that these new ranking indicators should hopefully promote more competitive races, not only till the end of the race, but also until the end of each stage. Generalizations and other applications within operational research topics, like in academia, are suggested.</description>

      <title>Opinion dynamics on biased dynamical networks: beyond rare opinion updating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Opinion dynamics is of paramount importance as it provides insights into the complex dynamics of opinion propagation and social relationship adjustment. It is assumed in most of the previous works that social relationships evolve much faster than opinions. This is not always true in reality. We propose an analytical approximation to study this issue for arbitrary time scales between opinion adjustment and network evolution. To this end, the coefficient of determination in statistics is introduced and a one-dimensional stable manifold is analytically found, i.e., the most likely trajectory. With the aid of the stable manifold, we further obtain the fate of opinions and the consensus time, i.e., fixation probability and fixation time. We find that for in-group bias, the more likely individuals are to adopt the popular opinion, the less likely the majority opinion takes over the population, i.e., conformity inhibits the domination of popular opinions. This counter-intuitive result can be interpreted from a game perspective, in which in-group bias refers to a coordination game and rewiring probability refers to a rescaling of the selection intensity. Our work proposes an efficient approximation method to foster the understanding of opinion dynamics in dynamical networks.</description>

      <title>Light's Impact on Fertility: Unveiling the Maybe Connection Between Nighttime Illumination and Global Societal Changes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chinese people are talking about a national birth rate of 6.4 per 1,000 people in 2023, the lowest in the world. Whether this is related to the wrong use of various artificial night light rays passing through our eyes is worth reflection. Non-visual effects of light are the effects of the blue component of light, which effectively inhibits the melatonin secretion in the pineal gland. As melatonin acts through high-affinity receptors located centrally and in all organs, blue light affects, in principle, the hormone secretion throughout the body, including the secretion of sex hormones and cortisol. These effects have been widely used in animal reproduction. Given that the night light environment has significantly changed over the past century, an effect of light on fertility and behavior could be detected in multiple cases. We showed that the ovulation phase of hens could be shifted by the light as low as 0.2 Lx, which corresponds to the illumination intensity at full moon,and the effect of 0.2 Lx on ovulation is normally far greater than all other factors combined. Two rounds of experiments and many other facts listed support that human intrinsic fertility may have not declined significantly, and food, chemical pollution and policy making are all not the main factors affecting fertility. The longer lighting time at night has brought modern humans into a radically different endocrine state compared with that of humans who lived 100 years ago, which has a huge impact on human reproduction, values and even the progress of civilization. With the development of the digital era, our eyes will be exposed to even longer light time at night. How to restore human beings to a normal hormonal state by combating the misuse of light may be the urgent issue. The light of the digital world (met averse, AI, and so on)may be should not continue to flood.</description>

      <title>Human Mobility in the Metaverse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The metaverse promises a shift in the way humans interact with each other, and with their digital and physical environments. The lack of geographical boundaries and travel costs in the metaverse prompts us to ask if the fundamental laws that govern human mobility in the physical world apply. We collected data on avatar movements, along with their network mobility extracted from NFT purchases. We find that despite the absence of commuting costs, an individuals inclination to explore new locations diminishes over time, limiting movement to a small fraction of the metaverse. We also find a lack of correlation between land prices and visitation, a deviation from the patterns characterizing the physical world. Finally, we identify the scaling laws that characterize meta mobility and show that we need to add preferential selection to the existing models to explain quantitative patterns of metaverse mobility. Our ability to predict the characteristics of the emerging meta mobility network implies that the laws governing human mobility are rooted in fundamental patterns of human dynamics, rather than the nature of space and cost of movement.</description>

      <title>Seat Allocation and Seat Bias under the Jefferson--D'Hondt Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.08291</link>
      <description>arXiv:1805.08291v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that under the Jefferson--D'Hondt method of apportionment, given certain distributional assumptions regarding mean rounding residuals, as well as absence of correlations between party vote shares, district sizes (in votes), and multipliers, the seat share of each relevant party is an affine function of the aggregate vote share, the number of relevant parties, and the mean district magnitude. We further show that the first of those assumptions follows approximately from more general ones regarding smoothness, vanishing at the extremes, and total variation of the density of the distribution of vote shares. We also discuss how our main result differs from the simple generalization of the single-district asymptotic seat bias formulae, and how it can be used to derive an estimate of the natural threshold and certain properties thereof.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Space Situational Awareness to Mitigate Risk: A Single-Case Study in the Misidentification of a Recently-Launched Starlink Satellite Train as a UAP in Commercial Aviation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08155v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Over the past several years, the misidentification of SpaceX Starlink satellites as Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP) by pilots and laypersons has generated unnecessary aviation risk and confusion. The many deployment and orbital evolution strategies, coupled with changing sun specular reflection angles, contribute to this gap in space situational awareness. In this paper we present a case analysis of an incident that generated multiple, corroborating reports of a UAP from five pilots on two commercial airline flights over the Pacific Ocean on August 10th, 2022. This incident included two cell phone photos and a video of an unrecognizable and possibly anomalous phenomenon. We then use supplemental two-line elements (TLEs) for the Starlink train of satellites launched that same day and Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast (ADS-B) data from the flight with the photographs to reconstruct a view of these satellites from the cockpit at the time and place of the sighting. The success of this work demonstrates an approach that could, in principle, warn aviators about satellites that could be visible in unusual or novel illumination configurations, thus increasing space situational awareness and supporting aviation safety. We conclude with recommendations for governments and satellite operators to provide better a-priori data that can be used to create advisories to aviators and the public. The automated simulation of known specular reflection off constellations of satellites could also support researchers investigating sightings of unfamiliar aerial or aerospace objects as likely being from normal versus novel space events.</description>

      <title>Upper Bounds on Overshoot in SIR Models with Nonlinear Incidence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.01653v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We expand the calculation of the upper bound on epidemic overshoot in SIR models to account for nonlinear incidence. We lay out the general procedure and restrictions to perform the calculation analytically. We demonstrate the procedure by working through several examples and also numerically study what happens to the upper bound on overshoot when nonlinear incidence manifests in the form of epidemic dynamics over a contact network. We find that both steeper incidence terms and larger contact heterogeneity can increase the range of communicable diseases at which the overshoot remains a relatively large public health hazard.</description>

      <title>Scalable tensor methods for nonuniform hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.17825v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While multilinear algebra appears natural for studying the multiway interactions modeled by hypergraphs, tensor methods for general hypergraphs have been stymied by theoretical and practical barriers. A recently proposed adjacency tensor is applicable to nonuniform hypergraphs, but is prohibitively costly to form and analyze in practice. We develop tensor times same vector (TTSV) algorithms for this tensor which improve complexity from $O(n^r)$ to a low-degree polynomial in $r$, where $n$ is the number of vertices and $r$ is the maximum hyperedge size. Our algorithms are implicit, avoiding formation of the order $r$ adjacency tensor. We demonstrate the flexibility and utility of our approach in practice by developing tensor-based hypergraph centrality and clustering algorithms. We also show these tensor measures offer complementary information to analogous graph-reduction approaches on data, and are also able to detect higher-order structure that many existing matrix-based approaches provably cannot.</description>

      <title>Bernardo Dessau, fisico, scienziato, maestro, da Bologna a Perugia tra i marosi del secolo breve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06113v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Seventy-five years ago, Bernardo Dessau passed away. He had been the sole professor of Physics at the University of Perugia for thirty years. With this brief contribution we intend to repay a debt of gratitude, first of all because his scientific merits were probably underestimated, having spent the first fifteen years of his career under the shadow of the great Augusto Righi in Bologna, where he also witnessed meetings with the young Marconi. He was then relegated to the Faculty of Medicine of Perugia, without a real laboratory, disregarded by the national scientific community and unable to move to better equipped locations. Nevertheless, he proved to be a gifted teacher and popularizer of science. He published a comprehensive three-volume physics textbook that was widely used in Italy and abroad. Despite becoming an Italian citizen in 1894, Dessau's German origins led to his suspension from service during World War I. Furthermore, his Jewish identity made him a target of Nazi-fascist antisemitism. He was dismissed from both the University of Perugia and from the Italian Society of Physics, of which he had been a member since its beginning, fortunately escaping deportation.</description>
