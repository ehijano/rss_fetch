      <title>Majorana zero modes are the edge modes?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological phases are typically characterised by a topological invariant: winding number, which indicates the number of zero modes expected in a given phase. However, the winding number alone does not capture the qualitative differences between the modes within the same topological phase. In this work, we present an analytical solution for the zero-energy modes across various regimes of the phase diagram; a result that, to our knowledge, has not been reported previously in the literature. Through this solution, we characterise edge modes coexisting in a single phase and systematically classify them based on their spatial behaviour. Our analysis also identifies parameter regions where one or both zero modes are perfectly localised at the system edges. Finite and infinite systems were compared based on their spatial characteristics of zero modes. In addition, we provide a detailed analytical treatment of the characteristic equation, demonstrating that its roots offer further insight into the nature of the topological phase transitions. The whole study is based on a one-dimensional quantum Ising chain with long range interactions.</description>

      <title>Tunable lower critical fractal dimension for a non-equilibrium phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the role of spatial dimension and driving frequency in a non-equilibrium phase transition of a driven-dissipative interacting bosonic system. In this setting, spatial dimension is dictated by the shape of the external driving field. We consider both homogeneous driving configurations, which correspond to standard integer-dimensional systems, and fractal driving patterns, which give rise to a non-integer Hausdorff dimension for the spatial density. The onset of criticality is characterized by critical slowing down in the excited density dynamics as the system asymptotically approaches the steady state, signaling the closing of the Liouvillian frequency gap. We show that the lower critical dimension -- below which the non-equilibrium phase transition ceases to occur -- can be controlled continuously by the frequency detuning of the driving field.</description>

      <title>Realization of pure gyration in an on-chip superconducting microwave device</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Synthetic materials that emulate tight-binding Hamiltonians have enabled a wide range of advances in topological and non-Hermitian physics. A crucial requirement in such systems is the engineering of non-reciprocal couplings and synthetic magnetic fields. More broadly, the development of these capabilities in a manner compatible with quantum-coherent degrees of freedom remains an outstanding challenge, particularly for superconducting circuits, which are highly sensitive to magnetic fields. Here we demonstrate that pure gyration -- a non-reciprocal coupling with exactly matched magnitude but non-reciprocal $\pi$ phase contrast -- can be realized between degenerate states using only spatio-temporal modulation. Our experiments are performed using microwave superconducting resonators that are modulated using dc-SQUID arrays. We first show the existence of continuous exceptional surfaces in modulation parameter space where coupling with arbitrarily-large magnitude contrast can be achieved, with robust volumes of $\pi$ phase contrast contained within. We then demonstrate that intersection of these volumes necessarily gives rise to new continuous surfaces in parameter space where pure gyration is achieved. With this we experimentally demonstrate $&gt;58$ dB isolation and the first on-chip gyrator with only superconducting circuit elements. Our method is fully agnostic to physical implementation (classical or quantum) or frequency range and paves the way to large-scale non-reciprocal metamaterials.</description>

      <title>Controlling Casimir Effect in Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Networks have played a pivotal role in physics, mathematics, and biology, propelling the recent revolution in artificial intelligence. This paper studies quantum field theories on networks and proposes a novel junction condition on the node. The junction condition is consistent with energy conservation in the sense that the total energy flow into the node is zero. As an application, we explore the Casimir effect on networks. Remarkably, the Casimir force on one edge can be changed from attractive to repulsive by adjusting the lengths of the other edges, providing a straightforward way to control the Casimir effect. We begin by discussing the Casimir effect for $(1+1)$-dimensional free massless scalars on a simple network. We then extend this discussion to various types of networks and higher dimensions. Finally, we offer brief comments on some open questions.</description>

      <title>Phonon spectra and vibrational heat capacity of quasi-one-dimensional structures formed by rare gas atoms on the surface of carbon nanotube bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20460v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The features of phonon spectra and their effect on the vibrational heat capacity of linear chains of inert gas atoms adsorbed onto a substrate, which is the surface of nanotubes bound to a nanobundle. The influence of the substrate results both in a shift of the lower limit of the chain spectrum from zero, and in mechanical stress in the chain (its extension or compression) also. It is shown that in the case of a compressed chain, the non-central interaction between atoms is negative (repulsive), it results in a shift of the lower boundary of the spectrum of transverse vibrations to low frequencies and to a shortening of the part of the specific heat temperature dependence in which this dependence is close to exponential. Heterogeneity of the nanobundle structure can cause a change in the distances between atoms of the chain. It is shown both and analytically and numerically, that as a result of it, discrete levels with frequencies both above and below the quasi-continuous spectrum band can appear in the phonon spectrum of the chain. The discrete levels with frequencies below the quasi-continuous spectrum band lead to a further shortening of the temperature interval at which the temperature dependence of the specific heat is close to the exponential one.</description>

      <title>Adaptive quantum dynamics with the time-dependent variational Monte Carlo method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08575v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce an extension of the time-dependent variational Monte Carlo (tVMC) method that adaptively controls the expressivity of the variational quantum state during the simulation. This adaptive tVMC approach addresses numerical instabilities that arise when the variational ansatz is overparameterized or contains redundant degrees of freedom. Building on the concept of the local-in-time error (LITE), a measure of the deviation between variational and exact evolution, we introduce a procedure to quantify each parameter's contribution to reducing the LITE, using only quantities already computed in standard tVMC simulations. These relevance estimates guide the selective evolution of only the most significant parameters at each time step, while maintaining a prescribed level of accuracy. We benchmark the algorithm on quantum quenches in the one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model using both spin-Jastrow and restricted Boltzmann machine wave functions, with an emphasis on overparameterized regimes. The adaptive scheme significantly improves numerical stability and reduces the need for strong regularization, enabling reliable simulations with highly expressive variational ans\"atze.</description>
