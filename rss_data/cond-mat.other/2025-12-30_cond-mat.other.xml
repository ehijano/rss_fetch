      <title>Anomalous Transport In Low Dimension Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This dissertation presents a systematic theoretical investigation into realizing a condensed matter analogue of the Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME) in a quasi-planar, 2+1D system. The research establishes a conceptual bridge between the anomalous transport phenomena of high-energy physics and the emergent electronic properties of engineered honeycomb lattices. The central objective is the formulation of a low-energy effective Hamiltonian that incorporates the necessary ingredients for a CME-like effect. This is achieved by moving beyond pristine graphene, whose inherent sublattice symmetry precludes the formation of a mass gap necessary for defining robust pseudo-chiral states. The core of this work is a model based on a honeycomb lattice with explicitly broken sublattice symmetry, which introduces a band gap and endows the quasi-particles system with a well-defined pseudo-chirality based on sublattice polarization. A time-reversal symmetry-breaking parameter is introduced to asymmetrically modify the valley gaps, creating a controllable non-equilibrium imbalance analogous to the chiral chemical potential in relativistic systems. A key finding is the validation of the physical model consistency; through commutator calculations, the total angular momentum - comprising both orbital and an emergent lattice spin component - is shown to be a conserved quantity. This research successfully transforms the abstract possibility of a 2D CME into a concrete, self-consistent theoretical framework, detailing the precise symmetry conditions required for its manifestation.</description>

      <title>On the comparison of models and experiments in the study of DNA open states: the problem of degrees of freedom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simple mechanical models of DNA play an important role in studying the dynamics of its open states. The main requirement when developing a DNA model is the correct selection of its effective potentials and parameters based on experimental data. At the same time, various experiments allow us to "see" different types of DNA open states. Consideration of this feature is one of the most important conditions in the development, optimization, and parameterization of any mechanical model. Violation of this condition, i.e., the comparison of incomparable characteristics, leads to critical errors. The present investigation is devoted to the problem of degrees of freedom of DNA bases taken into account in mechanical models. Using the Peyrard-Bishop-Dauxois model as an example, two types of errors in interpreting experimental data when compared with the model are examined. The first one is a mismatch between the open state types in the model and experiment. The second one is an incorrect specification of the "threshold coordinate" of the open state. The concept of the effective total threshold coordinate of the radial separation of DNA strands for registration of opening is introduced. It is shown that correct interpretation of experimental data can actually eliminate discrepancies with theory.</description>

      <title>Motion-driven quantum dissipation in an open electronic system with nonlocal interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13163v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study excitations and dissipation in two infinite parallel metallic plates undergoing relative motion. The degrees of freedom of the electrons in both plates are modeled using the 1+2 dimensional Dirac field, and a nonlocal potential is selected to describe the interaction between the two plates. The internal relative motion is introduced via a Galilean boost, with one plate assumed to slide relative to the other. We then calculate the effective action of the system and derive the vacuum occupation number in momentum space using a perturbative method. Numerical plots reveal that the vacuum occupation number, as a function of momentum, is isotropic for a motion speed $v = 0$ and anisotropic for nonzero $v$. The relative motion induces energy transfer between the plates, leading to on-shell excitations in a manner analogous to the dissipative process of the Schwinger effect. Consequently, we study the motion-induced dissipation effects and the dissipative forces through the quantum action. Numerical results demonstrate that both the imaginary part of the quantum action due to the motion boost and the dissipative force exhibit a threshold as functions of $v$, and both are positively correlated with $v$.</description>

      <title>On the relation between fractional charge and statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15857v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit an argument, originally given by Kivelson and Ro\v{c}ek, for why the existence of fractional charge necessarily implies fractional statistics. In doing so, we resolve a contradiction in the original argument, and in the case of a $\nu = 1/m$ Laughlin holes, we also show that the standard relation between fractional charge and statistics is necessary by an argument based on a t'Hooft anomaly in a global one-form ${\mathcal Z}_m$ symmetry.</description>
