      <title>From Graph Properties to Graph Parameters: Tight Bounds for Counting on Small Subgraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph property is a function $\Phi$ that maps every graph to {0, 1} and is invariant under isomorphism. In the $\#IndSub(\Phi)$ problem, given a graph $G$ and an integer $k$, the task is to count the number of $k$-vertex induced subgraphs $G'$ with $\Phi(G')=1$. $\#IndSub(\Phi)$ can be naturally generalized to graph parameters, that is, to functions $\Phi$ on graphs that do not necessarily map to {0, 1}: now the task is to compute the sum $\sum_{G'} \Phi(G')$ taken over all $k$-vertex induced subgraphs $G'$. This problem setting can express a wider range of counting problems (for instance, counting $k$-cycles or $k$-matchings) and can model problems involving expected values (for instance, the expected number of components in a subgraph induced by $k$ random vertices). Our main results are lower bounds on $\#IndSub(\Phi)$ in this setting, which simplify, generalize, and tighten the recent lower bounds of D\"oring, Marx, and Wellnitz [STOC'24] in various ways.
  (1) We show a lower bound for every nontrivial edge-monotone graph parameter $\Phi$ with finite codomain (not only for parameters that take value in {0, 1}).
  (2) The lower bound is tight: we show that, assuming ETH, there is no $f(k)n^{o(k)}$ time algorithm.
  (3) The lower bound applies also to the modular counting versions of the problem.
  (4) The lower bound applies also to the multicolored version of the problem.
  We can extend the #W[1]-hardness result to the case when the codomain of $\Phi$ is not finite, but has size at most $(1 - \varepsilon)\sqrt{k}$ on $k$-vertex graphs. However, if there is no bound on the size of the codomain, the situation changes significantly: for example, there is a nontrivial edge-monotone function $\Phi$ where the size of the codomain is $k$ on $k$-vertex graphs and $\#IndSub(\Phi)$ is FPT.</description>

      <title>Counting Small Induced Subgraphs: Hardness via Fourier Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a fixed graph property $\Phi$ and integer $k \geq 1$, the problem $\#\mathrm{IndSub}(\Phi,k)$ asks to count the induced $k$-vertex subgraphs satisfying $\Phi$ in an input graph $G$. If $\Phi$ is trivial on $k$-vertex graphs (i.e., if $\Phi$ contains either all or no $k$-vertex graphs), this problem is trivial. Otherwise we prove, among other results:
  - If $\Phi$ is edge-monotone (i.e., closed under deleting edges), then $\#\mathrm{IndSub}(\Phi,k)$ cannot be solved in time $n^{o(k)}$ assuming ETH. This strengthens a result by D\"oring, Marx and Wellnitz [STOC 2024] that only ruled out an exponent of $o(\sqrt{\log k}/ \log \log k)$. Our results also hold when counting modulo fixed primes.
  - If there is some fixed $\varepsilon &gt; 0$ such that at most $(2-\varepsilon)^{\binom{k}{2}}$ graphs on $k$ vertices satisfy $\Phi$, then $\#\mathrm{IndSub}(\Phi,k)$ cannot be solved in time $n^{o(k/\sqrt{\log k})}$ assuming ETH. Our results hold even when each of the graphs in $\Phi$ may come with an arbitrary individual weight. This generalizes previous results for hereditary properties by Focke and Roth [SIAM J.\ Comput.\ 2024] up to a $\sqrt{\log k}$ factor in the exponent of the lower bound.
  - If $\Phi$ only depends on the number of edges, then $\#\mathrm{IndSub}(\Phi,k)$ cannot be solved in time $n^{o(k)}$ assuming ETH. This improves on a lower bound by Roth, Schmitt and Wellnitz [FOCS 2020] that only ruled out an exponent of $o(k / \sqrt{\log k})$.
  In all cases, we also obtain $\mathsf{\#W[1]}$-hardness if $k$ is part of the input and the problem is parameterized by $k$. We also obtain lower bounds on the Weisfeiler-Leman dimension. Our results follow from relatively straightforward Fourier analysis, and our paper subsumes most of the known $\mathsf{\#W[1]}$-hardness results known in the area, often with tighter lower bounds under ETH.</description>

      <title>Gate-based quantum simulation of Gaussian bosonic circuits on exponentially many modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a framework for simulating, on an $(n+1)$-qubit quantum computer, the action of a Gaussian Bosonic (GB) circuit on a state over $2^n$ modes. Specifically, we encode the initial bosonic state's expectation values over quadrature operators (and their covariance matrix) as an input qubit-state. This is then evolved by a quantum circuit that effectively implements the symplectic propagators induced by the GB gates. We find families of GB circuits and initial states leading to efficient quantum simulations. For this purpose, we introduce a dictionary that maps between GB and qubit gates such that particle- (non-particle-) preserving GB gates lead to real (imaginary) time evolutions at the qubit level. For the special case of particle-preserving circuits, we present a BQP-complete GB decision problem, indicating that GB evolutions of Gaussian states on exponentially many modes are as powerful as universal quantum computers. We also perform numerical simulations of an interferometer on $\sim8$ billion modes, illustrating the power of our framework.</description>

      <title>Quantum Query-Space Lower Bounds Using Branching Programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06872v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Branching programs are quite popular for studying time-space lower bounds. Bera et al. recently introduced the model of generalized quantum branching program aka. GQBP that generalized two earlier models of quantum branching programs. In this work we study a restricted version of GQBP with the motivation of proving bounds on the query-space requirement of quantum-query circuits. We show the first explicit query-space lower bound for our restricted version. We prove that the well-studied OR$_n$ decision problem, given a promise that at most one position of an $n$-sized Boolean array is a 1, satisfies the bound $Q^2 s = \Omega(n^2)$, where $Q$ denotes the number of queries and $s$ denotes the width of the GQBP. We then generalize the problem to show that the same bound holds for deciding between two strings with a constant Hamming distance; this gives us query-space lower bounds on problems such as Parity and Majority. Our results produce an alternative proof of the $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$-lower bound on the query complexity of any non-constant symmetric Boolean function.</description>

      <title>Incompressibility and spectral gaps of random circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07478v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Random reversible and quantum circuits form random walks on the alternating group $\mathrm{Alt}(2^n)$ and unitary group $\mathrm{SU}(2^n)$, respectively. Known bounds on the spectral gap for the $t$-th moment of these random walks have inverse-polynomial dependence in both $n$ and $t$. We prove that the gap for random reversible circuits is $\Omega(n^{-3})$ for all $t\geq 1$, and the gap for random quantum circuits is $\Omega(n^{-3})$ for $t \leq \Theta(2^{n/2})$. These gaps are independent of $t$ in the respective regimes. We can further improve both gaps to $n^{-1}/\mathrm{polylog}(n, t)$ for $t\leq 2^{\Theta(n)}$, which is tight up to polylog factors. Our spectral gap results have a number of consequences:
  1) Random reversible circuits with $\mathcal{O}(n^4 t)$ gates form multiplicative-error $t$-wise independent (even) permutations for all $t\geq 1$; for $t \leq \Theta(2^{n/6.1})$, we show that $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(n^2 t)$ gates suffice.
  2) Random quantum circuits with $\mathcal{O}(n^4 t)$ gates form multiplicative-error unitary $t$-designs for $t \leq \Theta(2^{n/2})$; for $t\leq \Theta(2^{2n/5})$, we show that $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(n^2t)$ gates suffice.
  3) The robust quantum circuit complexity of random circuits grows linearly for an exponentially long time, proving the robust Brown--Susskind conjecture [BS18,BCHJ+21].
  Our spectral gap bounds are proven by reducing random quantum circuits to a more structured walk: a modification of the ``$\mathrm{PFC}$ ensemble'' from [MPSY24] together with an expander on the alternating group due to Kassabov [Kas07a], for which we give an efficient implementation using reversible circuits. In our reduction, we approximate the structured walk with local random circuits without losing the gap, which uses tools from the study of frustration-free Hamiltonians.</description>
