      <title>Dynamical structure of AGM over finite fields with order congruent to 5 mod 8</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by classical works of Gauss and Euler on the AGM, Ono and his collaborators investigated the union of AGM sequences over finite fields $\mathbb{F}_q$, where $q \equiv 3 \bmod 4$, which they refer to as swarms of jellyfish. A recent preprint extends some of their results to all finite fields with odd characteristic. For $q \equiv 5 \bmod 8$, we reveal finer details about the structure of the connected components, which turn out to be variants of jellyfish with longer and branched tentacles. Moreover, we determine the total population of these swarms in terms of the celebrated base "congruent number" elliptic curve.</description>

      <title>A note on variants of Buchstab's identity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The author proves variants of Buchstab's identity on sieve functions, refining the previous work on new iteration rules of Brady. The main tool used in the proof is a special form of combinatorial identities related to the binomial coefficients. As a by--product, the author obtains better inequalities of $F_{\kappa}(s)$ and $f_{\kappa}(s)$ for dimensions $\kappa &gt; 1$.</description>

      <title>Wolstenholme's theorem over Gaussian integers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper establishes an extension of Wolstenholme's theorem to the ring of Gaussian integers $\mathbb{Z}[i]$. For a prime $p &gt; 7$, we prove that the sum $S_p$ of inverses of Gaussian integers in the set $\{n+mi \mid 1 \leq n, m \leq p-1, \gcd(p, mi+n)=1\}$ satisfies the congruence $S_p \equiv 0 \pmod{p^4}$. We further generalize this result to higher-power sums $S_p^{(k)}$, demonstrating structured divisibility patterns modulo powers of $p$. We propose some conjectures generalising the connections between classical Wolstenholme's theorem and binomial coefficients. Special cases and irregularities for small primes ($p \leq 1000$) are explicitly computed and tabulated.</description>

      <title>On an iterated arithmetic function problem of Erdos and Graham</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Erd\H{o}s and Graham define $g(n) = n + \phi(n)$ and the iterated application $g_k(n) = g(g_{k-1}(n))$. They ask for solutions of $g_{k+r}(n) = 2 g_{k}(n)$ and observe $g_{k+2}(10) = 2 g_{k}(10)$ and $g_{k+2}(94) = 2 g_{k}(94)$. We show that understanding the case $r = 2$ is equivalent to understanding all solutions of the equation $\phi(n) + \phi(n + \phi(n)) = n$ and find the explicit solutions $ n = 2^{\ell} \cdot \left\{1,3,5,7,35,47\right\}$. This list of solutions is possibly complete: any other solution derives from a number $n=2^{\ell} p$ where $p \geq 10^{10}$ is a prime satisfying $\phi((3p-1)/4) = (p+1)/2$. Primes with this property seem to be very rare and maybe no such prime exists.</description>

      <title>On distribution of supersingular primes of abelian varieties and K3 surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let K be a global field and let X/K be a non-CM abelian variety or non-CM K3 surface. We prove that the density of the supersingular primes of X is zero. When K is a number field, we obtain asymptotic upper bounds of the counting function for supersingular primes by applying the effective Chebotarev density theorem for infinite Galois extensions due to Serre.</description>

      <title>Regular version of the inverse Galois problem for skew fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In order to extend the study of the regular version of the regular inverse Galois problem to skew fields, we generalize the definition of regular field extensions for commutative fields to the case of arbitrary fields. We then propose a general version of the inverse Galois property and show that for a field k, the study of the class InvReg(k) of non-trivial regular extensions of k satisfying this property constitutes a natural generalization of the classical regular inverse Galois problem. Next, we use recent results from Behajaina, Deschamps, and Legrand on the inverse Galois problem in the noncommutative setting to show that certain skew fraction fields h(t, {\sigma}, {\delta}) belong to the class InvReg(h). Finally, we generalize Behajaina's method to construct extensions belonging to InvReg(h) that are not of the form h(t, {\sigma}) with {\sigma} an automorphism of finite order.</description>

      <title>A Central Limit Theorem for Linear Combinations of Logarithms of Dirichlet $L$-functions Sampled at the Zeros of the Zeta Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $L(s, \chi_1), \ldots, L(s, \chi_N)$ be primitive Dirichlet $L$-functions different from the Riemann zeta function. Under suitable hypotheses we prove that any linear combination $a_1\log|L(\rho,\chi_1)|+\dots+a_N\log|L(\rho,\chi_N)|$ has an approximately normal distribution as $T\to \infty $ with mean $0$ and variance $ \tfrac12 \big({a_1}^2+\dots+{a_N}^2\big)\log\log T.$ Here $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_N \in \mathbb{R}$, and $\rho$ runs over the nontrivial zeros of the zeta function with $0&lt; \Im\rho \leq T$. From this we deduce that the vectors $\big(\log|L(\rho,\chi_1)|/\sqrt{ \frac12 \log\log T}, \ldots, \log|L(\rho,\chi_N)|/\sqrt{\frac12 \log\log T}\,\big)$ have approximately an $N$-variate normal distribution whose components are approximately mutually independent as $T\to \infty$. We apply these results to study the proportion of the $\rho$ that are zeros or $a$-values of linear combinations of the form $c_1 L(\rho, \chi_1)+ \cdots + c_N L(\rho, \chi_N)$ with complex $c_i$ as coefficients.</description>

      <title>Cotangent power sums and character coordinates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that certain sums studied in two recent papers are basically character coordinates (as they are called in the literature). These sums involve values of Dirichlet characters and powers of $\cot(\pi k/n)$, $1\le k\le n-1$. We also show that a basic tool for the study of these sums was already given in 1987, in the form of the character coordinates of so-called cotangent numbers. By means of this tool, we obtain the results of the said papers in a lucid way and even in a simpler form. We also show that the coefficients of the linear combinations used in the said papers are essentially the same.</description>

      <title>Sums of infinite series involving the Dirichlet lambda function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $$ \lambda(s)=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{(2n+1)^{s}},~\textrm{Re}(s)&gt;1 $$ be Dirichlet's lambda function, which was firstly studied by Euler in the real axis under the notation $N(s)$. In this paper, by applying the partial fractional decomposition of the function $\pi\tan(\pi x)$, the explicit calculation of the integral $\int_0^{\frac12}x^{2m-1}\cos(2k\pi x) dx$ and the zeta-values representation of the integral $\int_0^{\frac12}x^{m-1}\log\cos(\pi x)dx$, we establish closed-form expressions for several classes of infinite series involving $\lambda(s)$. As a by product, we show that the lambda-values $\lambda(2k)$ appears as the constant terms of the Eisenstein series for the congruence subgroup $\Gamma_{0}(2).$</description>

      <title>Powerfree integers and Fourier bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a general approach for showing when a set of integers $\mathscr{A}$ has infinitely many $k^{th}$ powerfree numbers. In particular, we show that if the Fourier transform of $\mathscr{A}$ satisfies certain $L^{\infty}$ and $L^{1}$ bounds, and is also ``decreasing'' in some sense, then $\mathscr{A}$ contains infinitely many $k^{th}$ powerfree numbers. We then use this method to show that there are infinitely many cubefree palindromes in base $b$ for $b\ge 1100$.</description>

      <title>The $k$-elongated plane partition function modulo small powers of $5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Andrews and Paule revisited combinatorial structures known as the $k$-elongated partition diamonds, which were introduced in connection with the study of the broken $k$-diamond partitions. They found the generating function for the number $d_k(n)$ of partitions obtained by summing the links of such partition diamonds of length $n$ and discovered congruences for $d_k(n)$ using modular forms. Since then, congruences for $d_k(n)$ modulo certain powers of primes have been proven via elementary means and modular forms by many authors, most recently Banerjee and Smoot who established an infinite family of congruences for $d_5(n)$ modulo powers of $5$. We extend in this paper the list of known results for $d_k(n)$ by proving infinite families of congruences for $d_k(n)$ modulo $5,25$, and $125$ using classical $q$-series manipulations and $5$-dissections.</description>

      <title>On the Cycle Structure of the Metacommutation Map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cohn and Kumar showed that the permutation on the set of the classes of left associated Hurwitz primes above an odd prime $p$ induced through metacommutation by a Hurwitz prime $\xi$ of norm $q$ has either $0$, $1$ or $2$ fixed points, and that the permutation $\tau_{\xi,p}$ induced on the non-fixed points splits into cycles of the same length. Here we show how to find the length of those cycles, in terms of $p$ and $\xi$, using cyclotomic polynomials over $\mathbb{F}_p$. We then show that, given an odd prime $p$, there is always a prime quaternion $\xi$ such that the permutation $\tau_{\xi,p}$ has only one non-trivial cycle of length $p$. Finally, we give conditions for a prime $\pi$ of norm $p$ to be a fixed point of the aforementioned metacommutation map.</description>

      <title>Construction and Applications of Trisections of Low Genus on Del Pezzo Surfaces of Degree One</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider a rational elliptic surface over a field $k$ with characteristic $0$ given by $\mathcal{E}: y^2 = x^3 + f(t)x + g(t)$, with $f,g\in k[t]$, $\text{deg}(f) \leq 4$ and $\text{deg}(g) \leq 6$. If all the bad fibres are irreducible, such a surface comes from the blow-up of a del Pezzo surface of degree one. We are interested in studying multisections, curves which intersect each fibre a fixed number of times, specifically, trisections (three times). Many configurations of singularities on a trisection lead to a lower genus. Here, we focus on of several them: by specifying conditions on the coefficients $f,g$ of the surface $\mathcal{E}$, and looking at trisections which pass through a given point three times, we obtain a pencil of cubics on such surfaces. Our construction allows us to prove in several cases the Zariski density of the rational points. This is especially interesting since the results in this regard are partial for del Pezzo surfaces of degree one.</description>

      <title>Harmonic Morphisms of Arithmetical Structures on Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\phi \colon \Gamma_2 \rightarrow \Gamma_1$ be a harmonic morphism of connected graphs. We show that an arithmetical structure on $\Gamma_1$ can be pulled back via $\phi$ to an arithmetical structure on $\Gamma_2$. We then show that some results of Baker and Norine on the critical groups for the usual Laplacian extend to arithmetical critical groups, which are abelian groups determined by the generalized Laplacian associated to these arithmetical structures. In particular, we show that the morphism $\phi$ induces a surjective group homomorphism from the arithmetical critical group of $\Gamma_2$ to that of $\Gamma_1$ and an injective group homomorphism from the arithmetical critical group of $\Gamma_1$ to that of $\Gamma_2$. Finally, we prove a Riemann-Hurwitz formula for arithmetical structures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2111.10160v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider integral models of Hilbert modular varieties with Iwahori level structure at primes over p, first proving a Kodaira-Spencer isomorphism that gives a concise description of their dualizing sheaves. We then analyze fibres of the degeneracy maps to Hilbert modular varieties of level prime to p and deduce the vanishing of higher direct images of structure and dualizing sheaves, generalizing prior work with Kassaei and Sasaki (for p unramified in the totally real field F). We apply the vanishing results to prove flatness of the finite morphisms in the resulting Stein factorizations, and combine them with the Kodaira-Spencer isomorphism to simplify and generalize the construction of Hecke operators at primes over p on Hilbert modular forms (integrally and mod p).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.01229v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by a classical result of R\'enyi, we prove that every even integer $N\geq 4$ can be written as the sum of a prime and a number with at most 395 prime factors. We also show, under assumption of the generalised Riemann hypothesis, that this result can be improved to 31 prime factors.</description>

      <title>Compactifications of Iwahori-level Hilbert modular varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.06922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.06922v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study minimal and toroidal compactifications of $p$-integral models of Hilbert modular varieties. We review the theory in the setting of Iwahori level at primes over $p$, and extend it to certain finer level structures. We also prove extensions to compactifications of recent results on Iwahori-level Kodaira--Spencer isomorphisms and cohomological vanishing for degeneracy maps. Finally we apply the theory to study $q$-expansions of Hilbert modular forms, especially the effect of Hecke operators at primes over $p$ over general base rings.</description>

      <title>Counting integral points on symmetric varieties with applications to arithmetic statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.01050v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we combine Bhargava's geometry-of-numbers methods with the dynamical point-counting methods of Eskin--McMullen and Benoist--Oh to develop a new technique for counting integral points on symmetric varieties lying within fundamental domains for coregular representations. As applications, we study the distribution of the $2$-torsion subgroup of the class group in thin families of cubic number fields, as well as the distribution of the $2$-Selmer groups in thin families of elliptic curves over $\mathbb{Q}$. For example, our results suggest that the existence of a generator of the ring of integers with small norm has an increasing effect on the average size of the $2$-torsion subgroup of the class group, relative to the Cohen--Lenstra predictions.</description>

Abstract: We prove resurgence properties for the Borel transform of a formal power series associated to elements in the Habiro ring that come from radial limits of partial theta series via strange identities.

      <title>Patching for \'etale algebras and the period-index problem for higher degree Galois cohomology groups over Hensel semi-global fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.20119v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we present a partial generalization of the field patching technique initially proposed by Harbater-Hartmann to Hensel semi-global fields, i.e., function fields of curves over excellent henselian discretely valued fields. More specifically, we show that patching holds for \'etale algebras over such fields and a suitable set of overfields. Within this new framework, we further establish a local-global principle for higher degree Galois cohomology groups over Hensel semi-global fields. As an application, we extend a recent result regarding a uniform period-index bound for higher degree Galois cohomology classes by Harbater-Hartmann-Krashen to Hensel semi-global fields. Additionally, we prove such a bound for coefficient groups of non-prime orders.</description>

      <title>An Analytical Exploration of the Erd\"os-Moser Equation $ \sum_{i=1}^{m-1} i^k = m^k $ Using Approximation Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13146v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Erd\"{o}s-Moser equation $ \sum_{i=1}^{m - 1} i^k = m^k $ is a longstanding challenge in number theory, with the only known integer solution being $ (k,m) = (1,3) $. Here, we investigate whether other solutions might exist by using the Euler-MacLaurin formula to approximate the discrete sum $ S(m-1,k) $ with a continuous function $ S_{\mathbb{R}}(m-1,k) $. We then analyze the resulting approximate polynomial $ P_{\mathbb{R}}(m) = S_{\mathbb{R}}(m-1,k) - m^k $ under the rational root theorem to look for integer roots. Our approximation confirms that for $ k=1 $, the only solution is $ m=3 $, and for $ k \geq 2 $ it suggests there are no further positive integer solutions. However, because Diophantine problems demand exactness, any omission of correction terms in the Euler-MacLaurin formula could mask genuine solutions. Thus, while our method offers valuable insights into the behavior of the Erd\"{o}s-Moser equation and illustrates the analytical challenges involved, it does not constitute a definitive proof. We discuss the implications of these findings and emphasize that fully rigorous approaches, potentially incorporating prime-power constraints, are needed to conclusively resolve the conjecture.</description>

      <title>Equidistribution of continued fraction convergents in $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{Z}_m)$ with an application to local discrepancy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.08504v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider the sequence of continued fraction convergents $p_n/q_n$ to a random irrational number. We study the distribution of the sequences $p_n \pmod{m}$ and $q_n \pmod{m}$ with a fixed modulus $m$, and more generally, the distribution of the $2 \times 2$ matrix with entries $p_{n-1}, p_n, q_{n-1}, q_n \pmod{m}$. Improving the strong law of large numbers due to Sz\"usz, Moeckel, Jager and Liardet, we establish the central limit theorem and the law of the iterated logarithm, as well as the weak and the almost sure invariance principles. As an application, we find the limit distribution of the maximum and the minimum of the Birkhoff sum for the irrational rotation with the indicator of an interval as test function. We also compute the normalizing constant in a classical limit law for the same Birkhoff sum due to Kesten, and dispel a misconception about its dependence on the test interval.</description>

      <title>Smooth linear eigenvalue statistics on random covers of compact hyperbolic surfaces -- A central limit theorem and almost sure RMT statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.18663v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study smooth linear spectral statistics of twisted Laplacians on random $n$-covers of a fixed compact hyperbolic surface $X$. We consider two aspects of such statistics. The first is the fluctuations of such statistics in a small energy window around a fixed energy level when averaged over the space of all degree $n$ covers of $X$. The second is the energy variance of a typical surface.
  In the first case, we show a central limit theorem. Specifically, we show that the distribution of such fluctuations tends to a Gaussian with variance given by the corresponding quantity for the Gaussian Orthogonal/Unitary Ensemble (GOE/GUE). In the second case, we show that the energy variance of a typical random $n$-cover is that of the GOE/GUE. In both cases, we consider a double limit where first we let $n$, the covering degree, go to $\infty$ then let $L\to \infty$ where $1/L$ is the window length.</description>

      <title>Gamma factors and root numbers of pairs for the Galois and the linear model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02850v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using harmonic analysis on Harish-Chandra Schwartz spaces of various spherical spaces, we extend a relative local converse theorem of Youngbin Ok for the Galois model of p-adic GLn, from the class of cuspidal representations to that of square integrable representations, which is its optimal form. We also prove a variant of this result for linear models by the same method. The above statements are luckily non empty as we verify triviality results for gamma and epsilon factors of pairs of distinguished representations at the central value s=1/2. Along the way, we offer a new proof of conjectures of D. Prasad and D. Ramakrishnan on local components of symplectic cuspidal automorphic representations, and root numbers of pairs of symplectic representations.</description>

      <title>Generalized Hofstadter functions $G, H$ and beyond: numeration systems and discrepancy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12615v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hofstadter's $G$ function is recursively defined via $G(0)=0$ and then $G(n)=n-G(G(n-1))$. Following Hofstadter, a family $(F_k)$ of similar functions is obtained by varying the number $k$ of nested recursive calls in this equation. We study here some Fibonacci-like sequences that are deeply connected with these functions $F_k$. In particular, the Zeckendorf theorem can be adapted to provide digital expansions via sums of terms of these sequences. On these digital expansions, the functions $F_k$ are acting as right shifts of the digits. These Fibonacci-like sequences can be expressed in terms of zeros of the polynomial $X^k{-}X^{k-1}{-}1$. Considering now the discrepancy of each function $F_k$, i.e., the maximal distance between $F_k$ and its linear equivalent, we retrieve the fact that this discrepancy is finite exactly when $k \le 4$. Thanks to that, we solve two twenty-year-old OEIS conjectures stating how close the functions $F_3$ and $F_4$ are from the integer parts of their linear equivalents. Moreover we establish that $F_k$ can coincide exactly with such an integer part only when $k\le 2$, while $F_k$ is almost additive exactly when $k \le 4$. Finally, a nice fractal shape a la Rauzy has been encountered when investigating the discrepancy of $F_3$. Almost all this article has been formalized and verified in the Coq/Rocq proof assistant.</description>

      <title>Finite analogs of partition bias related to hook length two and a variant of Sylvester's map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17571v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we count the total number of hooks of length two in all odd partitions of $n$ and all distinct partitions of $n$ with a bound on the largest part of the partitions. We generalize inequalities of Ballantine, Burson, Craig, Folsom and Wen by showing there is a bias in the number of hooks of length two in all odd partitions over all distinct partitions of $n$ in presence of a bound on the largest part. To establish such a bias, we use a variant of Sylvester's map. Then, we conjecture a similar finite bias for a weighted count of hooks of length two and prove it when we remove the bound on the largest part.</description>
