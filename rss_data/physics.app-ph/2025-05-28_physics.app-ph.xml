      <title>Curvature-Guided Mechanics and Design of Spinodal and Shell-Based Architected Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Additively manufactured (AM) architected materials have enabled unprecedented control over mechanical properties of engineered materials. While lattice architectures have played a key role in these advances, they suffer from stress concentrations at sharp joints and bending-dominated behavior at high relative densities, limiting their mechanical efficiency. Additionally, high-resolution AM techniques often result in low-throughput or costly fabrication, restricting manufacturing scalability of these materials. Aperiodic spinodal architected materials offer a promising alternative by leveraging low-curvature architectures that can be fabricated through techniques beyond AM. Enabled by phase separation processes, these architectures exhibit tunable mechanical properties and enhanced defect tolerance by tailoring their curvature distributions. However, the relation between curvature and their anisotropic mechanical behavior remains poorly understood. In this work, we develop a theoretical framework to quantify the role of curvature in governing the anisotropic stiffness and strength of shell-based spinodal architected materials. We introduce geometric metrics that predict the distribution of stretching and bending energies under different loading conditions, bridging the gap between curvature in doubly curved shell-based morphologies and their mechanical anisotropy. We validate our framework through finite element simulations and microscale experiments, demonstrating its utility in designing mechanically robust spinodal architectures. This study provides fundamental insights into curvature-driven mechanics, guiding the optimization of next-generation architected materials for engineering applications.</description>

      <title>Enhanced bandwidth in radiation sensors operating at the fundamental temperature fluctuation noise limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Temperature-based radiation detectors are an essential tool for long optical wavelengths detection even if they often suffer from important bandwidth limitations. Their responsivity, and hence their noise equivalent power (NEP), typically degrade at frequencies exceeding the cutoff set by their characteristic thermal response time ($\tau_\text{th}$), i.e., at $\omega &gt; \tau_\text{th}^{-1}$. Here we show that this bandwidth limitation can be broken when a radiation sensor operates at its fundamental temperature fluctuation noise limit. The key enabler of this demonstration is a nanomechanical sensor in which frequency stability is limited by fundamental temperature fluctuations over an unprecedentedly large bandwidth of 54 $\text{Hz}$. In this range, the sensor performance remains within a factor 3 from its peak detectivity ($D_T^* = 7.4 \times 10^9~\mathrm{cm \cdot Hz^{1/2} W^{-1}}$) even though the thermal cutoff frequency is 30 times lower (i.e., $1/2\mathrm{\pi} \tau_\text{th} = 1.8~\text{Hz}$). We also derive and validate experimentally closed-form expression predicting maximum bandwidth enhancement in the context of nanomechanical resonators interfaced with a closed-loop frequency tracking scheme.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Macromolecular Proton Fraction Imaging using Pulsed Spin-Lock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Purpose: Recent studies have shown that spin-lock MRI can simplify quantitative magnetization transfer (MT) by eliminating its dependency on water pool parameters, removing the need for a T1 map in macromolecular proton fraction (MPF) quantification. However, its application is often limited by the requirement for long radiofrequency (RF) pulse durations, which are constrained by RF hardware capabilities despite remaining within specific absorption rate (SAR) safety limits.
  Methods: To address this challenge, we propose a novel method, MPF mapping using pulsed spin-lock (MPF-PSL). MPF-PSL employs a pulsed spin-lock train with intermittent free precession periods, enabling extended total spin-lock durations without exceeding hardware and specific absorption rate limits. A comprehensive analytical framework was developed to model the magnetization dynamics of the two-pool MT system under pulsed spin-lock, demonstrating that MPF-PSL achieves MT-specific quantification while minimizing confounding effects from the water pool. The proposed method is validated with Bloch-McConnell simulations, phantoms, and in vivo studies at 3T.
  Results: Both Bloch-McConnell simulations and phantom validation demonstrated that MPF-PSL exhibits robust insensitivity to water pool parameters while enabling high-SNR MPF quantification. In vivo validation studies confirmed the method's clinical utility in detecting collagen deposition in patients with liver fibrosis.
  Conclusion: MPF-PSL presents a practical solution for quantitative MT imaging, with strong potential for clinical applications.</description>

      <title>Giant electro-optic coefficient in single crystal barium titanate on oxide insulator based Mach-Zehnder interferometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electro-optic modulators are indispensable components of modern day photonic integrated circuits (PICs). Recently lithium niobate has emerged as a key material to realize large-bandwidth high-speed modulation, but next-generation modulators require high-density integration, low cost, low power and high performance simultaneously, which are difficult to achieve with established integrated lithium niobate photonics platforms due to its limited electro-optic coefficient. Leveraging its exceptional Pockels coefficient, barium titanate (BTO) in the thin film form has emerged as a promising alternative but the electro-optic coefficients reported in thin-film BTO often fall short of bulk values due to challenges in film growth and waveguide fabrication. Here, we report, to the best of our knowledge, the largest Pockels coefficient (r42) of 1268 pm/V in thin film BTO platform, which is very close to the bulk value. We measure it by using an unbalanced Mach-Zehnder interferometer, fabricated by an optimized wet-etching method for realising single-mode waveguides in single-crystal barium titanate-on-insulator grown by pulsed laser deposition. This giant r42 is extracted from a device in which the optical mode is fully confined within a single-crystal BTO waveguide. This approach contrasts with previous designs where the core material - typically silicon or silicon nitride - supports only partial confinement, resulting in an evanescent overlap with a multi-crystalline BTO layer. This highly confined BTO on insulator electro-optic modulation technology may significantly advance the field of ultra-low-power integrated photonic devices and allows for the realization of next-generation efficient and compact photonic circuits.</description>

      <title>Influence of thickness on magnetic properties of RF-sputtered amorphous CoNbZr thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Amorphous sputtered Co-based thin films are widely used as soft magnetic materials in applications such as sensors, inductors and magnetic flux concentrators. The magnetic properties of these films can be controlled by deposition parameters like film thickness, argon pressure, deposition rate and others. In this study, we present a detailed investigation of the magnetic properties of RF-sputtered Co$_{91}$Nb$_7$Zr$_2$ films with thicknesses ranging from 52 nm to 1040 nm. These amorphous films exhibit an average saturation magnetisation of 1.01(4) MA/m. As the film thickness increases, there is a significant decrease in coercivity, remanent-to-saturation magnetisation ratio M$_r$/M$_s$, and maximum permeability. The change in macroscopic magnetic properties is also reflected by the domain structure. At a thickness of 52 nm, the remanent domain state shows irregular domains, while films thicknesses above 208 nm exhibit flux-closure domain structures instead. The thickness-dependent modifications are attributed to the transition between N\'eel and Bloch type domain walls, which is expected to occur at approximately 84 nm.</description>

      <title>Quantum Walk Comb in a Dual Waveguide Quantum Cascade Laser</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ring quantum cascade lasers (QCLs) proved to be a versatile tool for generating tunable and stable frequency combs in the mid infrared range in the form of quantum walk combs. By homogeneously integrating a racetrack QCL with a passive waveguide, which lays on top of the active region plane and therefore can be designed to be fully independent from the laser geometry, we improve the light outcoupling from the ring by more than 2 orders of magnitude reaching a maximum output power of 120 mW. In addition, we show that it is possible to achieve quantum walk comb operation in the devices under analysis. Finally, we prove that we can change the light dispersion by tuning the parameters of the passive waveguide, with a direct impact on the behavior of the generated comb.</description>

      <title>Ultrasonic spin pumping in the antiferromagnetic acoustic resonator $\alpha-\text{Fe}_2\text{O}_3$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in magnon spintronics have ignited interest in the interactions between the spin and elastic subsystems of magnetic materials. These interactions suggest a dynamic connection between collective excitations of spins, quantized as magnons, and elastic waves generated by perturbations in the crystal lattice, quantized as phonons. Both magnons and their associated magnon-phonon excitations can act as sources of spin pumping from magnetic materials into non-magnetic metals. Although a considerable body of research has focused on spin pumping via elastic waves in ferromagnets, similar investigations involving antiferromagnets have yet to be undertaken. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate for the first time the feasibility of generating spin currents at ultrasonic frequencies of acoustic resonance in antiferromagnetic crystal hematite $\alpha-\text{Fe}_2\text{O}_3$ at room temperature. We provide both theoretical and experimental evidence that, due to strong magnetoelastic coupling, acoustic vibrations in hematite induce significant variable deviations in magnetization, resulting in spin accumulation at the antiferromagnet-normal metal interface, which in turn leads to the generation of spin and charge currents in the metal. Charge currents arising from the inverse spin Hall effect can be measured using the same methodology employed under high-frequency spin pumping conditions at the resonances of the magnetic subsystem itself. Moreover, the acoustic resonance in hematite is significantly more pronounced (by hundreds or even thousands of times) than in other quasiferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic systems, enabling the attainment of extremely large amplitudes of magnetic oscillations for spin pumping. This research highlights the new approach of utilizing acoustic spin pumping to manipulate spin currents in magnetic materials, particularly antiferromagnets.</description>

      <title>Brightify: A tool for calculating brightness in neutron sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22431v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Brightness is a critical metric for optimizing the design of neutron sources and beamlines, yet there is no direct way to calculate brightness within most Monte Carlo packages used for neutron source simulation. In this paper, we present Brightify, an open-source Python-based tool designed to calculate brightness from Monte Carlo Particle List (MCPL) files, which can be extracted from several Monte Carlo simulation packages. Brightify provides an efficient computational approach to calculate brightness for any particle type and energy spectrum recorded in the MCPL file. It enables localized, directionally-resolved brightness evaluations by scanning across both spatial and angular domains, facilitating the identification of positions and directions corresponding to maximum brightness. This functionality is particularly valuable for identifying brightness hotspots and helping fine-tune the design of neutron sources for optimal performance. We validate Brightify against standard methods, such as surface current tally and point estimator tally, and demonstrate its accuracy and adaptability, particularly in high-resolution analyses. By overcoming the limitations of traditional methods, Brightify streamlines neutron source re-optimization, reduces computational burden, and accelerates source development workflows. The full code is available on the Brightify GitHub repository.</description>

      <title>Observation of Coherent Ferrons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Excitation of ordered phases produces quasiparticles and collective modes, as exemplified by magnons that emerge from magnetic order, with applications in information transmission and quantum interconnects. Extending this paradigm to ferroelectric materials suggests the existence of ferrons, i.e. fundamental quanta of the collective excitation of ferroelectric order5 developed theoretically by Bauer and coworkers. While coherent magnons are observed in a broad range of experiments, coherent ferrons have eluded experimental detection. This discrepancy is particularly intriguing given that electric dipole interactions (FE) are inherently stronger than their magnetic counterparts. Here, we report the generation and transport of coherent ferrons in the van der Waals (vdW) ferroelectric material NbOI2. By launching collective oscillations of the ferroelectric dipoles using a short laser pulse, we identify coherent ferrons from intense and narrow-band terahertz (THz) emission and observe their propagations along the polar direction at extremely hypersonic velocities exceeding 10^5 m/s. The THz emission is a second-order nonlinear process that requires ferroelectric order, as is confirmed in the structurally related ferroelectric WO2Br2 and non-ferroelectric TaOBr2. The discovery of coherent ferrons paves the way for numerous applications, including narrow-band THz emission, ferronic information processing, and quantum interconnects.</description>

      <title>Quantum-inspired Beamforming Optimization for Quantized Phase-only Massive MIMO Arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19938v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces an innovative quantum-inspired method for beamforming (BF) optimization in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) arrays. The method leverages the simulated bifurcation (SB) algorithm to address the complex combinatorial optimization problem due to the quantized phase configuration. We propose novel encoding techniques for high-bit phase quantization, which are then mapped into Ising spins. This enables efficient construction of the Hamiltonians and subsequent optimization of BF patterns. The results clearly demonstrate that the SB optimizer surpasses traditional schemes such as digital BF, holographic algorithms and genetic algorithms, offering faster convergence and higher solution quality. The impressive capability of the SB optimizer to handle complex BF scenarios, including sidelobe suppression and multiple beams with nulls, is undoubtedly demonstrated through several application cases. These findings strongly suggest that quantum-inspired methods have great potential to advance MIMO techniques in next-generation wireless communication.</description>

Abstract: Achieving high conversion efficiencies in second-order nonlinear optical processes is a key challenge in integrated photonics for both classical and quantum applications. This paper presents the first demonstration of Transverse Orientation-Patterned gallium phosphide (TOP-GaP) waveguides showing high-efficiency second harmonic generation. In such devices, first order modal phase matching is unlocked and optimized through the inversion of the nonlinear susceptibility along the vertical direction. We discuss here the theory behind modal phase matching in TOP structures, describe the fabrication process, and present linear and nonlinear characterizations of the TOP-GaP waveguides.</description>

      <title>Optical neuromorphic computing via temporal up-sampling and trainable encoding on a telecom device platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03429v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mapping input signals to a high-dimensional space is a critical concept in various neuromorphic computing paradigms, including models such as Reservoir Computing (RC) and Extreme Learning Machines (ELM). We propose using commercially available telecom devices and technologies developed for high-speed optical data transmission to implement these models through nonlinear mapping of optical signals into a high-dimensional space where linear processing can be applied. We manipulate the output feature dimension by applying temporal up-sampling (at the speed of commercially available telecom devices) of input signals and a well-established wave-division-multiplexing (WDM). Our up-sampling approach utilizes a trainable encoding mask, where each input symbol is replaced with a structured sequence of masked symbols, effectively increasing the representational capacity of the feature space. This gives remarkable flexibility in the dynamical phase masking of the input signal. We demonstrate this approach in the context of RC and ELM, employing readily available photonic devices, including a semiconductor optical amplifier and nonlinear Mach-Zender interferometer (MZI). We investigate how nonlinear mapping provided by these devices can be characterized in terms of the increased controlled separability and predictability of the output state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15059v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Decoherence in superconducting quantum circuits, caused by loss mechanisms like material imperfections and two-level system (TLS) defects, remains a major obstacle to improving the performance of quantum devices. In this work, we present atomic-level characterization of cross-sections of a Josephson junction and a spiral resonator to assess the quality of critical interfaces. Employing scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) combined with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and electron-energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), we identify structural imperfections associated with oxide layer formation and carbon-based contamination, and correlate these imperfections to the patterning and etching steps in the fabrication process and environmental exposure. These results suggest that TLS imperfections at critical interfaces significantly contribute to limiting device performance, emphasizing the need for an improved fabrication process.</description>

Abstract: Over the past century, continuous advancements in electron microscopy have enabled the synthesis, control, and characterization of high-quality free-electron beams. These probes carry an evanescent electromagnetic field that can drive localized excitations and provide high-resolution information on material structures and their optical responses, currently reaching the sub-{\aa}ngstr\"om and few-meV regime. Moreover, combining free electrons with pulsed light sources in ultrafast electron microscopy adds temporal resolution in the sub-femtosecond range while offering enhanced control of the electron wave function. Beyond their exceptional capabilities for time-resolved spectromicroscopy, free electrons are emerging as powerful tools in quantum nanophotonics, on par with photons in their ability to carry and transfer quantum information, create entanglement within and with a specimen, and reveal previously inaccessible details on nanoscale quantum phenomena. This Roadmap outlines the current state of this rapidly evolving field, highlights key challenges and opportunities, and discusses future directions through a collection of topical sections prepared by leading experts.</description>

      <title>Molecular Cross-linking of MXenes: Tunable Interfaces and Chemiresistive Sensing</title>

Abstract: MXenes, a family of 2D transition metal compounds, have emerged as promising materials due to their unique electronic properties and tunable surface chemistry. However, the translation of these nanoscale properties into macroscopic devices is constrained by suitable cross-linking strategies that enable both processability and controlled inter flake charge transport. Herein, we demonstrate the tunability of interfaces and the inter-layer spacing between Ti$_3$C$_2$T$_x$ MXene flakes through molecular cross-linking with homologous diamines. Oleylamine was first used to stabilize Ti$_3$C$_2$T$_x$ MXene in chloroform, followed by diamine-mediated cross-linking to precisely tune interlayer spacing. Grazing incidence X-ray scattering (GIXRD/GIWAXS) confirmed the correlation between ligand chain length and inter-layer spacing, which was further supported by Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. Furthermore, we investigated the charge transport properties of thin films consisting of these diamine-crosslinked Ti$_3$C$_2$T$_x$ MXenes and observed a strong dependence of the conductivity on the interlayer spacing. Finally, we probed chemiresistive vapor sensing properties of the MXene composites and observed a pronounced sensitivity and selectivity towards water vapor, highlighting their potential for use in humidity sensors. Insights into the molecular cross-linking of MXenes to form a hybrid inorganic/organic system and its implications for charge transport, this study opens avenues for developing next-generation MXene-based electronic devices.</description>
