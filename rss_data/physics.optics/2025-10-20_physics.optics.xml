      <title>A Second-Order Optical Butterworth Fabry-P\'erot Filter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Filters with flat-top pass-bands are a key enabling technology for signal processing. From communication to sensing, the ability to choose a pass \emph{band}, rather than a single pass \emph{frequency}, while still efficiently suppressing backgrounds at other frequencies, is a critical capability for ensuring both detection sensitivity and power efficiency.
  Efficient transmission of a single frequency can be achieved by a single-pole resonator -- which in optics is a Fabry-P\'erot cavity offering linewidths from kHz to GHz and beyond. Coupling multiple resonators allows for the construction of flat-top multi-pole filters. These, although straightforward from RF to THz where resonators are macroscopic and tunable, are more difficult to control in the optical band and typically realized with dielectric stacks, whose passband widths exceed 100 GHz. Here, we bridge the gap to narrower bandwidth flat-top filters by proposing and implementing a second-order Butterworth-type optical filter in a single two-mirror Fabry-P\'erot cavity, by coupling the two polarization modes. We demonstrate a pass-band width of 2.68(1)~GHz, a maximum stopband suppression of 43~dB, and a passband insertion loss of 2.2(1)~dB, with out-of-band power suppression falling as the fourth power of detuning. This approach is viable down to much narrower filters, and has the potential to improve high-frequency phase noise performance of lasers, enhance the sensitivity of LIDARs, and provide higher quality narrowband filtering, for example, for Raman spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian topological filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a non-Hermitian photonic filter that harnesses dissipation to selectively isolate a desired topological state. In science and engineering, dissipation is often used to filter incoherent waves, producing a pure coherent output. Here, we apply this principle to topological states, creating a linear filter that effectively isolates a specific topological state regardless of the initial input's coherence properties. This approach creates a dissipation-free topological subspace, where the desired states are preserved and their topological protection is enhanced. Our work provides a versatile and simple method for topological state selection, opening the door to new applications in integrated topological photonics.</description>

      <title>Wafer-Scale All-Dielectric quasi-BIC Metasurfaces: Bridging High-throughput Deep-UV Lithography with Nanophotonic Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High quality-factor (Q) dielectric metasurfaces operating in the visible to near-infrared range usually require sub-200 nm features, limiting their fabrication to expensive, low-throughput electron beam lithography. Here, we demonstrate wafer-scale metasurfaces fabricated using deep ultraviolet lithography (DUVL), a workhorse technology in the semiconductor industry. Using a radius and depth perturbation technique in a hole array patterned into a silicon nitride slab, we achieve quasi-bound states in the continuum (qBIC) resonances with measured Q-factors of 150. Critically, we introduce DUV exposure dose as a Q-factor engineering parameter and demonstrate how hole depth control circumvents DUVL resolution limits. Despite stochastic nanoscale variations, the fabricated metasurfaces exhibit spatial uniformity, a consequence of the nonlocal nature of the qBIC resonances. Proof of concept refractive index sensing demonstrates 129 nm/RIU sensitivity while maintaining simple CMOS camera-based resonance shift interrogation. This work bridges scalable semiconductor manufacturing with high-performance nanophotonics, establishing a practical pathway for commercializing metasurface-based sensors, on-chip spectrometers, and integrated photonic systems.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast broadband soliton microcomb laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical frequency combs, defined by their ultrafast timescale and profound coherence, have become a foundational technology in science and technology. Their chip-scale miniaturization offers great promise for refining a wide range of applications from metrology to advanced computing. Existing microcomb technologies, however, are constrained by fundamental limitations inherent to their mode-locking mechanisms. Specifically, the carrier dynamics of saturable absorption in semiconductor mode-locked lasers and the external laser pumping required for dissipative Kerr soliton generation lead to degraded comb performance and significant operational complexity. Here, we introduce an on-chip mode-locking approach that resolves these challenges. By leveraging the intriguing property of a thin-film lithium niobate photonic circuit integrated with semiconductor optical gain, the chip-scale soliton laser directly emits background-free, ultrashort soliton pulses with a 3-dB bandwidth exceeding 3.4THz ($&lt;$90fs pulse width) and an ultra-narrow comb linewidth down to 53 Hz. Our approach dramatically simplifies bright-soliton generation, featuring fully electric pumping, stable turn-key operation, near-unity optical efficiency, superior long-term stability, and remarkably low soliton generation threshold (1V, 75mA) that could be powered with a standard alkaline battery. The demonstrated soliton laser represents a paradigm shift in chip-scale frequency comb technology, which is expected to have profound impacts across a wide range of microcomb applications.</description>

      <title>Visible Imaging of Incoherent 1200-nm Light via Triplet--Triplet Annihilation Upconversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Upconversion of low-energy photons to higher-energy photons provides an opportunity to surpass traditional limitations in fields such as 3D printing, photovoltaics, and photocatalysis. Triplet--triplet annihilation upconversion (TTA-UC) is particularly appealing for such applications as it can efficiently upconvert low-intensity, incoherent light. However, previously demonstrated thin-film TTA systems are simultaneously constrained by modest efficiencies and limited reach into the near infrared (NIR). Here, we design a single-layer thin-film bulk heterojunction that integrates PbS quantum dots (QDs) as tunable NIR absorbers within an organic semiconductor matrix of TES-ADT, achieving large anti-Stokes shifts up to 500 nm and internal quantum efficiencies that surpass previous reports across the NIR-I and NIR-II windows (800-1200 nm). UC performance is improved 15-fold through the incorporation of 5-tetracene carboxylic acid ligands on the PbS QD surface, which served to increase the yield of sensitized triplets, as confirmed by transient absorption and time-resolved photoluminescence measurements. We demonstrate visible imaging of incoherent 1200 nm light via thin-film TTA-UC at incident intensities at the imaging mask as low as 20 mWcm$^2$, marking a significant advance toward practical implementation of solid-state NIR-to-visible upconversion.</description>

      <title>Solid-State High-Order Harmonic Generation: Emerging Frontiers in Ultrafast and Quantum Light Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-order harmonic generation (HHG) in solids has emerged as a versatile platform for exploring ultrafast and quantum-coherent phenomena in condensed matter. Recent advances reveal Berry-phase and topological effects in harmonic emission, strong-field control of excitons and lattice motion, the generation of nonclassical light states driven by quantum and squeezed fields, and the emergence of orbital-angular-momentum transfer in solid-state high-harmonic generation. Nanostructured and hybrid plasmonic-semiconductor platforms enable enhanced and spectrally tunable HHG, while interferometric and cryogenic setups allow attosecond-resolved phase measurements. On the theoretical side, multiband and topological models incorporating dephasing, propagation, and electron-hole coherence effects have deepened our understanding of the interplay between interband and intraband dynamics. These developments establish solid-state HHG as a bridge between ultrafast spectroscopy, quantum optics, and material science, paving the way toward quantum-engineered attosecond sources and coherent control of light-matter interactions in solids.</description>

      <title>Polarization Multiplexed Metalens Array Optical Chip for High-Performance LWIR Polarimetric Camera</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compared with traditional infrared thermal imaging, polarimetric imaging provides additional polarization information, which effectively enhances object contours and image contrast, with broad application in both military and civilian domains. However, the traditional long-wave infrared polarimetric camera suffers from severe thermal noise, low sensitivity and limited detection accuracy. To address the aforementioned problems, a novel cooled LWIR polarimetric camera based on an achromatic polarization multiplexed germanium-based metalens array optical chip is reported in this paper, enabling high-precision division of focal plane linearly polarimetric imaging. The proposed system demonstrates high-precision linearly polarimetric imaging, with the metalens array achieving an average transmittance of 84.7% across the 8.4~11.6{\mu}m band and a polarization extinction ratio exceeding 10. The metasurface-based camera attains an average polarization reconstruction error below 0.981%, markedly surpassing state-of-the-art commercial LWIR polarimetric systems. Additionally, the new camera presents excellent polarimetric imaging capability for complex scenes. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the world's first LWIR polarimetric camera utilizing the metasurface optical chip with performance superior to commercial cameras, promoting the practical development of metasurface-integrated devices.</description>

      <title>Wideband Low-Scattering Dual-Polarized Phased Array with Stepped Ground</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a wideband dual-polarized phased array with ultra-wideband scattering cross section (SCS) reduction. The antenna elements are loaded on a bilateral stepped ground. This ground is carefully designed in terms of height difference, step number, and length to achieve phase cancellation near the normal direction. Wideband dipoles with vertical electric coupling are designed. The radiation frequency band covers the X-band (40%) under VSWR &lt; 2.8. Array patterns are synthesized with the two subarrays, covering the scanning range from -45 to +45 degrees. The monostatic SCSs of the proposed 17 x 8 array prototype have been reduced within 3.6 - 30 GHz, with an averaged reduction of over 19.4/18.9 dB and an averaged in-band reduction of over 15.4/16.6 dB, under the normal x/y polarized incident waves respectively.</description>

      <title>Photothermal Phase Synchronization on the Fourier Plane for Interferometric Scattering Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and experimentally demonstrate the concept of phase synchronization on the Fourier plane for enhancing interferometric scattering microscopy. By employing a photothermal phase plate, we realize a synchronized phase difference between all scattering components and the reference beam on Fourier plane of high numerical-aperture microscopes, where the evanescent Fourier components and optical aberration normally produce highly inhomogeneous phase distribution. We show that the point spread function can be substantially improved, exhibiting a tighter focus with 50\% enhancement in interference contrast and a near-perfect circular symmetry. By synchronizing the phase difference to $\pi/2$, we demonstrate the background speckles exhibit an anti-symmetric dependence on axial defocus, enabling the effective suppression of the unavoidable background speckles and thus the detection of 10 nm particles immobilized on the substrate. The concept and technique of seamless dynamic phase control on the Fourier plane constitute a key asset for interferometric scattering microscopy.</description>

      <title>Widely tunable cavity-enhanced backward difference-frequency generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Difference-frequency generation (DFG) is a powerful technique for generating widely tunable infrared radiation. However, conventional phase-matching schemes may require tuning multiple parameters-such as the wavelengths, crystal temperature, crystal angle, and poling period-to achieve wide tunability, which increases the complexity of practical operation. In this work, we employ a backward quasi-phase-matching scheme with distinctive tuning characteristics and demonstrate pump-enhanced continuous-wave DFG output tunable from 1751 nm to 2451 nm (700 nm range) in a bulk crystal. The tuning is achieved solely by varying the pump wavelength and the signal wavelength (less than 5 nm), enabling continuous, rapid, and room-temperature operation. The tuning characteristics, power-scaling behavior, and output stability are experimentally verified with the idler wavelength set at 2000 nm. The approach offers a new paradigm for widely tunable infrared radiation generation and holds promise for applications in spectroscopy and biomedical sensing.</description>

      <title>Sub-ppb CO2 Detection based on Dissipative Whispering Gallery mode Microcavity Sensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Whispering gallery mode (WGM) microcavities feature ultrahigh Q-factors and small mode volumes, offering strong light-matter interactions for sensing applications. However, unmodified surfaces are weakly responsive togas-phase refractive index changes, limiting trace gas detection. In this work, we propose a novel dissipative sensing scheme based on a non-functionalized WGM microcavity and experimentally demonstrate its feasibility and performance through trace-level CO2 detection. Unlike conventional dispersive sensing that tracks resonance frequency shifts, our approach leverages enhanced local fields and thermal effects at the coupling region to convert weak absorption into measurable variations in resonance depth. A modulation-demodulation method suppresses low-frequency noise, with parameters optimized experimentally. The sensor achieves quantitative detection over 1.5-400 ppm (R2 &gt; 0.99), ~1.13% accuracy, a minimum detection limit of 0.12 ppb at 424 s integration-five orders of magnitude better than dispersive WGM sensors. Long term CO2 monitoring further demonstrates stability and resistance to environmental perturbations. Compared with state-of-the-art cavity-enhanced and photoacoustic sensors, our system delivers at least an order of magnitude lower baseline detection while maintaining compact size, ambient pressure operation, and low cost, highlighting its potential for scalable, real-world deployment.</description>

      <title>Ultracompact Inverse-Designed Silicon-on-Insulator Couplers with Sub-Decibel Coupling Efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fiber-to-chip couplers play a crucial role in interfacing on-chip photonic circuits with other optical systems or off-chip devices. Downsizing the couplers via topology optimization addresses the demand for high-density integration and improves the scalability of photonic integrated systems. However, these optimized couplers have yet to reach the performance level demonstrated by their conventional counterparts, leaving room for further improvement. In this work, we apply topology optimization to design single-polarization 1D and dual-polarization 2D grating couplers incorporating bottom reflectors and achieve sub-decibel coupling efficiency. Both types of couplers are fabricated on the silicon-on-insulator platform with dimensions of mere 14 $\mu$m $\times$ 14 $\mu$m and are compatible with standard single-mode fibers at normal incidence. From our experimental characterization, the measured peak coupling efficiency of the topology-optimized 1D and 2D couplers is -0.92(1) dB and -0.86(13) dB, respectively, within the telecom C-band. Our demonstration provides a coupling solution for photonic applications requiring high efficiency and high-density integration, such as spatial division multiplexing and photonic quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>3D-Structured Polyethylene Windows for Low-Loss Transmission in Wideband Cryogenic Terahertz Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the design, fabrication, and characterisation of a broadband vacuum window and infrared filter based on ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) for millimeter wave receivers operating across ALMA Band 6 and 7 (211-373 GHz). The window incorporates pyramidal anti-reflection (AR) structures, machined directly into the polyethylene using CNC machining, which provide impedance matching over a broad frequency range. The structured UHMWPE method was implemented in two distinct components: a vacuum window and a cryogenic infrared filter. This surface structuring approach provides mechanical robustness, cryogenic compatibility, and low insertion loss. We characterize the transmission properties using Terahertz Time-Domain Spectroscopy (THz-TDS), which demonstrates reflection below $5\%$ across the full band. Complementary heterodyne measurements confirm improved receiver noise performance. These results establish 3D structured UHMWPE as a promising platform for broadband cryogenic optics in high-sensitivity THz instrumentation.</description>

      <title>All-Dielectric Photo-thermo-optical Metasurfaces for Thermal Landscaping at the Nanoscale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise control of temperature fields at the micro- and nanoscale is essential for emerging applications in nanophotonics, catalysis, and microfluidics, yet remains difficult due to the diffusive nature of heat. While inverse-design algorithms have advanced thermoplasmonic metasurfaces, their extension to all-dielectric systems has not been explored. Here, an inverse thermal design framework is introduced for dielectric metasurfaces composed of thermo-optical amorphous silicon (a-Si) nanoresonators. By leveraging a precomputed library of absorption spectra as a function of geometry and temperature, target thermal profiles are directly mapped onto metasurfaces, enabling both uniform and complex temperature shaping. Unlike plasmonic platforms that require multi-resonator unit cells for tunability, dielectric nanoresonators provide intrinsic reconfigurability: at wavelengths where the thermo-optical coefficient is negligible (e.g., ~500 nm), absorption is temperature-invariant, whereas at other wavelengths it becomes strongly temperature-dependent, allowing illumination intensity to reshape the thermal landscape. This multifunctionality permits a single metasurface to yield distinct profiles under different excitation conditions without added structural complexity. As a proof of concept, photothermal catalysis on such metasurfaces is modeled, predicting over 30% enhancement in reaction rates. The presented framework establishes a scalable strategy for engineering nanoscale temperature fields with broad implications for catalysis, thermal management, and photothermal energy conversion.</description>

      <title>Directional and contra-directional coupling in Huygens' metawaveguide microring resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Huygens' metawaveguides represent a transformative concept in photonic device engineering, enabling unprecedented control over light propagation. This study presents, for the first time, integrated Huygens'-based microring resonators and directional and contra-directional couplers, specifically designed for operation at the 1550 nm telecommunication wavelength. By leveraging the unique properties of resonant Huygens' waveguides, we demonstrate efficient evanescent directional coupling with high-Q resonators, characterized by negative group index and near-zero dispersion, which are critical for enhancing performance in compact, high-performance add-drop filters. The research further explores the implications of these novel structures on group index and group velocity dispersion, providing insights into their potential applications in nonlinear optics and quantum information technologies. Notably, the introduction of a hybrid subwavelength grating-Huygens' contra-directional coupler facilitates backward coupling between resonant and non-resonant metawaveguides, achieving a broad spectral rejection bandwidth. Our findings advance the integration of resonant metamaterials into scalable photonic platforms, laying the groundwork for innovative applications in optical communications, quantum photonics and sensing systems.</description>

      <title>Optomechanical crystal in light-resilient quantum ground-state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interaction between light and high-frequency sound is a key area in integrated photonics, quantum and nonlinear optics, and quantum science. However, the typical suspended optomechanical structures suffer from poor thermal anchoring, making them susceptible to thermal noise arising from optical absorption. Here, we demonstrate a chip-scale, release-free silicon optomechanical crystal cavity (OMC) operating cryogenically with improved resilience to laser light. Relative to a suspended nanobeam OMC, we observe an 18 dB suppression of the thermo-optic effect, and the device sustains near-unity phonon occupation at 35 dB higher intracavity optical energy. Time-resolved measurements further reveal rapid initial thermalization governed by the mechanical decay time. With further material and design improvements in sight, these results bolster release-free systems on a chip as a path for low-noise and high-power classical and quantum electro-optomechanics, such as for frequency converters between microwave and optical photons.</description>

      <title>Silicon nanoantennas for tailoring the optical properties of MoS2 monolayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03264v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Silicon-based dielectric nanoantennas provide an effective platform for engineering light-matter interactions in van der Waals semiconductors. Here, we demonstrate near-field coupling between monolayer MoS2 and silicon nanoantennas arranged in hexagonal lattices with tunable geometric parameters, leading to a three-fold enhancement in photoluminescence and an excitation-wavelength-dependent emission that aligns with Mie-resonant modes. Raman spectroscopy reveals an up to 8-fold enhancement in the vibrational modes of MoS2, while second-harmonic generation exhibits a 20 to 30-fold increase in efficiency, closely correlating with the presence of the underlying nanoantennas. Our experiments and simulations quantify the tunable benefits of the near-field interactions, taking into account thin-film interference and strain-induced effects. Our findings present dielectric nanoantennas as a promising platform for tailoring linear and nonlinear optical properties in 2D materials, with potential applications in nanophotonic devices and integrated photonics.</description>

      <title>Scattering modeling by a nonlinear slab: exact solution of the full vector problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04084v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the scattering of light by a nonlinear, anisotropic slab under conical incidence and arbitrary polarization, within the framework of Maxwell's equations, where the nonlinearities are described by nonlinear susceptibility tensors. We develop a fully tensorial numerical method, free from standard simplifications such as the undepleted pump approximation or scalar field assumptions, based on an iterative scheme where each step is solved via the finite element method. The two-dimensional problem is reduced to one dimension by exploiting symmetry arguments. Energy considerations are also addressed. Several numerical experiments involving a potassium titanyl phosphate (KTP) slab and a lithium niobate (LiNbO3) photonic crystal are presented, including cases with incident TE and TM waves, as well as a rotation-based study highlighting the anisotropic capabilities of our numerical model. This work provides a practical and general tool to help the optics research community overcome the limitations of existing models. It may facilitate the design of more advanced experiments to test nonlinear optical theories or improve nonlinear devices.</description>

      <title>Atomic-Scale Light Coupling Control in Ultrathin Photonic Nanomembranes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23265v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Atomic-layer and two-dimensional (2D) materials have emerged as essential building blocks for next-generation quantum and semiconductor technologies, where atomic-scale control over light-matter interactions is critical. However, their inherently small interaction volume poses fundamental challenges for efficient integration into quantum and nanophotonic devices. Addressing this limitation requires the development of photonic platforms that can effectively enhance atomic-scale optical coupling. To this end, freestanding nanomembranes with extreme thinness and minimal radiative loss offer an ideal framework for integrating these materials into photonic systems. Here, we demonstrate an ultrathin photonic nanomembrane enabling atomic-scale control of light coupling. This architecture supports strong field confinement at the surface and significantly enhances light-matter interaction. Through the integration of atomic-layer dielectrics, we achieve {\AA}-level thickness modulation, where each deposition cycle leads to an ultrafine shift of the high-Q resonance. High-resolution spatial mapping further confirms uniform and deterministic resonance tuning across the nanomembrane surface. Furthermore, by integrating a WS2 monolayer with the photonic nanomembrane, strong field localization within the monolayer and a significant emission enhancement are achieved. This approach offers a scalable and versatile route for atomic-scale light coupling, helping to overcome the limitations of conventional photonics and opening opportunities in quantum photonics, optoelectronics, and advanced semiconductor technologies.</description>

      <title>Scalable Generalized Meta-Spanners Enabling Parallel Multitasking Optical Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13146v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optical manipulation techniques offer exceptional contactless control but are fundamentally limited in their ability to perform parallel multitasking. To achieve high-density, versatile manipulation with subwavelength photonic devices, it is essential to sculpt light fields in multiple dimensions. Here, we overcome this challenge by introducing generalized optical meta-spanners (GOMSs) based on metasurfaces. Relying on complex-amplitude modulation, this platform generates lens-free, customizable optical fields that suppress diffractive losses. As a result, several advanced functionalities are simultaneously achieved, including longitudinally varying manipulation and in-plane spanner arrays, which outperforms the same operations realized by conventional donut-shaped orbital flows. Furthermore, the particle dynamics is reconfigurable simply by switching the input and output polarizations, facilitating robust multi-channel control. We experimentally validate the proposed approach by demonstrating single-particle dynamics and the parallel manipulation of particle ensembles, revealing exceptional stability for multitasking operations. These results demonstrate an ultracompact platform scalable to a much larger number of optical spanners, advancing metadevices from wavefront sculptors to particle manipulators. We envision that the GOMS will catalyze innovations in cross-disciplinary fields such as targeted drug delivery and cell-level biomechanics.</description>

      <title>Analytical exploration of the optomechanical attractor diagram and of limit cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05352v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyse the interplay between mechanical and radiation pressure in an optomechanical cavity system. Our study is based on an analytical evaluation of the infinite Bessel summations involved, which previously had led to a numerical exploration of the so-called attractor diagram. The analytical expressions are then suitable for further asymptotic analysis in opposing regimes of the amplitude, which allows for a characterisation of the diagram in terms of elementary functions. Building on this framework, we investigate the emergence and properties of optomechanical limit cycles beyond the constraints of the resolved sideband approximation. By employing a Fokker-Planck formalism originally developed in the context of laser theory and then used in cavity optomechanics, we describe the quantum regime of these limit cycles, offering a more detailed and unified analytical perspective.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10862v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a time crystal based on a quantum black-hole laser, where the genuinely spontaneous character of the symmetry breaking stems from the self-amplification of spontaneous Hawking radiation. The resulting Hawking time crystal (HTC) is characterized by the periodic dependence of the out-of-time density-density correlation function, while equal-time observables are time-independent because they embody averages over different realizations with a random oscillation phase. The HTC can be regarded as a nonlinear periodic analogue of the Andreev-Hawking effect, exhibiting anticorrelation bands resulting from the spontaneous, quantum emission of pairs of dispersive waves and solitons into the upstream and downstream regions. Remarkably, the time-crystal formation is understood in terms of two time operators: one associated to the initial black-hole laser and another associated to the final spontaneous Floquet state.</description>

      <title>Optical Link Tomography: First Field Trial and 4D Extension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09384v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optical link tomography (OLT) is a rapidly evolving field that allows the multi-span, end-to-end visualization of optical power along fiber links in multiple dimensions from network endpoints, solely by processing signals received at coherent receivers. This paper has two objectives: (1) to report the first field trial of OLT, using a commercial transponder under standard DWDM transmission, and (2) to extend its capability to visualize across 4D (distance, time, frequency, and polarization), allowing for locating and measuring multiple QoT degradation causes, including time-varying power anomalies, spectral anomalies, and excessive polarization dependent loss. We also address a critical aspect of OLT, i.e., its need for high fiber launch power, by improving power profile signal-to-noise ratio through averaging across all available dimensions. Consequently, multiple loss anomalies in a field-deployed link are observed even at launch power lower than the system-optimal level. The applications and use cases of OLT from network commissioning to provisioning and operation for current and near-term network scenarios are also discussed.</description>
