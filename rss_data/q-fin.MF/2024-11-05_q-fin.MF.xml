      <title>Real-world models for multiple term structures: a unifying HJM framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a unifying framework for modeling multiple term structures arising in financial, insurance, and energy markets. We adopt the Heath-Jarrow-Morton approach under the real-world probability and provide a full description of the set of local martingale deflators, which ensure market viability. We perform a thorough analysis of the stochastic partial differential equation arising in the model, addressing existence and uniqueness of a solution, invariance properties and existence of affine realizations.</description>

      <title>On Merton's Optimal Portfolio Problem with Sporadic Bankruptcy for Isoelastic Utility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15923v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a stock that follows a geometric Brownian motion (GBM) and a riskless asset continuously compounded at a constant rate. We assume that the stock can go bankrupt, i.e., lose all of its value, at some exogenous random time (independent of the stock price) modeled as the first arrival time of a homogeneous Poisson process. For this setup, we study Merton's optimal portfolio problem consisting in maximizing the expected isoelastic utility of the total wealth at a given finite maturity time. We obtain an analytical solution using coupled Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations. The optimal strategy bans borrowing and never allocates more wealth into the stock than the classical Merton ratio recommends. For non-logarithmic isoelastic utilities, the optimal weights are non-myopic. This is an example where a realistic problem, being merely a slight modification of the usual GBM model, leads to non-myopic weights. For logarithmic utility, we additionally present an alternative derivation using a stochastic integral and verify that the weights obtained are identical to our first approach. We also present an example for our strategy applied to a stock with non-zero bankruptcy probability.</description>

      <title>Note on a Theoretical Justification for Approximations of Arithmetic Forwards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09488v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This note explores the theoretical justification for some approximations of arithmetic forwards ($F_a$) with weighted averages of overnight (ON) forwards ($F_k$). The central equation presented in this analysis is: \begin{equation*} F_a(0;T_s,T_e)=\frac{1}{\tau(T_s,T_e)}\sum_{k=1}^K \tau_k \mathcal{A}_k F_k\,, \end{equation*} with $\mathcal{A}_k$ being explicit model-dependent quantities, numerically stable and close to one under certain market scenarios. We will present computationally cheaper methods that approximate $F_a$, i.e., we will define some $\{\tilde{\mathcal{A}}_k\}_{k=1}^K$ such that \begin{equation*} F_a(0;T_s,T_e)\approx \frac{1}{\tau(T_s,T_e)}\sum_{k=1}^K \tau_k \tilde{\mathcal{A}}_k F_k\,, \end{equation*} thereby gaining some intuition about the arithmetic factors $\mathcal{A}_k$. Additionally, theoretical bounds and closed-form expressions for the arithmetic factors $\mathcal{A}_k$ in the context of Gaussian HJM models are explored. Finally, we demonstrate that one of these forms can be closely aligned with an approximation suggested by Katsumi Takada in his work on the valuation of arithmetic averages of Fed Funds rates.</description>

      <title>Optimal consumption under a drawdown constraint over a finite horizon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.07848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.07848v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies a finite horizon utility maximization problem on excessive consumption under a drawdown constraint. Our control problem is an extension of the one considered in Bahman et al. (2019) to the model with a finite horizon and an extension of the one considered in Jeon and Oh (2022) to the model with zero interest rate. Contrary to Bahman et al. (2019), we encounter a parabolic nonlinear HJB variational inequality with a gradient constraint, in which some time-dependent free boundaries complicate the analysis significantly. Meanwhile, our methodology is built on technical PDE arguments, which differs from the martingale approach in Jeon and Oh (2022). Using the dual transform and considering the auxiliary variational inequality with gradient and function constraints, we establish the existence and uniqueness of the classical solution to the HJB variational inequality after the dimension reduction, and the associated free boundaries can be characterized in analytical form. Consequently, the piecewise optimal feedback controls and the time-dependent thresholds for the ratio of wealth and historical consumption peak can be obtained.</description>

      <title>Neural Hawkes: Non-Parametric Estimation in High Dimension and Causality Analysis in Cryptocurrency Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09361v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel approach to marked Hawkes kernel inference which we name the moment-based neural Hawkes estimation method. Hawkes processes are fully characterized by their first and second order statistics through a Fredholm integral equation of the second kind. Using recent advances in solving partial differential equations with physics-informed neural networks, we provide a numerical procedure to solve this integral equation in high dimension. Together with an adapted training pipeline, we give a generic set of hyperparameters that produces robust results across a wide range of kernel shapes. We conduct an extensive numerical validation on simulated data. We finally propose two applications of the method to the analysis of the microstructure of cryptocurrency markets. In a first application we extract the influence of volume on the arrival rate of BTC-USD trades and in a second application we analyze the causality relationships and their directions amongst a universe of 15 cryptocurrency pairs in a centralized exchange.</description>

      <title>PSAHARA Utility Family: Modeling Non-monotone Risk Aversion and Convex Compensation in Incomplete Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00435v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In hedge funds, convex compensation schemes are adopted to stimulate a high-profit performance for portfolio managers. In economics, non-monotone risk aversion is proposed to argue that individuals may not be risk-averse when the wealth level is low. Combining these two ingredients, we study the optimal control strategy of the manager in incomplete markets. Generally, we propose a wide family of utility functions, the piecewise symmetric asymptotic hyperbolic absolute risk aversion (PSAHARA) utility, to model the two ingredients, containing both non-concavity and non-differentiability as some abnormalities. Technically, we propose an additional assumption and prove concavification techniques of non--concave utility functions with a left unbounded domain in incomplete markets. Next, we derive an explicit optimal control for the family of PSAHARA utilities. This control is expressed into a unified four-term structure, featuring the asymptotic Merton term. Furthermore, we provide a detailed asymptotic analysis and numerical illustration of the optimal portfolio. We obtain several key insights, including that the convex compensation still induces a great risk-taking behavior in the case that the preference is modeled by SAHARA utility. Finally, we conduct a real-data analysis of the U.S. stock market under the above model and conclude that the PSAHARA portfolio is very risk-seeking and leads to a high return and a high volatility.</description>
