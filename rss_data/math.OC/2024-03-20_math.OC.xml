      <title>Constrained Bayesian optimization with merit functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bayesian optimization is a powerful optimization tool for problems where native first-order derivatives are unavailable. Recently, constrained Bayesian optimization (CBO) has been applied to many engineering applications where constraints are essential. However, several obstacles remain with current CBO algorithms that could prevent a wider adoption. We propose CBO algorithms using merit functions, such as the penalty merit function, in acquisition functions, inspired by nonlinear optimization methods, e.g., sequential quadratic programming. Merit functions measure the potential progress of both the objective and constraint functions, thus increasing algorithmic efficiency and allowing infeasible initial samples. The acquisition functions with merit functions are relaxed to have closed forms, making its implementation readily available wherever Bayesian optimization is. We further propose a unified CBO algorithm that can be seen as extension to the popular expected constrained improvement (ECI) approach. We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithms through numerical experiments on synthetic problems and a practical data-driven engineering design problem in the field of plasma physics.</description>

      <title>Modeling stock price dynamics on the Ghana Stock Exchange: A Geometric Brownian Motion approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling financial data often relies on assumptions that may prove insufficient or unrealistic in practice. The Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) model is frequently employed to represent stock price processes. This study investigates whether the behavior of weekly and monthly returns of selected equities listed on the Ghana Stock Exchange conforms to the GBM model. Parameters of the GBM model were estimated for five equities, and forecasts were generated for three months. Evaluation of estimation accuracy was conducted using mean square error (MSE). Results indicate that the expected prices from the modeled equities closely align with actual stock prices observed on the Exchange. Furthermore, while some deviations were observed, the actual prices consistently fell within the estimated confidence intervals.</description>

      <title>Distributionally Robust Hospital Capacity Expansion Planning under Stochastic and Correlated Patient Demand</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the optimal locations and capacities of hospital expansion facilities under uncertain future patient demands, considering both spatial and temporal correlations. We propose a novel two-stage distributionally robust optimization (DRO) model that integrates a Spatio-Temporal Neural Network (STNN). Specifically, we develop an STNN model that predicts future hospital occupancy levels considering spatial and temporal patterns in time-series datasets over a network of hospitals. The predictions of the STNN model are then used in the construction of the ambiguity set of the DRO model. To address computational challenges associated with two-stage DRO, we employ the linear-decision-rules technique to derive a tractable mixed-integer linear programming approximation. Extensive computational experiments conducted on real-world data demonstrate the superiority of the STNN model in minimizing forecast errors. Compared to neural network models built for each individual hospital, the proposed STNN model achieves a 53% improvement in average RMSE. Furthermore, the results demonstrate the value of incorporating spatiotemporal dependencies of demand uncertainty in the DRO model, as evidenced by out-of-sample analysis conducted with both ground truth data and under perfect information scenarios.</description>

      <title>A Log-domain Interior Point Method for Convex Quadratic Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an equilibrium-seeking algorithm for finding generalized Nash equilibria of non-cooperative monotone convex quadratic games. Specifically, we recast the Nash equilibrium-seeking problem as variational inequality problem that we solve using a log-domain interior point method and provide a general purpose solver based on this algorithm. This approach is suitable for non-potential, general sum games and does not require extensive structural assumptions. We demonstrate the efficiency and versatility of our method using three benchmark games and demonstrate our algorithm is especially effective on small to medium scale problems.</description>

      <title>Direct search for stochastic optimization in random subspaces with zeroth-, first-, and second-order convergence and expected complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The work presented here is motivated by the development of StoDARS, a framework for large-scale stochastic blackbox optimization that not only is both an algorithmic and theoretical extension of the stochastic directional direct-search (SDDS) framework but also extends to noisy objectives a recent framework of direct-search algorithms in reduced spaces (DARS). Unlike SDDS, StoDARS achieves scalability by using~$m$ search directions generated in random subspaces defined through the columns of Johnson--Lindenstrauss transforms (JLTs) obtained from Haar-distributed orthogonal matrices. For theoretical needs, the quality of these subspaces and the accuracy of random estimates used by the algorithm are required to hold with sufficiently large, but fixed, probabilities. By leveraging an existing supermartingale-based framework, the expected complexity of StoDARS is proved to be similar to that of SDDS and other stochastic full-space methods up to constants, when the objective function is continuously differentiable. By dropping the latter assumption, the convergence of StoDARS to Clarke stationary points with probability one is established. Moreover, the analysis of the second-order behavior of the mesh adaptive direct-search (MADS) algorithm using a second-order-like extension of the Rademacher's theorem-based definition of the Clarke subdifferential (so-called generalized Hessian) is extended to the StoDARS framework, making it the first in a stochastic direct-search setting, to the best of our knowledge.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper explores in detail the use of dynamic adaptation gain/step size (DAG) for improving the adaptation  transient performance of variable step-size LMS (VS-LMS) adaptation algorithms. A generic form for the implementation of the DAG  within the VS-LMS algorithms is provided. Criteria for  the selection of the coefficients of the DAG filter which is required to be  a strictly positive real transfer operator are given.  The potential of the VS-LMS adaptation algorithms using a DAG is then illustrated by experimental results obtained on a relevant adaptive active noise attenuation system.</description>

      <title>A multilevel framework for accelerating uSARA in radio-interferometric imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a multilevel algorithm specifically designed for radio-interferometric imaging in astronomy. The proposed algorithm is used to solve the uSARA (unconstrained Sparsity Averaging Reweighting Analysis) formulation of this image restoration problem. Multilevel algorithms rely on a hierarchy of approximations of the objective function to accelerate its optimization. In contrast to the usual multilevel approaches where this hierarchy is derived in the parameter space, here we construct the hierarchy of approximations in the  observation space. The proposed approach is compared to a reweighted forward-backward procedure, which is the backbone iteration scheme for solving the uSARA problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solving equilibrium problems under constraints is an important problem in optimization and optimal control. In this context an important practical challenge is the efficient incorporation of constraints. We develop a continuous-time method for solving constrained variational inequalities based on a new penalty regulated dynamical system in a general potentially infinite-dimensional Hilbert space. In order to obtain strong convergence of the issued trajectory of our method, we incorporate an explicit Tikhonov regularization parameter in our method, leading to a class of time-varying monotone inclusion problems featuring multiscale aspects. Besides strong convergence, we illustrate the practical efficiency of our developed method in solving constrained min-max problems.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the integration of constraint propagation and dual proof analysis in an exact, roundoff-error-free MIP solver. The authors employ safe rounding methods to ensure that all results remain provably correct, while sacrificing as little computational performance as possible in comparison to a pure floating-point implementation. The study also addresses the adaptation of certification techniques for correctness verification. Computational studies demonstrate the effectiveness of these techniques, showcasing a 23% performance improvement on the MIPLIB 2017 benchmark test set.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An iterative learning algorithm is presented for continuous-time linear-quadratic optimal control problems where the system is externally symmetric with unknown dynamics. Both finite-horizon and infinite-horizon problems are considered. It is shown that the proposed algorithm is globally convergent to the optimal solution and has some advantages over adaptive dynamic programming, including being unbiased under noisy measurements and having a relatively low computational burden. Numerical experiments show the effectiveness of the results.</description>

      <title>Scalable Projection-Free Optimization Methods via MultiRadial Duality Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent works have developed new projection-free first-order methods based on utilizing linesearches and normal vector computations to maintain feasibility. These oracles can be cheaper than orthogonal projection or linear optimization subroutines but have the drawback of requiring a known strictly feasible point to do these linesearches with respect to. In this work, we develop new theory and algorithms which can operate using these cheaper linesearches while only requiring knowledge of points strictly satisfying each constraint separately. Convergence theory for several resulting ``multiradial'' gradient methods is established. We also provide preliminary numerics showing performance is essentially independent of how one selects the reference points for synthetic quadratically constrained quadratic programs.</description>

      <title>Projection-free computation of robust controllable sets with constrained zonotopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of computing robust controllable sets for discrete-time linear systems with additive uncertainty. We propose a tractable and scalable approach to inner- and outer-approximate robust controllable sets using constrained zonotopes, when the additive uncertainty set is a symmetric, convex, and compact set. Our least-squares-based approach uses novel closed-form approximations of the Pontryagin difference between a constrained zonotopic minuend and a symmetric, convex, and compact subtrahend. Unlike existing approaches, our approach does not rely on convex optimization solvers, and is projection-free for ellipsoidal and zonotopic uncertainty sets. We also propose a least-squares-based approach to compute a convex, polyhedral outer-approximation to constrained zonotopes, and characterize sufficient conditions under which all these approximations are exact. We demonstrate the computational efficiency and scalability of our approach in several case studies, including the design of abort-safe rendezvous trajectories for a spacecraft in near-rectilinear halo orbit under uncertainty. Our approach can inner-approximate a 20-step robust controllable set for a 100-dimensional linear system in under 15 seconds on a standard computer.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Model for Data-Driven Black-Box Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative AI has redefined artificial intelligence, enabling the creation of innovative content and customized solutions that drive business practices into a new era of efficiency and creativity. In this paper, we focus on diffusion models, a powerful generative AI technology, and investigate their potential for black-box optimization over complex structured variables. Consider the practical scenario where one wants to optimize some structured design in a high-dimensional space, based on massive unlabeled data (representing design variables) and a small labeled dataset. We study two practical types of labels: 1) noisy measurements of a real-valued reward function and 2) human preference based on pairwise comparisons. The goal is to generate new designs that are near-optimal and preserve the designed latent structures. Our proposed method reformulates the design optimization problem into a conditional sampling problem, which allows us to leverage the power of diffusion models for modeling complex distributions. In particular, we propose a reward-directed conditional diffusion model, to be trained on the mixed data, for sampling a near-optimal solution conditioned on high predicted rewards. Theoretically, we establish sub-optimality error bounds for the generated designs. The sub-optimality gap nearly matches the optimal guarantee in off-policy bandits, demonstrating the efficiency of reward-directed diffusion models for black-box optimization. Moreover, when the data admits a low-dimensional latent subspace structure, our model efficiently generates high-fidelity designs that closely respect the latent structure. We provide empirical experiments validating our model in decision-making and content-creation tasks.</description>

      <title>Safety-Aware Reinforcement Learning for Electric Vehicle Charging Station Management in Distribution Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing integration of electric vehicles (EVs) into the grid can pose a significant risk to the distribution system operation in the absence of coordination. In response to the need for effective coordination of EVs within the distribution network, this paper presents a safety-aware reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm designed to manage EV charging stations while ensuring the satisfaction of system constraints. Unlike existing methods, our proposed algorithm does not rely on explicit penalties for constraint violations, eliminating the need for penalty coefficient tuning. Furthermore, managing EV charging stations is further complicated by multiple uncertainties, notably the variability in solar energy generation and energy prices. To address this challenge, we develop an off-policy RL algorithm to efficiently utilize data to learn patterns in such uncertain environments. Our algorithm also incorporates a maximum entropy framework to enhance the RL algorithm's exploratory process, preventing convergence to local optimal solutions. Simulation results demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms traditional RL algorithms in managing EV charging in the distribution network.</description>

      <title>Graph Attention Network-based Block Propagation with Optimal AoI and Reputation in Web 3.0</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Web 3.0 is recognized as a pioneering paradigm that empowers users to securely oversee data without reliance on a centralized authority. Blockchains, as a core technology to realize Web 3.0, can facilitate decentralized and transparent data management. Nevertheless, the evolution of blockchain-enabled Web 3.0 is still in its nascent phase, grappling with challenges such as ensuring efficiency and reliability to enhance block propagation performance. In this paper, we design a Graph Attention Network (GAT)-based reliable block propagation optimization framework for blockchain-enabled Web 3.0. We first innovatively apply a data-freshness metric called age of information to measure block propagation efficiency in public blockchains. To achieve the reliability of block propagation, we introduce a reputation mechanism based on the subjective logic model, including the local and recommended opinions to calculate the miner reputation value. Moreover, considering that the GAT possesses the excellent ability to process graph-structured data, we utilize the GAT with reinforcement learning to obtain the optimal block propagation trajectory. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed scheme exhibits the most outstanding block propagation efficiency and reliability compared with traditional routing algorithms.</description>

      <title>Network-Aware Value Stacking of Community Battery via Asynchronous Distributed Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Community battery systems have been widely deployed to provide services to the grid. Unlike a single battery storage system in the community, coordinating multiple community batteries can further unlock their value, enhancing the viability of community battery solutions. However, the centralized control of community batteries relies on the full information of the system, which is less practical and may even lead to privacy leakage. In this paper, we formulate a value-stacking optimization problem for community batteries to interact with local solar, buildings, and the grid, within distribution network constraints. We then propose a distributed algorithm using asynchronous distributed alternate direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to solve the problem. Our algorithm is robust to communication latency between community batteries and the grid while preserving the operational privacy. The simulation results demonstrate the convergence of our proposed asynchronous distributed ADMM algorithm. We also evaluate the electricity cost and the contribution of each value stream in the value-stacking problem for community batteries using real-world data.</description>

Abstract: The notion of defect of a finitely presented functor on a module category is extended to arbitrary additive functors. The new defect and the contravariant Yoneda embedding form a right adjoint pair. The main result identifies the defect of the covariant Hom modulo projectives with the Bass torsion of the fixed argument. When applied to a linear control systems, it shows that the defect of the Malgrange functor of the system modulo projectives is isomorphic to the autonomy of the system. Furthermore, the defect of the contravariant Hom modulo injectives is shown to be isomorphic to the cotorsion coradical of the fixed argument. Since the Auslander-Gruson-Jensen transform of cotorsion is isomorphic to torsion, the above results raise two important questions: a) what is a control-theoretic interpretation of the covariant Yoneda embedding of the Malgrange module modulo injectives, and b) what is a control-theoretic interpretation of the Auslander-Gruson-Jensen duality?</description>

      <title>PaPILO: A Parallel Presolving Library for Integer and Linear Programming with Multiprecision Support</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.10709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.10709v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Presolving has become an essential component of modern MIP solvers both in terms of computational performance and numerical robustness. In this paper, we present PaPILO, a new C++ header-only library that provides a large set of presolving routines for MIP and LP problems from the literature. The creation of PaPILO was motivated by the current lack of (a) solver-independent implementations that (b) exploit parallel hardware, and (c) support multiprecision arithmetic. Traditionally, presolving is designed to be fast. Whenever necessary, its low computational overhead is usually achieved by strict working limits. PaPILO's parallelization framework aims at reducing the computational overhead also when presolving is executed more aggressively or is applied to large-scale problems. To rule out conflicts between parallel presolve reductions, PaPILO uses a transaction-based design. This helps to avoid both the memory-intensive allocation of multiple copies of the problem and special synchronization between presolvers. Additionally, the use of Intel's TBB library aids PaPILO to efficiently exploit recursive parallelism within expensive presolving routines such as probing, dominated columns, or constraint sparsification. We provide an overview of PaPILO's capabilities and insights into important design choices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2207.06305v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the solution of finite-sum minimization problems, such as those appearing in nonlinear least-squares or general empirical risk minimization problems. We are motivated by problems in which the summand functions are computationally expensive and evaluating all summands on every iteration of an optimization method may be undesirable. We present the idea of stochastic average model (SAM) methods, inspired by stochastic average gradient methods. SAM methods sample component functions on each iteration of a trust-region method according to a discrete probability distribution on component functions; the distribution is designed to minimize an upper bound on the variance of the resulting stochastic model. We present promising numerical results concerning an implemented variant extending the derivative-free model-based trust-region solver POUNDERS, which we name SAM-POUNDERS.</description>

      <title>A fast Multiplicative Updates algorithm for Non-negative Matrix Factorization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.17992v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonnegative Matrix Factorization is an important tool in unsupervised machine learning to decompose a data matrix into a product of parts that are often interpretable. Many algorithms have been proposed during the last three decades. A well-known method is the Multiplicative Updates algorithm proposed by Lee and Seung in 2002. Multiplicative updates have many interesting features: they are simple to implement and can be adapted to popular variants such as sparse Nonnegative Matrix Factorization, and, according to recent benchmarks, is state-of-the-art for many problems where the loss function is not the Frobenius norm. In this manuscript, we propose to improve the Multiplicative Updates algorithm seen as an alternating majorization minimization algorithm by crafting a tighter upper bound of the Hessian matrix for each alternate subproblem. Convergence is still ensured and we observe in practice on both synthetic and real world dataset that the proposed fastMU algorithm is often several orders of magnitude faster than the regular Multiplicative Updates algorithm, and can even be competitive with state-of-the-art methods for the Frobenius loss.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.09421v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel single-loop decentralized algorithm called DGDA-VR for solving the stochastic nonconvex strongly-concave minimax problem over a connected network of $M$ agents. By using stochastic first-order oracles to estimate the local gradients, we prove that our algorithm finds an $\epsilon$-accurate solution with $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-3})$ sample complexity and $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-2})$ communication complexity, both of which are optimal and match the lower bounds for this class of problems. Unlike competitors, our algorithm does not require multiple communications for the convergence results to hold, making it applicable to a broader computational environment setting. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first such algorithm to jointly optimize the sample and communication complexities for the problem considered here.</description>

      <title>Certifying MIP-based Presolve Reductions for 0-1 Integer Linear Programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09277v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well known that reformulating the original problem can be crucial for the performance of mixed-integer programming (MIP) solvers. To ensure correctness, all transformations must preserve the fea sibility status and optimal value of the problem, but there is currently no established methodology to express and verify the equivalence of two mixed-integer programs. In this work, we take a first step in this direction by showing how the correctness of MIP presolve reductions on 0-1 integer linear programs can be certified by using (and suitably extending) the VeriPB tool for pseudo-Boolean proof logging. Our experimental evaluation on both decision and optimization instances demonstrates the computational viability of the approach and leads to suggestions for future revisions of the proof format that will help to reduce the verbosity of the certificates and to accelerate the certification and verification process further.</description>

Abstract: We consider the strategic interaction of traders in a continuous-time financial market with Epstein-Zin-type recursive intertemporal preferences and performance concerns. We derive explicitly an equilibrium for the finite player and the mean-field version of the game, based on a study of geometric backward stochastic differential equations of Bernoulli type that describe the best replies of traders. Our results show that Epstein-Zin preferences can lead to substantially different equilibrium behavior.</description>

      <title>Supporting the next generation lithography roadmap using partial state-feedback reduced-order switching predictive models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13928v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To support the ever-increasing performance requirements of lithography systems in terms of throughput and accuracy, in this paper, we introduce a design framework for partial state-feedback reduced-order switching predictive models. By combining measurements and predictions, this method aims to: 1) improve overall system performance by reducing the placement errors in a die within and across the full-wafer and 2) eliminate redundant measurements by using predictions to improve system throughput. We primarily focus on well-known trade-off introduced by measurement time, which can correct errors at a cost of throughput, noise and not being robust to uncertainties. The proposed approach consists of a reduced-order model with a switching logic that acts a scheduler to deal with uncertain operating conditions. It also utilizes linear predictive models as a basis for the control design which is appealing to the ease and cost of implementation, enhancing the applicability. For the add-on part, the scheduler logic is adapted based on expected operating conditions of the system while guaranteeing global uniform ultimate bounded asymptotic stability. Lastly, to deal with measurement layouts, the predictor combines the measurement into model using partial state-feedback. Effectiveness of the proposed strategy is demonstrated in practice on a high-precision industrial scanner.</description>

      <title>Deep Reinforcement Learning: A Convex Optimization Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.19212v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider reinforcement learning of nonlinear systems with continuous state and action spaces. We present an episodic learning algorithm, where we for each episode use convex optimization to find a two-layer neural network approximation of the optimal $Q$-function. The convex optimization approach guarantees that the weights calculated at each episode are optimal, with respect to the given sampled states and actions of the current episode. For stable nonlinear systems, we show that the algorithm converges and that the converging parameters of the trained neural network can be made arbitrarily close to the optimal neural network parameters. In particular, if the regularization parameter is $\rho$ and the time horizon is $T$, then the parameters of the trained neural network converge to $w$, where the distance between $w$ from the optimal parameters $w^\star$ is bounded by $\mathcal{O}(\rho T^{-1})$. That is, when the number of episodes goes to infinity, there exists a constant $C$ such that \[\|w-w^\star\| \le C\cdot\frac{\rho}{T}.\] In particular, our algorithm converges arbitrarily close to the optimal neural network parameters as the time horizon increases or as the regularization parameter decreases.</description>

      <title>Optimization of inventory and capacity in large-scale assembly systems using extreme-value theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.09189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2105.09189v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-tech systems are typically produced in two stages: 1) Production of components using specialized equipment and staff; 2) System assembly/integration. Component production capacity is subject to fluctuations, causing a high risk of shortages of at least one component, which results in costly delays. Companies hedge this risk by strategic investments in excess production capacity and in buffer inventories of components. To optimize these, it is crucial to characterize the relation between component shortage risk and capacity and inventory investments. We suppose that component production capacity and produce demand are normally distributed over finite time intervals, and we accordingly model the production system as a symmetric fork-join queueing network with $N$ statistically identical queues with a common arrival process and independent service processes. Assuming a symmetric cost structure, we subsequently apply extreme value theory to gain analytic insights into this optimization problem. We derive several new results for this queueing network, notably that the scaled maximum of $N$ steady-state queue lengths converges in distribution to a Gaussian random variable. These results translate into asymptotically optimal methods to dimension the system. Tests on a range of problems reveal that these methods typically work well for systems of moderate size.</description>

      <title>On Continuous Full-Order Integral-Terminal Sliding Mode Control with Unknown Apriori Bound on Uncertainty</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.02433v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study aims at providing a solution to the problem of designing a continuous and finite-time control for a class of nonlinear systems in the presence of matched uncertainty with an unknown apriori bound. First, we propose a Full-Order Integral-Terminal Sliding Manifold (FOITSM) with a conventional (discontinuous) sliding mode to show that it provides the combined attributes of the nonsingular terminal and integral sliding mode algorithms. Secondly, an Adaptive Disturbance Observer (ADO) has been designed to alleviate the effect of the uncertainty acting on the system. On application of the ADO-based Full-Order Integral-Terminal Sliding Mode Control (FOITSMC), the chattering phenomenon in control input has been reduced substantially in the presence of conditionally known matched disturbances. Moreover, the adaptive gains of ADO are updated non-monotonically without over-bounding the acting disturbance, yet sustain the global boundedness of state trajectories within a specific bound. %Finally, an application of the proposed algorithm for attitude stabilization of a rigid spacecraft has been successively shown.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.06101v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating the learning rate in adaptive methods, such as AdaGrad and Adam. We propose Prodigy, an algorithm that provably estimates the distance to the solution $D$, which is needed to set the learning rate optimally. At its core, Prodigy is a modification of the D-Adaptation method for learning-rate-free learning. It improves upon the convergence rate of D-Adaptation by a factor of $O(\sqrt{\log(D/d_0)})$, where $d_0$ is the initial estimate of $D$. We test Prodigy on 12 common logistic-regression benchmark datasets, VGG11 and ResNet-50 training on CIFAR10, ViT training on Imagenet, LSTM training on IWSLT14, DLRM training on Criteo dataset, VarNet on Knee MRI dataset, as well as RoBERTa and GPT transformer training on BookWiki. Our experimental results show that our approach consistently outperforms D-Adaptation and reaches test accuracy values close to that of hand-tuned Adam.</description>

Abstract: This article presents some controllability and stabilization results for a system of two coupled linear Schr\"odinger equations in the one-dimensional case where the state components are interacting through the Kirchhoff boundary conditions. Considering the system in a bounded domain, the null boundary controllability result is shown. The result is achieved thanks to a new Carleman estimate, which ensures a boundary observation. Additionally, this boundary observation together with some trace estimates, helps us to use the Gramian approach, with a suitable choice of feedback law, to prove that the system under consideration decays exponentially to zero at least as fast as the function $e^{-2\omega t}$ for some $\omega&gt;0$.</description>

      <title>Span-Based Optimal Sample Complexity for Average Reward MDPs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13469v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the sample complexity of learning an $\varepsilon$-optimal policy in an average-reward Markov decision process (MDP) under a generative model. We establish the complexity bound $\widetilde{O}\left(SA\frac{H}{\varepsilon^2} \right)$, where $H$ is the span of the bias function of the optimal policy and $SA$ is the cardinality of the state-action space. Our result is the first that is minimax optimal (up to log factors) in all parameters $S,A,H$ and $\varepsilon$, improving on existing work that either assumes uniformly bounded mixing times for all policies or has suboptimal dependence on the parameters.
  Our result is based on reducing the average-reward MDP to a discounted MDP. To establish the optimality of this reduction, we develop improved bounds for $\gamma$-discounted MDPs, showing that $\widetilde{O}\left(SA\frac{H}{(1-\gamma)^2\varepsilon^2} \right)$ samples suffice to learn a $\varepsilon$-optimal policy in weakly communicating MDPs under the regime that $\gamma \geq 1 - \frac{1}{H}$, circumventing the well-known lower bound of $\widetilde{\Omega}\left(SA\frac{1}{(1-\gamma)^3\varepsilon^2} \right)$ for general $\gamma$-discounted MDPs. Our analysis develops upper bounds on certain instance-dependent variance parameters in terms of the span parameter. These bounds are tighter than those based on the mixing time or diameter of the MDP and may be of broader use.</description>

      <title>Iterative Regularization with k-support Norm: An Important Complement to Sparse Recovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05394v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sparse recovery is ubiquitous in machine learning and signal processing. Due to the NP-hard nature of sparse recovery, existing methods are known to suffer either from restrictive (or even unknown) applicability conditions, or high computational cost. Recently, iterative regularization methods have emerged as a promising fast approach because they can achieve sparse recovery in one pass through early stopping, rather than the tedious grid-search used in the traditional methods. However, most of those iterative methods are based on the $\ell_1$ norm which requires restrictive applicability conditions and could fail in many cases. Therefore, achieving sparse recovery with iterative regularization methods under a wider range of conditions has yet to be further explored. To address this issue, we propose a novel iterative regularization algorithm, IRKSN, based on the $k$-support norm regularizer rather than the $\ell_1$ norm. We provide conditions for sparse recovery with IRKSN, and compare them with traditional conditions for recovery with $\ell_1$ norm regularizers. Additionally, we give an early stopping bound on the model error of IRKSN with explicit constants, achieving the standard linear rate for sparse recovery. Finally, we illustrate the applicability of our algorithm on several experiments, including a support recovery experiment with a correlated design matrix.</description>

      <title>A Simple Mixture Policy Parameterization for Improving Sample Efficiency of CVaR Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11062v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning algorithms utilizing policy gradients (PG) to optimize Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) face significant challenges with sample inefficiency, hindering their practical applications. This inefficiency stems from two main facts: a focus on tail-end performance that overlooks many sampled trajectories, and the potential of gradient vanishing when the lower tail of the return distribution is overly flat. To address these challenges, we propose a simple mixture policy parameterization. This method integrates a risk-neutral policy with an adjustable policy to form a risk-averse policy. By employing this strategy, all collected trajectories can be utilized for policy updating, and the issue of vanishing gradients is counteracted by stimulating higher returns through the risk-neutral component, thus lifting the tail and preventing flatness. Our empirical study reveals that this mixture parameterization is uniquely effective across a variety of benchmark domains. Specifically, it excels in identifying risk-averse CVaR policies in some Mujoco environments where the traditional CVaR-PG fails to learn a reasonable policy.</description>
