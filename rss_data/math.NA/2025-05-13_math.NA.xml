      <title>Initialization and training of matrix product state probabilistic models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling probability distributions via the wave function of a quantum state is central to quantum-inspired generative modeling and quantum state tomography (QST). We investigate a common failure mode in training randomly initialized matrix product states (MPS) using gradient descent. The results show that the trained MPS models do not accurately predict the strong interactions between boundary sites in periodic spin chain models. In the case of the Born machine algorithm, we further identify a causality trap, where the trained MPS models resemble causal models that ignore the non-local correlations in the true distribution. We propose two complementary strategies to overcome the training failure -- one through optimization and one through initialization. First, we develop a natural gradient descent (NGD) method, which approximately simulates the gradient flow on tensor manifolds and significantly enhances training efficiency. Numerical experiments show that NGD avoids local minima in both Born machines and in general MPS tomography. Remarkably, we show that NGD with line search can converge to the global minimum in only a few iterations. Second, for the BM algorithm, we introduce a warm-start initialization based on the TTNS-Sketch algorithm. We show that gradient descent under a warm initialization does not encounter the causality trap and admits rapid convergence to the ground truth.</description>

      <title>A Hybridizable Discontinuous Galerkin Method for the Miscible Displacement Problem Under Minimal Regularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A numerical method based on the hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin method in space and backward Euler in time is formulated and analyzed for solving the miscible displacement problem. Under low regularity assumptions, convergence is established by proving that, up to a subsequence, the discrete pressure, velocity and concentration converge to a weak solution as the mesh size and time step tend to zero. The analysis is based on several key features: an H(div) reconstruction of the velocity, the skew-symmetrization of the concentration equation, the introduction of an auxiliary variable and the definition of a new numerical flux. Numerical examples demonstrate optimal rates of convergence for smooth solutions, and convergence for problems of low regularity.</description>

      <title>A novel class of arbitrary high-order numerical schemes for fractional differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel efficient and high accuracy numerical method for the time-fractional differential equations (TFDEs) is proposed in this work. We show the equivalence between TFDEs and the integer-order extended parametric differential equations (EPDE) by dimensional expanding, and establish the stability of EPDE. We apply BDF-$k$ formula for the temporal discretization, while we use the Jacobi spectral collocation method for the discretization of the extended direction. We analyze the stability of the proposed method and give rigorous error estimates with order $O(\Delta t^{k} + M^{-m})$, where $\Delta t$ and $M$ are time step size and number of collocation nodes in extended direction, respectively. Also, we point out that the computational cost and the storage requirement is essentially the same as the integer problems, namely, the computational cost and the storage of the present algorithm are $O(N)$ and $O(1)$, respectively, where $N$ is the total number of time step. We present several numerical examples, including both linear and nonlinear problems, to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method and to validate the theoretical results</description>

      <title>Tuning Butterworth filter's parameters in SPECT reconstructions via kernel-based Bayesian optimization with a no-reference image evaluation metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT), the image reconstruction process involves many tunable parameters that have a significant impact on the quality of the resulting clinical images. Traditional image quality evaluation often relies on expert judgment and full-reference metrics such as MSE and SSIM. However, these approaches are limited by their subjectivity or the need for a ground-truth image. In this paper, we investigate the usage of a no-reference image quality assessment method tailored for SPECT imaging, employing the Perception-based Image QUality Evaluator (PIQUE) score. Precisely, we propose a novel application of PIQUE in evaluating SPECT images reconstructed via filtered backprojection using a parameter-dependent Butterworth filter. For the optimization of filter's parameters, we adopt a kernel-based Bayesian optimization framework grounded in reproducing kernel Hilbert space theory, highlighting the connections to recent greedy approximation techniques. Experimental results in a concrete clinical setting for SPECT imaging show the potential of this optimization approach for an objective and quantitative assessment of image quality, without requiring a reference image.</description>

      <title>Quantum preconditioning method for linear systems problems via Schr\"odingerization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a quantum computational framework that systematically converts classical linear iterative algorithms with fixed iteration operators into their quantum counterparts using the Schr\"odingerization technique [Shi Jin, Nana Liu and Yue Yu, Phys. Rev. Lett., vol. 133 No. 230602,2024]. This is achieved by capturing the steady state of the associated differential equations. The Schr\"odingerization technique transforms linear partial and ordinary differential equations into Schr\"odinger-type systems, making them suitable for quantum computing. This is accomplished through the so-called warped phase transformation, which maps the equation into a higher-dimensional space. Building on this framework, we develop a quantum preconditioning algorithm that leverages the well-known BPX multilevel preconditioner for the finite element discretization of the Poisson equation. The algorithm achieves a near-optimal dependence on the number of queries to our established input models, with a complexity of $\mathscr{O}(\text{polylog} \frac{1}{\varepsilon})$ for a target accuracy of $\varepsilon$ when the dimension $d\geq 2$. This improvement results from the Hamiltonian simulation strategy applied to the Schr\"odingerized preconditioning dynamics, coupled with the smoothing of initial data in the extended space.</description>

      <title>Optimal pressure approximation for the nonstationary Stokes problem by a variational method in time with post-processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide an error analysis for the solution of the nonstationary Stokes problem by a variational method in space and time. We use finite elements of higher order for the approximation in space and a Galerkin-Petrov method with first order polynomials for the approximation in time. We require global continuity of the discrete velocity trajectory in time, while allowing the discrete pressure trajectory to be discontinuous at the endpoints of the time intervals. We show existence and uniqueness of the discrete velocity solution, characterize the set of all discrete pressure solutions and prove an optimal second order estimate in time for the pressure error in the midpoints of the time intervals. The key result and innovation is the construction of approximations to the pressure trajectory by means of post-processing together with the proof of optimal order error estimates. We propose two variants for a post-processed pressure within the set of pressure solutions based on collocation techniques or interpolation. Both variants guarantee that the pressure error measured in the L2-norm converges with optimal second order in time and optimal order in space. For the discrete velocity solution, we prove error estimates of optimal order in time and space. We present some numerical tests to support our theoretical results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exact computation of permanent for high-dimensional tensors is a hard problem. Having in mind the applications of permanents in other fields, providing an algorithm for the approximation of tensor permanents is an attractive subject. In this paper, we design a deterministic quasi-polynomial time algorithm and a PTAS that computes the permanent of complex random tensors that its module of the mean is at least 1/polylog(n).</description>

      <title>Streaming Krylov-Accelerated Stochastic Gradient Descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present SKA-SGD (Streaming Krylov-Accelerated Stochastic Gradient Descent), a novel optimization approach that accelerates convergence for ill-conditioned problems by projecting stochastic gradients onto a low-dimensional Krylov subspace. Directly inspired by recent advances in s-step Conjugate Gradient methods with streaming Gauss-Seidel Gram solvers \cite{dambra2025sstep}, our method extends these techniques to the stochastic optimization domain. Our approach combines three key innovations: (1) projection coefficients computed via a single streaming Gauss-Seidel iteration, which is mathematically equivalent to Modified Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization; (2) a Chebyshev polynomial basis for constructing the Krylov subspace, providing superior numerical stability; and (3) efficient implementation for AMD GPUs using HIP. We prove that our streaming approach achieves a backward error near machine precision with $O(s^2)$ complexity rather than $O(s^3)$, where $s$ is the Krylov subspace dimension. Experimental results demonstrate that SKA-SGD significantly outperforms standard SGD and Adam in convergence rate and final error, particularly for problems with condition numbers exceeding $10^3$. GPU performance analysis reveals a crossover point where communication-avoiding benefits outweigh computational overhead, typically occurring at moderate scale ($p \approx 64$ processors) for problem sizes $n \geq 10^6$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problems of optimal recovery of unbounded operators are studied. Optimality means the highest possible accuracy and the minimal amount of discrete information involved. It is established that the truncation method, when certain conditions are met, realizes the optimal values of the studied quantities. As an illustration of the general results, problems of numerical differentiation and the backward parabolic equation are considered.</description>

      <title>Field of values analysis that includes zero for preconditioned nonsymmetric saddle-point systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a field-of-values (FOV) analysis for preconditioned nonsymmetric saddle-point linear systems, where zero is included in the field of values of the matrix. We rely on recent results of Crouzeix and Greenbaum [Spectral sets: numerical range and beyond. SIAM Journal on Matrix Analysis and Applications, 40(3):1087-1001, 2019], showing that a convex region with a circular hole is a spectral set. Sufficient conditions are derived for convergence independent of the matrix dimensions. We apply our results to preconditioned nonsymmetric saddle-point systems, and show their applicability to families of block preconditioners that have not been previously covered by existing FOV analysis. A limitation of our theory is that the preconditioned matrix is required to have a small skew-symmetric part in norm. Consequently, our analysis may not be applicable, for example, to fluid flow problems characterized by a small viscosity coefficient. Some numerical results illustrate our findings.</description>

      <title>Trigonometric Interpolation Based Approach for Second Order ODE with Mixed Boundary Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a trigonometric interpolation-based approach (TIBA) to approximate solutions of mixed boundary value problems of second-order ODEs. TIBA leverages the analytic attractiveness of a trigonometric polynomial to reformulate the dynamics of $y, y',y''$ implied by ODE and boundary conditions. TIBA is particularly attractive for a linear ODE where the solution can be obtained directly by solving a linear system. The framework can be used to solve integro-differential equations. Numerical tests have been conducted to assess TIBA's performance regarding convergence, existence, and uniqueness of solution under various boundary conditions with expected results.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Sparse Matrix Coloring and Bicoloring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sparse matrix coloring and bicoloring are fundamental building blocks of sparse automatic differentiation. Bicoloring is particularly advantageous for rectangular Jacobian matrices with at least one dense row and column. Indeed, in such cases, unidirectional row or column coloring demands a number of colors equal to the number of rows or columns. We introduce a new strategy for bicoloring that encompasses both direct and substitution-based decompression approaches. Our method reformulates the two variants of bicoloring as star and acyclic colorings of an augmented symmetric matrix. We extend the concept of neutral colors, previously exclusive to bicoloring, to symmetric colorings, and we propose a post-processing routine that neutralizes colors to further reduce the overall color count. We also present the Julia package SparseMatrixColorings, which includes these new bicoloring algorithms alongside all standard coloring methods for sparse derivative matrix computation. Compared to ColPack, the Julia package also offers enhanced implementations for star and acyclic coloring, vertex ordering, as well as decompression.</description>

      <title>An Approximation Framework for Subspace-based Methods in Spectral Analysis with Accuracy Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A mathematical framework for the approximation of eigenvalues of self-adjoint operators through subspace-based methods is presented.
  The framework contains spectral inequalities that extend to unbounded operators and account for multiple error sources.
  We include conceptual remarks, on how such framework addresses contemporary challenges towards a more complete approximation theory for quantum physics.
  Further analysis considers the computational operation of subspace-based methods and proposes new numerical practices.
  In particular, analytical guarantees on dimension detection of spectral subspaces in the presence of noise are introduced.
  The generality of the framework invites application to a broad class of numerical methods, and its utility is demonstrated through recent advances in signal processing.</description>

      <title>On the choice of optimization norm for Anderson acceleration of the Picard iteration for Navier-Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently developed convergence theory for Anderson acceleration (AA) assumes that the AA optimization norm matches the norm of the Hilbert space that the fixed point function is defined on. While this seems a natural assumption, it may not be the optimal choice in terms of convergence of the iteration or computational efficiency. For the Picard iteration for the Navier-Stokes equations (NSE), the associated Hilbert space norm is $H^1_0(\Omega),$ which is inefficient to implement in a large scale HPC setting since it requires multiplication of global coefficient vectors by the stiffness matrix. Motivated by recent numerical tests that show using the $\ell^2$ norm produces similar convergence behavior as $H^1_0$ does, we revisit the convergence theory of [Pollock et al, {\it SINUM} 2019] and find that i) it can be improved with a sharper treatment of the nonlinear terms; and ii) in the case that the AA optimization norm is changed to $L^2$ (and by extension $\ell^2$ or $L^2$ using a diagonally lumped mass matrix), a new convergence theory is developed that provides an essentially equivalent estimate as the $H^1_0$ case. Several numerical tests illustrate the new theory, and the theory and tests reveal that one can interchangeably use the norms $H^1_0$, $L^2$, $\ell^2$ or $L^2$ with diagonally lumped mass matrix for the AA optimization problem without significantly affecting the overall convergence behavior. Thus, one is justified to use $\ell^2$ or diagonally lumped $L^2$ for the AA optimization norm in Anderson accelerated Picard iterations for large scale NSE problems.</description>

      <title>Solving Nonlinear PDEs with Sparse Radial Basis Function Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel framework for solving nonlinear PDEs using sparse radial basis function (RBF) networks. Sparsity-promoting regularization is employed to prevent over-parameterization and reduce redundant features. This work is motivated by longstanding challenges in traditional RBF collocation methods, along with the limitations of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and Gaussian process (GP) approaches, aiming to blend their respective strengths in a unified framework. The theoretical foundation of our approach lies in the function space of Reproducing Kernel Banach Spaces (RKBS) induced by one-hidden-layer neural networks of possibly infinite width. We prove a representer theorem showing that the solution to the sparse optimization problem in the RKBS admits a finite solution and establishes error bounds that offer a foundation for generalizing classical numerical analysis. The algorithmic framework is based on a three-phase algorithm to maintain computational efficiency through adaptive feature selection, second-order optimization, and pruning of inactive neurons. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method and highlight cases where it offers notable advantages over GP approaches. This work opens new directions for adaptive PDE solvers grounded in rigorous analysis with efficient, learning-inspired implementation.</description>

      <title>Automatically Differentiable Model Updating (ADiMU): conventional, hybrid, and neural network material model discovery including history-dependency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the first Automatically Differentiable Model Updating (ADiMU) framework that finds any history-dependent material model from full-field displacement and global force data (global, indirect discovery) or from strain-stress data (local, direct discovery). We show that ADiMU can update conventional (physics-based), neural network (data-driven), and hybrid material models. Moreover, this framework requires no fine-tuning of hyperparameters or additional quantities beyond those inherent to the user-selected material model architecture and optimizer. The robustness and versatility of ADiMU is extensively exemplified by updating different models spanning tens to millions of parameters, in both local and global discovery settings. Relying on fully differentiable code, the algorithmic implementation leverages vectorizing maps that enable history-dependent automatic differentiation via efficient batched execution of shared computation graphs. This contribution also aims to facilitate the integration, evaluation and application of future material model architectures by openly supporting the research community. Therefore, ADiMU is released as an open-source computational tool, integrated into a carefully designed and documented software named HookeAI.</description>

      <title>Neural Network Operator-Based Fractal Approximation: Smoothness Preservation and Convergence Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a new approach of constructing $\alpha$-fractal interpolation functions (FIFs) using neural network operators, integrating concepts from approximation theory. Initially, we construct $\alpha$-fractals utilizing neural network-based operators, providing an approach to generating fractal functions with interpolation properties. Based on the same foundation, we have developed fractal interpolation functions that utilize only the values of the original function at the nodes or partition points, unlike traditional methods that rely on the entire original function.
  Further, we have constructed \(\alpha\)-fractals that preserve the smoothness of functions under certain constraints by employing a four-layered neural network operator, ensuring that if \(f \in C^{r}[a,b]\), then the corresponding fractal \(f^{\alpha} \in C^{r}[a,b]\). Furthermore, we analyze the convergence of these $\alpha$-fractals to the original function under suitable conditions. The work uses key approximation theory tools, such as the modulus of continuity and interpolation operators, to develop convergence results and uniform approximation error bounds.</description>

      <title>Quantum medical image encoding and compression using Fourier-based methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum image processing (QIMP) has recently emerged as a promising field for modern image processing applications. In QIMP algorithms, encoding classical image informaiton into quantum circuit is important as the first step. However, most of existing encoding methods use gates almost twice the number of pixels in an image, and simulating even a modest sized image is computationally demanding. In this work, we propose a quantum image encoding method that effectively reduces gates than the number of pixels by a factor at least 4. We demonstrate our method for various 1024 by 1024 high-quality medical images captured during the Bilateral Axillo-Breast Approach (BABA) robotic thyroidectomy surgery. Additionally, two compression techniques are proposed to further reduce the number of gates as well as pre-processing time with negligible loss of image quality. We suggest our image encoding strategy as a valuable option for large scale medical imaging.</description>

      <title>Rate of Convergence for a Nonlocal-to-local Limit in One Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a nonlocal approximation of the quadratic porous medium equation where the pressure is given by a convolution with a mollification kernel. It is known that when the kernel concentrates around the origin, the nonlocal equation converges to the local one. In one spatial dimension, for a particular choice of the kernel, and under mere assumptions on the initial condition, we quantify the rate of convergence in the 2-Wasserstein distance. Our proof is very simple, exploiting the so-called Evolutionary Variational Inequality for both the nonlocal and local equations as well as a priori estimates. We also present numerical simulations using the finite volume method, which suggests that the obtained rate can be improved - this will be addressed in a forthcoming work.</description>

      <title>Analytic and Gevrey class regularity for parametric semilinear reaction-diffusion problems and applications in uncertainty quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.17397v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a class of parametric elliptic semilinear partial differential equations of second order with homogeneous essential boundary conditions, where the coefficients and the right-hand side (and hence the solution) may depend on a parameter. This model can be seen as a reaction-diffusion problem with a polynomial nonlinearity in the reaction term. The efficiency of various numerical approximations across the entire parameter space is closely related to the regularity of the solution with respect to the parameter. We show that if the coefficients and the right-hand side are analytic or Gevrey class regular with respect to the parameter, the same type of parametric regularity is valid for the solution. The key ingredient of the proof is the combination of the alternative-to-factorial technique from our previous work [1] with a novel argument for the treatment of the power-type nonlinearity in the reaction term. As an application of this abstract result, we obtain rigorous convergence estimates for numerical integration of semilinear reaction-diffusion problems with random coefficients using Gaussian and Quasi-Monte Carlo quadrature. Our theoretical findings are confirmed in numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Error Estimates for Systems of Nonlocal Balance Laws Modeling Dense Multilane Vehicular Traffic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16928v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss a class of coupled systems of nonlocal nonlinear balance laws modeling multilane traffic, with the nonlocality present in both convective and source terms. The uniqueness and existence of the entropy solution are proven via doubling of the variables arguments and convergent finite volume approximations, respectively. The primary goal is to establish that the finite volume numerical approximations of the system converge to the unique entropy solution at a rate of $\sqrt{\Delta t}$, even when using relatively less regular one-sided kernels, compared to the globally smooth kernels analyzed in [Num. Math., 156(1):237-271, 2024] and [IMA J. Numer. Anal., 44(6):3354-3392, 2024].The applicability of the proven theory to a general class of systems of nonlocal balance laws coupled strongly through the convective part and weakly through the source part, is indicated. As the support of the kernel tends to zero, the convergence of the entropy solutions of the proposed model to its local counterparts [SIAM J. Math. Anal., 51: 3694-3713, 2019] is also discussed. Numerical simulations illustrating the behavior of the entropy solutions of the coupled nonlocal systems are also shown.</description>

      <title>Preconditioners based on Voronoi quantizers of random variable coefficients for stochastic elliptic partial differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07824v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A preconditioning strategy is proposed for the iterative solve of large numbers of linear systems with parameter-dependent matrix and right-hand side which arise during the computation of solution statistics of stochastic elliptic partial differential equations with random and spatially variable coefficients sampled by Monte Carlo. Building on the assumption that a truncated Karhunen-Lo\`{e}ve expansion of a known transform of the random coefficient is available, we introduce a compact approximation of the random coefficient in the form of a Voronoi quantizer. The number of Voronoi cells, each of which is represented by a centroidal coefficient, is set to the prescribed number of preconditioners. Upon sampling the random coefficient, the linear system assembled with a given realization of the coefficient is solved using a Krylov subspace iterative solver with the preconditioner whose centroidal coefficient is the closest to the realization. We consider different ways to define and obtain the centroidal coefficients, and we investigate the properties of the induced preconditioning strategies in terms of average number of solver iterations for sequential simulations, and of load balancing for parallel simulations. Another approach, which is based on deterministic grids on the system of stochastic coordinates of the truncated representation of the random coefficient, is proposed with a stochastic dimension that increases with the number of preconditioners. This approach allows to bypass the need for preliminary computations in order to determine the optimal stochastic dimension of the truncated approximation of the random coefficient for a given number of preconditioners.</description>

      <title>Randomized iterative methods for generalized absolute value equations: Solvability and error bounds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04091v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Randomized iterative methods, such as the Kaczmarz method and its variants, have gained growing attention due to their simplicity and efficiency in solving large-scale linear systems. Meanwhile, absolute value equations (AVE) have attracted increasing interest due to their connection with the linear complementarity problem. In this paper, we investigate the application of randomized iterative methods to generalized AVE (GAVE). Our approach differs from most existing works in that we tackle GAVE with non-square coefficient matrices. We establish more comprehensive sufficient and necessary conditions for characterizing the solvability of GAVE and propose precise error bound conditions. Furthermore, we introduce a flexible and efficient randomized iterative algorithmic framework for solving GAVE, which employs randomized sketching matrices drawn from user-specified distributions. This framework is capable of encompassing many well-known methods, including the Picard iteration method and the randomized Kaczmarz method. Leveraging our findings on solvability and error bounds, we establish both almost sure convergence and linear convergence rates for this versatile algorithmic framework. Finally, we present numerical examples to illustrate the advantages of the new algorithms.</description>

      <title>Neural empirical interpolation method for nonlinear model reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03562v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the neural empirical interpolation method (NEIM), a neural network-based alternative to the discrete empirical interpolation method for reducing the time complexity of computing the nonlinear term in a reduced order model (ROM) for a parameterized nonlinear partial differential equation. NEIM is a greedy algorithm which accomplishes this reduction by approximating an affine decomposition of the nonlinear term of the ROM, where the vector terms of the expansion are given by neural networks depending on the ROM solution, and the coefficients are given by an interpolation of some "optimal" coefficients. Because NEIM is based on a greedy strategy, we are able to provide a basic error analysis to investigate its performance. NEIM has the advantages of being easy to implement in models with automatic differentiation, of being a nonlinear projection of the ROM nonlinearity, of being efficient for both nonlocal and local nonlinearities, and of relying solely on data and not the explicit form of the ROM nonlinearity. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the methodology on solution-dependent and solution-independent nonlinearities, a nonlinear elliptic problem, and a nonlinear parabolic model of liquid crystals.

      <description>arXiv:2409.15863v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we develop a discrete trace theory that spans non-conforming hybrid discretization methods and holds on polytopal meshes. A notion of a discrete trace seminorm is defined, and trace and lifting results with respect to a discrete $H^1$-seminorm on the hybrid fully discrete space are proven. Building on these results we also prove a truncation estimate for piecewise polynomials in the discrete trace seminorm. Finally, we conduct two numerical tests in which we compute the proposed discrete operators and investigate their spectrum to verify the theoretical analysis. The development of this theory is motivated by the design and analysis of preconditioners for hybrid methods, e.g., of substructuring domain decomposition type.</description>

      <title>Geometric low-rank approximation of the Zeitlin model of incompressible fluids on the sphere</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08182v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the vorticity formulation of the Euler equations describing the flow of a two-dimensional incompressible ideal fluid on the sphere. Zeitlin's model provides a finite-dimensional approximation of the vorticity formulation that preserves the underlying geometric structure: it consists of an isospectral Lie--Poisson flow on the Lie algebra of skew-Hermitian matrices. We propose an approximation of Zeitlin's model based on a time-dependent low-rank factorization of the vorticity matrix and evolve a basis of eigenvectors according to the Euler equations. In particular, we show that the approximate flow remains isospectral and Lie--Poisson and that the error in the solution, in the approximation of the Hamiltonian and of the Casimir functions only depends on the approximation of the vorticity matrix at the initial time. The computational complexity of solving the approximate model is shown to scale quadratically with the order of the vorticity matrix and linearly if a further approximation of the stream function is introduced.</description>

Abstract: Nitsche's method is a numerical approach that weakly enforces boundary conditions for partial differential equations. In recent years, Nitsche's method has experienced a revival owing to its natural application in modern computational methods, such as the cut and immersed finite element methods. This study investigates Nitsche's methods based on an anisotropic weakly over-penalized symmetric interior penalty method for Poisson and Stokes equations on convex domains. As our primary contribution, we provide a new proof for the consistency term, which allows us to obtain an estimate of the anisotropic consistency error. The key idea of the proof is to apply the relationship between the Crouzeix and Raviart finite element space and the Raviart--Thomas finite element space. We present the error estimates in the energy norm on anisotropic meshes. We compared the calculation results for the anisotropic mesh partitions in the numerical experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08749v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider elliptic problems in multipatch isogeometric analysis (IGA) where the patch parameterizations may be singular. Specifically, we address cases where certain dimensions of the parametric geometry diminish as the singularity is approached - for example, a curve collapsing into a point (in 2D), or a surface collapsing into a point or a curve (in 3D). To deal with this issue, we develop a robust weak formulation for the second-order Laplace equation that allows trimmed (cut) elements, enforces interface and Dirichlet conditions weakly, and does not depend on specially constructed approximation spaces. Our technique for dealing with the singular maps is based on the regularization of the Riemannian metric tensor, and we detail how to implement this robustly. We investigate the method's behavior when applied to a square-to-cusp parameterization that allows us to vary the singular behavior's aggressiveness in how quickly the measure tends to zero when the singularity is approached. We propose a scaling of the regularization parameter to obtain optimal order approximation. Our numerical experiments indicate that the method is robust also for quite aggressive singular parameterizations.</description>

      <title>Ensemble Score Filter for Data Assimilation of Two-Phase Flow Models in Porous Media</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09245v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Numerical modeling and simulation of two-phase flow in porous media is challenging due to the uncertainties in key parameters, such as permeability. To address these challenges, we propose a computational framework by utilizing the novel Ensemble Score Filter (EnSF) to enhance the accuracy of state estimation for two-phase flow systems in porous media. The forward simulation of the two-phase flow model is implemented using a mixed finite element method, which ensures accurate approximation of the pressure, the velocity, and the saturation. The EnSF leverages score-based diffusion models to approximate filtering distributions efficiently, avoiding the computational expense of neural network-based methods. By incorporating a closed-form score approximation and an analytical update mechanism, the EnSF overcomes degeneracy issues and handles high-dimensional nonlinear filtering with minimal computational overhead. Numerical experiments demonstrate the capabilities of EnSF in scenarios with uncertain permeability and incomplete observational data.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents two main theoretical results concerning shallow neural networks with ReLU$^k$ activation functions. We establish a novel integral representation for Sobolev spaces, showing that every function in $H^{\frac{d+2k+1}{2}}(\Omega)$ can be expressed as an $L^2$-weighted integral of ReLU$^k$ ridge functions over the unit sphere. This result mirrors the known representation of Barron spaces and highlights a fundamental connection between Sobolev regularity and neural network representations. Moreover, we prove that linearized shallow networks -- constructed by fixed inner parameters and optimizing only the linear coefficients -- achieve optimal approximation rates $O(n^{-\frac{1}{2}-\frac{2k+1}{2d}})$ in Sobolev spaces.</description>

      <title>Condition numbers in multiview geometry, instability in relative pose estimation, and RANSAC</title>

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a general framework for analyzing the numerical conditioning of minimal problems in multiple view geometry, using tools from computational algebra and Riemannian geometry. Special motivation comes from the fact that relative pose estimation, based on standard 5-point or 7-point Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC) algorithms, can fail even when no outliers are present and there is enough data to support a hypothesis. We argue that these cases arise due to the intrinsic instability of the 5- and 7-point minimal problems. We apply our framework to characterize the instabilities, both in terms of the world scenes that lead to infinite condition number, and directly in terms of ill-conditioned image data. The approach produces computational tests for assessing the condition number before solving the minimal problem. Lastly, synthetic and real data experiments suggest that RANSAC serves not only to remove outliers, but in practice it also selects for well-conditioned image data, which is consistent with our theory.</description>

      <title>A monolithic first--order BSSNOK formulation of the Einstein--Euler equations and its solution with path-conservative finite difference CWENO schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12055v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new, monolithic first--order (both in time and space) BSSNOK formulation of the coupled Einstein--Euler equations. The entire system of hyperbolic PDEs is solved in a completely unified manner via one single numerical scheme applied to both the conservative sector of the matter part and to the first--order strictly non--conservative sector of the spacetime evolution. The coupling between matter and space-time is achieved via algebraic source terms. The numerical scheme used for the solution of the new monolithic first order formulation is a path-conservative central WENO (CWENO) finite difference scheme, with suitable insertions to account for the presence of the non--conservative terms. By solving several crucial tests of numerical general relativity, including a stable neutron star, Riemann problems in relativistic matter with shock waves and the stable long-time evolution of single and binary puncture black holes up and beyond the binary merger, we show that our new CWENO scheme, introduced two decades ago for the compressible Euler equations of gas dynamics, can be successfully applied also to numerical general relativity, solving all equations at the same time with one single numerical method. In the future the new monolithic approach proposed in this paper may become an attractive alternative to traditional methods that couple central finite difference schemes with Kreiss-Oliger dissipation for the space-time part with totally different TVD schemes for the matter evolution and which are currently the state of the art in the field.</description>
