      <title>Cyclic Quantum Annealing: Searching for Deep Low-Energy States in 5000-Qubit Spin Glass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computers promise a qualitative speedup in solving a broad spectrum of real-life optimization problems. The latter can be mapped onto the task of finding low-energy states of spin glasses, which is known to be exceedingly difficult. Using D-Wave's 5000-qubit quantum processor, we demonstrate that a recently proposed iterative cyclic quantum annealing algorithm[1] can find deep low-energy states in record time. We also find intricate structures in a low-energy landscape of spin glasses, such as a power-law distribution of connected clusters with a small surface energy. These observations offer guidance for further improvement of the optimization algorithms.</description>

      <title>Disconnectivity graphs for visualizing combinatorial optimization problems: challenges of embedding to Ising machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics-based Ising machines (IM) have risen to the challenge of solving hard combinatorial optimization problems with higher speed and better energy efficiency. Generally, such dedicated systems employ local search heuristics to traverse energy landscapes in searching for optimal solutions. Extending landscape geometry visualization tools, disconnectivity graphs, we quantify and address some of the major challenges met by IMs in the field of combinatorial optimization. Using efficient sampling methods, we visually capture landscapes of problems having diverse structure and hardness and featuring strong degeneracies, which act as entropic barriers for IMs. Furthermore, we investigate energy barriers, local minima, and configuration space clustering effects caused by locality reduction methods when embedding combinatorial problems to the Ising hardware. For this purpose, we sample disconnectivity graphs of PUBO energy landscapes and their different QUBO mappings accounting for both local minima and saddle regions. We demonstrate that QUBO energy landscape properties lead to the subpar performance of quadratic IMs and suggest directions for their improvement.</description>

      <title>Measuring Entanglement in Physical Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The links of a physical network cannot cross, which often forces the network layout into non- optimal entangled states. Here we define a network fabric as a two-dimensional projection of a network and propose the average crossing number as a measure of network entanglement. We analytically derive the dependence of the crossing number on network density, average link length, degree heterogeneity, and community structure and show that the predictions accurately estimate the entanglement of both network models and of real physical networks.</description>

      <title>Discrete time-crystals in linear potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discrete time crystalline (DTC) phases have attracted significant theoretical and experimental attention in the last few years. Such systems require a seemingly impossible combination of non-adiabatic driving and a finite-entropy long-time state, which is, however, possible in non-ergodic systems. Previous works have often relied on disorder for the required non-ergodicity; here, we describe the construction of a discrete time crystal (DTC) phase in non-disordered, non-integrable Ising-type systems. After discussing the conditions for interacting and periodically driven systems to display such phases in general, we propose a concrete model and then provide approximate analytical arguments and direct numerical evidence that it satisfies the conditions and displays a DTC phase robust to local periodic perturbations.</description>

      <title>Renormalization group for Anderson localization on high-dimensional lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the dependence of the critical properties of the Anderson model on the dimension $d$ in the language of $\beta$-function and renormalization group recently introduced in Ref.[arXiv:2306.14965] in the context of Anderson transition on random regular graphs. We show how in the delocalized region, including the transition point, the one-parameter scaling part of the $\beta$-function for the fractal dimension $D_{1}$ evolves smoothly from its $d=2$ form, in which $\beta_2\leq 0$, to its $\beta_\infty\geq 0$ form, which is represented by the regular random graph (RRG) result. We show how the $\epsilon=d-2$ expansion and the $1/d$ expansion around the RRG result can be reconciled and how the initial part of a renormalization group trajectory governed by the irrelevant exponent $y$ depends on dimensionality. We also show how the irrelevant exponent emerges out of the high-gradient terms of expansion in the nonlinear sigma-model and put forward a conjecture about a lower bound for the fractal dimension. The framework introduced here may serve as a basis for investigations of disordered many-body systems and of more general non-equilibrium quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Evolving disorder and chaos induces acceleration of elastic waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Static or frozen disorder, characterised by spatial heterogeneities, influences diverse complex systems, encompassing many-body systems, equilibrium and nonequilibrium states of matter, intricate network topologies, biological systems, and wave-matter interactions. While static disorder has been thoroughly examined, delving into evolving disorder brings increased intricacy to the issue. An example of this complexity is the observation of stochastic acceleration of electromagnetic waves in evolving media, where noisy fluctuations in the propagation medium transfer effective momentum to the wave. Here, we investigate elastic wave propagation in a one-dimensional heterogeneous medium with diagonal disorder. We examine two types of complex elastic materials: one with static disorder, where mass density randomly varies in space, and the other with evolving disorder, featuring random variations in both space and time. Our results indicate that evolving disorder enhances the propagation speed of Gaussian pulses compared to static disorder. Additionally, we demonstrate that the acceleration effect also occurs when the medium evolves chaotically rather than randomly over time. The latter establishes that evolving randomness is not a unique prerequisite for observing wavefront acceleration, introducing the concept of chaotic acceleration in complex media.</description>

      <title>Computational supremacy in quantum simulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00910v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computers hold the promise of solving certain problems that lie beyond the reach of conventional computers. Establishing this capability, especially for impactful and meaningful problems, remains a central challenge. One such problem is the simulation of nonequilibrium dynamics of a magnetic spin system quenched through a quantum phase transition. State-of-the-art classical simulations demand resources that grow exponentially with system size. Here we show that superconducting quantum annealing processors can rapidly generate samples in close agreement with solutions of the Schr\"odinger equation. We demonstrate area-law scaling of entanglement in the model quench in two-, three- and infinite-dimensional spin glasses, supporting the observed stretched-exponential scaling of effort for classical approaches. We assess approximate methods based on tensor networks and neural networks and conclude that no known approach can achieve the same accuracy as the quantum annealer within a reasonable timeframe. Thus quantum annealers can answer questions of practical importance that classical computers cannot.</description>

      <title>A universal niche geometry governs the response of ecosystems to environmental perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How ecosystems respond to environmental perturbations is a fundamental question in ecology, made especially challenging due to the strong coupling between species and their environment. Here, we introduce a theoretical framework for calculating the linear response of ecosystems to environmental perturbations in generalized consumer-resource models. Our construction is applicable to a wide class of systems, including models with non-reciprocal interactions, cross-feeding, and non-linear growth/consumption rates. Within our framework, all ecological variables are embedded into four distinct vector spaces and ecological interactions are represented by geometric transformations between these spaces. We show that near a steady state, such geometric transformations directly map environmental perturbations -- in resource availability and mortality rates -- to shifts in niche structure. We illustrate these ideas in a variety of settings including a minimal model for pH-induced toxicity in bacterial denitrification.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous assembly of condensate networks during the demixing of structured fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Liquid-liquid phase separation, whereby two liquids spontaneously demix, is ubiquitous in industrial, environmental, and biological processes. While isotropic fluids are known to condense into spherical droplets in the binodal region, these dynamics are poorly understood for structured fluids. Here, we report the novel observation of condensate networks, which spontaneously assemble during the demixing of a mesogen from a solvent. Condensing mesogens form rapidly-elongating filaments, rather than spheres, to relieve distortion of a simultaneously-forming internal smectic mesophase. As filaments densify, they collapse into bulged discs, lowering the elastic free energy. Additional distortion is relieved by retraction of filaments into the bulged discs, which are straightened under tension to form a ramified network. Understanding and controlling these dynamics may provide new avenues to direct pattern formation or template materials.</description>

      <title>Disorder-Induced Anomalous Mobility Enhancement in Confined Geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strong, scale-free disorder disrupts typical transport properties like the Stokes-Einstein relation and linear response, leading to anomalous, non-diffusive motion observed in amorphous materials, glasses, living cells, and other systems. Our study reveals that the combination of scale-free quenched disorder and geometrical constraints induces unconventional single particle mobility behavior. Specifically, in a $2$-dimensional channel with width $w$, under external drive, tighter geometrical constraints (smaller $w$) enhance mobility. We derive an explicit form of the response to an external force by utilizing the double-subordination approach for the quenched trap model. The observed mobility enhancement occurs in the low-temperature regime where the distribution of localization times is scale-free.</description>

      <title>Minimal cyclic behavior in sheared amorphous solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although jammed packings of soft spheres exist in potential-energy landscapes with a vast number of minima, when subjected to cyclic shear they may revisit the same configurations repeatedly. Simple hysteretic spin models, in which particle rearrangements are represented by spin flips, capture many features of this periodic behavior. Yet it has been unclear to what extent individual rearrangements can be described by such binary objects. Using a particularly sensitive algorithm, we identify rearrangements in simulated jammed packings. We select pairs of rearrangements that undo one another to create periodic cyclic behavior, explore the statistics of these pairs, and show that their internal structure is more complex than a spin analogy would indicate. This offers insight into both the collective nature of rearrangement events themselves and how complex systems such as amorphous solids can reach a limit cycle with relative ease.</description>

      <title>Jamming is a first-order transition with quenched disorder in amorphous materials sheared by cyclic quasistatic deformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Jamming is an athermal transition between flowing and rigid states in amorphous systems such as granular matter, colloidal suspensions, complex fluids and cells. The jamming transition seems to display mixed aspects of a first-order transition, evidenced by a discontinuity in the coordination number, and a second-order transition, indicated by power-law scalings and diverging lengths. Here we demonstrate that jamming is a first-order transition with quenched disorder in cyclically sheared systems with quasistatic deformations. Particle models are simulated in two and three dimensions, which undergo reversible-irreversible transitions under cyclic shear. The ensemble of configurations, with partially crystallized and fragile states excluded, is generated in the irreversible phase, where the system is stationary and particles are diffusive. Detailed scaling analyses are performed on the distribution of coordination numbers. The fluctuation of the jamming density in finite-sized systems has important consequences on the finite-size effects of various quantities, resulting in a square relationship between disconnected and connected susceptibilities, a key signature of first-order transitions with quenched disorder. This study puts the jamming transition into the category of a broad class of transitions in disordered systems, including the first-order transition in the random-field Ising model, brittle yielding of amorphous materials, and melting of ultra-stable glasses.</description>

      <title>Capacity of the Hebbian-Hopfield network associative memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In \cite{Hop82}, Hopfield introduced a \emph{Hebbian} learning rule based neural network model and suggested how it can efficiently operate as an associative memory. Studying random binary patterns, he also uncovered that, if a small fraction of errors is tolerated in the stored patterns retrieval, the capacity of the network (maximal number of memorized patterns, $m$) scales linearly with each pattern's size, $n$. Moreover, he famously predicted $\alpha_c=\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\frac{m}{n}\approx 0.14$. We study this very same scenario with two famous pattern's basins of attraction: \textbf{\emph{(i)}} The AGS one from \cite{AmiGutSom85}; and \textbf{\emph{(ii)}} The NLT one from \cite{Newman88,Louk94,Louk94a,Louk97,Tal98}. Relying on the \emph{fully lifted random duality theory} (fl RDT) from \cite{Stojnicflrdt23}, we obtain the following explicit capacity characterizations on the first level of lifting:
  \begin{equation}
  \alpha_c^{(AGS,1)} = \left ( \max_{\delta\in \left ( 0,\frac{1}{2}\right ) }\frac{1-2\delta}{\sqrt{2} \mbox{erfinv} \left ( 1-2\delta\right )} - \frac{2}{\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-\left ( \mbox{erfinv}\left ( 1-2\delta \right )\right )^2}\right )^2 \approx \mathbf{0.137906} \end{equation}
  \begin{equation}
  \alpha_c^{(NLT,1)} = \frac{\mbox{erf}(x)^2}{2x^2}-1+\mbox{erf}(x)^2 \approx \mathbf{0.129490}, \quad 1-\mbox{erf}(x)^2- \frac{2\mbox{erf}(x)e^{-x^2}}{\sqrt{\pi}x}+\frac{2e^{-2x^2}}{\pi}=0. \end{equation}
  A substantial numerical work gives on the second level of lifting $\alpha_c^{(AGS,2)} \approx \mathbf{0.138186}$ and $\alpha_c^{(NLT,2)} \approx \mathbf{0.12979}$, effectively uncovering a remarkably fast lifting convergence. Moreover, the obtained AGS characterizations exactly match the replica symmetry based ones of \cite{AmiGutSom85} and the corresponding symmetry breaking ones of \cite{SteKuh94}.</description>

Abstract: We investigate scenarios in which the low-temperature phase of short-range spin glasses comprises thermodynamic states which are nontrivial mixtures of multiple incongruent pure state pairs. We construct a new kind of metastate supported on Gibbs states whose edge overlap values with a reference state fall within a specified range. Using this metastate we show that, in any dimension, the variance of free energy difference fluctuations between pure states within a single mixed Gibbs state with multiple edge overlap values diverges linearly with the volume. We discuss some implications of these results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.16050v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new viewpoint on the study of localization transitions in disordered quantum systems, showing how critical properties can be seen also as a geometric transition in the data space generated by the classically encoded configurations of the disordered quantum system. We showcase our approach to the Anderson model on regular random graphs, known for displaying features of interacting systems, despite being a single-particle problem. We estimate the transition point and critical exponents in agreement with the best-known results in the literature. We provide a simple and coherent explanation of our findings, discussing the applicability of the method in real-world scenarios with a modest number of measurements.</description>

Abstract: We numerically analyze the spectral statistics of the multiparametric Gaussian ensembles of complex matrices with zero mean and variances with different decay routes away from the diagonals. As the latter mimics different degree of effective sparsity among the matrix elements, such ensembles can serve as good models for a wide range of phase transitions e.g. localization to delocalization in non-Hermitian systems or Hermitian to non-Hermitian one. Our analysis reveals a rich behavior hidden beneath the spectral statistics e.g. a crossover of the spectral statistics from Poisson to Ginibre universality class with changing variances for finite matrix size, an abrupt transition for infinite matrix size and the role of complexity parameter, a single functional of all system parameters, as a criteria to determine critical point. We also confirm the theoretical predictions in \cite{psgs, psnh}, regarding the universality of the spectral statistics in non-equilibrium regime of non-Hermitian systems characterized by the complexity parameter.</description>

      <title>Investigating finite-size effects in random matrices by counting resonances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10271</link>

Abstract: Resonance counting is an intuitive and widely used tool in Random Matrix Theory and Anderson Localization. Its undoubted advantage is its simplicity: in principle, it is easily applicable to any random matrix ensemble. On the downside, the notion of resonance is ill-defined, and the `number of resonances' does not have a direct mapping to any commonly used physical observable like the participation entropy, the fractal dimensions, or the gap ratios (r-parameter), restricting the method's predictive power to the thermodynamic limit only where it can be used for locating the Anderson localization transition. In this work, we reevaluate the notion of resonances and relate it to measurable quantities, building a foundation for the future application of the method to finite-size systems.

      <title>Entropy and chirality in sphinx tilings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.14388v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As a toy model of chiral interactions in crowded spaces, we consider sphinx tilings in finite regions of the triangular lattice. The sphinx tiles, hexiamonds composed of six equilateral triangles in the shape of a stylized sphinx, come in left and right enantiomorphs. Regions scaled up from the unit sphinx by an integer factor ("Sphinx frames") require tiles of both chiral forms to produce tilings, including crystalline, quasicrystalline, and fully disordered tilings. For frames up to order 13, we describe methods that permit exact enumeration and computation of partition functions using "accelerated backtracking," "seam," and "dangler" algorithms. For larger frames, we introduce a Monte Carlo (MC) method to sample typical tilings. Key to the latter is the identification of fundamental shapes (polyads) that admit multiple tilings and which allow a rejection-free MC simulation.</description>

      <title>A Phase Transition in Diffusion Models Reveals the Hierarchical Nature of Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16991v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the structure of real data is paramount in advancing modern deep-learning methodologies. Natural data such as images are believed to be composed of features organised in a hierarchical and combinatorial manner, which neural networks capture during learning. Recent advancements show that diffusion models can generate high-quality images, hinting at their ability to capture this underlying structure. We study this phenomenon in a hierarchical generative model of data. We find that the backward diffusion process acting after a time $t$ is governed by a phase transition at some threshold time, where the probability of reconstructing high-level features, like the class of an image, suddenly drops. Instead, the reconstruction of low-level features, such as specific details of an image, evolves smoothly across the whole diffusion process. This result implies that at times beyond the transition, the class has changed but the generated sample may still be composed of low-level elements of the initial image. We validate these theoretical insights through numerical experiments on class-unconditional ImageNet diffusion models. Our analysis characterises the relationship between time and scale in diffusion models and puts forward generative models as powerful tools to model combinatorial data properties.</description>
