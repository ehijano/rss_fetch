      <description>arXiv:2509.05401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This chapter introduces the reader to the solar interior, in particular the convection zone. The first section explores the solar cycle and the dynamo models that have been studied to explain this cycle. The second section explores helioseismology observations and analysis of the solar interior, and reviews the fundamental knowledge that has been gained from these studies. The third and final section reviews observations and theory of magnetic fields emerging from the convection zone into the solar corona.</description>

      <title>Super-slowly rotating Ap (ssrAp) stars: New spectroscopic observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rotation periods of Ap stars range over five to six orders of magnitude. The origin of their differentiation remains unknown. We carry out a systematic study of the longest period Ap stars to gain insight into their properties. We analyse newly obtained spectra of a sample of super-slowly rotating Ap (ssrAp) star candidates identified by a TESS photometric survey to confirm that their projected equatorial velocity v sin i is consistent with (very) long rotation periods, to obtain a first determination of their magnetic fields, and to test their binarity. The value of v sin i in 16 of the 18 studied stars is low enough for them to have moderately to extremely long rotation periods. All stars but one are definitely magnetic; for five of them, the magnetic field was detected for the first time. Five new stars with resolved magnetically split lines were discovered. Five stars that were not previously known to be spectroscopic binaries show radial velocity variations; in one of them, lines from both components are observed.</description>

      <title>Exploration of the Near-Infrared Colors of Cold Y Dwarfs from the Ground and Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: JWST has provided critical mid-infrared data for cold brown dwarfs. It has also provided low-resolution near-infrared spectra, and for faint sources these are the first spectra at these wavelengths. We use these data and other literature sources to synthesize near-infrared photometry on the MKO system for 19 T and Y dwarfs, on the Euclid system for 44 T and Y dwarfs, and on the Roman system for 48 T and Y dwarfs. We also synthesize Euclid I_E magnitudes for 15 T and Y dwarfs. Using the Beiler et al. 2024 observational effective temperatures (T_eff), together with ATMO 2020++ model colors, we show that the absolute 4.6um magnitude can be used as a proxy for T_eff. We present a polynomial fit to the M_W2:T_eff relationship for cool dwarfs with 250 &lt; T_eff K &lt; 1000. We select five Y dwarfs with 275 &lt; T_eff K &lt; 400 which have a range in near- to mid-infrared colors. Comparison of the JWST spectral energy distribution to ATMO 2020++ models indicate that Y dwarfs which are bluer in J - W2 are lower gravity or more metal-rich than their redder counterparts, with stronger CO and CO_2 absorption at 4.2 &lt; lambda um &lt; 4.9. The near-infrared color diagrams show significant scatter, with complex dependencies on T_eff, metallicity and gravity. In order to disentangle these effects, opacity sources for cool model atmospheres need to be more complete at lambda &lt; 1um.</description>

      <title>Segmentation and Tracking of Eruptive Solar Phenomena with Convolutional Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar eruptive events are complex phenomena, which most often include coronal mass ejections (CME), CME-driven compressive and shock waves, flares, and filament eruptions. CMEs are large eruptions of magnetized plasma from the Sun's outer atmosphere or corona, that propagate outward into the interplanetary space. Over the last several decades a large amount of remote solar eruption observational data has become available from ground-based and space-borne instruments. This has recently required the development of software approaches for automated characterisation of eruptive features. Most solar feature detection and tracking algorithms currently in use have restricted applicability and complicated processing chains, while complexity in engineering machine learning (ML) training sets limit the use of data-driven approaches for tracking or solar eruptive related phenomena. Recently, we introduced Wavetrack - a general algorithmic method for smart characterization and tracking of solar eruptive features. The method, based on a-trous wavelet decomposition, intensity rankings and a set of filtering techniques, allows to simplify and automate image processing and feature tracking. Previously, we applied the method successfully to several types of remote solar observations. Here we present the natural evolution of this approach. We discuss various aspects of applying Machine Learning (ML) techniques towards segmentation of high-dynamic range heliophysics observations. We trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) image segmentation models using feature masks obtained from the Wavetrack code. We present results from pre-trained models for segmentation of solar eruptive features and demonstrate their performance on a set of CME events based on SDO/AIA instrument data.</description>

      <title>Asteroseismology of 35 Kepler and TESS $\delta$ Scuti stars near the red edge of the instability strip. The limitations of $\delta$ Scuti stars for dating open clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aims. The aim of this work is to determine the maximum ages that can be unambiguously established for $\delta$ Sct stars using seismic observables, and, by extension, the oldest open clusters that can be dated using this type of star. Methods. I estimate the large frequency separation using various techniques applied to two samples of $\delta$ Sct located near the red edge of the instability strip. One sample consists of 18 targets observed by the Kepler mission, and the other comprises 17 targets observed by TESS. I employ a grid of stellar models representative of typical $\delta$ Sct parameters, incorporating mass, metallicity, and rotation as independent variables, and compute the first eight radial modes for each model. Using the observed spectroscopic temperature, and the estimated large separation, I estimate the age of each star by fitting a weighted probability density function to the age distribution of the models that best match the seismic constraints. Results. To evaluate the performance of the fitting method, it was applied to a synthetic population of 20 $\delta$ Sct stars with varying metallicities and ages, generated by randomly selecting models. The analysis indicates that $\delta$ Sct stars older than 1 Gyr, but still prior to reaching the terminal-age main sequence, can in principle be reliably age-dated. Nevertheless, when the method is applied to the observational sample, only three out of the 35 stars considered marginally exceed an estimated age of 1 Gyr. Conclusions. From these results, I can say that open clusters older than approximately 1 Gyr cannot be reliably dated using astero-seismology of $\delta$ Sct stars with 1D models, at least not without a more complete treatment of convection and a non-linear treatment of rotation.</description>

      <title>Asteroseismology of the young open cluster NGC 2516 II. Constraining cluster age using gravity-mode pulsators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although asteroseismology is regarded as the most powerful tool for probing stellar interiors, seismic modelling remains dependent on global stellar parameters. Stellar clusters offer direct measurements of these parameters by fitting a CMD, making the application of asteroseismology in clusters a valuable approach to advancing stellar physics modelling. We aimed to develop seismic modelling for gravity-mode pulsators in the open cluster NGC 2516 to determine stellar ages. We computed 1D stellar models using MESA, incorporating rotation-induced transport processes. Exponential overshooting was included, as well as rotationally induced mixing in the radiative envelope. Grids of evolutionary models were computed covering isochrone-derived mass ranges. The models were evolved up to 300 Myr because of the cluster's young age (~100Myr). By fitting the frequencies of identified modes of four gravity-mode member pulsators simultaneously, we measure the seismic age of the cluster NGC 2516 as 132+-8Myr. This high-precision seismic age estimate deviates by 1sigma from the isochronal age derived from public MIST isochrones for rotating stars. Our findings show that seismic modelling strongly constrains core overshooting, but because the period spacing patterns are smooth, it provides weak constraints on mixing in the radiative envelopes. The two most massive gravity-mode pulsators have MIST masses ~2.0M_sun while their seismic masses are 1.75M_sun. We constructed new asteroseismology-calibrated isochrones using input physics identical to that of our seismic model grid. While this resolves the age discrepancy, the mass discrepancy is only partially addressed. The remaining small yet persisting mass discrepancy implies a mismatch between the physics in core to surface environments of 1D stellar models and the seismic observables probing those areas of fast-rotating stars.</description>

      <title>Millimetre continuum from LBV stars and their environs. NIKA2 observations and Virtual Observatory data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-wavelength studies of their circumstellar environments around LBVs are essential to quantify their feedback at Galactic scales. Dominant emission mechanisms at millimetre wavelengths are, however, still poorly understood. Stellar winds, circumstellar dust, and ionised gas have not been explored together in the case of LBVs. We aim to study the millimetre continuum emission of Galactic LBVs to disclose the presence of these components, to describe their morphology and to measure their relevance in the mass and energy injection to the interstellar medium. We have used the NIKA2 continuum camera at the IRAM 30-m radio telescope to observe and analyse 1.15 and 2 mm continuum from the LBVs HD168607, HD168625, MN87, MN101, and G79.29+0.46. We used Virtual Observatory to complement our observations with archival data from optical, infrared, mm- and cm-wavelengths. With this information, we have built complete SEDs for the five sources, covering six decades of the electromagnetic spectrum. All targets except MN87 were detected at both wavelengths, with features including compact sources, extended nebular emission, shells, and unrelated background structures. Spectral indices of compact sources are consistent with thermal emission from stellar winds. We modelled the SEDs and successfully reproduced the emission from stellar photospheres, circumstellar dust, thermal stellar winds and enshrouding HII regions. Our models, in agreement with previous literature results, reveal the presence of unresolved hot dust very close to the stars and provide the first estimates for the fundamental parameters of MN101. This pilot study highlights the great potential of millimetre continuum studies of LBVs and possibly other evolved massive stars. The mm spectral window bridges the far-IR and radio regimes and can disclose the relative contribution of dust and free-free emission in this kind of sources.</description>

      <title>Simulation of Solar Surface Flux Transport Constrained by Magnetic Power Spectra. I. Flux Transport Parameter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The multi-scale structure of the solar surface magnetic field is essential for understanding both the Sun's internal dynamo processes and its external magnetic activity. The surface flux transport (SFT) model has been successful in describing the large-scale evolution of the surface field, but its ability to capture observed multi-scale features, quantified by magnetic power spectra, remains uncertain. Here, we evaluate the SFT model by comparing observed and simulated power spectra across a broad range of spatial scales and by analyzing the effects of key transport parameters. We find that the simulations reproduce the observed spectra well at spherical harmonic degrees $l\lesssim60$, but diverge progressively at smaller spatial scales $l\gtrsim60$. This divergence likely arises from the diffusion approximation used to model the random walk of supergranulation. Power at $20 \lesssim l \lesssim 60$ is primarily determined by the magnetic flux sources, while at $l \lesssim 20$, the spectra are more sensitive to transport parameters. The meridional flow profile, including its equatorial gradient, peak latitude, and polar distribution, along with turbulent diffusivity, has distinct impacts on the low-degree modes ($l \leq 5$). In particular, a comparison of the $l$=3 and $l$=5 multipoles strengths suggests that the poleward flow above $\sim\pm60^\circ$ latitudes is very weak. This study presents the first quantitative validation of SFT models using magnetic power spectra and provides new constraints on surface flux transport physics.</description>

      <title>Can the Anomalous Magnetic Braking of Ap/Bp Stars Explain the Orbital Decay of Algol-type Binaries?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several Algol-type binaries were detected to be experiencing rapid orbital decay, which is in contradiction with the conservative mass transfer model.} In this work, we investigate whether anomalous magnetic braking (MB) of intermediate-mass Ap/Bp stars, characterized by surface magnetic fields of $\sim10^2 \mathendash 10^4~\rm G$, could drive orbital decay through magnetic wind-field coupling. Using the stellar evolution code {\ttfamily MESA}, we simulate the evolution of several \add{main-sequence binaries containing Ap/Bp stars}, with typical initial parameters \add{of Algol binaries}. Our models indicate that the anomalous MB mechanism could induce orbital decay in long timescales (hundreds of Myr to several Gyr), \add{reproducing several basic Algol parameters such as the effective temperatures and luminosities of donor stars. However, the predicted orbital period decay rates are much lower than those observed in several Algol systems. We analyze the limitations of the anomalous MB model and discuss alternative mechanisms that could account for the long- or short-term orbital period variations observed in Algol systems, including a surrounding circumbinary disk, stellar expansion, the Applegate mechanism, and the light travel-time effect. Long-term observations are still required to distinguish between these mechanisms in the future.</description>

      <title>Neural Enhancement of the Traditional Wang-Sheeley-Arge Solar Wind Relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Wang-Sheeley-Arge (WSA) model has been the cornerstone of operational solar wind forecasting for nearly two decades, owing to its simplicity and physics-based formalism. However, its performance is strongly dependent on several empirical parameters that are typically fixed or tuned manually, limiting its adaptability across varying solar conditions. In this study, we present a neural enhancement to the WSA framework (referred to as WSA+) that systematically optimizes the empirical parameters of the WSA solar wind speed relation using in-situ observations within a differentiable physics-constrained pipeline. The approach operates in two stages: first, a neural optimizer adjusts WSA parameters independently for each Carrington Rotation to better match the observed solar wind data. Then, a neural network learns to predict these optimized speed maps directly from magnetogram-derived features. This enables generalization of the optimization process and allows inference for new solar conditions without manual tuning. The developed WSA+ preserves the interpretability of the original relation while significantly improving the match with OMNI in-situ data across multiple performance metrics, including correlation and error statistics. It consistently outperforms the traditional WSA relation across both low and high solar activity periods, with average improvements of approximately 40 percent. By integrating data-driven learning with physical constraints, WSA+ offers a robust and adaptable enhancement, with immediate utility as a drop-in replacement in global heliospheric modeling pipelines.</description>

      <title>Synthetic Ca II 8542 \AA\ Stokes Profile Associated with Chromospheric Magnetic Reconnection in a Simulated Active Region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic reconnection is an important driving mechanism of many chromospheric phenomena, e.g., UV bursts and chromospheric jets. Information about magnetic field is indispensable for analyzing chromospheric magnetic reconnection, which is mainly encoded in polarization signals. The purpose of this work is to predict possible Stokes features related to chromospheric reconnection events, from realistic two-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulation and Stokes profile synthesis. An emerging magnetic flux sheet is imposed at the bottom boundary of a well-relaxed unipolar atmosphere that spans from the upper convection zone to the corona. The reconnection region is heated to $\sim$7 kK and the outflow velocity reaches up to $\sim$35 km s$^{-1}$. Through Stokes profile synthesis, several Stokes features related to reconnections and plasmoids are reproduced. We found sign reversal features on circular polarization and amplitude reduction features on linear polarization at reconnection sites. Also, we report strong linear and circular polarization signals corresponding to huge ($\sim$300 km) and tiny ($\sim$40 km) plasmoids, respectively. We conclude that both linear and circular polarization signals may reveal the distinctive physical mechanisms in reconnections, and enhance the understanding of magnetic reconnection in observations.</description>

      <title>Selected Results on Variable Stars Observed by TESS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As we enter the final year of the second extended mission of the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), it is time to reflect on what the TESS mission has contributed to the advancement of astronomy. Thousands of papers based on TESS data have already been published, making it a challenge to select the ones we mention or summarise in this review. As the title suggests, this paper focuses on variable stars, that is, phenomena that causes a star's brightness to change. We discuss all the major classes of extrinsic and intrinsic variables, from planetary transits to pulsating stars, excluding only the longest-period ones, which are not well suited for the typical time spans of TESS time-series observations. TESS has provided significant and interesting data and results for all these variable types. We hope that this selection successfully demonstrates the diverse applicability of TESS in variable star research.</description>

      <title>A complex network approach to TESS light curves of $\delta$ Sct stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By using the horizontal visibility algorithm, the TESS light curves of 69 delta Sct stars are mapped to undirected horizontal visibility graphs (HVGs), where the graph nodes represent the light curve points. Then, the morphological characteristics of HVGs, such as the distribution of links between nodes (degree distribution) or the average fraction of triangles around each node (average clustering coefficient) are measured. The average clustering coefficients for HADS and LADS show two different linear correlations with the peak to peak amplitude of the TESS light curves is naturally separating them into two groups, thys, avoiding ad-hoc criteria for the first time. Exponential fits on HVG degree distributions for both HADS and LADS stars give indices suggesting correlated stochastic generating processes for delta Sct light curves. By applying the theoretical expression for the HVGs degree distribution of random time series we can distinguish significant pulsations from the background noise which might become a practical tool in frequency analysis of stars.</description>

      <title>3D structures of the base of small-scale recurrent jets revealed by Solar orbiter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar jets, characterized by small-scale plasma ejections along open magnetic field lines or the legs of large-scale coronal loops, play a crucial role in the dynamics of the solar atmosphere. Although spectral and EUV images have been widely used to analyze the formation and evolution of jets, the detailed 3D structure at the base of the jet has not been studied in detail due to the limitations in the spatial resolution of observations. Solar Orbiter enables us to investigate the structure of solar jets with much higher spatial and temporal resolutions and from a different angle than from Earth. By combining observations made by instruments onboard Solar Orbiter with data from the SDO, we analyzed recurrent solar jets originating in a mixed-polarity region near an active region. Additionally, we employed potential field and magnetohydrostatic extrapolation techniques to determine the magnetic field topology associated with the jets. The jets display dynamic, multi-strand outflows emanating from compact bright kernels above the magnetic inversion line, with apparent speeds exceeding 100 km/s. Magnetic field evolution reveals continuous flux cancellation at the jet footpoints. Throughout the sequence, base flows are confined within quasi-separatrix layers, with the highest velocities and temperatures located near coronal null points. Over four eruptions, the magnetic topology evolves from a simple fan-spine configuration with a single null to a more complex dome-shaped base containing multiple nulls with separatrix curtain, accompanied by a morphological transition from narrow, well-collimated spire to broader, fragmented outflows. These results provide the first direct observational evidence that dynamic changes in null-point geometry modulate jet morphology and energetics via successive reconnection episodes.</description>

      <title>Carbon-Enhanced Dwarf Stars Are Predominantly a Halo Population</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper reports a Galactic kinematical and dynamical analysis of 1003 main-sequence carbon stars. The sample is drawn from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, and cross-matched with Gaia DR3 to obtain 6-dimensional positions and velocities using a Bayesian framework. The study provides the first reliable distances for a large sample of dwarf carbon stars, which are then analyzed using both space motions and actions. The results are combined with dynamical equilibrium models for the three primary Galactic components to assign membership, finding that around 60 per cent belong to the halo, and over 30 per cent originate in the thick disc. Therefore, the results indicate dwarf carbon stars are dominated by a metal-poor halo population, and are thus an excellent resource for stellar archaeology. These stars remain on the main sequence and are relatively nearby, but atmospheric modelling is challenged by their cool effective temperatures and strong molecular features. In light of this, efforts should be made to improve C/O &gt;1 atmospheric modelling, as the subset of low-mass dwarf carbon stars may numerically dominate the Galactic population of carbon-enriched, metal-poor stars.</description>

      <title>An Acoustic Model for Sunquakes Unifying the Solar Interior and Atmosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the leading hypotheses for sunquake generation suggests that flare-accelerated particles originating from the reconnection site in the corona travel down to the chromosphere and photosphere, where they deposit energy through collisions and subsequently drive acoustic oscillations. To properly encompass this top-down excitation mechanism, we extend the domain of a semi-spectral 3D acoustic model of the global Sun up to several 10's of Mm above the photosphere, where the transition region and lower corona are resolved. We then use the radially-dependent heating rates derived from the flare radiative hydrodynamic (RADYN) simulations -- extrapolated to a 3D profile -- to realistically excite sunquakes. In addition to the usual sunquake wavefronts, we also observe waves that propagate through the chromosphere and corona in a similar fashion to Moreton-Ramsey waves and large-scale coronal propagating fronts (LCPFs). We examine the dynamics of these waves and discuss how they may be used to constrain models of sunquake excitation.</description>

      <title>A Seven-Day Multi-Wavelength Flare Campaign on AU Mic III: Quiescent and Flaring Properties of the X-ray Spectra and Chromospheric lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the X-ray quiescent and flaring properties from a unique, 7-day multiwavelength observing campaign on the M1 flare star AU Mic. Combining the XMM-Newton X-ray spectra with the chromospheric line and broadband NUV and optical continuum observations provides a dataset that is one of the most comprehensive to date. We analyze the sample of 38 X-ray flares and study in detail the X-ray flare temperature ($T$) and emission measure (EM) evolutions of three largest flares with the X-ray flare energies of $&gt;10^{33}$ erg. The $T-\mathrm{EM}$ evolution tracks and multi-wavelength emission evolutions of the largest-amplitude Neupert-type flare reveal that the so-called ``Flare H-R diagram" is consistent with thermal coronal flare emission evolution. The two other more gradual and longer duration X-ray flares are interpreted as having larger size scales. None of the 17 H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ flares show clear blue/red wing asymmetries, including the ones associated with the potential X-ray dimming event previously reported. The above largest-amplitude Neupert flare shows clear symmetric H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ broadenings with roughly $\pm$400 and $\pm$600 km s$^{-1}$, respectively, which are synchronized with the optical/NUV continuum emission evolution. Radiative hydrodynamic modeling results suggest that electron beam heating parameters that have been used to reproduce M-dwarf flare NUV/optical continuum emissions can reproduce these large broadenings of H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ lines. These results suggest that these most energetic M-dwarf flares are associated with stronger magnetic field flux densities and larger size scales than solar flares but can be interpreted in terms of the standard flare model.</description>

      <title>Revealing Unresolved White Dwarf-Main Sequence Binaries using Gaia DR3 and GALEX I. A Volume limited study of 100 pc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Understanding the demographics of white dwarf - main sequence (WDMS) binaries is key to uncovering the formation of various stellar exotica and refining the details of binary stellar evolution. Despite several dedicated efforts to identify unresolved WDMS binaries, their population remains incomplete, even within a 100 pc volume-limited sample. Aims. This study aims to identify WDMS binaries hidden within the main sequence of the optical color-magnitude diagram (CMD), improving the completeness of WDMS binaries within a volume-limited sample of 100 pc. Methods. We use NUV-optical CMDs to distinguish unresolved WDMS binaries from the rest of the populations. High-precision astrometric and photometric data from Gaia DR3 and NUV data from GALEX GR6/7 are combined to construct CMDs. Using the binary spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting algorithm within the Virtual Observatory SED Analyzer (VOSA) tool, we estimate stellar parameters such as effective temperature, bolometric luminosity, and radii. The masses of the WD companions are determined using white dwarf evolutionary models. As we use the sources which are detected only in NUV band of GALEX, this study directly complements to majority of the previous studies. Results. We identify 596 WD-MS binary candidates within 100 pc, with 497 newly reported. Our method predominantly identifies binaries with cooler WD companions (median ~7,000 K) compared to previous studies. The WD masses range from ~0.2 and 1.3 M$_\odot$, and most MS companions are of M spectral type.</description>

      <title>Rotational Metric: A Solution to Einstein's Clock-Rate Problem and Its Magnetospheric Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20501v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rotational metric provides an exact solution to Einstein's clock-rate problem in curved spacetime, specifically, whether time flows more slowly at the equator of a compact object such as a neutron star than at its poles. It features a curvature singularity, an event horizon, a potentially evolving ergosphere, a rigidly-rotating normal space, and two stationary limit surfaces. Although derived from the Schwarzschild metric through rotational transformations, it includes an additional ergosphere. Given the equivalence of inertia and gravity, this demonstrates how non-inertial transformations, such as rotational transformations, can introduce new spacetime structures into a gravitational system. In particular, the additional physical degrees of freedom carried by rotational transformations are `eaten' by the gravitational system to form an additional ergosphere. Furthermore, the rotational metric effectively models a rigidly-rotating gravitational system and is applicable for describing rotationally-induced gravitational effects in various rotating magnetospheres.</description>

      <title>"Industrial-Scale" Black Hole Selection without a Satellite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The forthcoming GRAVITY+ instrument promises to usher in an era of "industrial-scale" mass measurements of isolated black holes (BHs), with the potential to assemble a sample of many tens of BHs via interferometric microlensing over several years. A key challenge will be selecting interferometric follow-up targets from an order-of-magnitude larger pool of ongoing microlensing events when using traditional selection based on event timescale alone. Gould (2023) proposed a criterion optimized for BH selection using space-based microlens parallax measurements enabled by a satellite. We adapt it to work with microlens parallax constraints obtainable from ground-based data only. Using Galactic simulations, we show that our selection criterion is highly efficient, expecting to detect about a dozen BHs per year with GRAVITY+ from following up ~35 selected events.</description>

      <title>JWST-TST DREAMS: NIRSpec/PRISM Transmission Spectroscopy of the Habitable Zone Planet TRAPPIST-1 e</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: TRAPPIST-1 e is one of the very few rocky exoplanets that is both amenable to atmospheric characterization and that resides in the habitable zone of its star -- located at a distance from its star such that it might, with the right atmosphere, sustain liquid water on its surface. Here, we present a set of 4 JWST/NIRSpec PRISM transmission spectra of TRAPPIST-1 e obtained from mid to late 2023. Our transmission spectra exhibit similar levels of stellar contamination as observed in prior works for other planets in the TRAPPIST-1 system (Lim et al, 2023; Radica et al., 2024), but over a wider wavelength range, showcasing the challenge of characterizing the TRAPPIST-1 planets even at relatively long wavelengths (3-5 um). While we show that current stellar modeling frameworks are unable to explain the stellar contamination features in our spectra, we demonstrate that we can marginalize over those features instead using Gaussian Processes, which enables us to perform novel exoplanet atmospheric inferences with our transmission spectra. In particular, we are able to rule out cloudy, primary H$_2$-dominated ($\gtrsim$ 80$\%$ by volume) atmospheres at better than a 3$\sigma$ level. Constraints on possible secondary atmospheres on TRAPPIST-1 e are presented in a companion paper (Glidden et al., 2025). Our work showcases how JWST is breaking ground into the precisions needed to constrain the atmospheric composition of habitable-zone rocky exoplanets.</description>

      <title>Gamma-ray lines, electron-positron annihilation, and possible radio emission in X-ray pulsars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accretion onto neutron stars (NSs) in X-ray pulsars (XRPs) results in intense X-ray emission, and under specific conditions, high-energy nuclear interactions that produce gamma-ray photons at discrete energies. These interactions are enabled by the high free-fall velocities of accreting nuclei near the NS surface and give rise to characteristic gamma-ray lines, notably at 2.2 MeV, 5.5 MeV, and 67.5 MeV. We investigate the production mechanisms of these lines and estimate the resulting gamma-ray luminosities, accounting for the suppression effects of radiative deceleration in bright XRPs and the creation of electron-positron pairs in strong magnetic fields. The resulting annihilation of these pairs leads to a secondary emission line at $\sim 511$ keV. We also discuss the possibility that non-stationary pair creation in the polar cap region could drive coherent radio emission, though its detectability in accreting systems remains uncertain. Using a numerical framework incorporating general relativistic light bending and magnetic absorption, we compute the escape fraction of photons and distinguish between actual and apparent gamma-ray luminosities. Our results identify the parameter space - defined by magnetic field strength, accretion luminosity, and NS compactness - where these gamma-ray signatures may be observable by upcoming MeV gamma-ray missions. In particular, we highlight the diagnostic potential of detecting gravitationally redshifted gamma-ray lines and annihilation features for probing the mass-radius relation and magnetospheric structure of NSs.</description>

      <title>Slowly Rotating Relativistic Stars: VII. Gravitational Radiation from the Quasi-Radial Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When a relativistic star rotates slowly and rigidly, centrifugal forces flatten it slightly, thereby catalyzing a small admixture of quadrupolar vibration into its radial modes and a damping of the resulting quasi-radial modes. The damping rate $1/\tau$ of each quasi-radial mode divided by its frequency $\sigma^{(0)}$ is given by ${(1/\tau) / \sigma^{(0)} }= \beta (\sigma^{(0)})^3 \Omega^4 R^8/M \;, $where $\Omega$, $R$ and $M$ are the angular velocity, radius and mass of the star, and $\beta$ is a dimensionless number that depends on the mode, on relativistic corrections, and on the structure of the star, and is typically of order unity for the fundamental quasi-radial mode in the nonrelativistic limit. In this paper we develop equations and an algorithm for computing the emitted waves and the resulting damping factor $\beta$. The rotation is treated to second-order in the angular velocity and the pulsation amplitudes are assumed small and linearized, but no other approximations are made.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Alpha Optical Model Potential (\aomp \!) is a phenomenological approach used to describe elastic scattering where multiple reaction channels are open. It is one of the most critical inputs for the calculation of thermonuclear reaction rates in explosive stellar environments, but uncertainties within the $\alpha$-OMP lead to imprecise predictions hindering comparisons between calculations and observations. In order to improve the precision of the $\alpha$-OMP, additional nuclear physics data are required. In this paper, a measurement of the $^{86}$Sr($\alpha$, $\alpha$) elastic scattering cross section at multiple energies is reported. A local optical potential is constructed via a fully Bayesian analysis of the elastic scattering data. The resulting uncertainties on the low energy cross sections relevant to nuclear astrophysics are then calculated and shown to be on the order of $50 \%$.</description>

      <title>Non-Linear Solar EUV-Driven Sodium Release from the Lunar Surface: A Contrast to the Linear PSD Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The correlation between solar Extreme Ultra-Violet (EUV) radiation above 8.8 eV and the release of sodium from the lunar surface via photon-stimulated desorption (PSD) is investigated. We use simultaneous measurements of EUV photon flux and Na optical spectral line flux ($F_{Na}$) from the lunar exosphere. Data were acquired with the high-resolution (R$\sim$72000) Echelle Spectrograph on the 2.34-m Vainu Bappu Telescope during the lunar first quarter (January-March 2024), observing $Na\,I$ D2 and D1 flux at altitudes below $\sim590\,km$ from the surface. Simultaneous EUV and FUV measurements were acquired from the GOES-R Series Extreme Ultraviolet Sensor (EUVS), while NUV data were obtained from the Total and Spectral Solar Irradiance Sensor-1 (TSIS-1) aboard the ISS. We correlated $F_{Na}$ with EUV photon flux from EUVS across six bands spanning $256-1405\,\text{\r{A}}$ (48.5-8.8 eV) and NUV (2000-4000 $\text{\r{A}}$) from TSIS-1. A non-linear rise in lunar exospheric sodium with increasing EUV and FUV fluxes was observed, contrasting with previous linear PSD models. The EUV radiation above 10 eV drives sodium release, with 256-304 $\text{\r{A}}$ wavelengths as dominant contributors. Additionally, the NUV flux and $F_{Na}$ are positively correlated, indicating the role of sodium release. The zenith column density averages $3.3\times10^{9}$ atoms cm$^{-2}$, with Characteristic temperatures averaging at $\sim$6700K and scale heights of $\sim$1500 km. Elevated temperatures and sodium densities during solar activity suggest enhanced Na release during flares. These results emphasize the need for a revised PSD model above 8.8 eV and improved constraints on the PSD cross-section.</description>

      <title>What is the most massive gravitational-wave source?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the presence of significant measurement uncertainties, the events which appear to be the most extreme are very likely to be those exhibiting the greatest statistical fluctuations. It is therefore particularly important to exercise care when interpreting such events and to use the entire observed population for context. Here, I attempt to pedagogically illustrate this using the example of the most massive binary black hole so far detected in gravitational-wave data, GW231123. I argue that its total mass may be significantly lower than $238^{+28}_{-49}$ solar masses as reported by Abac et al. (2025a). The maximum total binary black hole mass from an analysis of the entire detected population may well be less than 140 solar masses, but the value is very sensitive to assumptions about the population distribution.</description>

      <title>Reassessing the Spin of Second-born Black Holes in Coalescing Binary Black Holes and Its Connection to the chi_eff-q Correlation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The mass ratio q and effective inspiral spin chi_eff of binary black hole mergers in GWTC-4.0 have been reported to display a weakeran ti-correlation compared to GWTC-3, a feature whose origin has been explored by several groups. In this work, within the isolated binary evolution framework, we adopt a recently proposed wind prescription for helium stars to systematically investigate the spin of the second-born black hole and its role in shaping this correlation. Using the stellar and binary evolution code MESA, which includes a recently proposed helium-star wind prescription alongside internal differential rotation and tidal interactions,we find that the recently proposed wind prescription for helium stars is substantially weaker than the standard Dutch wind scheme, particularly at subsolar metallicity. Using this scheme, we perform detailed binary modeling of a helium star with a black hole companion. Our results show that the spin magnitude of the resulting black hole is insensitive to the helium star's evolutionary stage at the onset of tidal interactions or to the companion mass. Instead, wind mass loss plays the dominant role: more massive helium-star progenitors produce lower-spinning black holes. The initial stellar rotation has only a minor effect, especially under strong tidal coupling, consistent with the common assumption of orbital synchronization. Using the derived relation between the mass and spin of the second-born black hole, we find that the properties of most binary black holes in GWTC-4.0-specifically the mass ratio q and effective inspiral spin chi_eff-can be reproduced. We further show that the q-chi_eff correlation is sensitive to the assumed mass function (e.g., Gaussian and uniform distribution), displaying notable deviations from the Power-Law+Peak model.</description>

      <title>An updated catalog of HIRES/Keck radial velocity measurements. Including Ca II H&amp;K measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The first HIRES/Keck precision radial velocity (RV) catalog was released in 2017; it was followed by a second release in 2019, which incorporated corrections for small but significant systematic errors. The manifestation of stellar activity accompanied by systematic errors could affect the detection of exoplanets via the RV method. We expanded the HIRES catalog to March 2023 using publicly available spectra. Furthermore, we included the chromospheric emission line Ca II H&amp;K indicator ($R_{\mathrm{HK}}^\prime$), which is among the most prominent tracers of stellar activity. The precision RVs were obtained using an iodine gas absorption cell and corrected for minor systematic errors. $R_{\mathrm{HK}}^\prime$ measurements were derived by rectifying the observed spectra with PHOENIX synthetic spectra models in six narrow bands surrounding the H and K lines, then subtracting the photospheric contribution. We present an updated HIRES/Keck precision RV catalog featuring 78,920 RV measurements for 1,702 stars. High-quality $R_{\mathrm{HK}}^\prime$ measurements are provided for ~ 40% of the HIRES catalog. The updated catalog can help distinguish stellar activity effects from planetary signals in RV time series, thereby corroborating previously detected planetary candidates and aiding in the detection of new ones.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Constraints on a Population of Massive Interstellar Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06300v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate dynamical constraints on the population of large interstellar objects (ISOs) by combining encounter rate analysis, Eddington inversion, and Liouville mapping. Encounter rate scaling demonstrates that detections of kilometer-scale ISOs require flux enhancements beyond natural Maxwellian expectations. Using Eddington inversion, we show how steep density profiles imply phase-space biases consistent with strong gravitational focusing and we then develop a Liouville mapping formalism that propagates the interstellar velocity distribution inward under conservation of energy and angular momentum, revealing that low-angular momentum anisotropies can reproduce the observed size dependent detection rates. These results provide a self consistent dynamical framework for interpreting the observed population of ISOs and for assessing whether the required anisotropies arise from natural or artificial origins. The main results are framed in the context of the parameters for 3I/ATLAS, but the implications are general and go on to sharpen the distinction between natural dynamical mechanisms and potential artificial origins for ISOs.</description>

      <title>Late accretion offers pathway to misaligned disk around the planet-hosting IRAS 04125+2902</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a 3D hydrodynamical simulation of the accretion of a gas cloudlet onto the IRAS 04125+2902 binary system, where the 3-Myr primary hosts a transiting planet. We demonstrate that such an accretion event can naturally produce a circumstellar disk that is misaligned with respect to the rest of the system, consistent with the observed misaligned transition disk. In the model, the prescribed orbital plane of the cloudlet is largely retained by the resulting circumstellar disk after undergoing gravitational interactions with the secondary during the initial accretion. After ~4.4 binary orbits, a disk with $R_d=300~\mathrm{AU}$ has formed around the stellar primary made of ~13% of the cloudlet mass, $M_\mathrm{d,p}=2.1\times 10^{-3}~\mathrm{M}_\odot$. The companion also retains some of the cloudlet's mass and forms a disk with $M_\mathrm{d,c}=9.3\times 10^{-5}~\mathrm{M}_\odot$, though only the transition disk around the primary has been observed. Our findings highlight the importance of considering mass inflow onto protoplanetary disk for their evolution.</description>

      <title>Influence of Boundary Conditions and Heating Modes on the Onset of Columnar Convection in Rotating Spherical Shells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the linear onset of thermal convection in rotating spherical shells with a focus on the influence of mechanical boundary conditions and thermal driving modes. Using a spectral method, we determine critical Rayleigh numbers, azimuthal wavenumbers, and oscillation frequencies over a wide range of Prandtl numbers and shell aspect ratios at moderate Ekman numbers. We show that the preferred boundary condition for convective onset depends systematically on both aspect ratio and Prandtl number: for sufficiently thick shells or for large $\text{Pr}$, the Ekman boundary layer at the outer boundary becomes destabilising, so that no-slip boundaries yield a lower $\text{Ra}_c$ than stress-free boundaries. Comparing differential and internal heating, we find that internal heating generally raises $\text{Ra}_c$, shifts the onset to larger wavenumbers and frequencies, and relocates the critical column away from the tangent cylinder. Mixed boundary conditions with no-slip on the inner boundary behave similarly to purely stress-free boundaries, confirming the dominant influence of the outer surface. These results demonstrate that boundary conditions and heating mechanisms play a central role in controlling the onset of convection and should be carefully considered in models of planetary and stellar interiors.</description>

      <title>Characterization of the Host Binary of the Directly Imaged Exoplanet HD 143811 AB b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: HD~143811~AB is the host star to the directly imaged planet HD~143811~AB~b, which was recently discovered using data from the Gemini Planet Imager and Keck NIRC2. A member of the Sco-Cen star-forming region with an age of $13 \pm 4$ Myr, HD~143811~AB is somewhat rare among hosts of directly imaged planets as it is a close stellar binary, with an $\sim$18 day period. Accurate values for the orbital and stellar parameters of this binary are needed to understand the formation and evolutionary history of the planet in orbit. We utilize archival high-resolution spectroscopy from FEROS on the MPG/ESO 2.2-meter telescope to fit the orbit of the binary, and combine with unresolved photometry to derive the basic stellar properties of the system. From the orbit, we derive precise values of orbital period of $18.59098 \pm 0.00007$ days, and mass ratio of $0.885 \pm 0.003$. When combined with stellar evolutionary models, we find masses of both components of $M_A = 1.30^{+0.03}_{-0.05}$ M$_\odot$ and $M_B = 1.15^{+0.03}_{-0.04}$ M$_\odot$. While the current data are consistent with the planet and stellar orbits being coplanar, the 3D orientations of both systems are currently poorly constrained, with additional observations required to more rigorously test for coplanarity.</description>

      <title>HD 143811 AB b: A Directly Imaged Planet Orbiting a Spectroscopic Binary in Sco-Cen</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present confirmation of HD 143811 AB b, a substellar companion to spectroscopic binary HD 143811 AB through direct imaging with the Gemini Planet Imager (GPI) and Keck NIRC2. HD 143811 AB was observed as a part of the Gemini Planet Imager Exoplanet Survey (GPIES) in 2016 and 2019 and is a member of the Sco-Cen star formation region. The companion object is detected $\sim 430$ mas from the host star by GPI. With two GPI epochs and one from Keck/NIRC2 in 2022, we confirm through common proper motion analysis that the object is bound to its host star. We derive an orbit with a semi-major axis of $64 ^{+32}_{-14}$ au and eccentricity $\sim 0.23$. Spectral analysis of the GPI $H$-band spectrum and NIRC2 \textit{L'} photometry provides additional proof that this object is a substellar companion. We compare the spectrum of HD 143811 AB b to PHOENIX stellar models and Exo-REM exoplanet atmosphere models and find that Exo-REM models provide the best fits to the data. From the Exo-REM models, we derive an effective temperature of $1042^{+178}_{-132}$ K for the planet and translate the derived luminosity of the planet to a mass of $5.6 \pm 1.1~M_\textrm{Jup}$ assuming hot-start evolutionary models. HD 143811 AB b is one of only a few planets to be directly imaged around a binary, and future characterization of this object will shed light on the formation of planets around binary star systems.</description>

      <title>ALMA-IMF XX: Core fragmentation in the W51 high-mass star-forming region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a study of core fragmentation in the W51-E and W51-IRS2 protoclusters in the W51 high-mass star-forming region. The identification of core fragmentation is achieved by the spatial correspondence of cores and compact sources which are detected in the short (low resolution) and the long baseline (high resolution) continuum images with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) in Bands 3 (3 mm) and 6 (1.3 mm), respectively. We characterize the compact sources found in the long baseline image, and conclude that the compact sources are pre/protostellar objects (PPOs) that are either prestellar dust cores or dust disks or envelopes around protostars. The observed trend of core fragmentation in W51 is that (i) massive cores host more PPOs, (ii) bright PPOs are preferentially formed in massive cores, (iii) equipartition of flux between PPOs is uncommon. Thermal Jeans masses of parent cores are insufficient to explain the masses of their fragments, and this trend is more prominent at high-mass cores. We also find that unfragmented cores are large, less massive, and less dense than fragmented cores.</description>

      <title>Detection of a septuple stellar system in formation via disk fragmentation</title>

Abstract: Stellar multiple systems play a pivotal role in cluster dynamics and stellar evolution, leading to intense astronomical phenomena like X-ray binaries, gamma-ray bursts, Type Ia supernova, and stellar mergers, which are prime sources of gravitational waves. However, their origin remains poorly understood. Here we report the discovery of a septuple protostellar system embedded in a Keplerian disk within the high-mass star-forming region NGC\,6334IN, with close separations of 181-461 AU. The stability analysis reveals that the disk surrounding the septuple system is dynamically unstable, indicating that the septuple system formed via disk fragmentation. Previous studies have typically found only 2--3 members forming via disk fragmentation in both low- and high-mass star-forming regions. Our findings provide compelling observational evidence that the fragmentation of a gravitationally unstable disk is a viable mechanism for the formation of extreme high-order multiplicity, confirming what was previously only a theoretical concept. The results shed new light on the formation of extreme high-order multiplicity in cluster environments.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Threads: Interlinking the Stellar Initial Mass Function from Star-Birth to Galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The stellar initial mass function (sIMF) describes the distribution of stellar masses formed in a single star formation event in a molecular cloud clump. It is fundamental to astrophysics and cosmology, shaping our understanding of unresolved stellar populations, galactic chemical enrichment and habitable zones, and black hole growth. This White Paper reviews studies on the core mass function, stellar multiplicity, and dynamical processes affecting sIMF determinations, as well as the link between star-forming clumps and the galaxy-wide IMF (gIMF). The evidence gleaned from observed systems for the dependency of the sIMF on the metallicity and density of the clump is portrayed. We examine evidence from gravitational lensing, stellar and gas kinematics, and spectral diagnostics to assess environmental dependencies of the gIMF. Theoretical perspectives provide further insights into the sIMF's variability. Beyond summarizing current knowledge, this work aims to establish a shared framework and define strategies for studying a variable IMF in the era of near-infrared integral-field spectroscopy, 30m-class telescopes and major space-based observatories.</description>

      <title>Observing the Sun with the Atacama Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (AtLAST): Forecasting Full-disk Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13145v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) has revolutionised the field of solar millimetre astronomy with its high angular resolution and cadence. However, with a limited field of view (FOV), targeted observations of highly dynamic phenomena such of flares are challenging. A large aperture single-dish telescope with a large FOV, such as the future Atacama Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (AtLAST), would prove useful in observing such phenomena, as one could scan the full solar disk on shorter timescales. We aimed to explore what FOVs, detector counts, and scan strategies are suitable for AtLAST to push the required full-disk scan times below 1 minute, enabling regular observations of dynamic solar phenomena. Utilising the maria code, we were able to simulate solar observations with AtLAST, and thoroughly explored how instrumental properties and scanning strategies affect the full-disk observations in the planned frequency bands. We find the double-circle scan pattern, currently employed at ALMA for full-disk mapping to also be an acceptable way of scanning the Sun with AtLAST. Using small to intermediately sized instruments (1000 - 50,000 detector elements), the estimated observational cadence would be less than 1 minute across AtLAST's frequency range with a reasonable pixel spacing. Using instruments with larger FOVs ($\gtrapprox 0.25^\circ$, equivalent to $\gtrapprox$ 1 R$_\odot$), we find a simple circular scan to be more efficient, achieving cadences on second time scales, but requiring more detector elements ($\gtrapprox$ 100,000). We find that a large FOV single-dish telescope such as AtLAST could provide the solar millimetre community with hitherto unachievable observations, namely full-disk observations at high cadence and adequate resolution. With cadences potentially down to seconds, such an instrument would be ideal in the study of quickly evolving solar phenomena.</description>

      <title>White dwarfs in wide binaries: the strong effects of stellar evolution and mass loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08364v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the statistics of main-sequence / main-sequence, main-sequence / white-dwarf and white-dwarf / white-dwarf wide binaries at 10^2.5-10^4 AU separations in Gaia data. For binaries containing a white dwarf, we find a complex dependence of the wide binary fraction on the white dwarf mass, including a steep decline as a function of mass at &gt;0.6Msun. Furthermore, we find that wide binaries containing white dwarfs have significantly lower eccentricities than main-sequence binaries at the same separations. To model these observations, we compute the effects of post-main-sequence mass loss on the orbital parameters of wide binaries in all regimes of timescales, from secular to impulsive, and incorporate this dynamics in a population synthesis model. We find that adiabatic expansion of the orbits in binaries with slow enough evolutionary processes is the most likely explanation for the puzzling eccentricity distribution of white dwarf wide binaries. The steeply declining white dwarf binary fraction as a function of mass requires that the timescale for mass loss must be significantly shorter for high-mass stars (10^3-10^4 years) than for the low-mass ones. We confirm previous studies that suggested that recoil in the range 0.25-4 km/s is required to explain the observed distribution of separations of white dwarf wide binaries. Finally, for low-mass white dwarfs (&lt;0.5Msun), we see interesting signatures of their formation due to close binary evolution in their wide binary statistics. Our observations and modeling provide a novel dynamical constraint on the mass-loss stages of stellar evolution that are difficult to probe with direct observations.</description>

Abstract: A method for investigating the sensitivity of the tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) I band magnitude $M_I$ to stellar input physics is presented.~We compute a grid of $\sim$125,000 theoretical stellar models with varying mass, initial helium abundance, and initial metallicity, and train a machine learning emulator to predict $M_I$ as a function of these parameters.~First, our emulator can be used to theoretically predict $M_I$ in a given galaxy using Monte Carlo sampling.~As an example, we predict $M_I = -3.87^{+0.11}_{-0.08}$ in the Large Magellanic Cloud (F20).~Second, our emulator enables a direct comparison of theoretical predictions for $M_I$ with empirical calibrations to constrain stellar modeling parameters using Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods.~We demonstrate this by using empirical TRGB calibrations to obtain new independent measurements of the metallicity in three galaxies.~We find $\log_{10}(Z)=-2.167^{+0.404}_{-0.492}$ and $\log_{10}(Z)=-2.098^{+0.388}_{-0.528}$ in the Large Magellanic Cloud (F20 and Y19 respectively), $\log_{10}(Z)=-2.146^{+0.400}_{-0.505}$ in NGC 4258, and $\log_{10}(Z)=-2.143^{+0.401}_{-0.508}$ in $\omega$-Centauri.~The LMC and NGC 4258 measurements are consistent with other measurements within $&lt;1\sigma$ errors, and the $\omega$-Centauri measurement are within $&lt;2\sigma$ errors.</description>

      <title>Dark Dwarfs: Dark Matter-Powered Sub-Stellar Objects Awaiting Discovery at the Galactic Center</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00822v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of dark matter annihilation on objects with masses close to the sub-stellar limit, finding that the minimum mass for stable hydrogen burning is larger than the $\sim0.075 M_\odot $ value predicted in the Standard Model. Below this limit, cooling brown dwarfs evolve into stable dark matter-powered objects that we name dark dwarfs. The timescale of this transition depends on the ambient dark matter density $\rho_{\rm DM}$ and circular velocity $v_{\rm DM}$ but is independent of the dark matter mass. We predict a population of dark dwarfs close to the galactic center, where the dark matter density is expected to be $\rho_{\rm DM}\gtrsim 10^{3}$ GeV/cm$^3$. At larger galactic radii the dark matter density is too low for these objects to have yet formed within the age of the universe. Dark dwarfs retain their initial lithium-7 in mass ranges where brown/red dwarfs would destroy it, providing a method for detecting them.</description>

      <title>The Dust Echo Emission of Fast Blue Optical Transients and Application to the Near-Infrared Excess of AT 2018cow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19897v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A near-infrared (NIR) excess has been discovered in the emission of the representative fast blue optical transient (FBOT): AT 2018cow. It was suggested that this NIR excess could be emitted by the dust surrounding the source and, thus, could provide a probe into the nature of its progenitor. We develop a model to describe the influence of the FBOT emission on the environmental dust and, as a result, a dust-free evaporation cavity can be formed on a timescale of one day. Outside this cavity, the surviving dust grains can have different size distributions at different distances to the source. With such a special dust environment, we fit the multi-wavelength light curves of AT 2018cow by taking into account the evolutionary dust echo of the FBOT emission. It is found that the dust temperature can vary with time along with the evolution of the irradiating FBOT emission. Even at a fixed time, the dust temperature can be distributed in a wide range rather than having only a unique value. Furthermore, both the mass of the dust shell and its distance to the FBOT are found to be much larger than those derived with a direct empirical fitting of the NIR spectra but without considering the evolutionary relationship between the spectra.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08104v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this White Paper, we present the potential of the enhanced X-ray Timing and Polarimetry (eXTP) mission to constrain the equation of state of dense matter in neutron stars, exploring regimes not directly accessible to terrestrial experiments. By observing a diverse population of neutron stars - including isolated objects, X-ray bursters, and accreting systems - eXTP's unique combination of timing, spectroscopy, and polarimetry enables high-precision measurements of compactness, spin, surface temperature, polarimetric signals, and timing irregularity. These multifaceted observations, combined with advances in theoretical modeling, pave the way toward a comprehensive description of the properties and phases of dense matter from the crust to the core of neutron stars. Under development by an international Consortium led by the Institute of High Energy Physics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the eXTP mission is planned to be launched in early 2030.</description>

Abstract: Scheduled for launch in 2030, the enhanced X-ray Timing and Polarization (eXTP) telescope is a Chinese space-based mission aimed at studying extreme conditions and phenomena in astrophysics. eXTP will feature three main payloads: Spectroscopy Focusing Arrays (SFAs), Polarimetry Focusing Arrays (PFAs), and a Wide-field Camera (W2C). This white paper outlines observatory science, incorporating key scientific advances and instrumental changes since the publication of the previous white paper [1]. We will discuss perspectives of eXTP on the research domains of flare stars, supernova remnants, pulsar wind nebulae, cataclysmic variables, X-ray binaries, ultraluminous X-ray sources, AGN, and pulsar-based positioning and timekeeping.</description>

      <title>The ATLAS Virtual Research Assistant</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09778v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the Virtual Research Assistant (VRA) of the ATLAS sky survey which performs preliminary eyeballing on our clean transient data stream. The VRA uses Histogram Based Gradient Boosted Decision Tree Classifiers trained on real data to score incoming alerts on two axes: "Real" and "Galactic". The alerts are then ranked using a geometric distance such that the most "Real" and "Extra-galactic" receive high scores; the scores are updated when new light curve data is obtained on subsequent visits. To assess the quality of the training we use the Recall at rank K, which is more informative to our science goal than general metrics such as accuracy or F1-Scores. We also establish benchmarks for our metric based on the pre-VRA eyeballing strategy, to ensure our models provide notable improvements before being added to the ATLAS pipeline. Finally, policies are defined on the ranked list to select the most promising alerts for humans to eyeball and to automatically remove the bogus alerts. In production the VRA method has resulted in a reduction in eyeballing workload by 85% with a loss of follow-up opportunity &lt;0.08%. It also allows us to automatically trigger follow-up observations with the Lesedi telescope, paving the way to automated methods that will be required in the era of LSST. inally, this is a demonstration that feature-based methods remain extremely relevant in our field, being trainable on only a few thousand samples and highly interpretable; they also offer a direct way to inject expertise into models through feature engineering</description>

      <title>The tidal interaction of an orbiting giant planet with a star near the Kraft break: the excitation of $r$-modes and the retention of orbital and spin angular momenta misalignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05894v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we extend the previous work of Papaloizou \&amp; Savonije on tidal interactions between a solar mass star and a closely orbiting giant planet which is such that the orbital and stellar spin angular momentum directions are misaligned. Here we consider the situation when the central star has a mass of $1.3 M_{\odot}$ and is in the vicinity of the Kraft break. We find and determine the properties of the lowest order $r$ modes and the tidal response arising from the secular non axisymmetric forcing associated with a misaligned orbit. We find that the response of the thin convective envelope, as well as the shift of $r$ mode frequencies from the low rotation frequency, limit can be understood by adopting a vertically averaged model that is similar to the well known one governed by the Laplace tidal equation for an incompressible ocean. From our results we are able to estimate lower bounds on realignment time scales for hot Jupiter systems with orbital periods in the range $2.8-5 d$ and rotation periods in the range $5-31 d$ that indicate the process is indeed markedly less effective than for a solar type star. This is on account of there being less dissipation in a relatively smaller convective envelope as well as the generally faster rotation and hence larger spin angular momentum expected for the more massive star.</description>

Abstract: We report two warm Earth-sized exoplanets orbiting the close binary TOI-2267 (M5+M6, separation ~8 au). Data from TESS and ground-based facilities confirm the planets, but we cannot determine which star they orbit. The planets have radii of 1.00+/-0.11 R_Earth (TOI-2267 b, P=2.28 d) and 1.14+/-0.13 R_Earth (TOI-2267 c, P=3.49 d) if around TOI-2267A, or 1.22+/-0.29 R_Earth and 1.36+/-0.33 R_Earth if around TOI-2267B. TESS also shows a candidate signal (TOI-2267.02, P=2.03 d, 0.95+/-0.12 or 1.13+/-0.30 R_Earth). Dynamical analysis shows all three cannot orbit one star; the most stable configuration has planets b and c (near a 3:2 resonance) orbiting one star and the candidate the other. This scenario would make TOI-2267 the most compact binary system known to host planets, with both components harbouring transiting worlds, offering a unique benchmark for studying planet formation and evolution in compact binary.</description>
