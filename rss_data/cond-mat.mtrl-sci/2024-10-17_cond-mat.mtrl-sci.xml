      <title>Stochastic 3D reconstruction of cracked polycrystalline NMC particles using 2D SEM data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Li-ion battery performance is strongly influenced by their cathodes' properties and consequently by the 3D microstructure of the particles the cathodes are comprised of. During calendaring and cycling, cracks develop within cathode particles, which may affect performance in multiple ways. On the one hand, cracks reduce internal connectivity such that electron transport within cathode particles is hindered. On the other hand, intra-particle cracks can increase the cathode reactive surface. Due to these contradictory effects, it is necessary to quantitatively investigate how battery cycling effects cracking and how cracking in-turn influences battery performance. Thus, it is necessary to characterize the 3D particle morphology with structural descriptors and quantitatively correlate them with effective battery properties. Typically, 3D structural characterization is performed using image data. However, informative 3D imaging techniques are time-consuming, costly and rarely available, such that analyses often have to rely on 2D image data. This paper presents a novel stereological approach for generating virtual 3D cathode particles that exhibit crack networks that are statistically equivalent to those observed in 2D sections of experimentally measured particles. Consequently, more easily available 2D image data suffices for deriving a full 3D characterization of cracked cathodes particles. In future research, the virtually generated 3D particles will be used as geometry input for spatially resolved electro-chemo-mechanical simulations, to enhance our understanding of structure-property relationships of cathodes in Li-ion batteries.</description>

      <title>Effect of Ti-doping on the dimer transition in Lithium Ruthenate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We carried out a comprehensive crystal structure characterization of Ti-doped lithium ruthenate (Li$_2$Ti$_x$Ru$_{1-x}$O$_3$), to investigate the effect of Ti-doping on the structural phase transition. Experimental tools sensitive to the average structure (X-ray diffraction), as well as those sensitive to local structure (Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure, EXAFS; pair distribution function, PDF) are used. We observed non-monotonic dependence of the structural transition temperature on the Ti-doping level. At low doping, the transition temperature slightly increases with doping, while at high doping, the temperature decreases significantly with doping. We note two important observations from our studies. First, Ti K-edge EXAFS data shows persistent Ti-Ru dimerization even with substantial Ti doping. Second, we were able to use the PDF data to estimate the dimer correlation length above the transition temperature, which would correspond to the size of the proposed local `dimer clusters' formed by Ru-Ru and Ti-Ru neighbours. The dimer correlation length is found to be around 10~\AA, which remains robust regardless of doping. Our study therefore suggests that Ti$^{4+}$ with its $d^0$ electronic configuration is a special type of dopant when replacing Ru.</description>

      <title>Tuning Electric Polarization via Exchange Striction Interaction in CaMn$_7$O$_{12}$ by Sr-Doping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetoelectric materials displaying strong magnetically induced polarization have attracted considerable interest due to their potential applications in spintronics and various fast electrically controlled magnetic devices. CaMn$_7$O$_{12}$ (CMO) stands out for its giant spin-induced ferroelectric polarization. However, the origin of the induced electric polarization in CMO remains highly controversial and continues to be a subject of ongoing debate. In this paper, through room temperature X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD), temperature-dependent magnetic susceptibility, and thermally stimulated depolarizing current (TSDC) measurements, we provide experimental evidence for a route to tune the magnetically induced polarization by modifying the exchange-striction in CMO via Sr-doping. Our findings demonstrate that the large and broad current peaks observed near the first magnetic phase transition ($T_N1 \sim 90$ K) indicate polarization contributions from both thermally stimulated depolarization current (TSDC) and intrinsic magnetically induced electric polarization. We suggest that this reduction in induced electric polarization in CMO originates from the increase in the Mn$^{3+}$ -- O -- Mn$^{4+}$ bond angle due to Sr$^{2+}$ doping, weakening the exchange-striction interaction. Meanwhile, the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) effect determines the direction of the induced electric polarization. Our result sheds light on understanding the intriguing giant-induced polarization in CMO and similar compounds with complex magnetic structures.</description>

      <title>Evolution of Ferromagnetism and Electrical Resistivity in Sb-Doped Cr4PtGa17</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe the doping effects on a metallic breathing pyrochlore compound, Cr4PtGa17. Upon doping with Sb, i.e., Cr4Pt(Ga1-xSbx)17, it was found that a selective doping on one of the seven Ga sites occurs. With increasing dopant level, the ferromagnetism in the parent compound is gradually suppressed, along with a decrease in fitted Curie-Weiss temperature (from 61 (1) K to -1.8 (1) K) and effective moment (from ~2.26 muB/f.u. to ~0.68 muB/f.u.). Low-temperature heat capacity measurements confirm the absence of magnetic ordering above 0.4 K for the three most doped samples. Meanwhile, electrical resistivity measurements display a metal-semiconductor transition with increasing Sb contents, which is attributed to an increase of Fermi energy based on the calculations of electronic band structure and density of states. Moreover, we have speculated that the ferromagnetism in Cr4PtGa17 is governed by itinerant electrons according to our observations. This study of Sb-doping effect on Cr4PtGa17 provides deeper understanding of magnetism of this system and possibilities for future modifications.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic grain boundary mobility tensor from three-dimensional interface random walk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, studies have demonstrated that the grain boundary (GB) migration is a three-dimensional (3D) process, characterized by a 3D mobility tensor. In this study, we develop a 3D interface random walk theory to extract the GB mobility and shear coupling tensors based on the random walk of the GB position. Using this approach, we mathematically prove the symmetry of the GB mobility tensor in the case of overdamped GB migration. The theory and its conclusions align with molecular dynamics simulation results, and the computed shear coupling aligns closely with predictions from disconnection analysis. Additionally, we refined the fast adapted random walk (FAIRWalk) method, enabling efficient extraction of the GB mobility tensor from fewer simulations while maintaining high accuracy. Building on this advancement, we conducted an extensive survey of the mobility, shear coupling, and activation energy for the migration of 388 coincidence-site lattice Ni GBs in the Olmsted database. Several intriguing phenomena were observed, including temperature-induced sudden emergence, disappearance, or inversion of shear coupling; GBs with "zero" normal mobility but high shear mobility; and a non-linear relationship between activation energy and mobility. These findings challenge the traditional understanding of GB migration and warrant further investigation.</description>

      <title>Large Enhancement of Properties in Strained Lead-free Multiferroic Solid Solutions with Strong Deviation from Vegard's Law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efforts to combine the advantages of multiple systems to enhance functionlities through solid solution design present a great challenge due to the constraint imposed by the classical Vegard law. Here, we successfully navigate this trade off by leveraging the synergistic effect of chemical doping and strain engineering in solid solution system of BiFeO3 BaTiO3. Unlike bulks, a significant deviation from the Vegard law accompanying with enhanced multiferroism is observed in the strained solid solution epitaxial films, where we achieve a pronounced tetragonality, enhanced saturated magnetization, substantial polarization, high ferroelectric Curie temperature, all while maintaining impressively low leakage current. These characteristics surpass the properties of their parent BiFeO3 and BaTiO3 films. Moreover, the superior ferroelectricity has never been reported in corresponding bulks. These findings underscore the potential of strained BiFeO3 BaTiO3 films as lead-free, room-temperature multiferroics.</description>

      <title>Highly anisotropic Drude-weight-reduction and enhanced linear-dichroism in van der Waals Weyl semimetal Td-MoTe2 with coherent interlayer electronic transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weyl semimetal (WSM) states can be achieved by breaking spatial-inversion symmetry or time reversal symmetry. However, the anisotropy of the energy reduction contributing to the emergence of WSM states has seldom been investigated by experiments. A van der Waals metal MoTe2 exhibits a type-II WSM phase below the monoclinic-to-orthorhombic-phase-transition temperature Tc ~ 250 K. Here, we report a combined linearly-polarized optical-spectroscopy and electrical-transport study of MoTe2 at different temperatures. The Drude components in the a-axis, b-axis and c-axis optical conductivity spectra, together with the metallic out-of-plane and in-plane electrical resistivities, indicate the coherent inter-layer and in-plane charge transports. Moreover, the Drude weight in {\sigma}1a({\omega}), rather than the Drude weights in {\sigma}1b({\omega}) and {\sigma}1c({\omega}), decreases dramatically below Tc, which exhibits a highly anisotropic decrease in its Drude weight and thus suggests a strongly anisotropic reduction of the electronic kinetic energy in the WSM phase. Furthermore, below Tc, due to the in-plane anisotropic spectral-weight transfer from Drude component to high-energy region, the in-plane inter-band-absorption anisotropy increases remarkably around 770 meV, and has the largest value (~ 0.68) of normalized linear dichroism among the reported type-II WSMs. Our work sheds light on seeking new WSMs and developing novel photonic devices based on WSMs.</description>

      <title>Structural and Thermoelectric Properties of Al$_{1+x}$Fe$_{2-y}$M$_y$B$_2$ (M=Ag, Ni, Sb, Ga, and Ge) Intermetallic Borides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AlFe$_2$B$_2$, a ternary transition metal boride doped with Ag, Ni, Sb, Ga, and Ge was investigated for the phase constituents, microstructure, and thermoelectric properties. The parent compound with 20\% excess Al (Al$_{1.2}$Fe$_2$B$_2$) prepared by vacuum arc melting contains orthorhombic AlFe$_2$B$_2$ and FeB upon doping form additional phases such as Ag$_5$Al, AlNi$_3$, Al$_3$Ni$_2$, AlSb, and AlB$_2$. The structural parameters of the AlFe$_2$B$_2$ phase in Ag, Ni, and Sb-doped samples are nearly the same as the un-doped one. The lattice parameters and cell volume increase noticeably in Ga and Ge-doped compounds. The Ga-doped sample shows only FeB as a secondary phase; however, the AlB$_2$ phase is observed in Ge-doped AlFe$_2$B$_2$. The microstructure investigated in FEG-SEM with EDS shows the AlFe$_2$B$_2$ matrix is chemically homogenous in all samples, except the Ga-doped one, with uniformly distributed single or multiple secondary phases. The DSC-TG results show that all the dopants decrease the AlFe$_2$B$_2$ phase peritectic decomposition reaction temperature, indicating the structure destabilizes. The thermoelectric properties measured show that AlFe$_2$B$_2$ is an n-type compound with electrical conductivity in the range of 0.35-0.46$\times$10$^6$ S/m. The addition of Ag, Ni, Ga, and Ge marginally alters the Seebeck and electrical conductivity. The noticeable improvement in Seebeck coefficient and with negligible change in electrical conductivity resulted in a highest power factor of 0.4 mW/mK$^2$ for Sb-doped sample. The thermal conductivity of AlFe$_2$B$_2$, which is in the range of 6.4-9.1 W/m-K between 300 to 773\,K, decreases with Sb doping to 5.2-8.5 W/m-K resulting in a maximum zT of 0.04 at 773K.</description>

      <title>Mass transport driving forces under electric current in the liquid Sn-Zn system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Significant effects of electric currents on mass transport in liquid metals have been observed for long, but the origin of the corresponding driving forces remains unclear in the literature. Without current, two driving forces induce mass transport in liquid metals. (i) A chemical force, coming from concentration gradients. In that case, mass transport occurs by diffusion. (ii) A physical force, resulting from density gradients thermally and/or chemically induced. Here, mass transport occurs by thermal and/or solutal convection. Under electric currents, these driving forces are modified, either by electrostatic or magnetic forces, the corresponding mechanisms being referred to as electroconvection and magnetoconvection, respectively. However, these mechanisms cannot easily be distinguished from each other, leading to confusion in literature. Here, it has been shown that, in the liquid Sn-Zn system, the driving force induced by 500-1000 A/cm 2 electric current densities is magnetic rather than electrostatic, the mechanism being therefore magnetoconvection.</description>

      <title>Modeling the diversity of laser-induced spin dynamics in Gd/FeCo multilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent experimental findings revealed an exceptionally diverse laser-induced spin dynamics tunable by magnetic field ($H$) and temperature ($T$) in ferrimagnetic Gd/FeCo multilayers, however the theoretical picture of these processes remains unclear. To bridge this gap, we theoretically explore $H-T$ phase diagram of such a ferrimagnet and perform a modeling of the laser-induced spin dynamics using the Landau-Lifshitz-Bloch equation. Our model can describe both transverse and longitudinal spin dynamics in the ferrimagnetic multilayer, including ultrafast helicity-independent all-optical switching, observed experimentally. We explore the magnetic $H-T$ phase diagram and the full range of magnetization switching at low laser fluences. We also examine the exchange relaxation mechanism critical for ultrafast switching at higher laser fluences. Our theoretical findings closely match experimental results, demonstrating the validity of the proposed models and their ability to predict static and dynamic magnetic properties of ferrimagnetic multilayers as functions of magnetic field and temperature.</description>

      <title>Phase transformation kinetics in polycrystalline Fe_xAl_1-x (x&gt;0.6) alloys: Experiment and Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The presence of defects of different kinds, e.g., vacancies, voids, dislocations, grain boundaries, and surfaces, in realistic materials can strongly modify and even dictate the thermodynamics of phase transformations. Our study demonstrates, both theoretically and experimentally, that in the ordering of Fe_xAl_1-x (x&gt;0.6) alloys subjected to high-temperature treatment, the relaxation of the as-prepared chemically disordered alloy into the ordered B2 state is hampered by another process. A manifestation of this is an increase in the alloy's magnetization. A plausible explanation for a non-monotonous behavior of the magnetization we observe is segregation of Al into structural defects, e.g., grain boundaries, and thus purification of the Fe host lattice. Qualitatively, experimental findings reported here are supported by molecular dynamics simulation of the phase transformation kinetics in Fe_xAl_1-x. These studies can be useful for choosing the preparation strategy for functional alloys.</description>

      <title>Unambiguous identification of the indirect band nature of atomically thin hexagonal boron nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atomically thin hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), especially monolayer, has garnered increasing attention due to its intriguing optical and light-matter-interaction properties. However, its intrinsic optical properties and electronic band structure, have long remained elusive. In this study, near-resonance excited deep-UV photoluminescence/Raman spectroscopy and deep-UV reflectance contrast spectroscopy are utilized to experimentally investigate the optical properties of atomically thin h-BN across various layer numbers. It is revealed that the absence of luminescence in 1-3 layers h-BN is indicative of their indirect band gap nature, rectifying previously adopted identification of a direct band gap in monolayer BN. Notably, band-edge luminescence signals and indirect bandgap absorption start to appear in 4-layer, and the luminescence intensity increases with the number of layers, suggesting that interlayer interactions and periodicity along the z-axis enhance phonon-assisted indirect bandgap transition, even in the 4-layer case, and furthermore indicating the formation process of flat bands at the K and M valleys as the periodicity along the z direction increases. Additionally, the prominent resonance Raman signals in atomically thin h-BN underscore strong electron-phonon coupling in this material.</description>

      <title>Regularities and features in the behavior of electrical and magnetic properties of Co$_2$FeZ (Z = Al, Si, Ga, Ge, Sn, Sb) half-metallic ferromagnetic Heusler alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electrical resistivity, magnetization, and Hall effect in Co$_2$FeZ (Z = Al, Si, Ga, Ge, Sn, Sb) ferromagnetic Heusler alloys are studied. A number of correlations between the electronic and magnetic characteristics of the studied alloys are revealed while the atomic number of the Z-component changes. For the Co$_2$FeAl and Co$_2$FeSi half-metallic ferromagnets, the magnitude of magnetization is consistent with the Slater-Pauling rule. For the Co$_2$FeAl, Co$_2$FeSi, and Co$_2$FeGe compounds, a quadratic temperature dependence of electrical resistivity at temperatures below 30 K and above 65 K is found. At the same time, in the region of intermediate temperatures (from 40 K to 65 K), a power-law dependence of $T^b$ with an exponent of 3.5 &lt; b &lt; 4 is observed, which may be due to two-magnon scattering processes.</description>

      <title>Optical and plasmonic properties of high electron density epitaxial and oxidative controlled titanium nitride thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work reports a pulsed laser-assisted synthesis, detailed structural characterization, and study of plasmonic properties of three sets of TiN/TiNO thin films with high electron density. The first two sets of TiN films were grown at 600C and 700C under a high vacuum condition. The third set of TiN film was grown in the presence of 5 mTorr of molecular oxygen at 700C. The results have shown that TiN films deposited in a high vacuum are metallic, have large optical reflectance, and have high optical and electrical conductivity. The TiN films, grown in 5 mTorr O2, were partially oxidized and semiconducting with room temperature resistivity nearly three times larger than those of the TiN films grown under high vacuum conditions. The optical conductivity of these films was analyzed using a Kramers-Kronig transformation of reflectance and a Lorentz-Drude model; the optical conductivity determined by these two different methods agreed very well. To corroborate our experimental spectral observations, we have calculated the phonon dispersions and Raman active modes of TiNO using the virtual crystal approximation. A comparative analysis of the phonon dispersions between rutile TiO2 and rocksalt TiNO has shown that the incorporation of nitrogen atoms does not significantly alter the phonon dispersions of rutile TiO2. However, it results in the emergence of new phonon modes at approximately 7.128 THz at the Gamma point, which corresponds to the experimentally observed Multi-Photon Phase-MPP. From the collateral study of experimental results and theoretical corroboration, a suitable multi-layer optical model was proposed for the TiN/TINO epitaxial thin films to extract the individual complex dielectric function from which many other optical parameters can be calculated.</description>

      <title>Structure of the water/magnetite interface from sum frequency generation experiments and neural network based molecular dynamics simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetite, a naturally abundant mineral, frequently interacts with water in both natural settings and various technical applications, making the study of its surface chemistry highly relevant. In this work, we investigate the hydrogen bonding dynamics and the presence of hydroxyl species at the magnetite-water interface using a combination of neural network potential-based molecular dynamics simulations and sum frequency generation vibrational spectroscopy. Our simulations, which involved large water systems, allowed us to identify distinct interfacial species, such as dissociated hydrogen and hydroxide ions formed by water dissociation. Notably, water molecules near the interface exhibited a preference for dipole orientation towards the surface, with bulk-like water behavior only re-emerging beyond 60 {\AA} from the surface. The vibrational spectroscopy results aligned well with the simulations, confirming the presence of a hydrogen bond network in the surface ad-layers. The analysis revealed that surface-adsorbed hydroxyl groups orient their hydrogen atoms towards the water bulk. In contrast, hydrogen-bonded water molecules align with their hydrogen atoms pointing towards the magnetite surface.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to discover new materials with desirable properties is critical for numerous applications from helping mitigate climate change to advances in next generation computing hardware. AI has the potential to accelerate materials discovery and design by more effectively exploring the chemical space compared to other computational methods or by trial-and-error. While substantial progress has been made on AI for materials data, benchmarks, and models, a barrier that has emerged is the lack of publicly available training data and open pre-trained models. To address this, we present a Meta FAIR release of the Open Materials 2024 (OMat24) large-scale open dataset and an accompanying set of pre-trained models. OMat24 contains over 110 million density functional theory (DFT) calculations focused on structural and compositional diversity. Our EquiformerV2 models achieve state-of-the-art performance on the Matbench Discovery leaderboard and are capable of predicting ground-state stability and formation energies to an F1 score above 0.9 and an accuracy of 20 meV/atom, respectively. We explore the impact of model size, auxiliary denoising objectives, and fine-tuning on performance across a range of datasets including OMat24, MPtraj, and Alexandria. The open release of the OMat24 dataset and models enables the research community to build upon our efforts and drive further advancements in AI-assisted materials science.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Moir\'e superstructures arising at twisted 2D interfaces have recently attracted the attention of the scientific community due to exotic quantum states and unique mechanical and tribological behaviors that they exhibit. Here, we predict the emergence of chiral distortions in twisted layered interfaces of finite dimensions. This phenomenon originates in intricate interplay between interfacial interactions and contact boundary constraints. A metric termed the fractional chiral area, is introduced to quantify the overall chirality of the moir\'e superstructure and to characterize its spatial distribution. Despite the equilibrium nature of the discovered energetic and structural chirality effects they are shown to be manifested in the twisting dynamics of layered interfaces, which demonstrates a continuous transition from stick-slip to smooth rotation with no external trigger.</description>

      <title>Exchange-enhanced spin-orbit splitting and its density dependence for electrons in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12125v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that spin-orbit splitting (SOS) in monolayers of semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) is substantially enhanced by electron-electron interaction. This effect, similar to the exchange-enhancement of the electron g-factor, is most pronounced for conduction band electrons (in particular, in MoS$_2$), and it has a non-monotonic dependence on the carrier sheet density, $n$. That is, the SOS enhancement is peaked at the onset of filling of the higher-energy spin-split band by electrons, $n_*$, which also separates the regimes of slow (at $n&lt;n_*$) and fast (for $n&gt;n_*$) spin and valley relaxation of charge carriers. Moreover, this density itself is determined by the enhanced SOS value, making the account of exchange renormalisation important for the analysis of spintronic performance of field-effect transistors based on two-dimensional TMDs.</description>

      <title>Photoemission Insights to Electronic Orders in Kagome Superconductor AV3Sb5</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kagome superconductors AV3Sb5 (A = K, Rb, and Cs) have attracted considerable attention due to their intriguing combination of unique electron correlations and nontrivial band topology. The interplay of these fundamental aspects gives rise to a diverse array of exotic electronic phenomena, including superconductivity and charge density wave (CDW) states. In this review, we present recent advancements in the study of the electronic band structure of AV3Sb5 using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), including the identification of the multiple van Hove singularities near the Fermi level and their close relationship with the CDW transition, spectroscopic features related to CDW-induced symmetry breakings, as well as direct observations of nodeless superconducting gaps and moderate electron-phonon couplings through ultrahigh-resolution ARPES, providing critical insights into the origins of CDW order and electron pairing symmetry. By synthesizing these key ARPES findings, this review aims to deepen our understanding of kagome-related physics.</description>

      <title>PRefLexOR: Preference-based Recursive Language Modeling for Exploratory Optimization of Reasoning and Agentic Thinking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: PRefLexOR (Preference-based Recursive Language Modeling for Exploratory Optimization of Reasoning) combines preference optimization with concepts from Reinforcement Learning to enable models to self-teach through iterative reasoning improvements. We propose a recursive learning approach that engages the model in multi-step reasoning, revisiting, and refining intermediate steps before producing a final output in training and inference phases. Through multiple training stages, the model first learns to align its reasoning with accurate decision paths by optimizing the log odds between preferred and non-preferred responses. During this process, PRefLexOR builds a dynamic knowledge graph by generating questions from random text chunks and retrieval-augmentation to contextualize relevant details from the entire training corpus. In the second stage, preference optimization enhances model performance by using rejection sampling to fine-tune reasoning quality by continually producing in-situ training data while masking the reasoning steps. Recursive optimization within a thinking token framework introduces iterative feedback loops, where the model refines reasoning, achieving deeper coherence, consistency, and adaptability. Implemented in small language models with only 3 billion parameters, we should that even tiny models can iteratively teach themselves to reason with greater depth and reflectivity. Our implementation is straightforward and can be incorporated into any existing pretrained LLM. We focus our examples on applications in biological materials science and demonstrate the method in a variety of case studies that range from in-domain to cross-domain applications. Using reasoning strategies that include thinking and reflection modalities we build a multi-agent recursive self-improving inference approach to successively improve responses via repeated sampling in inference time.</description>

      <title>Thermal analysis of GaN-based photonic membranes for optoelectronics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semiconductor membranes find their widespread use in various research fields targeting medical, biological, environmental, and optical applications. Often such membranes derive their functionality from an inherent nanopatterning, which renders the determination of their, e.g., optical, electronic, mechanical, and thermal properties a challenging task. In this work we demonstrate the non-invasive, all-optical thermal characterization of around 800-nm-thick and 150-$\mu$m-wide membranes that consist of wurtzite GaN and a stack of In$_{0.15}$Ga$_{0.85}$N quantum wells as a built-in light source. Due to their application in photonics such membranes are bright light emitters, which challenges their non-invasive thermal characterization by only optical means. As a solution, we combine two-laser Raman thermometry with (time-resolved) photoluminescence measurements to extract the in-plane (i.e., $c$-plane) thermal conductivity $\kappa_{\text{in-plane}}$ of our membranes. Based on this approach, we can disentangle the entire laser-induced power balance during our thermal analysis, meaning that all fractions of reflected, scattered, transmitted, and reemitted light are considered. As a result of our thermal imaging via Raman spectroscopy, we obtain $\kappa_{\text{in-plane}}\,=\,165^{+16}_{-14}\,$Wm$^{-1}$K$^{-1}$ for our best membrane, which compares well to our simulations yielding $\kappa_{\text{in-plane}}\,=\,177\,$Wm$^{-1}$K$^{-1}$ based on an ab initio solution of the linearized phonon Boltzmann transport equation. Our work presents a promising pathway towards thermal imaging at cryogenic temperatures, e.g., when aiming to elucidate experimentally different phonon transport regimes via the recording of non-Fourier temperature distributions.</description>

      <title>Quantum Phase Transition as a Promising Route to Enhance the Critical Current in Kagome Superconductor CsV$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Developing strategies to systematically increase the critical current, the threshold current below which the superconductivity exists, is an important goal of materials science. Here, the concept of quantum phase transition is employed to enhance the critical current of a kagome superconductor CsV$_3$Sb$_5$, which exhibits a charge density wave (CDW) and superconductivity that are both affected by hydrostatic pressure. As the CDW phase is rapidly suppressed under pressure, a large enhancement in the self-field critical current ($I_{\rm c,sf}$) is recorded. The observation of a peak-like enhancement of $I_{\rm c,sf}$ at the zero-temperature limit ($I_{\rm c,sf}(0)$) centred at $p^*\approx 20$~kbar, the same pressure where the CDW phase transition vanishes, further provides strong evidence of a zero-temperature quantum anomaly in this class of pressure-tuned superconductor. Such a peak in $I_{\rm c,sf}(0)$ resembles the findings in other well-established quantum-critical superconductors, hinting at the presence of enhanced quantum fluctuations associated with the CDW phase in CsV$_3$Sb$_5$.</description>

Abstract: The Allen-Heine-Cardona theory allows us to calculate phonon-induced electron self-energies from first principles without resorting to the adiabatic approximation. However, this theory has not been able to account for the change of the electron wave function, which is crucial if interband energy differences are comparable to the phonon-induced electron self-energy as in temperature-driven topological transitions. Furthermore, for materials without inversion symmetry, even the existence of such topological transitions cannot be investigated using the Allen-Heine-Cardona theory. Here, we generalize this theory to the renormalization of both the electron energies and wave functions. Our theory can describe both the diagonal and off-diagonal components of the Debye-Waller self-energy in a simple, unified framework. For demonstration, we calculate the electron-phonon coupling contribution to the temperature-dependent band structure and hidden spin polarization of BiTlSe2 across a topological transition. These quantities can be directly measured. Our theory opens a door for studying temperature-induced topological phase transitions in materials both with and without inversion symmetry.</description>

Abstract: Constitutive models play a crucial role in materials science as they describe the behavior of the materials in mathematical forms. Over the last few decades, the rapid development of manufacturing technologies have led to the discovery of many advanced materials with complex and novel behaviors, which in the meantime, have also posed great challenges for constructing accurate and reliable constitutive models of these materials. In this work, we propose a data-driven approach to construct physics-consistent constitutive models for hyperelastic materials from experimentally measurable data, with the help of PDE-constrained optimization methods. Specifically, our constitutive models are based on the physically augmented neural networks~(PANNs), which has been shown to ensure that the models are both physically consistent but also mathematically well-posed by construction. Specimens with deliberately introduced inhomogeneity are used to generate the data, i.e., the full-field displacement data and the total external load, for training the model. Using such approach, a considerably diverse pairs of stress-strain states can be explored with a limited number of simple experiments, such as uniaxial tension. A loss function is defined to measure the difference between the data and the model prediction, which is obtained by numerically solving the governing PDEs under the same geometry and loading conditions. With the help of adjoint method, we can iteratively optimize the parameters of our NN-based constitutive models through gradient descent. We test our method for a wide range of hyperelastic materials and in all cases, our methods are able to capture the constitutive model efficiently and accurately. The trained models are also tested against unseen geometry and unseen loading conditions, exhibiting strong interpolation and extrapolation capabilities.</description>

Abstract: Efforts aimed at scaling fabrication processes to the level of single atoms, dubbed atom-by-atom fabrication or atomic fabrication, invariably encounter the obstacle of atomic scale cleanliness. When considering atomic fabrication, cleanliness of the base material and purity of the source reservoir from which atomic structures will be built are invariable constraints imposed by laws of physics and chemistry. As obvious as such statements may be, and regardless of the inevitable consequences for successful atomic fabrication, there is a poignant lack of understanding of the "dirt" (contamination/impurities). Here, we examine hydrocarbon contamination on graphene. Graphene has formed the base substrate for many e-beam-based atomic fabrication studies and many strategies for cleaning graphene have been presented in the literature. One popular method is heating to high temperatures (&gt;500 {\deg}C). It is usually inferred that volatile hydrocarbons evaporate into the microscope vacuum system leaving behind pristine graphene. Here, we show through direct image intensity analysis that what appears to be clean graphene can be coated with a thin layer of dynamically diffusing hydrocarbons. This result holds significant implications for approaches to e-beam based atomic fabrication, updates the conceptual model of e-beam induced hydrocarbon deposition, and may extend to hot surfaces generally.</description>

Abstract: Generating high magnetic fields requires materials with not only high electric conductivity, but also good strength properties in order to withstand the necessarily strong Lorentz forces. A number of bi-metal composites, most notably Cu/Nb, are considered to be good candidates for this purpose. Here, we generalize our previous work on Cu/Nb in order to predict, from theory, the dependence of electric conductivity on the microstructure and volume fraction of the less conductive component for a number of other bi-metal composites. Together with information on strength properties (taken from previous literature), the conductivity information we provide in this work can help to identify new promising candidate materials (such as Cu/Nb, Cu/Ag, Cu/W, ...) for magnet applications with the highest achievable field strengths.</description>

      <title>TCAD Parameters for 4H-SiC: A Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06798v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we review the models and their parameters to describe the relative permittivity, bandgap, impact ionization, mobility, charge carrier recombination/effective masses and incomplete dopand ionization of 4H silicon carbide in computer simulations. We aim to lower the entrance barrier for newcomers and provide a critical evaluation of the status quo to identify shortcomings and guide future research. The review reveals a rich set of often diverging values in literature based on a variety of calculation and measurement methods. Although research for all the selected parameters is still active, we show that sometimes old values or those determined for other kinds of silicon carbide are commonly used.</description>

      <title>Tensor-involved peridynamics: A unified framework for isotropic and anisotropic materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10175v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce tensor involved peridynamics, a unified framework for simulating both isotropic and anisotropic materials. While traditional peridynamics models effectively simulate isotropic materials, they face challenges with anisotropic materials and are prone to instability caused by zero energy modes. Our novel model extend the linear bond based peridynamics framework by incorporating the elastic tensor into the micrmodulus function, thereby ensuring stability for anisotropic materials without the need for additional corrections. For isotropic materials. the model mantains compatibility with conventional bond based peridynamics, assuming Possion's rations of 1/4 in 3D and 1/3 in 2D.Numerical experiments confirm the model's stability and accuracy across various scenarios. Additionally, we introduce a damage model for isotropic materials. validating its performance in predicting crack propagation paths in a 2D plate. The results show superior alignment with experimental date compared to traditional model.</description>

      <title>Theory of the Spin Seebeck effect induced by crystal-field excitations in Tb$_3$Fe$_5$O$_{12}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10362v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The spin Seebeck effect (SSE) is a phenomenon of thermoelectric generation that occurs within a device consisting of a bilayer of a metal and a ferromagnet. When Tb$_3$Fe$_5$O$_{12}$ (TbIG) is substituted for the ferromagnet, the effect goes to zero at low temperatures, yet it increases to positive values with the application of a magnetic field. This is opposite to the expectation that the SSE should be suppressed by a magnetic field due to the increase in the magnon gap. In this paper, the crystal-field excitations (CFE) in TbIG are calculated within a mean field theory exploiting the parameters of Terbium Gallium Garnet Tb$_3$Ga$_5$O$_{12}$ (TGG) from the neutron-scattering experimental literature. Like TGG, the primitive cell of TbIG hosts twelve Tb sites with six inequivalent magnetic sublattices, but due to the net $[111]$-molecular field from the tetrahedral and octahedral Fe ions, these can be classified into two distinct groups, the $\mathbf{C}$ and the $\mathbf{C'}$ sites, which account for the `double umbrella' magnetic structure. We show that when an external magnetic field is applied along the [111] direction of the crystal, the lowest CFE of the $\mathbf{C}$ sublattices decreases. As a consequence of the magnetic field dependence of the lowest CFE, we find that at low temperatures the SSE in TbIG can result enhanced by an applied magnetic field.</description>

      <title>A Versatile Side Entry Laser System for Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09461v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the design and implementation of a side entry laser system designed for an ultra-high vacuum scanning transmission electron microscope. This system uses a versatile probe design enclosed in a vacuum envelope such that parts can be easily aligned, modified, or exchanged without disturbing the vacuum. The system uses a mirror mounted on the sample holder such that the sample can be illuminated without being tilted. Notably the mirror can be removed and replaced with an ablation target and a higher power laser used to ablate material directly onto the sample. We argue that new capabilities hold the potential to transform the electron microscope from an analysis tool towards a more flexible synthesis system, where atomic scale fabrication and atom-by-atom experiments can be performed.</description>

      <title>Extreme time extrapolation capabilities and thermodynamic consistency of physics-inspired Neural Networks for the 3D microstructure evolution of materials via Cahn-Hilliard flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20126v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN) is trained to reproduce the evolution of the spinodal decomposition process in three dimensions as described by the Cahn-Hilliard equation. A specialized, physics-inspired architecture is proven to provide close accordance between the predicted evolutions and the ground truth ones obtained via conventional integration schemes. The method can accurately reproduce the evolution of microstructures not represented in the training set at a fraction of the computational costs. Extremely long-time extrapolation capabilities are achieved, up to reaching the theoretically expected equilibrium state of the system, consisting of a layered, phase-separated morphology, despite the training set containing only relatively-short, initial phases of the evolution. Quantitative accordance with the decay rate of the Free energy is also demonstrated up to the late coarsening stages, proving that this class of Machine Learning approaches can become a new and powerful tool for the long timescale and high throughput simulation of materials, while retaining thermodynamic consistency and high-accuracy.</description>
