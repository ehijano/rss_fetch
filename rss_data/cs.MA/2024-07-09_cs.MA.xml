      <title>Fair Money -- Public Good Value Pricing With Karma Economies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: City road infrastructure is a public good, and over-consumption by self-interested, rational individuals leads to traffic jams. Congestion pricing is effective in reducing demand to sustainable levels, but also controversial, as it introduces equity issues and systematically discriminates lower-income groups. Karma is a non-monetary, fair, and efficient resource allocation mechanism, that employs an artificial currency different from money, that incentivizes cooperation amongst selfish individuals, and achieves a balance between giving and taking. Where money does not do its job, Karma achieves socially more desirable resource allocations by being aligned with consumers' needs rather than their financial power. This work highlights the value proposition of Karma, gives guidance on important Karma mechanism design elements, and equips the reader with a useful software framework to model Karma economies and predict consumers' behaviour. A case study demonstrates the potential of this feasible alternative to money, without the burden of additional fees.</description>

      <title>Homogeneous Distributed Observers for Quasilinear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The problem of finite/fixed-time cooperative state estimation is considered for a class of quasilinear systems with nonlinearities satisfying a H\"older condition. A strongly connected nonlinear distributed observer is designed under the assumption of global observability. By proper parameter tuning with linear matrix inequalities, the observer error equation possesses finite/fixed-time stability in the perturbation-free case and input-to-state stability with respect to bounded perturbations. Numerical simulations are performed to validate this design.</description>

      <title>Open Ad Hoc Teamwork with Cooperative Game Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15259v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ad hoc teamwork poses a challenging problem, requiring the design of an agent to collaborate with teammates without prior coordination or joint training. Open ad hoc teamwork (OAHT) further complicates this challenge by considering environments with a changing number of teammates, referred to as open teams. One promising solution in practice to this problem is leveraging the generalizability of graph neural networks to handle an unrestricted number of agents with various agent-types, named graph-based policy learning (GPL). However, its joint Q-value representation over a coordination graph lacks convincing explanations. In this paper, we establish a new theory to understand the representation of the joint Q-value for OAHT and its learning paradigm, through the lens of cooperative game theory. Building on our theory, we propose a novel algorithm named CIAO, based on GPL's framework, with additional provable implementation tricks that can facilitate learning. The demos of experimental results are available on https://sites.google.com/view/ciao2024, and the code of experiments is published on https://github.com/hsvgbkhgbv/CIAO.</description>

      <title>An active learning method for solving competitive multi-agent decision-making and control problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.12561v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To identify a stationary action profile for a population of competitive agents, each executing private strategies, we introduce a novel active-learning scheme where a centralized external observer (or entity) can probe the agents' reactions and recursively update simple local parametric estimates of the action-reaction mappings. Under very general working assumptions (not even assuming that a stationary profile exists), sufficient conditions are established to assess the asymptotic properties of the proposed active learning methodology so that, if the parameters characterizing the action-reaction mappings converge, a stationary action profile is achieved. Such conditions hence act also as certificates for the existence of such a profile. Extensive numerical simulations involving typical competitive multi-agent control and decision-making problems illustrate the practical effectiveness of the proposed learning-based approach.</description>

      <title>An extension of May's Theorem to three alternatives: axiomatizing Minimax voting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14256v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: May's Theorem [K. O. May, Econometrica 20 (1952) 680-684] characterizes majority voting on two alternatives as the unique preferential voting method satisfying several simple axioms. Here we show that by adding some desirable axioms to May's axioms, we can uniquely determine how to vote on three alternatives (setting aside tiebreaking). In particular, we add two axioms stating that the voting method should mitigate spoiler effects and avoid the so-called strong no show paradox. We prove a theorem stating that any preferential voting method satisfying our enlarged set of axioms, which includes some weak homogeneity and preservation axioms, must choose from among the Minimax winners in all three-alternative elections. When applied to more than three alternatives, our axioms also distinguish Minimax from other known voting methods that coincide with or refine Minimax for three alternatives.</description>

      <title>Incentive-Compatible Vertiport Reservation in Advanced Air Mobility: An Auction-Based Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18166v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rise of advanced air mobility (AAM) is expected to become a multibillion-dollar industry in the near future. Market-based mechanisms are touted to be an integral part of AAM operations, which comprise heterogeneous operators with private valuations. In this work, we study the problem of designing a mechanism to coordinate the movement of electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft, operated by multiple operators each having heterogeneous valuations associated with their fleet, between vertiports, while enforcing the arrival, departure, and parking constraints at vertiports. Particularly, we propose an incentive-compatible and individually rational vertiport reservation mechanism that maximizes a social welfare metric, which encapsulates the objective of maximizing the overall valuations of all operators while minimizing the congestion at vertiports. Additionally, we improve the computational tractability of designing the reservation mechanism by proposing a mixed binary linear programming approach that is based on constructing network flow graph corresponding to the underlying problem.</description>

      <title>Synthetic Participatory Planning of Shard Automated Electric Mobility Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12317v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unleashing the synergies among rapidly evolving mobility technologies in a multi-stakeholder setting presents unique challenges and opportunities for addressing urban transportation problems. This paper introduces a novel synthetic participatory method that critically leverages large language models (LLMs) to create digital avatars representing diverse stakeholders to plan shared automated electric mobility systems (SAEMS). These calibratable agents collaboratively identify objectives, envision and evaluate SAEMS alternatives, and strategize implementation under risks and constraints. The results of a Montreal case study indicate that a structured and parameterized workflow provides outputs with higher controllability and comprehensiveness on an SAEMS plan than that generated using a single LLM-enabled expert agent. Consequently, this approach provides a promising avenue for cost-efficiently improving the inclusivity and interpretability of multi-objective transportation planning, suggesting a paradigm shift in how we envision and strategize for sustainable transportation systems.</description>

      <title>Advancing Healthcare Automation: Multi-Agent System for Medical Necessity Justification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17977v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Prior Authorization delivers safe, appropriate, and cost-effective care that is medically justified with evidence-based guidelines. However, the process often requires labor-intensive manual comparisons between patient medical records and clinical guidelines, that is both repetitive and time-consuming. Recent developments in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown potential in addressing complex medical NLP tasks with minimal supervision. This paper explores the application of Multi-Agent System (MAS) that utilize specialized LLM agents to automate Prior Authorization task by breaking them down into simpler and manageable sub-tasks. Our study systematically investigates the effects of various prompting strategies on these agents and benchmarks the performance of different LLMs. We demonstrate that GPT-4 achieves an accuracy of 86.2% in predicting checklist item-level judgments with evidence, and 95.6% in determining overall checklist judgment. Additionally, we explore how these agents can contribute to explainability of steps taken in the process, thereby enhancing trust and transparency in the system.</description>
