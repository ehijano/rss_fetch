      <title>A nonlocal-to-local approach to aggregation-diffusion equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past decades, nonlocal models have been widely used to describe aggregation phenomena in biology, physics, engineering, and the social sciences. These are often derived as mean-field limits of attraction-repulsion agent-based models, and consist of systems of nonlocal partial differential equations. Using differential adhesion between cells as a biological case study, we introduce a novel local model of aggregation-diffusion phenomena. This system of local aggregation-diffusion equations is fourth-order, resembling thin-film or Cahn-Hilliard type equations. In this framework, cell sorting phenomena are explained through relative surface tensions between distinct cell types. The local model emerges as a limiting case of short-range interactions, providing a significant simplification of earlier nonlocal models, while preserving the same phenomenology. This simplification makes the model easier to implement numerically and more amenable to calibration to quantitative data. Additionally, we discuss recent analytical results based on the gradient-flow structure of the model, along with open problems and future research directions.</description>

      <title>CellVerse: Do Large Language Models Really Understand Cell Biology?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated the feasibility of modeling single-cell data as natural languages and the potential of leveraging powerful large language models (LLMs) for understanding cell biology. However, a comprehensive evaluation of LLMs' performance on language-driven single-cell analysis tasks still remains unexplored. Motivated by this challenge, we introduce CellVerse, a unified language-centric question-answering benchmark that integrates four types of single-cell multi-omics data and encompasses three hierarchical levels of single-cell analysis tasks: cell type annotation (cell-level), drug response prediction (drug-level), and perturbation analysis (gene-level). Going beyond this, we systematically evaluate the performance across 14 open-source and closed-source LLMs ranging from 160M to 671B on CellVerse. Remarkably, the experimental results reveal: (1) Existing specialist models (C2S-Pythia) fail to make reasonable decisions across all sub-tasks within CellVerse, while generalist models such as Qwen, Llama, GPT, and DeepSeek family models exhibit preliminary understanding capabilities within the realm of cell biology. (2) The performance of current LLMs falls short of expectations and has substantial room for improvement. Notably, in the widely studied drug response prediction task, none of the evaluated LLMs demonstrate significant performance improvement over random guessing. CellVerse offers the first large-scale empirical demonstration that significant challenges still remain in applying LLMs to cell biology. By introducing CellVerse, we lay the foundation for advancing cell biology through natural languages and hope this paradigm could facilitate next-generation single-cell analysis.</description>
