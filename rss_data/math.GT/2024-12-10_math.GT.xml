      <title>L-space satellite operators and knot Floer homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider satellite operators where the corresponding 2-component link is an L-space link. This family includes many commonly studied satellite operators, including cabling operators, the Whitehead operator, and a family of Mazur operators. We give a formula which computes the knot Floer complex of a satellite of $K$ in terms of the knot Floer complex of $K$. Our main tools are the Heegaard Floer Dehn surgery formulas and their refinements. A key step in our computation is a proof that 2-component L-space links have formal knot Floer complexes. We use this to show that the link Floer complexes of 2-component L-space links are determined by their multivariable Alexander polynomials. We implement our satellite formula in Python code, which we also make available.</description>

      <title>Perturbed Traceless SU(2) Character Varieties of Tangle Sums</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If a link $L$ can be decomposed into the union of two tangles $T\cup_{S^2} S$ along a 2-sphere intersecting $L$ in 4 points, then the intersections of perturbed traceless SU(2) character varieties of tangles in a space called the pillowcase form a set of generators for Kronheimer and Mrowka's reduced singular instanton homology, $I^\natural$. It is conjectured by Cazassus, Herald, Kirk, and Kotelskiy that with the addition of bounding cochains, the differential of $I^\natural$ can be recovered from these Lagrangians as well. This article gives a method to compute the perturbed character variety for a large class of tangles using cut-and-paste methods. In particular, given two tangles, $T$ and $S$, Conway defines the tangle sum $T+S$. Given the character varieties of $T$ and $S$, we show how to construct the perturbed character variety of $T+S$. This is done by first studying the perturbed character variety of a certain tangle $C_3$ properly embedded in $S^3$ with 3 balls removed. Using these results, we prove a nontriviality result for the bounding cochains in the conjecture of Cazassus, Herald, Kirk, and Kotelskiy.</description>

      <title>The Enumeration of Alternating Pretzel Links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we tabulate the set of alternating pretzel links. Specifically, for any given crossing number $c$, we derive a closed formula that would allow us to compute $\mathcal{P}(c)$, the total number of alternating pretzel links with crossing number $c$. Numerical computation suggests that $\mathcal{P}(c)\approx 0.0775e^{0.588c}$. That is, the number of alternating pretzel links with a given crossing number $c$ grows exponentially in terms of $c$.</description>

      <title>Quaternionic spinors and horospheres in 4-dimensional hyperbolic geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give explicit bijective correspondences between three families of objects: certain pairs of quaternions, which we regard as spinors; certain flags in (1+4)-dimensional Minkowski space; and horospheres in 4-dimensional hyperbolic space decorated with certain pairs of spinorial directions. These correspondences generalise previous work of the first author, Penrose--Rindler, and Penner in lower dimensions, and use the description of 4-dimensional hyperbolic isometries via Clifford matrices studied by Ahlfors and others.
  We show that lambda lengths generalise to 4 dimensions, where they take quaternionic values, and are given by a certain bilinear form on quaternionic spinors. They satisfy a non-commutative Ptolemy equation, arising from quasi-Pl\"ucker relations in the Gel'fand--Retakh theory of noncommutative determinants. We also study various structures of geometric and topological interest that arise in the process.</description>

      <title>The boundary of a totally geodesic subvariety of moduli space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider subvarieties $N$ of $\mathcal{M}_{g,n}$, the moduli space of genus $g$ Riemann surfaces with $n$ marked points, that are totally geodesic with respect to the Teichm\"uller metric. The Deligne-Mumford boundary of $\mathcal{M}_{g,n}$ decomposes into strata, each of which is essentially a product of lower complexity moduli spaces -- in such spaces there is a natural notion of totally geodesic. We show that the boundary locus of $N$ in any such stratum is itself totally geodesic. Furthermore, we prove that each such boundary locus decomposes into prime pieces, and for each such piece the projection to each factor is locally isometric in an appropriate sense.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce maximal discs of Weil-Petersson class in $\mathbb{A}\mathrm{d}\mathbb{S}^{2,1}$ whose deformation space can be understood as the cotangent bundle of Weil-Petersson universal Teichm\"uller space $T_0(1)$. We show that the Mess map is a symplectic diffeomorphism from $T^*T_0(1)$ to $T_0(1)\times T_0(1)$ for a canonical symplectic form on $T^*T_0(1)$ and the difference of two Weil-Petersson symplectic forms on $T_0(1)\times T_0(1)$. Moreover, we show that the anti-holomorphic energy functional of the induced Gauss map is a K\"ahler potential of the canonical symplectic form over certain subspaces of $T^*T_0(1)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.08779v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generalizing Heegaard splittings of 3-manifolds and trisections of 4-manifolds, we consider multisections of higher-dimensional smooth (or PL) closed orientable manifolds, namely decompositions into 1-handlebodies whose subcollections intersect along 1-handlebodies, with global intersection a closed surface. With such a multisection one can associate a diagram. We prove that a multisection diagram determines a unique PL-manifold in all dimensions and a unique smooth manifold up to dimension 6. Further, we show that any closed orientable smooth 5-manifold admits a multisection.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.10638v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Barnette and Edelson have shown that there are finitely many minimal triangulations of a connected compact 2-manifold M. Similar finiteness results are obtained for cellular partial triangulations that satisfy various girth inequality constraints for embedded cycles. A characterisation of various M-embedded sparse graphs is given in terms of the satisfaction of higher genus girth inequalities. With this it is shown that there are finitely many contraction-minimal M-embedded graphs that are (3,6)-tight or (3,3)-tight.</description>

      <title>Marked Length Spectrum Rigidity for Surface Amalgams</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.09968v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we show that simple, thick negatively curved two-dimensional P-manifolds, a large class of surface amalgams, are marked length spectrum rigid. That is, if two piecewise negatively curved Riemannian metrics (satisfying certain smoothness conditions) on a simple, thick two-dimensional P-manifold assign the same lengths to all closed geodesics, then they differ by an isometry up to isotopy. Our main theorem is a natural generalization of Croke and Otal's celebrated results about marked length spectrum rigidity of negatively curved surfaces.</description>

Abstract: We formulate a connection between a topological and a geometric category. The former is the idempotent completion of the (horizontal) trace of the affine Hecke category, while the latter is the equivariant derived category of the (semi-nilpotent) commuting stack. This provides a more precise and improved version of our proposal in [13].</description>

Abstract: For classical knots, there is a concept of (semi)meander diagrams; in this short note we generalize this concept to virtual knots and prove that the classes of meander and semimeander diagrams are universal (this was known for classical knots). We also introduce a new class of invariants for virtual knots -- virtual $k$-arc crossing numbers and we use Manturov projection to show that for all classical knots the virtual $k$-arc crossing number equals to the classical $k$-arc crossing number.</description>

      <title>Profinite almost rigidity in 3-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16002v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that any compact, orientable 3-manifold with empty or toral boundary is profinitely almost rigid among all compact, orientable 3-manifolds, i.e. the profinite completion of its fundamental group determines its homeomorphism type to finitely many possibilities. Moreover, the profinite completion of the fundamental group of a mixed 3-manifold, together with the peripheral structure, uniquely determines the homeomorphism type of its Seifert part (i.e. the maximal graph manifold components in the JSJ-decomposition). On the other hand, without assigning the peripheral structure, the profinite completion of a mixed 3-manifold group may not even determine the fundamental group of its Seifert part. The proof is based on JSJ-decomposition.</description>

      <title>Representations of a quantum-deformed Lorentz algebra, Clebsch-Gordan map, and Fenchel-Nielsen representation of complex Chern-Simons theory at level-${N}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08176v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A family of infinite-dimensional irreducible $*$-representations on $\mathcal{H}\simeq L^2(\mathbb{R})\otimes\mathbb{C}^N$ is defined for a quantum-deformed Lorentz algebra $\mathscr{U}_{\bf q}(sl_2)\otimes \mathscr{U}_{\widetilde{\bf {q}}}(sl_2)$, where $\mathbf{q}=\exp[\frac{\pi i}{N}(1+b^2)]$ and $\tilde{\mathbf{q}}=\exp[\frac{\pi i}{N}(1+b^{-2})]$ with $N\in\mathbb{Z}_+$ and $|b|=1$. The representations are constructed with the irreducible representation of quantum torus algebra at level-$N$, which is developed from the quantization of $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{C})$ Chern-Simons theory. We study the Clebsch-Gordan decomposition of the tensor product representation, and we show that it reduces to the same problem as diagonalizing the complex Fenchel-Nielson length operators in quantizing $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{C})$ Chern-Simons theory on 4-holed sphere. Finally, we explicitly compute the spectral decomposition of the complex Fenchel-Nielson length operators and the corresponding direct-integral representation of the Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$, which we call the Fenchel-Nielson representation.</description>

Abstract: Let $\mathbb{K}=\mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{C}$. For all but finitely many $m\in \mathbb{N}$, we exhibit the first examples of non-locally rigid, Zariski dense, robust quasi-isometric embeddings of hyperbolic groups in $\mathsf{SL}_m(\mathbb{K})$ which are not limits of Anosov representations. As a consequence, we show that higher rank analogues of Sullivan's structural stabilty theorem and of the density theorem for Kleinian groups fail for Anosov representations in $\mathsf{SL}_m(\mathbb{C}), m\geq 30$.</description>

      <title>Random dynamical systems of polynomial automorphisms on $\Bbb{C}^{2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03577v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper deals with random dynamical systems of polynomial automorphisms (complex generalized H\'{e}non maps and their conjugate maps) of $\Bbb{C}^{2}.$ We show that a generic random dynamical system of polynomial automorphisms has ``mean stablity'' on $\Bbb{C}^{2}$. Further, we show that if a system has mean stability, then (1) for each $z\in \Bbb{C}^{2}$ and for almost every sequence $\gamma =(\gamma _{n})_{n=1}^{\infty }$ of maps, the maximal Lyapunov exponents of $\gamma $ at $z$ is negative, (2) there are only finitely many minimal sets of the system, (3) each minimal set is attracting, (4) for each $z\in \Bbb{C}^{2}$ and for almost every sequence $\gamma $ of maps, the orbit $\{ \gamma _{n}\cdots \gamma _{1}(z) \} _{n=1}^{\infty }$ tends to one of the minimal sets of the system, and (5) the transition operator of the system has the spectrum gap property on the space of Hoelder continuous functions with some exponent. Note that none of (1)--(5) can hold for any deterministic iteration dynamical system of a single complex generalized H\'{e}non map. We observe many new phenomena in random dynamical systems of polynomial automorphisms of $\Bbb{C}^{2}$ and observe the mechanisms. We provide new strategies and methods to study higher-dimensional random holomorphic dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Arrangements of small circles for Morse-Bott functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03846v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As a topic of mathematics, "arrangements", systems of hyperplanes, circles, and general (regular) submanifolds, attract us strongly. We present a natural elementary study of arrangements of circles. It is also a kind of new studies. Our study is closely related to geometry and singularity theory of Morse(-Bott) functions. Regions surrounded by circles are regarded as images of real algebraic maps and composing them with projections gives Morse-Bott functions: this observation is natural, and surprisingly, recently presented first, by the author. We present a systematic way of constructing such arrangements by choosing small circles centered at existing circles inductively. We are interested in graphs the regions surrounded by the circles naturally collapse. We have studied local changes of the graphs in adding these circles. These graphs are essentially so-called {\it Reeb graphs} of the previous Morse-Bott functions: they are spaces of all components of preimages of single points for the functions.</description>
