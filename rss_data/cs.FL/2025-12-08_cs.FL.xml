      <title>On the Impact of the Communication Model on Realisability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiparty Session Types (MPST) provide a type-theoretic foundation for specifying and verifying communication protocols in distributed systems. MPST rely on the notion of global type which specifies the global behaviour and local types, which are the projections of the global behaviour onto each local participant. A central notion in MPST is realisability - whether local implementations derived from a global specification correctly realise the intended protocol under a given communication model. While realisability has been extensively studied under peer-to-peer semantics, it remains poorly understood in alternative communication models such as bag-based, causally ordered, or synchronous communications. In this paper, we develop a unified framework for reasoning about realisability and subtyping across a spectrum of communication models. We show that the communication model does not impact the notion of subtyping, but that it impacts the notion of realisability. We introduce several decision procedures for subtyping checking and realisability checking with complexities ranging from NLOGSPACE to EXPSPACE depending on the assumptions made on the global types, in particular depending on their complementability and the size of a given complement.</description>

      <title>BEAVER: An Efficient Deterministic LLM Verifier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) transition from research prototypes to production systems, practitioners often need reliable methods to verify that model outputs satisfy required constraints. While sampling-based estimates provide an intuition of model behavior, they offer no sound guarantees. We present BEAVER, the first practical framework for computing deterministic, sound probability bounds on LLM constraint satisfaction. Given any prefix-closed semantic constraint, BEAVER systematically explores the generation space using novel token trie and frontier data structures, maintaining provably sound bounds at every iteration. We formalize the verification problem, prove soundness of our approach, and evaluate BEAVER on correctness verification, privacy verification and secure code generation tasks across multiple state of the art LLMs. BEAVER achieves 6 to 8 times tighter probability bounds and identifies 3 to 4 times more high risk instances compared to baseline methods under identical computational budgets, enabling precise characterization and risk assessment that loose bounds or empirical evaluation cannot provide.</description>

      <title>Computing Sound and Accurate Upper and Lower Bounds on Hamilton-Jacobi Reachability Value Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15238v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis is a fundamental tool for safety verification and control synthesis for nonlinear-control systems. Classical HJ reachability analysis methods discretize the continuous state space and solve the HJ partial differential equation over a grid, but these approaches do not account for discretization errors and can under-approximate backward reachable sets, which represent unsafe sets of states. We present a framework for computing sound upper and lower bounds on the HJ value functions via value iteration over grids. Additionally, we develop a refinement algorithm that splits cells that were not possible to classify as safe or unsafe given the computed bounds. This algorithm enables computing accurate over-approximations of backward reachable sets even when starting from coarse grids. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of our method in two case studies.</description>
