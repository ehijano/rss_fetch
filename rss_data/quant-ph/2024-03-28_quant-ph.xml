      <title>Entanglement of temporal sections as quantum histories and their quantum correlation bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we focus on the underlying quantum structure of temporal correlations and show their peculiar nature which differentiate them from spatial quantum correlations. With a growing interest in representation of quantum states as topological objects, we consider quantum history bundles based on the temporal manifold and show the source of violation of monogamous temporal Bell-like inequalities. We introduce definitions for the mixture of quantum histories and consider their entanglement as sections over the Hilbert vector bundles. As a generalization of temporal Bell-like inequalities, we derive the quantum bound for multi-time Bell-like inequalities.</description>

      <title>Modified Multiple Sequence Alignment Algorithm on Quantum Annealers (MAQ)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a modified MSA algorithm on quantum annealers with applications in areas of bioinformatics and genetic sequencing. To understand the human genome, researchers compare extensive sets of these genetic sequences -- or their protein counterparts -- to identify patterns. This comparison begins with the alignment of the set of (multiple) sequences. However, this alignment problem is considered nondeterministically-polynomial time complete and, thus, current classical algorithms at best rely on brute force or heuristic methods to find solutions. Quantum annealing algorithms are able to bypass this need for sheer brute force due to their use of quantum mechanical properties. However, due to the novelty of these algorithms, many are rudimentary in nature and limited by hardware restrictions. We apply progressive alignment techniques to modify annealing algorithms, achieving a linear reduction in spin usage whilst introducing more complex heuristics to the algorithm. This opens the door for further exploration into quantum computing-based bioinformatics, potentially allowing for a deeper understanding of disease detection and monitoring.</description>

      <title>Achieving Quantum Limits of Exoplanet Detection and Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discovering exoplanets in orbit around distant stars via direct imaging is fundamentally impeded by the high dynamic range between the star and the planet. Coronagraphs strive to increase the signal-to-noise ratio of exoplanet signatures by optically rejecting light from the host star while leaving light from the exoplanet mostly unaltered. However it is unclear whether coronagraphs constitute an optimal strategy for attaining fundamental limits relevant exoplanet discovery. In this work, we report the quantum information limits of exoplanet detection and localization specified by the Quantum Chernoff Exponent (QCE) and the Quantum Fisher Information Matrix (QFIM) respectively. In view of these quantum limits, we assess and compare several high-performance coronagraph designs that theoretically achieve total rejection of an on-axis point source. We find that systems which exclusively eliminate the fundamental mode of the telescope without attenuating higher-order orthogonal modes are quantum-optimal in the regime of high star-planet contrasts. Importantly, the QFIM is shown to persist well below the diffraction-limit of the telescope, suggesting that quantum-optimal coronagraphs may further expand the domain of accessible exoplanets.</description>

      <title>Fast quantum integer multiplication with zero ancillas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The multiplication of superpositions of numbers is a core operation in many quantum algorithms. The standard method for multiplication (both classical and quantum) has a runtime quadratic in the size of the inputs. Quantum circuits with asymptotically fewer gates have been developed, but generally exhibit large overheads, especially in the number of ancilla qubits. In this work, we introduce a new paradigm for sub-quadratic-time quantum multiplication with zero ancilla qubits -- the only qubits involved are the input and output registers themselves. Our algorithm achieves an asymptotic gate count of $\mathcal{O}(n^{1+\epsilon})$ for any $\epsilon &gt; 0$; with practical choices of parameters, we expect scalings as low as $\mathcal{O}(n^{1.3})$. Used as a subroutine in Shor's algorithm, our technique immediately yields a factoring circuit with $\mathcal{O}(n^{2+\epsilon})$ gates and only $2n + \mathcal{O}(\log n)$ qubits; to our knowledge, this is by far the best qubit count of any factoring circuit with a sub-cubic number of gates. Used in Regev's recent factoring algorithm, the gate count is $\mathcal{O}(n^{1.5+\epsilon})$. Finally, we demonstrate that our algorithm has the potential to outperform previous proposals at problem sizes relevant in practice, including yielding the smallest circuits we know of for classically-verifiable quantum advantage.</description>

      <title>Typical thermalization of low-entanglement states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Proving thermalization from the unitary evolution of a closed quantum system is one of the oldest questions that is still nowadays only partially resolved. Several efforts have led to various formulations of what is called the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. The latter, however, assume initial states which are highly concentrated around a specific energy window and, as such, cannot account for a large class of states that are of paramount importance and that are operationally accessible in natural physical settings, including many experimental schemes for testing thermalization and for quantum simulation: low-entanglement states. In this work, we prove thermalization of these states under precise conditions that have operational significance. More specifically, we define a random energy smoothing - motivated by arguments of unavoidable finite resolution - on local Hamiltonians that lead to local thermalization when the initial state has low entanglement. Finally we show that such transformation affects neither the Gibbs state locally nor, under a mild condition, the short time dynamics.</description>

      <title>Equilibration of objective observables in a dynamical model of quantum measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The challenge of understanding quantum measurement persists as a fundamental issue in modern physics. Particularly, the abrupt and energy-non-conserving collapse of the wave function appears to contradict classical thermodynamic laws. The contradiction can be resolved by considering measurement itself to be an entropy-increasing process, driven by the second law of thermodynamics. This proposal, dubbed the Measurement-Equilibration Hypothesis, builds on the Quantum Darwinism framework derived to explain the emergence of the classical world. Measurement outcomes thus emerge objectively from unitary dynamics via closed-system equilibration. Working within this framework, we construct the set of \textit{`objectifying observables'} that best encode the measurement statistics of a system in an objective manner, and establish a measurement error bound to quantify the probability an observer will obtain an incorrect measurement outcome. Using this error bound, we show that the objectifying observables readily equilibrate on average under the set of Hamiltonians which preserve the outcome statistics on the measured system. Using a random matrix model for this set, we numerically determine the measurement error bound, finding that the error only approaches zero with increasing environment size when the environment is coarse-grained into so-called observer systems. This indicates the necessity of coarse-graining an environment for the emergence of objective measurement outcomes.</description>

      <title>EinExprs: Contraction Paths of Tensor Networks as Symbolic Expressions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tensor Networks are graph representations of summation expressions in which vertices represent tensors and edges represent tensor indices or vector spaces. In this work, we present EinExprs.jl, a Julia package for contraction path optimization that offers state-of-art optimizers. We propose a representation of the contraction path of a Tensor Network based on symbolic expressions. Using this package the user may choose among a collection of different methods such as Greedy algorithms, or an approach based on the hypergraph partitioning problem. We benchmark this library with examples obtained from the simulation of Random Quantum Circuits (RQC), a well known example where Tensor Networks provide state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Double well ground state energy splitting (or instanton flipping rate); rendering the implicit explicit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A prime example of quantum tunnelling is the semiclassical 'energy splitting' of the levels of a symmetrical double well potential, or equivalently the flipping rate of an instanton. Curiously the accepted expression for the ground state energy splitting in terms of the (smooth) potential function has not been pursued to the full explicitness available from classical mechanics. This implicitness is rectified here.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe a novel algorithm that recovers the Hamiltonian and temperature of a quantum state in thermal equilibrium using a restricted set of measurements. The algorithm works by imposing a semidefinite constraint based on free energy minimization, which we interpret in terms of thermodynamic stability. We benchmark the algorithm on the problem of learning a nearest-neighbour Hamiltonian on a 100-qubit spin chain.</description>

      <title>Antiscarring in Chaotic Quantum Wells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chaos plays a crucial role in numerous natural phenomena, but its quantum nature has remained large elusive. One intriguing quantum-chaotic phenomenon is the scarring of a single-particle wavefunction, where the quantum probability density is enhanced in the vicinity of a classical periodic orbit. These quantum scars illustrate the quantum suppression of classical chaos, offering a unique way to explore the classical-quantum relationship beyond conventional limits. In this study, we establish an ergodicity theorem for slacking a group of adjacent eigenstates, revealing the aspect of antiscarring -- the reduction of probability density along a periodic orbit generating the corresponding scars. We thereafter apply these two concepts to variational scars in a disordered quantum well, and finally discuss their broader implications, suggesting potential experimental approaches to observe this phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Band engineering and study of disorder using topology in compact high kinetic inductance cavity arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconducting microwave metamaterials offer enormous potential for quantum optics and information science, enabling the development of advanced quantum technologies for sensing and amplification. In the context of circuit quantum electrodynamics, such metamaterials can be implemented as coupled cavity arrays (CCAs). In the continuous effort to miniaturize quantum devices for increasing scalability, minimizing the footprint of CCAs while preserving low disorder becomes paramount. In this work, we present a compact CCA architecture leveraging superconducting NbN thin films presenting high kinetic inductance, which enables high-impedance CCA ($\sim1.5$ k$\Omega$), while reducing the resonator footprint. We demonstrate its versatility and scalability by engineering one-dimensional CCAs with up to 100 resonators and exhibiting multiple bandgaps. Additionally, we quantitatively investigate disorder in the CCAs using symmetry-protected topological SSH modes, from which we extract a resonator frequency scattering of $0.22^{+0.04}_{-0.03}\%$. Our platform opens up exciting new prospects for analog quantum simulations of many-body physics with ultrastrongly coupled emitters.</description>

      <title>A unified view of direct measurement of quantum states, processes, and measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamics of a quantum system are characterized by three components: quantum state, quantum process, and quantum measurement. The proper measurement of these components is a crucial issue in quantum information processing. Recently, direct measurement methods have been proposed and demonstrated wherein each complex matrix element of these three components is obtained separately, without the need for quantum tomography of the entire matrix. Since these direct measurement methods have been proposed independently, no theoretical framework has been presented to unify them despite the time symmetry of quantum dynamics. In this study, we propose a theoretical framework to systematically derive direct measurement methods for these three components. Following this framework and further utilizing the basis-shift unitary transformation, we have derived the most efficient direct measurement method using qubit probes. Additionally, we have experimentally demonstrated the feasibility of the direct measurement method of quantum states using optical pulse trains.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a quantum particle under the dynamical confinement caused by PT-symmetric box with a moving wall. The latter is described in terms of the time-dependent Schr\"{o}dinger equation obeying the time-dependent PT-symmetric boundary conditions. The class of the functions, describing time-dependence of the wall's position and keeping the system as PT-symmetric is found. Physically observable characteristics, such as average kinetic energy and the average quantum force are calculated as a function of time. Also, geometric phase is calculated for the harmonically oscillating wall regime. Experimental realization of the proposed model is discussed.</description>

      <title>Scaling Enhancement of Photon Blockade in Output Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photon blockade enhancement is an exciting and promising subject that has been well studied for photons in cavities. However, whether photon blockade can be enhanced in the output fields remains largely unexplored. We show that photon blockade can be greatly enhanced in the mixing output field of a nonlinear cavity and an auxiliary (linear) cavity, where no direct coupling between the nonlinear and auxiliary cavities is needed. We uncover a biquadratic scaling relation between the second-order correlation of the photons in the output field and intracavity nonlinear interaction strength, in contrast to a quadratic scaling relation for the photons in a nonlinear cavity. We identify that this scaling enhancement of photon blockade in the output field is induced by the destructive interference between two of the paths for two photons passing through the two cavities. We then extend the theory to the experimentally feasible Jaynes-Cummings model consisting of a two-level system strongly coupled to one of the two uncoupled cavities, and also predict a biquadratic scaling law in the mixing output field. Our proposed scheme is universal and can be extended to enhance blockade in other bosonic systems.</description>

      <title>Shaping entangled photons through thick scattering media using an advanced wave beacon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entangled photons provide transformative new paths in the fields of communication, sensing, and computing. However, when entangled photons propagate through a complex medium such as a biological tissue or a turbulent atmosphere, their correlations are scrambled. Using wavefront shaping to compensate for the scattering and retrieve the two-photon correlations is challenging due to the low signal-to-noise ratio of the two-photon signal. While previous works partly addressed this challenge by using feedback from a strong classical laser beam that co-propagates with the entangled photons, such methods frequently depend on assumptions about the complex medium, limiting the applicability of quantum wavefront shaping. In this work, we propose and demonstrate a new feedback mechanism that is inspired by Klyshko's advanced wave picture, in which the classical laser beam counter-propagates with one of the entangled photons and co-propagates with the other. The new Klyshko feedback allows compensation of scattering in thick samples and even in situations where each photon propagates through a different scattering medium. Since the advanced wave picture applies whenever optical reciprocity is valid, such Klyshko optimization can be utilized across a wide range of configurations, offering a robust and alignment-free setup. We therefore believe this protocol will open the door for real-world applications of quantum wavefront shaping.</description>

      <title>Effective Embedding of Integer Linear Inequalities for Variational Quantum Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In variational quantum algorithms, constraints are usually added to the problem objective via penalty terms. For linear inequality constraints, this procedure requires additional slack qubits. Those extra qubits tend to blow up the search space and complicate the parameter landscapes to be navigated by the classical optimizers. In this work, we explore approaches to model linear inequalities for quantum algorithms without these drawbacks. More concretely, our main suggestion is to omit the slack qubits completely and evaluate the inequality classically during parameter tuning. We test our methods on QAOA as well as on Trotterized adiabatic evolution, and present empirical results. As a benchmark problem, we consider different instances of the multi-knapsack problem. Our results show that removing the slack bits from the circuit Hamiltonian and considering them only for the expectation value yields better solution quality than the standard approach. The tests have been carried out using problem sizes up to 26 qubits. Our methods can in principle be applied to any problem with linear inequality constraints, and are suitable for variational as well as digitized versions of adiabatic quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Chiral Virasoro algebra from a single wavefunction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chiral edges of 2+1D systems can have very robust emergent conformal symmetry. When the edge is purely chiral, the Hilbert space of low-energy edge excitations can form a representation of a single Virasoro algebra. We propose a method to systematically extract the generators of the Virasoro algebra from a single ground state wavefunction, using entanglement bootstrap and an input from the edge conformal field theory. We corroborate our construction by numerically verifying the commutation relations of the generators. We also study the unitary flows generated by these operators, whose properties (such as energy and state overlap) are shown numerically to agree with our analytical predictions.</description>

      <title>Thermalization condition for non-Hermitian quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The application of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis to non-Hermitian quantum systems has become one of the most important topics in dissipative quantum chaos, recently giving rise to intense debates. The process of thermalization is intricate, involving many time-evolution trajectories in the reduced Hilbert space of the system. By considering two different expansion forms of the density matrices adopted in the biorthogonal and right-state time evolutions, we have derived two versions of the Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad master equations describing the non-Hermitian systems coupled to a bosonic heat bath in thermal equilibrium. By solving the equations, we have identified a sufficient condition for thermalization under both time evolutions, resulting in Boltzmann biorthogonal and right-eigenstate statistics, respectively. This finding implies that the recently proposed biorthogonal random matrix theory needs an appropriate revision. Moreover, we have exemplified the precise dynamics of thermalization and thermodynamic properties with test models.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Quantum Heat Engine Based on Non-Markovian Dynamics of an Optomechanical Hamiltonian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a recipe for demonstrating an autonomous quantum heat engine where the working fluid consists of a harmonic oscillator, the frequency of which is tuned by a driving mode. The working fluid is coupled two heat reservoirs each exhibiting a peaked power spectrum, a hot reservoir peaked at a higher frequency than the cold reservoir. Provided that the driving mode is initialized in a coherent state with a high enough amplitude and the parameters of the utilized optomechanical Hamiltonian and the reservoirs are appropriate, the driving mode induces an approximate Otto cycle for the working fluid and consequently its oscillation amplitude begins to increase in time. We build both an analytical and a non-Markovian quasiclassical model for this quantum heat engine and show that reasonably powerful coherent fields can be generated as the output of the quantum heat engine. This general theoretical proposal heralds the in-depth studies of quantum heat engines in the non-Markovian regime. Further, it paves the way for specific physical realizations, such as those in optomechanical systems, and for the subsequent experimental realization of an autonomous quantum heat engine.</description>

      <title>Classifying symmetric and symmetry-broken spin chain phases with anomalous group actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the classification problem of quantum spin chains invariant under local decomposable group actions, covering matrix product unitaries (MPUs), using an operator algebraic approach. We focus on finite group symmetries hosting both symmetric and symmetry broken phases. The local-decomposable group actions we consider have a 3-cocycle class of the symmetry group associated to them. We derive invariants for our classification that naturally cover one-dimensional symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases. We prove that these invariants coincide with the ones of [J. Garre Rubio et al, Quantum 7, 927 (2023)] using matrix product states (MPSs) techniques, by explicitly working out the GNS representation of MPSs and MPUs, resulting in a useful dictionary between both approaches that could be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Qubit teleportation between a memory-compatible photonic time-bin qubit and a solid-state quantum network node</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on a quantum interface linking a diamond NV center quantum network node and 795nm photonic time-bin qubits compatible with Thulium and Rubidium quantum memories. The interface makes use of two-stage low-noise quantum frequency conversion and waveform shaping to match temporal and spectral photon profiles. Two-photon quantum interference shows high indistinguishability of (89.5 $\pm$ 1.9)% between converted 795nm photons and the native NV center photons. We use the interface to demonstrate quantum teleportation including real-time feedforward from an unbiased set of 795nm photonic qubit input states to the NV center spin qubit, achieving a teleportation fidelity of (75.5 $\pm$ 1.0)%. This proof-of-concept experiment shows the feasibility of interconnecting different quantum network hardware.</description>

      <title>Resonances crossing effect and quantum sensor of electric fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While the phenomenon of the exact crossing of energy levels is a rarely occurring event, in the case of quantum resonances associated with metastable states this phenomenon is much more frequent and various scenarios can occur. When there is an exact crossing of the imaginary parts of the resonances in a two-level quantum system subject to an external DC electric field, then a damped beating phenomenon occurs, which is absent if there is no such crossing. This fact, tested numerically on an explicit one-dimensional model, suggests the possibility of designing quantum sensors to determine in a very simple way whether the external field strength has an assigned value or not.</description>

      <title>Quantum backflow current in a ring: Optimal bounds and fractality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The probability density of a quantum particle moving freely within a circular ring can exhibit local flow patterns inconsistent with its angular momentum, a phenomenon known as quantum backflow. In this study, we examine a quantum particle confined to a ring and prepared in a state composed of a fixed (yet arbitrary) number of lowest energy eigenstates with non-negative angular momentum. We investigate the time-dependent behavior of the probability current at a specified point along the ring's circumference. We establish precise lower and upper bounds for this probability current, thereby delineating the exact scope of the quantum backflow effect. We also present an analytical expression for a quantum state that yields a record-high backflow probability transfer, reaching over 95% of the theoretical bound. Furthermore, our investigation yields compelling numerical and analytical evidence supporting the conjecture that the current-versus-time function associated with states maximizing backflow probability transfer forms a fractal curve with a dimension of 7/4. The observed fractality may provide a characteristic, experimentally-relevant signature of quantum backflow near the probability-transfer bound.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Quantum Generative Learning: A Study on Scalability and Noise Resilience using QUARK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing promises a disruptive impact on machine learning algorithms, taking advantage of the exponentially large Hilbert space available. However, it is not clear how to scale quantum machine learning (QML) to industrial-level applications. This paper investigates the scalability and noise resilience of quantum generative learning applications. We consider the training performance in the presence of statistical noise due to finite-shot noise statistics and quantum noise due to decoherence to analyze the scalability of QML methods. We employ rigorous benchmarking techniques to track progress and identify challenges in scaling QML algorithms, and show how characterization of QML systems can be accelerated, simplified, and made reproducible when the QUARK framework is used. We show that QGANs are not as affected by the curse of dimensionality as QCBMs and to which extent QCBMs are resilient to noise.</description>

      <title>Mollow-like triplets in ultra-fast resonant absorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that resonant absorption of smooth laser fields can yield Mollow-like triplet patterns. General conditions for such triplets are derived and illustrated with a super-Gaussian pulse sequence. Gaussian pulses can not exhibit triplets, super-Gaussian pulses can form triplets depending on the pulse area and flat-top pulses can produce absorption triplets after one Rabi cycle. Our results are compared side-by-side with resonance fluorescence to emphasize similarities and differences between these unlike observables. In the high-intensity limit, we show that the central absorption peak is asymmetric, which we attribute to non-linear photoionization, beyond two-level atomic physics.</description>

      <title>Light-cone feature selection for quantum machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Feature selection plays an essential role in improving the predictive performance and interpretability of trained models in classical machine learning. On the other hand, the usability of conventional feature selection could be limited for quantum machine learning tasks; the technique might not provide a clear interpretation on embedding quantum circuits for classical data tasks and, more importantly, is not applicable to quantum data tasks. In this work, we propose a feature selection method with a specific focus on quantum machine learning. Our scheme treats the light-cones (i.e., subspace) of quantum models as features and then select relevant ones through training of the corresponding local quantum kernels. We numerically demonstrate its versatility for four different applications using toy tasks: (1) feature selection of classical inputs, (2) circuit architecture search for data embedding, (3) compression of quantum machine learning models and (4) subspace selection for quantum data. The proposed framework paves the way towards applications of quantum machine learning to practical tasks. Also, this technique could be used to practically test if the quantum machine learning tasks really need quantumness, while it is beyond the scope of this work.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a thermodynamic task to certify the general quantum resources of both states and channels via work extraction, showing that general quantum resources provide advantages in work extraction. Such work extraction tasks can be further applied to certify quantum entanglement in a one-sided device-independent way. As an application, we report a novel type of anomalous energy flow -- a type of locally extractable energy that is attributed to the globally distributed entanglement. Finally, we show that the existence of this novel anomalous energy flow is equivalent to measurement incompatibility.</description>

      <title>Efficient Generation of Multi-partite Entanglement between Non-local Superconducting Qubits using Classical Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement is one of the primary features which distinguishes quantum computers from classical computers. In gate-based quantum computing, the creation of entangled states or the distribution of entanglement across a quantum processor often requires circuit depths which grow with the number of entangled qubits. However, in teleportation-based quantum computing, one can deterministically generate entangled states with a circuit depth that is constant in the number of qubits, provided that one has access to an entangled resource state, the ability to perform mid-circuit measurements, and can rapidly transmit classical information. In this work, aided by fast classical FPGA-based control hardware with a feedback latency of only 150 ns, we explore the utility of teleportation-based protocols for generating non-local, multi-partite entanglement between superconducting qubits. First, we demonstrate well-known protocols for generating Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states and non-local CNOT gates in constant depth. Next, we utilize both protocols for implementing an unbounded fan-out (i.e., controlled-NOT-NOT) gate in constant depth between three non-local qubits. Finally, we demonstrate deterministic state teleportation and entanglement swapping between qubits on opposite side of our quantum processor.</description>

      <title>Squeezing below the ground state of motion of a continuously monitored levitating nanoparticle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Squeezing is a crucial resource for quantum information processing and quantum sensing. In levitated nanomechanics, squeezed states of motion can be generated via temporal control of the trapping frequency of a massive particle. However, the amount of achievable squeezing typically suffers from detrimental environmental effects. We analyze the performance of a scheme that, by embedding careful time-control of trapping potentials and fully accounting for the most relevant sources of noise -- including measurement backaction -- achieves significant levels of mechanical squeezing. The feasibility of our proposal, which is close to experimental state-of-the-art, makes it a valuable tool for quantum state engineering.</description>

      <title>Theory of quantum error mitigation for non-Clifford gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum error mitigation techniques mimic noiseless quantum circuits by running several related noisy circuits and combining their outputs in particular ways. How well such techniques work is thought to depend strongly on how noisy the underlying gates are. Weakly-entangling gates, like $R_{ZZ}(\theta)$ for small angles $\theta$, can be much less noisy than entangling Clifford gates, like CNOT and CZ, and they arise naturally in circuits used to simulate quantum dynamics. However, such weakly-entangling gates are non-Clifford, and are therefore incompatible with two of the most prominent error mitigation techniques to date: probabilistic error cancellation (PEC) and the related form of zero-noise extrapolation (ZNE). This paper generalizes these techniques to non-Clifford gates, and comprises two complementary parts. The first part shows how to effectively transform any given quantum channel into (almost) any desired channel, at the cost of a sampling overhead, by adding random Pauli gates and processing the measurement outcomes. This enables us to cancel or properly amplify noise in non-Clifford gates, provided we can first characterize such gates in detail. The second part therefore introduces techniques to do so for noisy $R_{ZZ}(\theta)$ gates. These techniques are robust to state preparation and measurement (SPAM) errors, and exhibit concentration and sensitivity--crucial features in many experiments. They are related to randomized benchmarking, and may also be of interest beyond the context of error mitigation. We find that while non-Clifford gates can be less noisy than related Cliffords, their noise is fundamentally more complex, which can lead to surprising and sometimes unwanted effects in error mitigation. Whether this trade-off can be broadly advantageous remains to be seen.</description>

      <title>Equivalence Checking of Quantum Circuits by Model Counting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Verifying equivalence between two quantum circuits is a hard problem, that is nonetheless crucial in compiling and optimizing quantum algorithms for real-world devices. This paper gives a Turing reduction of the (universal) quantum circuits equivalence problem to weighted model counting (WMC). Our starting point is a folklore theorem showing that equivalence checking of quantum circuits can be done in the so-called Pauli-basis. We combine this insight with a WMC encoding of quantum circuit simulation, which we extend with support for the Toffoli gate. Finally, we prove that the weights computed by the model counter indeed realize the reduction. With an open-source implementation, we demonstrate that this novel approach can outperform a state-of-the-art equivalence-checking tool based on ZX calculus and decision diagrams.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we characterize convexity in terms of algebras over a PROP, and establish a tensor-product-like symmetric monoidal structure on the category of convex sets. Using these two structures, and the theory of $\scr{O}$-monoidal categories, we state and prove a Grothendieck construction for lax $\scr{O}$-monoidal functors into convex sets. We apply this construction to the categorical characterization of entropy of Baez, Fritz, and Leinster, and to the study of quantum contextuality in the framework of simplicial distributions.</description>

      <title>Convergence of Iterative Quadratic Programming for Robust Fixed-Endpoint Transfer of Bilinear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a computational method for open-loop minimum-norm control synthesis for fixed-endpoint transfer of bilinear ensemble systems that are indexed by two continuously varying parameters. We suppose that one ensemble parameter scales the homogeneous, linear part of the dynamics, and the second parameter scales the effect of the applied control inputs on the inhomogeneous, bilinear dynamics. This class of dynamical systems is motivated by robust quantum control pulse synthesis, where the ensemble parameters correspond to uncertainty in the free Hamiltonian and inhomogeneity in the control Hamiltonian, respectively. Our computational method is based on polynomial approximation of the ensemble state in parameter space and discretization of the evolution equations in the time domain using a product of matrix exponentials corresponding to zero-order hold controls over the time intervals. The dynamics are successively linearized about control and trajectory iterates to formulate a sequence of quadratic programs for computing perturbations to the control that successively improve the objective until the iteration converges. We use a two-stage computation to first ensure transfer to the desired terminal state, and then minimize the norm of the control function. The method is demonstrated for the canonical uniform transfer problem for the Bloch system that appears in nuclear magnetic resonance, as well as the matter-wave splitting problem for the Raman-Nath system that appears in ultra-cold atom interferometry.</description>

      <title>New Constraints on Exotic Spin-Spin-Velocity-Dependent Interactions with Solid-State Quantum Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report new experimental results on exotic spin-spin-velocity-dependent interactions between electron spins. We designed an elaborate setup that is equipped with two nitrogen-vacancy (NV) ensembles in diamonds. One of the NV ensembles serves as the spin source, while the other functions as the spin sensor. By coherently manipulating the quantum states of two NV ensembles and their relative velocity at the micrometer scale, we are able to scrutinize exotic spin-spin-velocity-dependent interactions at short force ranges. For a T-violating interaction, $V_6$, new limits on the corresponding coupling coefficient, $f_6$, have been established for the force range shorter than 1 cm. For a P,T-violating interaction, $V_{14}$, new constraints on the corresponding coupling coefficient, $f_{14}$, have been obtained for the force range shorter than 1 km.</description>

      <title>Classical dynamics and semiclassical analysis of excitons in cuprous oxide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Excitons, as bound states of electrons and holes, embody the solid state analogue of the hydrogen atom, whose quantum spectrum is explained within a classical framework by the Bohr-Sommerfeld atomic model. In a first hydrogenlike approximation the spectra of excitons are also well described by a Rydberg series, however, due to the surrounding crystal environment deviations from this series can be observed. A theoretical treatment of excitons in cuprous oxide needs to include the band structure of the crystal, leading to a prominent fine-structure splitting in the quantum spectra. This is achieved by introducing additional spin degrees of freedom into the system, making the existence and meaningfulness of classical exciton orbits in the physical system a non-trivial question. Recently, we have uncovered the contributions of periodic exciton orbits directly in the quantum mechanical recurrence spectra of cuprous oxide [J. Ertl et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 129, 067401 (2022)] by application of a scaling technique and fixing the energy of the classical dynamics to a value corresponding to a principle quantum number $n=5$ in the hydrogenlike case. Here, we present a comprehensive derivation of the classical and semiclassical theory of excitons in cuprous oxide. In particular, we investigate the energy dependence of the exciton dynamics. Both the semiclassical and quantum mechanical recurrence spectra exhibit stronger deviations from the hydrogenlike behavior with decreasing energy, which is related to a growing influence of the spin-orbit coupling and thus a higher velocity of the secular motion of the exciton orbits. The excellent agreement between semiclassical and quantum mechanical exciton recurrence spectra demonstrates the validity of the classical and semiclassical approach to excitons in cuprous oxide.</description>

      <title>Doppler-assisted quantum resonances through swappable excitation pathways in Potassium vapor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the observation of two additional sub-natural line width quantum interference in the $D_2$ manifold of $^{39}K$ vapor, in addition to the usual single Electromagnetically induced transparency peak. The other two features appear exclusively because $^{39}K$ ground hyperfine splitting is smaller than the Doppler broadened absorption profile. This allows probe and control beams to swap their transition pathways. The control beam detuning captures the nature of the coherence, therefore an unusual phenomenon of conversion from perfect transparency to enhanced absorption is observed and explained by utilizing adiabatic elimination of the excited state in the Master equation. Controlling such dark and bright resonances leads to new applications in quantum technologies viz. frequency offset laser stabilization and long-lived quantum memory.</description>

      <title>Vertex corrections to conductivity in the Holstein model: A numerical-analytical study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The optical-conductivity profile carries information on electronic dynamics in interacting quantum many-body systems. Its computation is a formidable task that is usually approached by invoking the single-particle (bubble) approximation and neglecting the vertex corrections. Their importance remains elusive even in model Hamiltonian calculations. Here, we combine analytical arguments with our recent breakthroughs in numerically exact and approximate calculations of finite-temperature real-time correlation functions to thoroughly assess the importance of vertex corrections in the one-dimensional Holstein polaron model. We find, both analytically and numerically, vanishing vertex corrections to optical conductivity in the limits of zero electron--phonon interaction, zero electronic bandwidth, and infinite temperature. Furthermore, our numerical results show that vertex corrections to the electron mobility also vanish in many parameter regimes between these limits. In some of these cases, the vertex corrections still introduce important qualitative changes to the optical-conductivity profile in comparison to the bubble approximation even though the self-energy remains approximately local. We trace these changes back to the bubble approximation not fully capturing a time-limited slow-down of the electron on intermediate time scales between ballistic and diffusive transport. We find that the vertex corrections are overall most pronounced for intermediate electron--phonon interaction and may increase or decrease the bubble-approximation mobility depending on the values of model parameters.</description>

      <title>Probing the quantum nature of gravity using a Bose-Einstein condensate; "Erste Abhandlung"</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18460v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The effect of noise induced by gravitons has been investigated using a Bose-Einstein condensate. The gravitational wave perturbation is then considerd as a sum of discrete Fourier modes in the momentum space. Coming to an operatorial representation and quantizing the phase space variables via appropriately introduced canonincal commutation relations between the canonically conjugate variables corresponding to the graviton and bosonic part of the total system, one obtains a proper quantum gravity setup. Then we obtain the Bogoliubov coefficients from the solution of the time-dependent part of the pseudo-Goldstone boson and construct the covariance metric for the bosons initially being in a squeezed state. Using the stochastic average of the Fisher information, we obtain a lower bound on the amplitude parameter of the gravitational wave. As the entire calculation is done at zero temperature, the bosonic system, by construction, will behave as a Bose-Einstein condensate. For a Bose-Einstein condensate with a single mode, we observe that the lower bound of the expectation value of the square of the uncertainty in the amplitude measurement does not become infinite when the total observational term approaches zero. In order to sum over all possible momentum modes, we next consider a noise term with a suitable Gaussian weight factor which decays over time. We then obtain the lower bound on the final expectation value of the square of the variance in the amplitude parameter. Because of the noise induced by the graviton, there is a minimum value of the measurement time below which it is impossible to detect any gravitational wave using a Bose-Einstein condensate. Finally, we consider interaction between the phonon modes of the Bose-Einstein condensate which results in a decoherence. We observe that the decoherence effect becomes significant for gravitons with minimal squeezing.</description>

      <title>Generalized bulk-boundary correspondence in periodically driven non-Hermitian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a pedagogical review of the periodically driven non-Hermitian systems, particularly on the rich interplay between the non-Hermitian skin effect and the topology. We start by reviewing the non-Bloch band theory of the static non-Hermitian systems and discuss the establishment of its generalized bulk-boundary correspondence. Ultimately, we focus on the non-Bloch band theory of two typical periodically driven non-Hermitian systems: harmonically driven non-Hermitian system and periodically quenched non-Hermitian system. The non-Bloch topological invariants were defined on the generalized Brillouin zone and the real space wave functions to characterize the Floquet non-Hermtian topological phases. Then, the generalized bulk-boundary correspondence was established for the two typical periodically driven non-Hermitian systems. Additionally, we review novel phenomena in the higher-dimensional periodically driven non-Hermitian systems, including Floquet non-Hermitian higher-order topological phases and Floquet hybrid skin-topological modes. The experimental realizations and recent advances have also been surveyed. Finally, we end with a summarization and hope this pedagogical review can motivate further research on Floquet non-Hermtian topological physics.</description>

      <title>Observation of vortices in a dipolar supersolid</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supersolids are states of matter that spontaneously break two continuous symmetries: translational invariance due to the appearance of a crystal structure and phase invariance due to phase locking of single-particle wave functions, responsible for superfluid phenomena. While originally predicted to be present in solid helium, ultracold quantum gases provided a first platform to observe supersolids, with particular success coming from dipolar atoms. Phase locking in dipolar supersolids has been probed through e.g. measurements of the phase coherence and gapless Goldstone modes, but quantized vortices, a hydrodynamic fingerprint of superfluidity, have not yet been observed. Here, with the prerequisite pieces at our disposal, namely a method to generate vortices in dipolar gases and supersolids with two-dimensional crystalline order, we report on the theoretical investigation and experimental observation of vortices in the supersolid phase. Our work reveals a fundamental difference in vortex seeding dynamics between unmodulated and modulated quantum fluids. This opens the door to study the hydrodynamic properties of exotic quantum systems with multiple spontaneously broken symmetries, in disparate domains such as quantum crystals and neutron stars.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Emergence of hydrodynamics in quantum many-body systems has recently garnered growing interest. The recent experiment of ultracold atoms [J. F. Wienand et al., arXiv:2306.11457] studied emergent hydrodynamics in hard-core bosons using a bipartite fluctuation, which quantifies how the particle number fluctuates in a subsystem. In this Letter, we theoretically study the variance of a bipartite fluctuation in one-dimensional noninteracting fermionic dynamics starting from an alternating state, deriving the exact solution of the variance and its asymptotic linear growth law for the long-time dynamics. To compare the theoretical prediction with the experiment, we generalize our exact solution by incorporating the incompleteness of the initial alternating state, deriving the general linear growth law analytically. We find that it quantitatively describes the experimentally observed variance growth without any fitting parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove new concentration inequalities for quantum spin systems which apply to any local observable measured on any product state or on any state with exponentially decaying correlations. Our results do not require the spins to be arranged in a regular lattice, and cover the case of observables that contain terms acting on spins at arbitrary distance. Moreover, we introduce a local W1 distance, which quantifies the distinguishability of two states with respect to local observables. We prove a transportation-cost inequality stating that the local W1 distance between a generic state and a state with exponentially decaying correlations is upper bounded by a function of their relative entropy. Finally, we apply such inequality to prove the equivalence between the canonical and microcanonical ensembles of quantum statistical mechanics and the weak eigenstate thermalization hypothesis for the Hamiltonians whose Gibbs states have exponentially decaying correlations.</description>

Abstract: Short-wavelength repulsive potentials for quantum gases allow to realize new systems and to study new phenomena. Here we report the realization of repulsive optical potentials for dysprosium atoms in the blue region of the spectrum, at wavelengths close to 400 nm. We employ a spectrallyfiltered diode laser system to measure both scalar and tensorial components of the polarizability of dysprosium, which we find in good agreement with the theoretical predictions. We demonstrate the implementation of potential strengths appropriate to manipulate Bose-Einstein condensates, with scattering-limited lifetimes exceeding one second. This type of optical potentials opens interesting directions for the study of dipolar superfluids and supersolids.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless Transition in a Two-dimensional Dipolar Bose Gas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18683v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Long-range and anisotropic dipolar interactions induce complex order in quantum systems. It becomes particularly interesting in two-dimension (2D), where the superfluidity with quasi-long-range order emerges via Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) mechanism, which still remains elusive with dipolar interactions. Here, we observe the BKT transition from a normal gas to the superfluid phase in a quasi-2D dipolar Bose gas of erbium atoms. Controlling the orientation of dipoles, we characterize the transition point by monitoring extended coherence and measuring the equation of state. This allows us to gain a systematic understanding of the BKT transition based on an effective short-range description of dipolar interaction in 2D. Additionally, we observe anisotropic density fluctuations and non-local effects in the superfluid regime, which establishes the dipolar nature of the 2D superfluid. Our results lay the ground for understanding the behavior of dipolar bosons in 2D and open up opportunities for examining complex orders in a dipolar superfluid.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The coupling between defects and extended critical degrees of freedom gives rise to the intriguing theory known as defect conformal field theory (CFT). In this work, we introduce a novel family of boundary and interface CFTs by coupling $N$ Majorana chains with SYK$_q$ interactions at the defect. Our analysis reveals that the interaction with $q=2$ constitutes a new marginal defect. Employing a versatile saddle point method, we compute unique entanglement characterizations, including the $g$-function and effective central charge, of the defect CFT. Furthermore, we analytically evaluate the transmission coefficient using CFT techniques. Surprisingly, the transmission coefficient deviates from the universal relation with the effective central charge across the defect at the large $N$ limit, suggesting that our defect CFT extends beyond all known examples of Gaussian defect CFT.</description>

Abstract: Random number generators (RNGs) are notoriously hard to build and test, especially in a cryptographic setting. Although one cannot conclusively determine the quality of an RNG by testing the statistical properties of its output alone, running numerical tests is both a powerful verification tool and the only universally applicable method. In this work, we present and make available a comprehensive statistical testing environment (STE) that is based on existing statistical test suites. The STE can be parameterised to run lightweight (i.e. fast) all the way to intensive testing, which goes far beyond what is required by certification bodies. With it, we benchmark the statistical properties of several RNGs, comparing them against each other. We then present and implement a variety of post-processing methods, in the form of randomness extractors, which improve the RNG's output quality under different sets of assumptions and analyse their impact through numerical testing with the STE.</description>

      <title>Nonstandard Lagrangians and branched Hamiltonians: A brief review</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time and again, non-conventional forms of Lagrangians have found attention in the literature. For one thing, such Lagrangians have deep connections with several aspects of nonlinear dynamics including specifically the types of the Li\'{e}nard class; for another, very often the problem of their quantization opens up multiple branches of the corresponding Hamiltonians, ending up with the presence of singularities in the associated eigenfunctions. In this article, we furnish a brief review of the classical theory of such Lagrangians and the associated branched Hamiltonians, starting with the example of Li\'{e}nard-type systems. We then take up other cases where the Lagrangians depend upon the velocity with powers greater than two while still having a tractable mathematical structure, while also describing the associated branched Hamiltonians for such systems. For various examples, we emphasize upon the emergence of the notion of momentum-dependent mass in the theory of branched Hamiltonians.</description>

      <title>On the Communication Complexity of Approximate Pattern Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The decades-old Pattern Matching with Edits problem, given a length-$n$ string $T$ (the text), a length-$m$ string $P$ (the pattern), and a positive integer $k$ (the threshold), asks to list all fragments of $T$ that are at edit distance at most $k$ from $P$. The one-way communication complexity of this problem is the minimum amount of space needed to encode the answer so that it can be retrieved without accessing the input strings $P$ and $T$.
  The closely related Pattern Matching with Mismatches problem (defined in terms of the Hamming distance instead of the edit distance) is already well understood from the communication complexity perspective: Clifford, Kociumaka, and Porat [SODA 2019] proved that $\Omega(n/m \cdot k \log(m/k))$ bits are necessary and $O(n/m \cdot k\log (m|\Sigma|/k))$ bits are sufficient; the upper bound allows encoding not only the occurrences of $P$ in $T$ with at most $k$ mismatches but also the substitutions needed to make each $k$-mismatch occurrence exact.
  Despite recent improvements in the running time [Charalampopoulos, Kociumaka, and Wellnitz; FOCS 2020 and 2022], the communication complexity of Pattern Matching with Edits remained unexplored, with a lower bound of $\Omega(n/m \cdot k\log(m/k))$ bits and an upper bound of $O(n/m \cdot k^3\log m)$ bits stemming from previous research. In this work, we prove an upper bound of $O(n/m \cdot k \log^2 m)$ bits, thus establishing the optimal communication complexity up to logarithmic factors. We also show that $O(n/m \cdot k \log m \log (m|\Sigma|))$ bits allow encoding, for each $k$-error occurrence of $P$ in $T$, the shortest sequence of edits needed to make the occurrence exact.
  We leverage the techniques behind our new result on the communication complexity to obtain quantum algorithms for Pattern Matching with Edits.</description>

Abstract: Integrated photonics has been a promising platform for analog quantum simulation of condensed matter phenomena in strongly correlated systems. To that end, we explore the implementation of all-photonic quantum simulators in coupled cavity arrays with integrated ensembles of spectrally disordered emitters. Our model is reflective of color center ensembles integrated into photonic crystal cavity arrays. Using the Quantum Master Equation and the Effective Hamiltonian approaches, we study energy band formation and wavefunction properties in the open quantum Tavis-Cummings-Hubbard framework. We find conditions for polariton creation and (de)localization under experimentally relevant values of disorder in emitter frequencies, cavity resonance frequencies, and emitter-cavity coupling rates. To quantify these properties, we introduce two metrics, the polaritonic and nodal participation ratios, that characterize the light-matter hybridization and the node delocalization of the wavefunction, respectively. These new metrics combined with the Effective Hamiltonian approach prove to be a powerful toolbox for cavity quantum electrodynamical engineering of solid-state systems.</description>

      <title>Addition and Differentiation of ZX-diagrams</title>

      <description>arXiv:2202.11386v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ZX-calculus is a powerful framework for reasoning in quantum computing. It provides in particular a compact representation of matrices of interests. A peculiar property of the ZX-calculus is the absence of a formal sum allowing the linear combinations of arbitrary ZX-diagrams. The universality of the formalism guarantees however that for any two ZX-diagrams, the sum of their interpretations can be represented by a ZX-diagram. We introduce a general, inductive definition of the addition of ZX-diagrams, relying on the construction of controlled diagrams. Based on this addition technique, we provide an inductive differentiation of ZX-diagrams.
  Indeed, given a ZX-diagram with variables in the description of its angles, one can differentiate the diagram according to one of these variables. Differentiation is ubiquitous in quantum mechanics and quantum computing (e.g. for solving optimization problems). Technically, differentiation of ZX-diagrams is strongly related to summation as witnessed by the product rules.
  We also introduce an alternative, non inductive, differentiation technique rather based on the isolation of the variables. Finally, we apply our results to deduce a diagram for an Ising Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Unraveling a cavity induced molecular polarization mechanism from collective vibrational strong coupling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.06004v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that collective vibrational strong coupling of molecules in thermal equilibrium can give rise to significant local electronic polarizations in the thermodynamic limit. We do so by first showing that the full non-relativistic Pauli-Fierz problem of an ensemble of strongly-coupled molecules in the dilute-gas limit reduces in the cavity Born-Oppenheimer approximation to a cavity-Hartree equation for the electronic structure. Consequently, each individual molecule experiences a self-consistent coupling to the dipoles of all other molecules, which amount to non-negligible values in the thermodynamic limit (large ensembles). Thus collective vibrational strong coupling can alter individual molecules strongly for localized "hotspots" within the ensemble. Moreover, the discovered cavity-induced polarization pattern possesses a zero net polarization, which resembles a continuous form of a spin glass (or better polarization glass). Our findings suggest that the thorough understanding of polaritonic chemistry, requires a self-consistent treatment of dressed electronic structure, which can give rise to numerous, so far overlooked, physical mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Optimization tools for distance-preserving flag fault-tolerant error correction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.12862v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lookup table decoding is fast and distance-preserving, making it attractive for near-term quantum computer architectures with small-distance quantum error-correcting codes. In this work, we develop several optimization tools that can potentially reduce the space and time overhead required for flag fault-tolerant quantum error correction (FTQEC) with lookup table decoding on Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) codes. Our techniques include the compact lookup table construction, the Meet-in-the-Middle technique, the adaptive time decoding for flag FTQEC, the classical processing technique for flag information, and the separated $X$ and $Z$ counting technique. We evaluate the performance of our tools using numerical simulation of hexagonal color codes of distances 3, 5, 7, and 9 under circuit-level noise. Combining all tools can result in more than an order of magnitude increase in pseudothreshold for the hexagonal color code of distance 9, from $(1.34 \pm 0.01) \times 10^{-4}$ to $(1.42 \pm 0.12) \times 10^{-3}$.</description>

      <title>Universal stability of coherently diffusive 1D systems with respect to decoherence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.05656v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Static disorder in a 3D crystal degrades the ideal ballistic dynamics until it produces a localized regime. This Metal-Insulator Transition is often preceded by coherent diffusion. By studying three paradigmatic 1D models, namely the Harper-Hofstadter-Aubry-Andr\'e and Fibonacci tight-binding chains, along with the power-banded random matrix model, we show that whenever coherent diffusion is present, transport is exceptionally stable against decoherent noise. This is completely at odds with what happens for coherently ballistic and localized dynamics, where the diffusion coefficient strongly depends on the environmental decoherence. A universal dependence of the diffusion coefficient on the decoherence strength is analytically derived: the diffusion coefficient remains almost decoherence-independent until the coherence time becomes comparable with the mean elastic scattering time.
  Thus, systems with a quantum diffusive regime could be used to design robust quantum wires. Moreover our results might shed new light on the functionality of many biological systems, which often operate at the border between the ballistic and localized regimes.</description>

      <title>Tangling schedules eases hardware connectivity requirements for quantum error correction</title>

Abstract: Quantum computers have the potential to change the way we solve computational problems. Due to the noisy nature of qubits, the need arises to correct physical errors occurring during computation. The surface code is a promising candidate for such error correction that shows high threshold and which can store a logical quantum state on hardware with square-grid connectivity, a type of device that already exists. However, for logical quantum computation, the measurement of some irregular, non-local stabilisers is required, and it is not currently known how to do this without modifying the connectivity of the hardware. Here, we present a method to achieve this, closing this gap on the path to fault-tolerant quantum computation. We introduce a method of tangled syndrome extraction circuits, which enables measurement of observables between distant qubits. As an application of our tangling technique, we show how to measure the aforementioned irregular non-local stabilisers, without physically modifying the hardware itself. We present a concrete scheme that enables general lattice surgery with the planar code. Therefore, tangling enables fault-tolerant logical quantum computation using the surface code on square-grid connectivity architectures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.12599v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the characteristics of special perfect entanglers and construct single parameter two-qubit circuits which are locally equivalent to special perfect entanglers. We present the results obtained from the implementation of one of the circuits using cross-resonance interaction and discuss their applications. First, we show that the ability of two-qubit gates to create entangled states can be described using the chords present in the argand diagram of squared eigenvalues of nonlocal part of two-qubit gates. We show that the entangling power of a two-qubit gate is proportional to the mean squared length of the chords. We deduce the entangling characteristics of special perfect entanglers from the argand diagram associated with them. We implement a special perfect entangler circuit using echoed cross-resonance gate and pulse-level programming for nine different circuit parameters. For a particular input state, we perform quantum state tomography and calculate state fidelity and concurrence of the obtained output density matrices. We also measure the average gate fidelity for B gate circuit. We construct two universal two-qubit quantum circuits using the special perfect entangler circuits. These universal circuits can be used to generate all two-qubit gates. We show that (n-1) B gate circuits can be used to generate n-qubit GHZ and perfect W states. We generate three-qubit perfect W state. Perfect W state generated using pulse-level programming shows better fidelity than the state generated using echoed cross-resonance gate.</description>

Abstract: Photonic interconnects between quantum systems will play a central role in both scalable quantum computing and quantum networking. Entanglement of remote qubits via photons has been demonstrated in many platforms; however, improving the rate of entanglement generation will be instrumental for integrating photonic links into modular quantum computers. We present an ion trap system that has the highest reported free-space photon collection efficiency for quantum networking. We use a pair of in-vacuum aspheric lenses, each with a numerical aperture of 0.8, to couple 10% of the 493 nm photons emitted from a $^{138}$Ba$^+$ ion into single-mode fibers. We also demonstrate that proximal effects of the lenses on the ion position and motion can be mitigated.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.16709v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low-lying entanglement spectrum provides the quintessential fingerprint to identify the highly entangled quantum matter with topological and conformal field-theoretical properties. However, when the entangling region acquires long boundary with the environment, such as that between long coupled chains or in two or higher dimensions, there unfortunately exists no universal yet practical method to compute the entanglement spectra with affordable computational cost. Here we propose a new scheme to overcome such difficulty and successfully extract the low-lying fine entanglement spectrum (ES). We trace out the environment via quantum Monte Carlo simulation and diagonalize the reduced density matrix to gain the ES. We demonstrate the strength and reliability of our method through long coupled spin chains and answer its long-standing controversy. Our simulation results, with unprecedentedly large system sizes, establish the practical computation scheme of the entanglement spectrum with a huge freedom degree of environment.</description>

Abstract: Scalable quantum computers hold the promise to solve hard computational problems, such as prime factorization, combinatorial optimization, simulation of many-body physics, and quantum chemistry. While being key to understanding many real-world phenomena, simulation of non-conservative quantum dynamics presents a challenge for unitary quantum computation. In this work, we focus on simulating non-unitary parity-time symmetric systems, which exhibit a distinctive symmetry-breaking phase transition as well as other unique features that have no counterpart in closed systems. We show that a qutrit, a three-level quantum system, is capable of realizing this non-equilibrium phase transition. By using two physical platforms -- an array of trapped ions and a superconducting transmon -- and by controlling their three energy levels in a digital manner, we experimentally simulate the parity-time symmetry-breaking phase transition. Our results indicate the potential advantage of multi-level (qudit) processors in simulating physical effects, where additional accessible levels can play the role of a controlled environment.</description>

Abstract: Quantum magnetometry uses quantum resources to measure magnetic fields with precision and accuracy that cannot be achieved by its classical counterparts. In this paper, we propose a scheme for quantum magnetometry using discrete-time quantum walk (DTQW) where multi-path interference plays a central role. The dynamics of a spin-half particle implementing DTQW on a one-dimensional lattice gets affected by magnetic fields, and the controlled dynamics of DTQW help in estimating the fields' strength. To gauge the effects of the field, we study the variance of the particle's position probability distribution (PD) and use it to determine the direction of the magnetic field maximally affecting the quantum walk. We then employ statistical tools like quantum Fisher information (QFI) and Fisher information (FI) of the particle's position and spin measurements to assess the system's sensitivity to the magnetic fields. We find that one can use the position and spin measurements to estimate the strengths of the magnetic fields. Calculations for an electron implementing quantum walk of fifty time steps show that the estimate had a root-mean-square error of the order of 0.1 picoTesla. Moreover, the sensitivity of our system can be tuned to measure any desired magnetic field. Our results indicate that the system can be used as a tool for optimal quantum magnetometry.</description>

Abstract: The Grover algorithm is a crucial solution for addressing unstructured search problems and has emerged as an essential quantum subroutine in various complex algorithms. This research extensively investigates Grover's search methodology within non-uniformly distributed databases, a scenario frequently encountered in practical applications. Our analysis reveals that the behavior of the Grover evolution differs significantly when applied to non-uniform databases compared to uniform or 'unstructured databases'. It is observed that the search process facilitated by this evolution does not consistently result in a speed-up, and we have identified specific criteria for such situations. Furthermore, we have extended this investigation to databases characterized by coherent states, confirming the speed-up achieved through Grover evolution via rigorous numerical verification. In conclusion, our study provides an enhancement to the original Grover algorithm, offering insights to optimize implementation strategies and broaden its range of applications.</description>

Abstract: One-dimensional quantum optical models usually rest on the intuition of large scale separation or frozen dynamics associated with the different spatial dimensions, for example when studying quasi one-dimensional atomic dynamics, potentially resulting in the violation of $3+1D$ Maxwell's theory. Here, we provide a rigorous foundation for this approximation by means of the light-matter interaction. We show how the quantized electromagnetic field can be decomposed $-$ exactly $-$ into an infinite number of subfields living on a lower dimensional subspace and containing the entirety of the spectrum when studying axially symmetric setups, such as with an optical fiber, a laser beam or a waveguide. The dimensional reduction approximation then corresponds to a truncation in the number of such subfields that in turn, when considering the interaction with for instance an atom, corresponds to a modification to the atomic spatial profile. We explore under what conditions the standard approach is justified and when corrections are necessary in order to account for the dynamics due to the neglected spatial dimensions. In particular we will examine what role vacuum fluctuations and structured laser modes play in the validity of the approximation.</description>

Abstract: Reservoir computing is a versatile paradigm in computational neuroscience and machine learning, that exploits the non-linear dynamics of a dynamical system - the reservoir - to efficiently process time-dependent information. Since its introduction, it has exhibited remarkable capabilities in various applications. As widely known, classes of reservoir computers serve as universal approximators of functionals with fading memory. The construction of such universal classes often appears context-specific, but in fact, they follow the same principles. Here we present a unified theoretical framework and we propose a ready-made setting to secure universality. We test the result in the arising context of quantum reservoir computing. Guided by such a unified theorem we suggest why spatial multiplexing may serve as a computational resource when dealing with quantum registers, as empirically observed in specific implementations on quantum hardware. The analysis sheds light on a unified view of classical and quantum reservoir computing.</description>

Abstract: Starting from Polchinski's thought experiment on how to distinguish between pure and thermal states, we construct a specific system to study the interaction between qubit and cavity quantum field theory (QFT) in order to provide a more operational point of view. Without imposing any restrictions on the initial states of qubit and cavity QFT, we compute the evolution of the system order by order by the perturbation method. We choose Landauer's principle, an important bound in quantum computation and quantum measurement, as the basis for the determination of the thermal state. By backtracking the initial state form, we obtain the conditions that must be satisfied by the cavity QFT: the expectation value of the annihilation operator should be zero, and the expectation value of the particle number operator should satisfy the Bose-Einstein distribution. We also discuss the difference between the thermal state and a possible alternative to the thermal state: the canonical thermal pure quantum (CTPQ) state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02022v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new proposal for distinguishing heat from work based on a control-theoretic observability decomposition. We derive a Hermitian operator representing instantaneous dissipation of observable energy, and suggest a generalization of the von-Neumann entropy which can account for the model-uncertainty also present in pure states if the measured observables are informationally incomplete. In this view, the transition from a fundamental to a thermodynamic model consists in mapping the fundamental density matrix to an effective one, generally of lower dimension, encoding only what is observable given the constraints of our sensor and actuator capabilities. The generalized entropy captures the information loss incurred in this mapping. The theory is illustrated for the central spin model, where we show that the application of external controls can increase the size of thermal fluctuations and lower the entropy.</description>

Abstract: In dynamic quantum circuits, classical information from mid-circuit measurements is fed forward during circuit execution. This emerging capability of quantum computers confers numerous advantages that can enable more efficient and powerful protocols by drastically reducing the resource requirements for certain core algorithmic primitives. In particular, in the case of the $n$-qubit quantum Fourier transform followed immediately by measurement, the scaling of resource requirements is reduced from $O(n^2)$ two-qubit gates in an all-to-all connectivity in the standard unitary formulation to $O(n)$ mid-circuit measurements in its dynamic counterpart without any connectivity constraints. Here, we demonstrate the advantage of dynamic quantum circuits for the quantum Fourier transform on IBM's superconducting quantum hardware with certified process fidelities of $&gt;50\%$ on up to $16$ qubits and $&gt;1\%$ on up to $37$ qubits, exceeding previous reports across all quantum computing platforms. These results are enabled by our contribution of an efficient method for certifying the process fidelity, as well as of a dynamical decoupling protocol for error suppression during mid-circuit measurements and feed-forward within a dynamic quantum circuit that we call ``feed-forward-compensated dynamical decoupling" (FC-DD). Our results demonstrate the advantages of leveraging dynamic circuits in optimizing the compilation of quantum algorithms.</description>

      <title>Markovian and non-Markovian master equations versus an exactly solvable model of a qubit in a cavity</title>

Abstract: Quantum master equations are commonly used to model the dynamics of open quantum systems, but their accuracy is rarely compared with the analytical solution of exactly solvable models. In this work, we perform such a comparison for the damped Jaynes-Cummings model of a qubit in a leaky cavity, for which an analytical solution is available in the one-excitation subspace. We consider the non-Markovian time-convolutionless master equation up to the second (Redfield) and fourth orders as well as three types of Markovian master equations: the coarse-grained, cumulant, and standard rotating-wave approximation (RWA) Lindblad equations. We compare the exact solution to these master equations for three different spectral densities: impulse, Ohmic, and triangular. We demonstrate that the coarse-grained master equation outperforms the standard RWA-based Lindblad master equation for weak coupling or high qubit frequency (relative to the spectral density high-frequency cutoff $\omega_c$), where the Markovian approximation is valid. In the presence of non-Markovian effects characterized by oscillatory, non-decaying behavior, the TCL approximation closely matches the exact solution for short evolution times (in units of $\omega_c^{-1}$) even outside the regime of validity of the Markovian approximations. For long evolution times, all master equations perform poorly, as quantified in terms of the trace-norm distance from the exact solution. The fourth-order time-convolutionless master equation achieves the top performance in all cases. Our results highlight the need for reliable approximation methods to describe open-system quantum dynamics beyond the short-time limit.</description>

      <title>A Secure Quantum Key Distribution Protocol Using Two-Particle Transmission</title>

Abstract: The evolution of Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) relies on innovative methods to enhance its security and efficiency. Unextendible Product Bases (UPBs) hold promise in quantum cryptography due to their inherent indistinguishability, yet they are underutilized in QKD protocols. This work introduces a protocol utilizing UPBs to establish quantum keys between distant parties. Specifically, we propose a protocol utilizing a $3\times 3$ tile UPB, where Alice sequentially transmits subsystem states to Bob through quantum channels. The protocol's security is underpinned by the no-cloning theorem, prohibiting the cloning of orthogonal states. We analyze potential attacks, including intercept-resend and detector blinding attacks when quantum channels are noiseless, and discuss the challenges posed by the indistinguishability of our protocol for eavesdroppers, thereby enhancing QKD security.</description>

      <title>Relativistic exponential-type spinor orbitals and their use in many-electron Dirac equation solution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17029v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dirac-Coulomb type differential equation and its solution relativistic exponential-type spinor orbitals are introduced. They provide a revised form for operator invariants, namely Dirac invariants, simplifying the treatment of the angular components in calculation of many-electron systems. The relativistic Coulomb energy is determined by employing a spectral solution to Poisson's equation for the one$-$electron potential, which is expressed in terms of radial functions involving incomplete gamma functions. The computation for incomplete gamma functions posses challenges due to slow convergence rate associated with their series representation. Such difficulties are eliminated through use of the bi-directional method along with hyper-radial functions. A new formulation for relativistic auxiliary functions that improve the efficiency in Coulomb energy calculations is presented. These formulations also contribute to inquiring into orthogonal expansions for solutions to Poisson's equation using complete orthonormal sets of exponential orbitals with non-integer principal quantum numbers. They may provide a meaningful alternative series representations.</description>

      <title>Fermihedral: On the Optimal Compilation for Fermion-to-Qubit Encoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17794v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces Fermihedral, a compiler framework focusing on discovering the optimal Fermion-to-qubit encoding for targeted Fermionic Hamiltonians. Fermion-to-qubit encoding is a crucial step in harnessing quantum computing for efficient simulation of Fermionic quantum systems. Utilizing Pauli algebra, Fermihedral redefines complex constraints and objectives of Fermion-to-qubit encoding into a Boolean Satisfiability problem which can then be solved with high-performance solvers. To accommodate larger-scale scenarios, this paper proposed two new strategies that yield approximate optimal solutions mitigating the overhead from the exponentially large number of clauses. Evaluation across diverse Fermionic systems highlights the superiority of Fermihedral, showcasing substantial reductions in implementation costs, gate counts, and circuit depth in the compiled circuits. Real-system experiments on IonQ's device affirm its effectiveness, notably enhancing simulation accuracy.</description>

      <title>Signatures of Parafermion Zero Modes in Fractional Quantum Hall-Superconductor Heterostructures</title>

Abstract: Parafermion zero modes can arise in hybrid structures composed of $\nu=1/m$ fractional quantum Hall edges proximitized with an s-wave superconductor. Here we consider parafermion and Cooper pair tunneling, and backscattering in a junction formed in such hybrid structures. We find that the $4\pi m$ periodicity due to parafermion-only tunneling reduces, in the presence of backscattering, to $4\pi$-periodic at zero temperature and $2\pi$-periodic at finite temperature unless the fermion parity is fixed. Nevertheless, a clear signature of parafermion tunneling remains in the shape of the current-phase relation.</description>

      <title>Emulating moir\'e materials with quasiperiodic circuit quantum electrodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.15103v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological bandstructures interfering with moir\'e superstructures give rise to a plethora of emergent phenomena, which are pivotal for correlated insulating and superconducting states of twisttronics materials. While quasiperiodicity was up to now a notion mostly reserved for solid-state materials and cold atoms, we here demonstrate the capacity of conventional superconducting circuits to emulate moir\'e physics in charge space. With two examples, we show that Hofstadter's butterfly and the magic-angle effect, are directly visible in spectroscopic transport measurements. Importantly, these features survive in the presence of harmonic trapping potentials due to parasitic linear capacitances. Our proposed platform benefits from unprecedented tuning capabilities, and opens the door to probe incommensurate physics in virtually any spatial dimension.</description>

      <title>Topological Orders Beyond Topological Quantum Field Theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.03353v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Systems displaying quantum topological order feature robust characteristics that are very attractive to quantum computing schemes. Topological quantum field theories have proven to be powerful in capturing the quintessential attributes of systems displaying topological order including, in particular, their anyon excitations. Here, we investigate systems that lie outside this common purview, and present a rich class of models exhibiting topological orders with distance-dependent interacting anyons. As we illustrate, in some instances, the gapped lowest-energy excitations are comprised of anyons that densely cover the entire system. This leads to behaviors not typically described by topological quantum field theories. We examine these models by performing dualities to systems displaying conventional (i.e., Landau) orders. Our approach enables a general method for mapping generic Landau-type theories to dual models with topological order of the same spatial dimension. The low-energy subspaces of our models can be made more resilient to thermal effects than those of surface codes.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian second-order topological superconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.18325v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The topology of non-Hermitian systems is fundamentally changed by the non-Hermitian skin effect, which leads to the generalized bulk-boundary correspondence. Based on the non-Bloch band theory, we get insight into the interplay between the non-Hermiticity and the second-order topological superconductors in two spatial dimensions. We investigate that the non-Hermiticity drives both the bulk states and topological edge modes to accumulate toward opposite corners of the system depending on the particle and hole degrees of freedom protected by the particle-hole symmetry. Furthermore, the degeneracy of the Majorana corner modes can be broken in terms of both the eigenenergies and the eigenstates. Through an edge theory analysis, we elucidate the impact of non-Hermiticity and enable the extension of higher-order topological superconductors to the realm of non-Hermitian systems. We show that $Z_2$ skin effect and $Z_2$ skin-topological modes reveal the universal characteristics of non-Hermitian second-order topological superconductors and the generalized bulk-boundary correspondence is further enriched by the particle-hole symmetry.</description>

      <title>Robustness of Quantum Chaos and Anomalous Relaxation in Open Quantum Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00649v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dissipation is a ubiquitous phenomenon in nature that affects the fate of chaotic quantum dynamics. To characterize the interplay between quantum chaos and dissipation in generic quantum many-body systems, we consider a minimal dissipative Floquet many-body circuit. In particular, we study the dissipative form factor (DFF), an extension of the spectral form factor to open quantum systems, of Floquet systems in the presence of arbitrary on-site dissipation modeled by quantum channels. For a solvable model, in the limit of large local Hilbert space dimension, we obtain an exact expression for the DFF averaged over the random unitary gates, with simple, closed-form expressions in the limit of large times. We find that, for long enough times, the system always relaxes (i.e., the DFF decays) with two distinctive regimes characterized by the presence or absence of gap-closing. While the system can sustain a robust ramp for a long (but finite) time interval in the gap-closing regime, relaxation is "assisted" by quantum chaos in the regime where the gap remains nonzero. In the latter regime, we find that, if the thermodynamic limit is taken first, the gap does not close even in the dissipationless limit, a recently uncovered phenomenon dubbed anomalous relaxation. We complement our findings with numerical results for quantum circuits with a small Hilbert space dimension.</description>

      <title>Few-magnon excitations in a frustrated spin-$S$ ferromagnetic chain with single-ion anisotropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14101v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study few-magnon excitations in a finite-size spin-$S$ chain with ferromagnetic nearest-neighbor (NN) interaction $J&gt;0$ and antiferromagnetic next-nearest-neighbor (NNN) interaction $J'&lt;0$, in the presence of the single-ion (SI) anisotropy $D$. We first reveal the condition for the emergence of zero-excitation-energy states. In the isotropic case with $\Delta=\Delta'=1$ ($\Delta$ and $\Delta'$ are the corresponding anisotropy parameters), a threshold of $J/|J'|$ above which the ground state is ferromagnetic is determined by exact diagonalization for short chains up to $12$ sites. Using a set of exact two-magnon Bloch states, we then map the two-magnon problem to a single-particle one on an effective open chain with both NN and NNN hoppings. The whole two-magnon excitation spectrum is calculated for large systems and the commensurate-incommensurate transition in the lowest-lying mode is found to exhibit different behaviors between $S=1/2$ and higher spins due to the interplay of the SI anisotropy and the NNN interaction. For the commensurate momentum $k=-\pi$, the effective lattice is decoupled into two NN open chains that can be exactly solved via a plane-wave ansatz. Based on this, we analytically identify in the $\Delta'-D/|J'|$ plane the regions supporting the SI or NNN exchange two-magnon bound states near the edge of the band. In particular, we prove that there always exists a lower-lying NN exchange two-magnon bound state near the band edge for arbitrary $S\geq 1/2$. Finally, we numerically calculate the $n$-magnon spectra for $S=1/2$ with $n\leq5$ by using a spin-operator matrix element method. The corresponding $n$-magnon commensurate instability regions are determined for finite chains and consistent results with prior literature are observed.</description>
