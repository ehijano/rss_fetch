      <title>Radiative corrections to $\tau\to\pi\pi\nu_\tau$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hadronic $\tau$ decays present an opportunity to determine the isovector part of the hadronic-vacuum-polarization contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon in a way complementary to $e^+e^-\to\text{hadrons}$ cross sections. However, the required isospin rotation is only exact in the isospin limit, and corrections need to be under control to draw robust conclusions, most notably for $\tau\to\pi\pi\nu_\tau$ decays to determine the two-pion contribution, $a_\mu^\text{HVP, LO}[\pi\pi,\tau]$. In this work, we present a novel analysis of the required radiative corrections using dispersion relations, thereby extending in a model-independent way the previous analysis in chiral perturbation theory (ChPT) beyond the threshold region. In particular, we include the dominant structure-dependent virtual corrections from pion-pole diagrams, leading to sizable changes in the vicinity of the $\rho(770)$ resonance. Moreover, we work out the matching to ChPT and devise a strategy for a stable numerical evaluation of real-emission contributions near the two-pion threshold, which proves important to capture isospin-breaking corrections enhanced by the threshold singularity. For the numerical analysis, we use a dispersive representation of the pion form factor including the $\rho'$, $\rho''$ resonances, perform fits to the available data sets for the $\tau\to\pi\pi\nu_\tau$ spectral function, and calculate the corresponding radiative correction factor $G_\text{EM}(s)$ in a self-consistent manner. Based on these results, we evaluate the $\tau$-specific isospin-breaking corrections to $a_\mu^\text{HVP, LO}[\pi\pi,\tau]$.</description>

      <title>Galactic magnetic fields seeded by ultralight dark photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we show that ultralight dark photons, which couple to the Standard Model photon through kinetic mixing, can potentially source galactic scale magnetic fields. Although these magnetic fields would be too weak to detect at present in galaxies due to plasma screening effects, we show that dark photons can provide the seed magnetic field strength ($10^{-20}$ G) required for dynamo amplification in galaxies. Such dynamo-amplified magnetic fields are consistent with observations of $\mu$G strength galactic magnetic fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.07509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-energy QCD evolution beyond leading order suffers from instabilities driven by large collinear logarithms. We present a framework, consistent with the standard high-energy operator product expansion (OPE), that restores perturbative stability order by order. The method involves a change of basis in the space of high-energy operators, which modifies both the evolution kernel and the coefficient functions while leaving physical observables invariant. Within this factorization scheme, we derive a next-to-leading-order renormalization-group equation whose numerical solution exhibits stable evolution up to large rapidities, thereby establishing a solid foundation for precision studies of gluon saturation at current and future colliders.</description>

      <title>Seasons of Dark Matter Freeze-In Shaped by the Weather of the Early Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantifying the imprints of freeze-in dark matter (DM) on cosmological structures requires knowledge of its phase-space distribution. We investigate how variations in the cosmological history before nucleosynthesis, the "weather" of that epoch, give rise to distinct "seasons" in the DM momentum distribution that govern its warmness. Studying decay-driven production across diverse cosmological histories, we map how these conditions shape DM phase-space properties. Our study quantifies how the early universe composition plays a key role in determining the mass bound on freeze-in DM.</description>

      <title>Quantum Calculations of the Cavity Shift in Electron Magnetic Moment Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The measurement of the anomalous electron magnetic moment $g-2$ through quantum transitions of a single trapped electron is the most stringent test of quantum field theory. These experiments are now so precise that they must account for the effects of the cavity containing the electron. Classical calculations of this "cavity shift" must subtract the electron's divergent self-field, and thus require knowledge of the exact Green's function for the cavity's electromagnetic field. We perform the first fully quantum calculation of the cavity shift in a closed cavity, which instead involves subtracting linearly divergent cavity mode sums and integrals. Using contour integration methods, we find perfect agreement with existing classical results for both spherical and cylindrical cavities, justifying their current use. Moreover, our mode-based results can be naturally generalized to account for systematic effects, necessary to push future measurements to the next order of magnitude in precision.</description>

      <title>Information Criteria for Selecting Parton Distribution Function Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In data-driven determination of Parton Distribution Functions (PDFs) in global QCD analyses, uncovering the true underlying distributions is complicated by a highly convoluted inverse problem. The determination of PDFs can be understood as the inference of a function supported on $[0,1]$, a problem that admits multiple acceptable solutions. An ensemble of solutions exists that pass all standard goodness-of-fit criteria.
  In this paper, we propose algorithms for the classification, clustering, and selection of solutions to the determination of PDFs, or any functions on $[0,1]$, based on the characterization of their shape. We explore information-theoretic based (R\'enyi entropy and divergence) and optimal-transport based (Wasserstein distance) criteria. In particular, we advocate for the use of the R\'enyi entropy as an {\it absolute} estimator per solution, as opposed to {\it relative} estimators that compare solutions pairwise. We show that the R\'enyi entropy can characterize the space of solutions {\it w.r.t.} the PDF shapes. Paired with the identification of the optimal combination of solutions via Pareto fronts, it provides a plausible and minimalist selection algorithm. Moreover, R\'enyi entropy proves versatile for use in clustering applications.</description>

      <title>Jet quenching in out-of-equilibrium QCD matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first study of jet substructure modifications during the bottom-up evolution that describes the early stages of heavy-ion collisions. To this end, we study the bremsstrahlung radiation rate of soft gluons from a hard parton propagating through out-of-equilibrium QCD matter. The gluon spectrum is computed within the Improved Opacity Expansion, which accounts for both multiple soft and single hard momentum exchanges between the hard probe and the medium. The background evolution is obtained from effective kinetic theory simulations that determine the jet quenching parameter, which in turn controls the radiation rate. We compute the radiation rate for initially under- and over-occupied systems, as well as for an expanding system undergoing hydrodynamization, which typically represents the initial stages of heavy-ion collisions. The results for these dynamical backgrounds are compared to static and thermally matched scenarios, allowing to gauge the importance of bulk expansion in the evolution of the jet cascade. Our findings show that the early stages of the bulk matter evolution in heavy-ion collisions leave a sizable imprint on the radiation pattern inside jets. These results establish a basis for incorporating pre-equilibrium dynamics into realistic descriptions of jet quenching and hard-probe evolution.</description>

      <title>Double Bangs at IceCube as a Window to the Neutrino Mass Origin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutrino oscillation parameters are subject to renormalization group (RG) evolution, just like all couplings and masses of Standard Model (SM) particles. Within the SM extended with three massive neutrinos, it is well known that RG running effects in the neutrino sector are small. However, the RG running of the elements of the leptonic mixing (PMNS) matrix below the electroweak symmetry breaking scale can be enhanced in the presence of light neutrinophilic new particles. In this work, using a particular low-scale neutrino mass model as an example, and by taking into account both atmospheric and astrophysical neutrino fluxes, we show that RG running of the PMNS matrix can lead to an increased number of high-energy tau neutrino events at IceCube. This excess manifests as an increased number of spatially displaced showers called ``double bangs". We find that the number of double bangs induced by new physics through RG effects can be comparable to that arising from SM interactions of astrophysical tau neutrinos.</description>

      <title>Prompt diphoton production at ATLAS 13 TeV in $k_t$-factorization: a comparative analysis of UPDF models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform an in-depth comparative analysis of unintegrated parton distribution function (UPDF) models for isolated prompt diphoton production in proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13$~TeV within the $k_t$-factorization framework. Predictions are obtained with three UPDF approaches: Parton Branching (PB), NLO-MRW, and Modified KMRW (MKMRW). Tre--level $q + \bar q\!\to\!\gamma +\gamma$, $q + \bar q\!\to\!\gamma + \gamma + g$, and $q + g\!\to\!\gamma +\gamma + q$ subprocesses are generated with \textsc{KaTie} using off-shell initial states; the loop-induced $g + g\!\to\!\gamma + \gamma$ channel is evaluated independently. We compare differential cross sections with ATLAS measurements across a broad set of observables, including the photon transverse momenta, diphoton invariant mass and transverse momentum, the Collins-Soper angle, acoplanarity, $\phi^*_\eta$, and a transverse thrust-related variable. This comparative study quantifies the impact of the UPDF choice on the diphoton spectra. We find that the PB model provides the most consistent agreement over all distributions, whereas NLO-MRW tends to overshoot in regions correlated with larger factorization scales and MKMRW generally undershoots due to stronger Sudakov suppression. With standard scale variations, our results indicate that $k_t$-factorization with PB UPDFs can accurately describe diphoton production, while fixed-order collinear predictions typically require higher-order corrections together with parton-shower effects to achieve a comparable description.</description>

      <title>Unified Pati-Salam from Noncommutative Geometry: Overview and Phenomenological Remarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The lack of clear new-physics signals at the LHC searches motivates models that can guide current and future collider searches. The spectral action principle within the noncommutative geometry (NCG) framework yields such models with distinctive phenomenology. This formalism derives the actions of the Standard Model, General Relativity, and beyond from the underlying algebra, putting them on a common geometric footing. Certain versions of Pati-Salam (PS) models with gauge coupling unification and limited scalar content can be derived from an appropriate noncommutative algebra. In this paper, I review these gauge-coupling-unified Pati-Salam models and discuss their phenomenological aspects, focusing on the $S_1$ scalar leptoquark.</description>

      <title>Parametrisation and dictionary for CP violating Higgs boson interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Searches for charge-parity (CP) violating interactions of the Standard Model (SM) Higgs boson are a key priority of the LHC physics program. Experimental results from ATLAS and CMS are often reinterpreted within a variety of theoretical parametrisations, the most commonly used being the Higgs basis, $\kappa$'s and angles, CP fractions and effective field theories (EFT) such as the SMEFT and the Higgs EFT. However, differing conventions and assumptions across the literature make the translation between these parametrisations nontrivial and prone to inconsistencies. In this paper, we provide a unified framework and construct explicit dictionaries connecting these different approaches. This facilitates a transparent comparison between theoretical studies and experimental analyses, enabling more robust interpretations of CP-violating effects in Higgs boson interactions.</description>

      <title>Scalar-Magnetometer Search for Ultralight Dark Photon Dark Matter with a Single-Site, Two-Sensor Array: A 6-Channel DTFT Likelihood Analysis with Scalar Optically Pumped Magnetometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on a laboratory search for ultralight dark photon dark matter using a single-site, two-sensor scalar magnetometer array. The experiment employs two scalar optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) operated in a differential configuration to suppress common-mode noise and enhance sensitivity to spatially coherent dark photon fields. We analyze 10.5 hours of continuous data with a six-channel complex data vector evaluated at the three physical frequencies of the expected dark photon signal triplet. Assuming Gaussian noise, we develop a likelihood framework to set robust, frequency-resolved upper limits on the kinetic-mixing parameter $\varepsilon$, which governs the coupling between Standard Model photons and dark photons. Within the mass range $4\times10^{-15}\,\mathrm{eV} \leq m_{A'} \leq 3\times10^{-14}\,\mathrm{eV}$, we obtain the most stringent direct laboratory limits to date on $\varepsilon$, complementing existing astrophysical bounds including those inferred from observations of the Leo-T dwarf galaxy.</description>

      <title>$\phi$ and $J/\psi$ Production in Proton-Proton Scattering through Hadronic Molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study estimates the contributions of hidden-strangeness hadronic molecular states ($N(2080)3/2^-$, $N(2270)3/2^-$) to $\phi$ production and hidden-charm $P_c$ states to $J/\psi$ production in $pp$ collisions. The calculated cross-sections reach $\sim 10~\mu b$ for $pp\to pp\phi$ and $\sim 0.1~nb$ for $pp\to pp J/\psi$ at energies $\sim 2$~GeV above threshold. We also compute the spin density matrix element $\rho_{00}$ and the decay angular distributions for $\phi\to K^+K^-$ and $J/\psi\to\mu^+\mu^-$. To support future experiments, we conduct Monte Carlo simulations for the four-body final states of $pp\to ppK^+K^-$ and $pp\to pp\mu^+\mu^-$. The resulting lab-frame distributions are expected to inform detector design at facilities like the High-Intensity heavy-ion Accelerator Facility (HIAF) and the proposed Chinese Advanced Nuclear Physics Research Facility (CNUF), enabling more precise measurements and tighter theoretical constraints. Furthermore, to explain the STAR collaboration's result on $\phi$ meson spin alignment in heavy-ion collisions, we propose a novel mechanism involving hidden-strangeness molecular states, testable with future high-statistics $pp\to pp\phi$ data.</description>

      <title>Novel bounds on neutrino portal dark matter from leptonic meson decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the potential of leptonic meson decays $M \to \ell \bar\nu_\ell$, where $M$ is a pseudo-scalar meson, as a probe of neutrino portal dark matter. The model of our focus features a neutral fermion $\psi$ and scalar $\phi$, which are coupled predominantly to neutrinos in the form ${\cal L} \supset \lambda\,\overline\nu_L\,\phi\,\psi_R$. This interaction generates two corrections to the $M \to \ell \bar\nu_\ell$ observables. The first one is a novel three-body decay process $M \to \ell \bar\psi\phi$. This process is enabled by the splitting of the off-shell anti-neutrino $\bar\nu_\ell$ into $\psi$ and $\phi$ in the $M \to \ell \bar\nu_\ell$ diagram. The helicity suppression in $M \to \ell \bar\nu_\ell$ is absent in the three-body process, thereby forming a potentially large contribution to real experimental results, provided $\psi$ and $\phi$ are invisible. The second one is one-loop radiative corrections to the weak vertex $W\ell \bar\nu_\ell$, which do not modify the charged lepton spectrum but lead to enhancement or suppression of the partial $M \to \ell \bar\nu_\ell$ decay width. To demonstrate the ability of the leptonic meson decays to probe the neutrino portal dark matter, we compute two corrections analytically and compare the modified meson branching ratios with the experimental data on the lepton flavor universality of pion and Kaon decays. The resulting constraints turn out to surpass the existing bounds in a large part of parameter spaces.</description>

The original $SU(5)$ model proposed by Georgi and Glashow is incompatible with the observed fermion mass spectrum. Two remedies are known to resolve this discrepancy, one is through introducing a new interaction via a 45-dimensional field, and the other via a 24-dimensional field. We investigate which modification is more natural, defining naturalness as proximity to the original Georgi-Glashow $SU(5)$ model. Our analysis shows that, in both supersymmetric and non-supersymmetric scenarios, the model incorporating the interaction with the 24-dimensional field is more natural under this criterion. We then generalise these models by introducing a continuous parameter $y$, which takes the value 3 for the 45-dimensional field and 1.5 for the 24-dimensional field. Numerical optimisation reveals that $y \approx 0.8$ yields the closest match to the original $SU(5)$ model, indicating that this value corresponds to the most natural model according to our definition.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the strong decay $X(4140)\rightarrow J/\psi \phi$ via the light-cone QCD sum rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we take the $X(4140)$ as the axialvector tetraquark state with the symbolic quark structure $[sc]_S[\bar{s}\bar{c}]_A+[sc]_A[\bar{s}\bar{c}]_S$, and calculate the width of the two-body strong decay $X(4140)\rightarrow J/\psi \phi$ within the framework of the light-cone sum rules. Different from the traditional light-cone sum rules, at the phenomenological side, we introduce parameters $C$ to eliminate the contaminations from the higher resonances and continuum states, and match the hadron side with the QCD side of the correlation function based on rigorous quark-hadron duality to obtain the stable QCD sum rules. Then we obtain the decay width $\Gamma(X(4140)\rightarrow J/\psi \phi)=145\pm21\, \text{MeV}$, which is in excellent agreement with the experimental data $162\pm21^{+24}_{-49 } \,\text{MeV}$ from the LHCb collaboration. The numerical result supports the possibility that the $X(4140)$ could be the $[sc]_S[\bar{s}\bar{c}]_A+[sc]_A[\bar{s}\bar{c}]_S$ type axialvector tetraquark state.</description>

      <title>Determination of Parton Densities for QCD partons and Electroweak Bosons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parton densities are obtained from a solution of the extended DGLAP-type evolution equation that includes both QCD and electroweak contributions. The equations are solved using the Parton-Branching (PB) approach, and the evolution is performed at next-to-leading order for QCD partons and leading order for electroweak bosons.
  The initial QCD parton distributions are fitted to HERA deep inelastic scattering data, while photon and weak-boson densities are generated perturbatively and validated against $d\sigma/dQ^2$.
  The resulting collinear and transverse-momentum dependent (TMD) densities are provided in LHApdf and TMDlib formats for direct phenomenological use.</description>

      <title>Probing low-mass dark matter from sub-MeV to sub-GeV with germanium-based quantum phononic spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a germanium phonon-to-charge transducer that integrates a slow-phonon phononic-crystal (PnC) region with radio-frequency quantum point-contact (RF-QPC) readout at 4 K, and we evaluate its dark-sector reach. A calibrated signal-collection model, which combines geometric guiding, propagation survival, and multiplicity-assisted primary-phonon detection, provides selection-corrected thresholds in the $10^{-3}$-$10^{-2}$~eV range and a background model informed by nanosecond timing gates and GHz-band power-spectral-density windows. Under standard halo assumptions, a 100 g module achieves projected sensitivity to DM-electron and DM-nucleon scattering at recoil energies below $10^{-2}$~eV, probing cross sections below $10^{-43}\,\mathrm{cm}^{2}$ for $m_\chi \in [0.01,100]~\mathrm{MeV}/c^{2}$ (with efficiencies and thresholds folded in). We present sensitivities for both heavy-mediator ($F_{\rm DM}=1$) and light-mediator ($F_{\rm DM}\propto 1/q^{2}$) benchmarks, quantify dominant systematics (threshold, phonon quality factor $Q$, and bulk defect densities), and outline a staged program toward kg$\cdot$yr exposures that begins to test models approaching the solar CE$\nu$NS background.</description>

      <title>Future Collider Perspectives on Higgs CP Violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The search for new sources of CP violation is a cornerstone of the beyond the Standard Model phenomenology programme at the LHC and beyond. We provide a comprehensive analysis of such searches at a range of future facilities with the aim of informing the currently unfolding future collider roadmap. Focussing on new sources of CP violation specifically in the gauge-Higgs sector, we demonstrate the outstanding potential held by future electron-positron and proton-proton colliders to reveal and identify BSM physics with direct relevance for the observed matter-antimatter asymmetry. In particular, the future colliders will provide an order of magnitude improvement in sensitivity to anomalous CP-violating interactions induced by dimension-six effective field theory operators when compared to the high-luminosity LHC programme.</description>

      <title>Evading the BBN bound with a soft stiff period</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmic inflation is the leading theory to explain early Universe history and structure formation. Non-oscillatory inflation is a class of models which can naturally introduce a post-inflationary stiff period of the Universe's evolution which boosts the signal of primordial gravitational waves (GWs), making it possible to observe them in forthcoming GW experiments. However, this pushes the GW energy density high enough to destabilise the process of Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN). This problem can be overcome by "softening" the stiff period, so that the field is gradually tending towards freefall from a frozen start. Here, we consider a modified hybrid inflation model where the stiff period is driven by the waterfall field, allowing the barotropic parameter of the Universe to vary, so that it does not violate the BBN constraint but produces a characteristic gravitational wave spectrum soon to be observable.</description>

      <title>Charming top interactions with a neutral Higgs Boson decaying into $\tau^+ \tau^-$ at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the discovery potential of flavor changing neutral Higgs (FCNH) interactions in top quark decays at the LHC. A general two Higgs doublet model (2HDM) is adopted to study the top quark decay $t \to c \phi^0$, where $\phi^0$ is either a CP-even heavy neutral scalar ($H^0$), or a CP-odd pseudoscalar ($A^0$), followed by the Higgs boson decaying into $\tau^+\tau^-$. The complete process is $pp \to t\bar{t} \to t c\phi^0 \to (bjj) (c\tau_{lep}\tau_{had}) +X$, where $t$ or $\bar{t}$ become virtual when $m_{\phi} &gt; m_t -m_c$, $\tau_{lep}$ and $\tau_{had}$ represent the $\tau$ leptonic decay ($\tau^\pm \to \ell^\pm$ + MET) and the $\tau$ hadronic decay ($\tau^\pm \to j_\tau$ + MET), respectively. We evaluate the cross section applying realistic selection criteria for the FCNH signal and the dominant physics background at the parton-level. In addition, we employ \textsc{MadGraph}, \textsc{Pythia}~8, and \textsc{Delphes} to perform a realistic event-level Monte Carlo simulation analysis. The collinear approximation is applied since the $\tau$'s from Higgs boson decays are highly boosted such that $\tau_{lep}$ and $\tau_{had}$ momenta are approximately in the same direction as the $\tau$'s, which enables the reconstruction of the Higgs boson mass. The energy of the charm quark provides an additional kinematic variable that discriminates the signal from the background. In the alignment limit, the FCNH couplings for the heavy Higgs bosons ($H^0$ and $A^0$) will not be suppressed [$\lambda_{tcH} \propto \sin(\beta-\alpha) \approx 1$]. We study the discovery potential for the heavy neutral Higgs bosons at the LHC with collider energies of $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV, 13.6 TeV and 14 TeV, and find the High-Luminosity LHC offers great promise for the discovery of heavier Higgs bosons from $t \to c \phi^0$ or $t^* \to c \phi^0$.</description>

      <title>Metastable Strings and Gravitational Waves in One-Scale Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metastable cosmic strings provide a minimal and predictive origin for the stochastic gravitational-wave background reported by Pulsar Timing Array experiments. We analyse this possibility in electroweak-like dark sectors with a single-stage breaking $SU(2)\times U(1)\!\to\!U(1)$ driven by one Higgs field. In the regime with dark sector Higgs mass below the $Z'$ mass, and for sufficiently small $W'$ mass, the resulting $Z$-string is classically stable but undergoes quantum decay via nucleation of monopole-antimonopole pairs along the string. We compute the corresponding semiclassical bounce action in a thin-defect approximation, treating both the string core and the monopole endpoints as localised defects whose sizes are small relative to their separation in the tunnelling configuration. This yields a decay rate per unit length that depends on the gauge couplings and the mass hierarchy. We delineate the parameter space in which single-scale dark-sector models reproduce the PTA signal, and verify that the thin-defect approximation remains valid throughout the phenomenologically favoured region, without invoking extended Higgs sectors or multi-stage symmetry breaking.</description>

      <title>Production of Gravitational Waves from Preheating and Tachyonic Instabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze GW production during preheating for an $\alpha$-attractor potential terminating in the positive-curvature regime, with energy transfer via $\phi\chi^{2}$. Linear Floquet analysis and nonlinear simulations show that $\phi$ fluctuations grow by parametric resonance, while $\chi$ undergoes tachyonic bursts. The GW spectrum features two peaks: a dominant low-frequency peak from the parametric channel and a subdominant high-frequency peak from the tachyonic channel. Redshifted to today, the peak reaches $h^{2}\Omega_{\rm GW}^{(0)} \sim 10^{-11}$ at $f^{(0)}_{p} \sim 10^{7}$ Hz. This multi-peak structure is a characteristic imprint of trilinear preheating in $\alpha$-attractors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.07432v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the key challenges in performing muon experiments is knowing which temperatures and applied fields to measure at, and how many muon decays should be measured at each temperature/field combination to get the most useful dataset. We have developed a technique using Fisher information which, for a given muon asymmetry function, can analytically calculate the number of muon decays required to obtain a given error on the parameters of the asymmetry model. Here, we report on the results of our project, in particular applying our methodology to the problem of knowing the best choice of applied longitudinal fields for ionic diffusion experiments.</description>

      <title>On the role of induced electric field in the time-dependent Aharonov-Bohm effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Whether the time-dependent Aharonov-Bohm (AB) effect even exists or not has been the subject of long-standing debate. There are two factors complicating the problem. First, in the closed spacetime line integral of the vector potential that is thought to give the AB-phase shift, how to treat the time-varying vector potential is highly nontrivial. Second, the time-varying magnetic flux generates induced electric field even outside the solenoid. In the present paper, motivated by a recent work by Gao, we re-investigate the role of the induced electric field with the utmost care. This analysis reveals a highly nontrivial effect of the induced electric field, which turns out to be useful for verifying the very existence of the time-dependent AB-effect.</description>

      <title>Exact Results for the Spectrum of the Ising Conformal Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a semiclassical framework to determine scaling dimensions of neutral composite operators in scalar conformal field theories. For the critical Ising $\lambda\phi^4$ theory in $d=4-\epsilon$, we obtain the full spectrum of composite operators built out of $n$ fields transforming in the traceless-symmetric Lorentz representations to next-to-leading order in the double-scaling limit $n\rightarrow \infty$ and $\lambda \rightarrow 0$ with $\lambda n$ fixed. At any given order the semiclassical expansion resums an infinite number of Feynman diagrams. Combining our results with existing perturbative computations further yields the complete five-loop scaling dimensions in the $\epsilon$-expansion for the family of $\phi^n$ operators. Finally, in three dimensions the next-to-leading order semiclassical results supersede any other existing methodology for $n \gtrsim \mathcal{O}(10)$.</description>

      <title>Anomaly induced transport from symmetry breaking in holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the transport properties of relativistic fluids induced by quantum anomalies in presence of explicit symmetry breaking. To this end we consider a holographic Einstein-Maxwell model in 5 dimensions with pure gauge and a mixed gauge-gravitational Chern-Simons terms, coupled with a scalar field. To study the chiral vortical effects and the energy transport sector, apart from the chiral magnetic effects, we have considered the full backreaction of the gauge field on the metric. We have studied the anomalous effects by using Kubo formulae involving correlators of the charged currents and the energy current. Our findings reveal that, in the presence of explicit symmetry breaking, anomaly-induced transport phenomena can extend beyond anomalous currents and affect non-anomalous sectors as well. In particular, we find that all the conductivities display a distinct sensitivity to the mass parameter controlling the symmetry breaking, thus reflecting the interplay between anomaly coefficients and explicit symmetry breaking terms. These findings highlight the role played by pure gauge and mixed gauge-gravitational anomalies in holographic transport, and their importance for strongly coupled systems with broken symmetries.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Possibility of a Sharp Phase Transition in Cold Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: First-order phase transitions (FOPTs) in cold neutron stars (NSs) have been extensively studied and have provided valuable insights into the behavior of the densest matter visible in our Universe, although a strong consensus has yet to emerge. Revisiting the possibility of a hadron-quark FOPT from a new perspective, we examine the interplay between the coupled nature of gravity and microscopic interactions in Tolman--Oppenheimer--Volkoff (TOV) equations and the fundamental requirements of thermodynamic consistency in NSs. We demonstrate that a sharp FOPT manifested as a plateau in the equation of state (EOS) $P(\varepsilon)$, i.e., pressure $P$ versus energy density $\varepsilon$, is intrinsically incompatible with the regularity conditions of the TOV solutions. Although numerical integrations of the TOV equations with EOSs incorporating FOPTs may yield seemingly reasonable mass-radius relations consistent with current observations, such results can mask underlying inconsistencies. Our analysis thus establishes a structural consistency criterion for constraining dense-matter EOSs using NS observables, complementing existing studies of possible phase transitions in NS interiors.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We test dark-energy-motivated screening mechanisms with near-Earth space-based measurements. Within a post-Newtonian treatment, we compute leading corrections to three observables, namely geodetic precession (Gravity Probe B), pericenter advance of LAGEOS-2, and Sagnac time delay in a prospective orbital configuration. We then map these corrections to bounds on chameleon, symmetron, and dilaton models. LAGEOS-2 data yield the strongest Earth-orbit limits for symmetron and dilaton models, while a prospective Sagnac setup provides the tightest constraint for chameleons. These results highlight the relevance of low-density, space-based experiments as sensitive probes of screened dark energy and exclude previously allowed regions of parameter space.</description>

Abstract: A universal contribution exists in the infrared (low frequency) regime of all gravitational waves, which results from nonlinear memory. Nonlinear memory is sourced by linear order gravitational waves and exists for any gravitational-wave background. We calculate the stochastic nonlinear memory signal of various stochastic backgrounds of cosmological (scalar induced, reheating, phase transition, topological defect, turbulence) and astrophysical (binary mergers of stellar-mass, intermediate mass, supermassive, and primordial black holes) origins. These results allow us to derive the complete frequency spectrum of cosmological and astrophysical SGWB. We calculate how to probe the thermal state of the universe, i.e. the equation of the state, via the memory spectrum's slope and also discuss the detection prospects at various frequency bands with future experiments.</description>

      <title>QCD String Axions and $M$-theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.08566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In $SU(N)$ Yang-Mills theory without matter, there exist stable long electric fluxtube strings which carry a 1-form symmetry charge. Over the past decade or so, there has been increasing evidence from lattice calculations that the worldsheet theories of such QCD strings contain a massive pseudoscalar (axion), at least when $N\geq 3$. This has so far been puzzling from the perspective of holographic realizations of strings in confining gauge theories. In this note, we will show how such axions appear naturally in the realization of 4D $\mathcal{N}=1$ Super-Yang-Mills (SYM) from $M$-theory spacetimes in which the extra dimensions are modeled by certain complete metrics of $G_2$-holonomy. This picture predicts that QCD string axions exist only if the gauge group is $SU(N\geq 3)$, $SO(4N+2)$, or $E_6$ (or a quotient/double-cover thereof), and is absent from the spectrum of stable QCD strings if the gauge group is $SU(2)$, $SO(2N+1)$, $SO(4N)$, $Sp(N)$, or $E_7$. We argue why we expect this pattern to persist for non-supersymmetric Yang-Mills strings, at least for large $N$, something which could be tested in future lattice studies of QCD strings for gauge algebras of B, C, D, and E-type.</description>

      <title>Dark winds on the horizon: Prospects for detecting neutrino and hot dark matter wakes in large-scale structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the cosmological signatures of neutrino and Hot Dark Matter (HDM) wakes, which refers to the preferential accumulation of neutrinos (or, more broadly, HDM particles) downstream of moving cold dark matter structures. We improve on existing theoretical models, and provide forecasts for the detectability of the effect in future surveys under more realistic conditions than previously considered in the literature. We show that neutrino and HDM wakes are unlikely to be ever observed with the most natural tracer of a hot subcomponent of the total dark matter on cosmological scales, i.e. 2D weak lensing surveys. However, the effect can be detected at a high significance with idealistic 3D maps of a tracer of HDM, for sufficiently small values of the effective free-streaming length (e.g. present-day values of $k_{\textrm{fs},0} \gtrsim 0.1\textrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ to reach $\textrm{SNR} \gtrsim 1$, for a HDM species accounting for a percent of the total dark matter). HDM wakes are a smoking gun of the effects of free-streaming, which cannot be mimicked by changes to the background expansion history (such as allowing for the dark energy to be dynamical), and hence offer another avenue to search for massive neutrinos, and hot subcomponents of the total dark matter more broadly, in a way that complements traditional observables.</description>

      <title>Early Formation of Supermassive Black Holes via Dark Star Gravitational Instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that dark stars, which are dark-matter-powered stars in the early universe, can grow by accretion to masses in the range $\mathscr{O}\left ({10}^4\right )-\mathscr{O}\left ({10}^7\right)\,{M_\odot}$ before the general-relativistic Feynman-Chandrasekhar instability causes their dynamical collapse to black holes. These accreting dark star configurations avoid standard stellar nuclear- and weak-interaction evolution that would lead to their demise long before they reached this supermassive size. Remarkably, this mechanism for supermassive black hole (SMBH) genesis is relatively robust to initial dark star mass, formation epoch, accretion rate and its history. The SMBHs produced this way can serve as seeds for even larger SMBHs $({\gtrsim}10^9\,M_\odot)$ that have been discovered at high redshift.</description>

      <title>Electroweak corrections in the SMEFT: four-fermion operators at high energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16076v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the Standard Model (SM), electroweak (EW) corrections become significant at high energies, particularly at the tera-electronvolt scale and beyond, due to the presence of Sudakov logarithms. At these energy scales, the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) framework provides an enhanced sensitivity to potential new physics effects. This motivates the inclusion of EW corrections not only for SM predictions but also for analyses within SMEFT. In this work, we compute EW corrections in the high-energy limit for a selected set of dimension-six operators, specifically the class of four-fermion contact interactions, in key hard-scattering processes relevant to both current and future colliders: top-quark pair production at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and in a muon collider scenario, as well as the Drell-Yan process at the LHC. We first discuss the technical details and challenges associated with evaluating EW Sudakov logarithms in SMEFT, contrasting them with the SM case. We then present phenomenological results for the aforementioned processes, highlighting the non-trivial effects introduced by EW corrections arising from the insertion of dimension-six, four-fermion operators. Importantly, the resulting $K$-factors exhibit significant deviations from their SM counterparts, with dependencies not only on the process but also on the specific operators considered. Finally, we explore the potential to lift flat directions in the SMEFT parameter space by incorporating higher-order corrections, using Fisher information techniques.</description>

      <title>Impact of new invisible particles on $B\to K^{(*)} E_{\rm miss}$ observables</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19025v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by a recent Belle~II measurement that suggests an excess in the rare decay $B \to K\, E_{\rm miss}$, and building upon our recent differential decay rate likelihood analysis of the existing experimental information, we investigate possible new physics (NP) scenarios in which light invisible states participate in flavour-changing $b \to s$ transitions. In particular, we consider the total and differential $B\to K^* E_{\rm miss}$ decay rates and $K^*$ polarisation effects in each NP scenario preferred by the $B\to K E_{\rm miss}$ measurement. We show that future measurements of these $B \to K^* E_{\rm miss}$ observables will offer decisive discrimination among the different NP explanations. Our results highlight the strong complementarity of the rare semi-invisible $b$-hadron decay observables, and underline the importance of analysing their momentum transfer spectra when probing extensions of the Standard Model that feature new light degrees of freedom.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14491v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dark matter (DM) annihilation can be significantly enhanced through narrow resonances or the Sommerfeld enhancement effect, with both mechanisms potentially combining in a super-resonant annihilation process. In such scenarios, the conventional assumption that kinetic equilibrium persists until chemical decoupling may not hold, leading to substantial impacts on the final DM relic density. However, a strongly enhanced annihilation cross section into Standard Model particles, except neutrinos, is constrained by cosmic microwave background observations. We thus investigate DM annihilation into neutrino pair final states, focusing on the role of kinetic decoupling. We solve the coupled Boltzmann equations to determine the relic density and constrain the parameter space using current experimental data, while also forecasting the sensitivity of future experiments.</description>

      <title>Higgs pole inflation with loop corrections in light of ACT results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21189v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the Coleman-Weinberg potential for the inflaton in the pole inflation scenarios such as the Higgs pole inflation and the Peccei-Quinn (PQ) pole inflation. The loop corrections stem from the Standard Model particles and extra singlet scalar fields in the former case, making the quartic coupling for the Higgs inflaton modified by the inflaton-dependent power corrections during inflation. We also obtain similar power corrections to the quartic coupling for the PQ inflaton, depending on the realizations of the PQ symmetry in KSVZ and DFSZ models. We show that the loop corrections can shift the spectral index in the pole inflation to a larger value in favor of the ACT results, while being compatible with the bound on the tensor-to-scalar ratio. For a positive one-loop beta function for the inflaton quartic coupling (namely, $b_1&gt;0$), a sub-dominant contribution from the two-loop corrections can be accommodated. On the other hand, if the one-loop beta function for the inflaton coupling is negative (namely, $b_1&lt;0$), we need sizable contributions from two-loops that are larger than the one-loop corrections due to the ACT results.</description>

      <title>Unraveling $K(1690)$ as a pseudoscalar $ud\bar{d}\bar{s}$ tetraquark state</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05726v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent observed $K (1690)$ has been identified as a supernumerary pseudoscalar resonance signal in the strange-meson spectrum predicted by quark model calculations. It is the best candidate of a strange crypto-exotic state. In this work, we systematically study the hadron masses of $ud\bar{d}\bar{s}$ tetraquark states with $J^P = 0^-$ in the method of QCD sum rules (QCDSR). For ten interpolating currents, we calculate the correlation functions up to dimension-8 nonperturbative condensates. To calculate the tri-gluon condensate, we comprehensively consider the contributions from different operators with and without covariant derivatives. The infrared (IR) safety can be guaranteed for the completely calculated tri-gluon condensate by properly addressing the IR divergences in Feynman diagrams. It is demonstrated that the tri-gluon condensate provides significant contributions to the sum-rule analyses in these light tetraquark systems. Our results support the interpretation of $K (1690)$ resonance to be a pseudoscalar $ud\bar{d}\bar{s}$ tetraquark state.</description>

      <title>No Hiding in the Dark: Cosmological Bounds on Heavy Neutral Leptons with Dark Decay Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12270v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Heavy neutral leptons (HNLs) are well-motivated new physics candidates. The mixing of sub-GeV HNLs with active neutrinos is severely constrained by cosmology. In particular, the success of Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) requires the HNL lifetime to be shorter than about 0.02 sec if they were in thermal equilibrium, thus excluding a wide range of mixing angles accessible to terrestrial experiments. In order to justify the laboratory searches in this cosmologically-forbidden region, it is often argued that adding new dark sector decay modes of HNLs can evade the stringent BBN constraint. Here we rule out this possibility and show that, contrary to the naive expectation, HNLs with significant dark decay modes actually lead to stronger cosmological bounds. This is mainly because of the increase in the extra radiation energy density in the Universe around the BBN epoch, which causes observable effects in the primordial helium fraction and $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$. Our result has major implications for laboratory searches of HNLs.</description>

      <title>Multi-loop spectra in general scalar EFTs and CFTs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12518v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the most general effective field theory (EFT) Lagrangian with scalar fields and derivatives, and renormalise it to substantially higher loop order than existing results in the literature. EFT Lagrangians have phenomenological applications, for example by encoding corrections to the Standard Model from unknown new physics. At the same time, scalar EFTs capture the spectrum of Wilson--Fisher conformal field theories (CFTs) in $4-\varepsilon$ dimensions. Our results are enabled by a more efficient version of the $R^*$ method for renormalisation, in which the IR divergences are subtracted via a small-momentum asymptotic expansion. In particular, we renormalise the most general set of composite operators up to engineering dimension six and Lorentz rank two. We exhibit direct applications of our results to Ising ($Z_2$), $O(n)$, and hypercubic ($S_n \ltimes (Z_2)^n$) CFTs, relevant for a plethora of real-world critical phenomena. The computed scaling dimensions agree well with known non-perturbative results, and they lead to new predictions where such results do not yet exist. We thereby expand the understanding of generic EFTs and open new possibilities in diverse fields, such as the numerical conformal bootstrap.</description>

      <title>Can WIMPs Survive the Legacy of a Magnetised Early Universe?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18692v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Primordial magnetic fields (PMFs) can seed additional small-scale matter fluctuations, leading to the formation of dense, early-collapsing dark matter structures known as minihalos. These minihalos may dramatically amplify the dark matter annihilation signal if dark matter is composed of self-annihilating thermal relic particles such as WIMPs. In this work, we analyse the annihilation signal from minihalos with prompt central cusps, $\rho \propto r^{-3/2}$, formed due to the enhanced power spectrum induced by PMFs, using gamma-ray observations of the Virgo cluster. We consider benchmarks motivated by cosmological phase transitions, focusing in particular on the electroweak and QCD transitions, where we assume maximal magnetic energy density and horizon-sized coherence length at generation (upper-limit scenarios). In addition, we include a data-driven case corresponding to the best-fit present-day PMF amplitude inferred from DESI BAO and Planck CMB measurements. Under these assumptions, we find that PMFs can place stringent bounds on WIMP annihilation. Magnetic fields with amplitudes matching the DESI-Planck best-fit values are in strong tension with self-annihilating WIMPs across a wide mass range extending beyond the TeV scale, while the electroweak- and QCD-phase-transition toy-model benchmarks would exclude thermal relics with masses below $300\,\mathrm{GeV}$ and $3\,\mathrm{TeV}$, respectively. Although weaker PMFs would yield weaker annihilation signals, our results demonstrate that whenever PMFs enhance small-scale structure, indirect-detection limits on dark matter must be revisited.</description>

Abstract: This paper investigates the physics potential of the proton-proton Future Circular Collider (FCC-hh) in the search for a new heavy gauge boson, Z', within the framework of the minimal Baryon-Lepton (B-L) symmetric model. We examine the exclusion limits on the mass of the Z' boson for various sets of coupling constants, utilizing leptonic decays, specifically into charged lepton pairs (electron and muon). Using the DARKCAST framework, we compare the parameter constraints derived from previous experiments with the expected reach of the FCC-hh, providing insights into the collider sensitivity and potential to probe new physics beyond the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Branching ratios and CP asymmetries of $B^0 \to \eta_c f_0$ in the improved perturbative QCD formalism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23578v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the idea of fragmented scalar glueball, we investigate the decays $B^0 \to \eta_c f_0$ within the improved perturbative QCD (iPQCD) framework by including the known next-to-leading order corrections. Here, $B^0$ and $f_0$ denote the neutral $B_{d,s}^0$ mesons and the light scalar mesons $f_0(500, 980, 1370, 1500)$ under the $q\bar q$ assignment. The CP-averaged branching ratios (BRs) and the CP asymmetries of $B^0 \to \eta_c f_0$ are evaluated with the $f_0(500)[f_0(1370)]-f_0(980)[f_0(1500)]$ mixing in quark-flavor basis. For effective comparisons with the near-future measurements, we further derive the $B^0 \to \eta_c f_0 (\to \pi^+ \pi^-/K^+ K^-)$ BRs under the narrow-width approximation. ${\rm BR}(B_s^0 \to \eta_c f_0(980) (\to \pi^+ \pi^-))= (2.87^{+1.38}_{-1.29}) \times 10^{-4}$ and ${\rm BR}(B_d^0 \to \eta_c f_0(500)(\to \pi^+\pi^-))/{\rm BR}(B_s^0 \to \eta_c f_0(980)(\to \pi^+\pi^-)) = (12^{+8}_{-7})\%$ obtained in the iPQCD formalism agree with the available measurements and/or predictions within uncertainties. Large BRs of $B_s^0 \to \eta_c f_0(1500) (\to \pi^+ \pi^-/K^+ K^-)$ and large direct CP asymmetries of $B^0 \to \eta_c f_0(1370, 1500)$ are accessible in the LHCb and Belle-II experiments. The experimental tests of these iPQCD predictions would help us to understand the nature of these light scalars more deeply and provide evidences to decipher $f_0(1500)$ as a primary or fragmented scalar glueball potentially.</description>

      <title>Generalized parton distributions and gravitational form factors at large momentum transfer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.01529v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Within the soft collinear effective theory (SCET), we derive a factorization theorem which resums Sudakov logarithms $(\alpha_s\ln^2(-t))^n$ to all orders in the quark-in-quark generalized parton distribution (GPD) at large momentum transfer $t$, and perform a consistency check to one-loop. We show that the same Sudakov factor appears in the `Feynman' contribution to the GPDs of the nucleon. Our result enables the resummation of all the large logarithms $\ln Q^2$ and $\ln^2t$ in exclusive processes with two hard scales $\Lambda_{\rm QCD}^2\ll |t| \ll Q^2$. We also present a SCET power counting analysis of the Feynman contributions to the GPDs and show that the $x$-dependence of GPDs factorizes at large-$t$ with controlled corrections. This in particular implies that any ratio of GPD moments such as the electromagnetic and gravitational form factors (GFF) is perturbatively calculable in this approximation. Furthermore, we identify a novel order $\alpha_s$ power-law $t$-dependence in the GPD and the $D$-type GFF that will dominate over the standard order $(\alpha_s^2)$ `leading twist' asymptotic contribution in the phenomenologically relevant region of $t$.</description>

      <title>Self-resonant dark matter with $Z_4$ gauged symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06728v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new model for two-component scalar dark matter (DM), consisting of two complex scalar fields. In this model, both the DM components are stable due to the remaining $Z_4$ gauge symmetry, which is the remnant of the $U(1)^\prime$ local symmetry. When the resonance condition for DM masses is fulfilled, we show that the elastic co-scattering processes between two components of dark matter ($u$-channel processes) are enhanced due to the Yukawa potential with a small effective mass for the lighter DM mediator, so we can use such co-scattering processes for dark matter to explain the small-scale problems at galaxies. Moreover, there are also semi-annihilation processes that two components of dark matter annihilate into one dark matter particle and a dark photon/Higgs, which are enhanced by the $u$-channel Sommerfeld factor. Focusing on some benchmark models for two-component dark matter satisfying the observed relic density, we obtain the bounds for the dark photon portal couplings from the direct detection for boosted dark matter, which is produced from the semi-annihilation processes at the galactic center.</description>

      <title>Radiative Correction from Secret Neutrino Interactions and Implications for Neutrino-Scattering Experiments</title>

Abstract: New, neutrinophilic mediators are one potential extension beyond the Standard Model of particle physics. Often, studies of neutrinophilic mediator consist of searching for direct evidence of its production and/or its tree-level virtual effect for generating strong neutrino self-interaction. In this work, we focus instead on the fact that such new mediators \textit{also} lead to deviations in neutrino-matter scattering via radiative corrections. With a mediator mass well below the electroweak scale, these effects are potentially observable in a variety of contexts, including coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CEvNS), neutrino deeply-inelastic scattering ($\nu$DIS), and neutrino-electron scattering (e.g., at Borexino). Additionally, such effects lead to new contributions to the $Z$-boson decay width and to non-standard neutrino interactions relevant for long-baseline oscillation experiments. We explore all of these scenarios in some depth, building on the rich phenomenology associated with neutrinophilic mediators.</description>

      <title>Warped Dimensions at the Cosmological Collider</title>

Abstract: Extra dimensions are present in many beyond the Standard Model scenarios, most notably in string theory. However, direct signatures of extra dimensions are difficult to observe in many cases. This is the situation, for example, if the energy scales associated with extra dimensions are close to the string or Grand Unification scale. The energetic early universe provides an exciting opportunity to overcome this challenge, since the heavy states associated with high-scale extra dimensions, such as scalar moduli and Kaluza-Klein (KK) gravitons, could have been produced on-shell at early epochs. In this work, we illustrate this by focusing on how such states can be produced during inflation and leave signatures in primordial non-Gaussianity (NG). Specifically, we consider a 5D spacetime with a warped extra dimension that remains stabilized as inflation proceeds in the four non-compact dimensions. By discussing an explicit stabilization mechanism, we compute the masses and couplings of the radion modulus and the KK graviton modes. Being gravitational degrees of freedom, these unavoidably couple to the field(s) generating curvature perturbation, and can lead to observable NG with a distinctive oscillatory shape and characteristic angular dependence. We give example benchmarks which can already be probed by the Planck data and identify targets for the future. Our study shows that cosmological surveys have the potential to observe on-shell imprints of extra dimensions in the coming years.</description>

      <title>Precision Imaging of the Pion Emission Source in Heavy-Ion Collisions via a Global Rest Frame Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01251v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conventional imaging of pion emission sources, conducted in the center-of-mass frame of individual pion pairs (CMFP), suffers from frame-dependent kinematic distortions that bias the reconstructed source morphology. This method introduces spurious correlations due to the relative boost between the CMFP and the true source rest frame (CMFS), leading to systematic image distortions with a pronounced non-Gaussian tail. We present a transformative approach by performing correlation analysis directly in the global source rest frame (CMFS), the physically meaningful reference frame of the collision fireball. This paradigm shift eliminates kinematic contamination inherent in conventional CMFP-based imaging. The resulting source image shows a dramatic suppression of the non-Gaussian artifact and achieves significantly better agreement with pristine model source functions. Our technique offers a more direct and uncontaminated probe of the intrinsic source geometry, overcoming the limitations of prior methods. It provides a clearer and more accurate determination of the spacetime properties of the nuclear collision fireball, marking a significant advancement in the field.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Singularity and Power-Law Solutions in Modified Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09714v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A bouncing Universe avoids the big-bang singularity. Using the time-like and null Raychaudhhuri equations, we explore whether the bounce near the big-bang, within a broad spectrum of modified theories of gravity, allows for cosmologically relevant power-law solutions under reasonable physical conditions. Our study shows that certain modified theories of gravity, such as Stelle gravity, do not demonstrate singularity resolution under any reasonable conditions, while others including $f(R)$ gravity and Brans-Dicke theory can demonstrate singularity resolution under suitable conditions. For these theories, we show that the accelerating solution is slightly favoured over ekypyrosis.</description>

      <title>Grassmann tensor renormalization group for the massive Schwinger model with a $\theta$ term using staggered fermions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08959v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use the Grassmann tensor renormalization group method to investigate the $N_f=2$ Schwinger model with the staggered fermions in the presence of a $2\pi$ periodic $\theta$ term in a broad range of mass. The method allows us to deal with the massive staggered fermions straightforwardly and to study the $\theta$ dependence of the free energy and topological charge in the thermodynamic limit. Our calculation provides consistent results with not only the analytical solution in the large mass limit but also the previous Monte Carlo studies in the small mass regime. Our numerical results also suggest that the $N_f=2$ Schwinger model on a lattice has a different phase structure, than the model in the continuum limit.</description>

      <title>Probing Decaying Dark Matter Using the Post-EoR HI 21-cm signal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10755v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose the HI 21-cm power spectrum from the post-reionization epoch as a probe of a cosmological model with decaying dark matter particles. The unstable particles are assumed to undergo a 2-body decay into a massless and massive daughter. We assume that a fraction $f$ of the total dark matter budget to be unstable and quantify the decay using the life time $\Gamma^{-1}$ and the relative mass splitting $\epsilon$ between the parent and the massive daughter. The redshift space anisotropic power spectrum of the post-reionization 21-cm signal brightness temperature, as a tracer of the dark matter clustering, imprints the decaying dark matter model through its effect on background evolution and the suppression of power on small scales. We find that with an idealized futuristic intensity mapping experiment with a SKA1-Mid like radio-array, $\epsilon$ and $\Gamma$ can be measured at $3.37\%$ and $6.86\%$ around their fiducial values of $\epsilon = 0.012$ and $\Gamma = 0.008 {\rm Gyr}^{-1}$ respectively. When only the foreground-free window is considered in the $k-$ space, these percentage errors in $\epsilon$ and $\Gamma$ degrade to $9.91\%$ and $12.03\%$ respectively.The forecasts under identical assumptions for a second, literature-anchored benchmark ($\epsilon=1.14\times10^{-4}$, $\Gamma=1.04\times10^{-3}\,\mathrm{Gyr}^{-1}$) yields projected uncertainties of $6.16\%$ on $\epsilon$ and $8.29\%$ on $\Gamma$ while, restricting to the foreground-free window increases these to $18.77\%$ and $14.22\%$, respectively.</description>

      <title>Self-Gravity in Superradiance Clouds: Implications for Binary Dynamics and Observational Prospects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08367v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spinning black holes could produce ultralight particles via the superradiance instability. These particles form a dense cloud around the host black hole, introducing new opportunities for the detection of ultralight new physics. When the black hole is part of a binary system, the binary can trigger transitions among different states of the cloud configuration. Such transitions backreact on the orbital dynamics, modifying the frequency evolution of the emitted gravitational waves. Based on this observation, black hole binaries were proposed as a way to test the existence of ultralight particles. We investigate the effects of the self-gravity of the cloud on the orbital evolution and on the gravitational wave emission. We find that cloud self-gravity could lead to a density-dependent modification of the energy levels of ultralight particles and that it could alter the order of hyperfine energy levels. The crossing of hyperfine levels prevents binaries from triggering resonant hyperfine transitions and allows them to approach radii that could trigger resonant transitions of fine levels. We study the implications of these findings, especially in the context of future space-borne gravitational wave observatory, the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). For quasi-circular, prograde and equatorial orbits, we find that LISA could probe ultralight particles in the mass range $10^{-15}\,{\rm eV} \, - \, 10^{-13}\, {\rm eV}$ through gravitational wave observations.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Analysis of the Neutron Star Equation of State and Model Comparison: Insights from PSR J0437+4715, PSR J0614+3329, and Other Multi-Physics Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07109v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform a comprehensive Bayesian analysis to constrain the neutron star (NS) equation of state (EoS) using a wide range of terrestrial and astrophysical data. The terrestrial inputs include quantities related to symmetric nuclear matter (SNM) and symmetry energy up to two times saturation density ($\rho_0\sim$0.16 fm$^{-3}$), derived from finite nuclei and heavy-ion collisions (HICs). The astrophysical constraints incorporate NS radii and tidal deformabilities from recent NICER observations and GW170817, respectively. We consider five different EoS models: Taylor, $n/3$, Skyrme, RMF, and sound speed(CS), are analyzed by sequentially updating the priors with (i) $\chi$EFT based pure neutron matter, (ii) terrestrial, empirical and earlier astrophysical data, (iii) case (ii) including NICER radii of PSR J0437+4715 and J0614+3329, (iv) all data combined, and (v) excluding empirical nuclear inputs. We also perform Bayesian model comparison which favors the Skyrme model under all combined data (scenario (iv)), yielding tight constraints on symmetry energy parameters: $L_0 = 56 \pm 3$~MeV, $K_{\mathrm{sym}0} = -132 \pm 15$~MeV and also on SNM parameters: $K_0 = 265 \pm 12$~MeV, $Q_0 = -366 \pm 43$~MeV. The mass-radius and mass-tidal deformability posterior distributions are also well constrained. The radius and tidal deformability of a $1.4\,M_\odot$ neutron star are found to be $R_{1.4} = 11.85 \pm 0.11$~km and $\Lambda_{1.4} = 354 \pm 25$, respectively.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic form factors and structure of the $T_{bb}$ tetraquark from lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17549v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first lattice QCD determination of the electromagnetic form factors of the exotic tetraquark $T_{bb} \ (bb \bar u \bar d)$ with quantum numbers $I( J^P ) = 0( 1^+ )$. The extracted form factors encode information about its internal structure, including the charge distribution and the magnetic dipole moments, determined separately for the light and heavy quarks. Our results provide evidence in favor of it being a bound state consisting of a compact heavy diquark $[bb]$ in a color-antitriplet with spin one, and a light antidiquark $[\bar u \bar d]$ in a color-triplet with spin zero. The charge radius of $T_{bb}$ is found to be significantly smaller than the combined charge radii of $B$ and $B^*$ mesons. These two comprise the lowest-lying threshold $BB^*$ in the channel we are considering, and their electric charge form factors are also determined. The computations were performed on a single CLS ensemble with $N_f = 2+1$ dynamical quarks and a lattice spacing of approximately $a \approx0.064 \ \mathrm{fm}$ at the pion mass $m_\pi \approx 290 \ \mathrm{MeV}$.</description>

      <title>Charged-Current Elastic Scattering at the Electron-Ion Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02049v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the measurement of the charged-current elastic scattering process $e^-p\rightarrow\nu_e n$ at the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC). This process provides sensitivity to the poorly constrained axial form factor of the nucleon, which encodes the spatial distribution of weak charge. Collisions of electrons with polarized protons enable measuring the axial form factor via the $e^{-\!}\,\vec{p} \to \nu_e\,n$ target-spin asymmetry for the first time. We conclude that a measurement of charged-current elastic scattering at the EIC will, perhaps unsurprisingly, prove very challenging. However, with dedicated instrumentation at a second EIC detector, the measurement may be possible.</description>
