      <title>Comparative Analysis of Richardson-Lucy Deconvolution and Data Unfolding with Mean Integrated Square Error Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two maximum likelihood-based algorithms for unfolding or deconvolution are considered: the Richardson-Lucy method and the Data Unfolding method with Mean Integrated Square Error (MISE) optimization [10]. Unfolding is viewed as a procedure for estimating an unknown probability density function. Both external and internal quality assessment methods can be applied for this purpose. In some cases, external criteria exist to evaluate deconvolution quality. A typical example is the deconvolution of a blurred image, where the sharpness of the restored image serves as an indicator of quality. However, defining such external criteria can be challenging, particularly when a measurement has not been performed previously. In such instances, internal criteria are necessary to assess the quality of the result independently of external information. The article discusses two internal criteria: MISE for the unfolded distribution and the condition number of the correlation matrix of the unfolded distribution. These internal quality criteria are applied to a comparative analysis of the two methods using identical numerical data. The results of the analysis demonstrate the superiority of the Data Unfolding method with MISE optimization over the Richardson-Lucy method.</description>

      <title>Nature-inspired optimization, the Philippine Eagle, and cosmological parameter estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precise and accurate estimation of cosmological parameters is crucial for understanding the Universe's dynamics and addressing cosmological tensions. In this methods paper, we explore bio-inspired metaheuristic algorithms, including the Improved Multi-Operator Differential Evolution scheme and the Philippine Eagle Optimization Algorithm (PEOA), alongside the relatively known genetic algorithm, for cosmological parameter estimation. Using mock data that underlay a true fiducial cosmology, we test the viability of each optimization method to recover the input cosmological parameters with confidence regions generated by bootstrapping on top of optimization. We compare the results with Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) in terms of accuracy and precision, and show that PEOA performs comparably well under the specific circumstances provided. Understandably, Bayesian inference and optimization serve distinct purposes, but comparing them highlights the potential of nature-inspired algorithms in cosmological analysis, offering alternative pathways to explore parameter spaces and validate standard results.</description>

      <title>Reproducing the first and second moment of empirical degree distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of probabilistic models for the analysis of complex networks represents a flourishing research field. Among the former, Exponential Random Graphs (ERGs) have gained increasing attention over the years. So far, only linear ERGs have been extensively employed to gain insight into the structural organisation of real-world complex networks. None, however, is capable of accounting for the variance of the empirical degree distribution. To this aim, non-linear ERGs must be considered. After showing that the usual mean-field approximation forces the degree-corrected version of the two-star model to degenerate, we define a fitness-induced variant of it. Such a `softened' model is capable of reproducing the sample variance, while retaining the explanatory power of its linear counterpart, within a purely canonical framework.</description>

      <title>Neural Thermodynamic Laws for Large Language Model Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Beyond neural scaling laws, little is known about the laws underlying large language models (LLMs). We introduce Neural Thermodynamic Laws (NTL) -- a new framework that offers fresh insights into LLM training dynamics. On the theoretical side, we demonstrate that key thermodynamic quantities (e.g., temperature, entropy, heat capacity, thermal conduction) and classical thermodynamic principles (e.g., the three laws of thermodynamics and the equipartition theorem) naturally emerge under river-valley loss landscape assumptions. On the practical side, this scientific perspective yields intuitive guidelines for designing learning rate schedules.</description>

      <title>Precise Cosmological Constraints from BOSS Galaxy Clustering with a Simulation-Based Emulator of the Wavelet Scattering Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16116v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform a reanalysis of the BOSS CMASS DR12 galaxy dataset using a simulation-based emulator for the Wavelet Scattering Transform (WST) coefficients. Moving beyond our previous works, which laid the foundation for the first galaxy clustering application of this estimator, we construct a neural net-based emulator for the cosmological dependence of the WST coefficients and the 2-point correlation function multipoles, trained from the state-of-the-art suite of \textsc{AbacusSummit} simulations combined with a flexible Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD) galaxy model. In order to confirm the accuracy of our pipeline, we subject it to a series of thorough internal and external mock parameter recovery tests, before applying it to reanalyze the CMASS observations in the redshift range $0.46&lt;z&lt;0.57$. We find that a joint WST + 2-point correlation function likelihood analysis allows us to obtain marginalized 1$\sigma$ errors on the $\Lambda$CDM parameters that are tighter by a factor of $2.5-6$, compared to the 2-point correlation function, and by a factor of $1.4-2.5$ compared to the WST-only results. This corresponds to a competitive $0.9\%$, $2.3\%$ and $1\%$ level of determination for parameters $\omega_c$, $\sigma_8$ $\&amp;$ $n_s$, respectively, and also to a $0.7\%$ $\&amp;$ $2.5 \%$ constraint on derived parameters h and $f(z)\sigma_8(z)$, in agreement with the \textit{Planck} 2018 results. Our results reaffirm the constraining power of the WST and highlight the exciting prospect of employing higher-order statistics in order to fully exploit the power of upcoming Stage-IV spectroscopic observations.</description>

      <title>On the statistical analysis of grouped data: when Pearson $\chi^2$ and other divisible statistics are not goodness-of-fit tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09195v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Thousands of experiments are analyzed and papers are published each year involving the statistical analysis of grouped data. While this area of statistics is often perceived -- somewhat naively -- as saturated, several misconceptions still affect everyday practice, and new frontiers have so far remained unexplored. Researchers must be aware of the limitations affecting their analyses and what are the new possibilities in their hands.
  Motivated by this need, the article introduces a unifying approach to the analysis of grouped data, which allows us to study the class of divisible statistics -- that includes Pearson's $\chi^2$, the likelihood ratio as special cases -- with a fresh perspective. The contributions collected in this manuscript span from modeling and estimation to distribution-free goodness-of-fit tests.
  Perhaps the most surprising result presented here is that, in a sparse regime, all tests proposed in the literature are dominated by members of the class of weighted linear statistics.</description>

      <title>Scalar embedding of temporal network trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02715v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A temporal network -- a collection of snapshots recording the evolution of a network whose links appear and disappear dynamically -- can be interpreted as a trajectory in graph space. In order to characterize the complex dynamics of such trajectory via the tools of time series analysis and signal processing, it is sensible to preprocess the trajectory by embedding it in a low-dimensional Euclidean space. Here we argue that, rather than the topological structure of each network snapshot, the main property of the trajectory that needs to be preserved in the embedding is the relative graph distance between snapshots. This idea naturally leads to dimensionality reduction approaches that explicitly consider relative distances, such as Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) or identifying the distance matrix as a feature matrix in which to perform Principal Component Analysis (PCA). This paper provides a comprehensible methodology that illustrates this approach. Its application to a suite of generative network trajectory models and empirical data certify that nontrivial dynamical properties of the network trajectories are preserved already in their scalar embeddings, what enables the possibility of performing time series analysis in temporal networks.</description>

      <title>Realization of discretized response in rare-earth vanadates accessed by AC susceptibility and magnetocaloric methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16327v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This report presents a new technique to probe the quantitative dynamical response of the magnetic field induced heating/cooling process in rare-earth vanadium materials. The approach combines AC susceptibility and AC caloric measurements to reveal the intrinsic timescale associated with the magnetic relaxation process of rare-earth ions at low temperatures. Utilizing the well-known crystal field effect in YbVO4, we prove and demonstrate a discretized thermal analysis through a common spin-lattice relaxation phenomenon. The demonstration experiment presented in this study provides a general approach to quantitatively address multiple measured quantities in one unified discretized thermal circuit analysis. It can be extended to study other magnetic, dielectric, and elastic materials exhibiting a complex response to an external driving field in the presence of intrinsic interactions and fluctuations, particularly when an energy dissipation process is within an accessible frequency regime.</description>
