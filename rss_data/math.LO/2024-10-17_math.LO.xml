      <title>A well-quasi-order for continuous functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that continuous reducibility is a well-quasi-order on the class of continuous functions between separable metrizable spaces with analytic zero-dimensional domain. To achieve this, we define scattered functions, which generalize scattered spaces, and describe exhaustively scattered functions between zero-dimensional separable metrizable spaces up to continuous equivalence.</description>

      <title>A Topos-Theoretic Semantics of Intuitionistic Modal Logic with an Application to the Logic of Branching Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Alexandrov topology affords a well-known semantics of modal necessity and possibility. This paper develops an Alexandrov topological semantics of intuitionistic propositional modal logic internally in any elementary topos. This is done by constructing interior and closure operators on the power-object associated to a given relation in the ambient topos. When the relation is an order, these operators model intuitionistic S4; when the relation is an equivalence relation, they also model the characteristic (B) axiom of classical S5. The running example of interest arises from the Branching space-time of Nuel Belnap, which is shown to induce a histories presheaf upon which can be defined an equivalence relation of being obviously undivided at a given point event. These results have some philosophical implications. For example, we study the branching space-time example in light of the indistinguishability interpretation of epistemic modal logic. We will also study several famous first-order formulas in presheaf topos semantics such as the so-called Barcan formula. We shall see, however, that one of the Barcan converses is invalidated by a simple example of non-trivial space-time branching. This invalidates a thesis of metaphysical actualism, namely, that there are no possibly existing but non-actual entities.</description>

      <title>Zarankiewicz bounds from distal regularity lemma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since K\H{o}v\'ari, S\'os, and Tur\'an proved upper bounds for the Zarankiewicz problem in 1954, much work has been undertaken to improve these bounds, and some have done so by restricting to particular classes of graphs. In 2017, Fox, Pach, Sheffer, Suk, and Zahl proved better bounds for semialgebraic binary relations, and this work was extended by Do in the following year to arbitrary semialgebraic relations. In this paper, we show that Zarankiewicz bounds in the shape of Do's are enjoyed by all relations satisfying the distal regularity lemma, an improved version of the Szemer\'edi regularity lemma satisfied by relations definable in distal structures (a vast generalisation of o-minimal structures).</description>

      <title>Stable functions and F{\o}lner's Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that if $G$ is amenable and $A\subseteq G$ has positive upper Banach density, then there is an identity neighborhood $B$ in the Bohr topology on $G$ that is almost contained in $AA^{-1}$ in the sense that $B\backslash AA^{-1}$ has upper Banach density $0$. This generalizes the abelian case (due to F{\o}lner) and the countable case (due to Beiglb\"{o}ck, Bergelson, and Fish). The proof is indirectly based on local stable group theory in continuous logic. The main ingredients are Grothendieck's double-limit characterization of relatively weakly compact sets in spaces of continuous functions, along with results of Ellis and Nerurkar on the topological dynamics of weakly almost periodic flows.</description>

      <title>Axiomatization of Compact Initial Value Problems: Open Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article proves the completeness of an axiomatization for initial value problems (IVPs) with compact initial conditions and compact time horizons for bounded open safety, open liveness and existence properties. Completeness systematically reduces the proofs of these properties to a complete axiomatization for differential equation invariants. This result unifies symbolic logic and numerical analysis by a computable procedure that generates symbolic proofs with differential invariants for rigorous error bounds of numerical solutions to polynomial initial value problems. The procedure is modular and works for all polynomial IVPs with rational coefficients and initial conditions and symbolic parameters constrained to compact sets. Furthermore, this paper discusses generalizations to IVPs with initial conditions/symbolic parameters that are not necessarily constrained to compact sets, achieved through the derivation of fully symbolic axioms/proof-rules based on the axiomatization.</description>

Abstract: In this memoir, we seek to construct a dynamical theory as complete as possible to describe the algebraic properties of the field of real numbers in constructive mathematics without axiom of dependent choice. We propose a theory which turns out to be very close to the theory of real closed local rings in classical mathematics. The theory of real closed rings is presented here in constructive form as a natural purely equational theory, which uses virtual root functions introduced in previous work. This work is also a first step through an essential goal for the future, which is to obtain a constructive version of o-minimal structures.</description>

      <title>Geometric theories for real number algebra without sign test or dependent choice axiom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10290v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this memoir, we seek to construct a constructive theory that is as complete as possible to describe the algebraic properties of the real number field in constructive mathematics without a dependent choice axiom. To this purpose, we use a dynamical version of geometric theories. We obtain a nice description of the algebraic properties of the real number field, but also a first outline for a constructive theory of certain o-minimal structures. The memoir we present here is an unfinished development of the article by the authors https://inria.hal.science/hal-01426164. Compared to that paper, however, we have modified the definition of continuous semialgebraic functions, in the same spirit in which Bishop defines a continuous real function as a uniformly continuous function on any bounded interval. Despite its unfinished nature and the many questions that we do not currently know how to answer, we hope that this paper will arouse interest for its original approach to the subject. This paper is an English translation of a French version on arXiv:2406.15218</description>

      <title>Irregular triads in 3-uniform hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.01737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.01737v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Over the past several years, numerous authors have explored model theoretically motivated combinatorial conditions that ensure that a graph has an efficient regular decomposition in the sense of Szemer\'edi. In this paper we set out a research program that explores a corresponding set of questions for 3-uniform hypergraphs, a setting in which useful notions of regularity are significantly more intricate.
  The main results in this paper concern certain combinatorial properties which arose as natural higher-order generalizations of the order property in parallel work of the authors in the arithmetic setting. Interpreted in the context of 3-uniform hypergraphs, these are tightly connected to the nature of irregular triads. Specifically, we show that a hereditary property of 3-uniform hypergraphs admits regular decompositions with so-called "linear error" if and only if it does not have the functional order property.
  Along the way, we show that a hereditary property of 3-uniform hypergraphs is homogeneous (i.e. all regular triads have density near $0$ or near $1$) if and only it has bounded $\textrm{VC}_2$-dimension. This provides a quantitative version of a recent result of Chernikov and Towsner.
  We also address several questions arising from prior work on tame regularity in hypergraphs. In particular, we characterize the hereditary properties of $3$-uniform hypergraphs admitting the type of regular partitions appearing in work of Fox et al. as those that have finite weak VC-dimension. This is again analogous to a recent non-quantitative result of Chernikov and Towsner.</description>
