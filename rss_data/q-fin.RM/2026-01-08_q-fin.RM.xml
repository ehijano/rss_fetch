      <title>Class of topological portfolios: Are they better than classical portfolios?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological Data Analysis (TDA), an emerging field in investment sciences, harnesses mathematical methods to extract data features based on shape, offering a promising alternative to classical portfolio selection methodologies. We utilize persistence landscapes, a type of summary statistics for persistent homology, to capture the topological variation of returns, blossoming a novel concept of ``Topological Risk". Our proposed topological risk then quantifies portfolio risk by tracking time-varying topological properties of assets through the $L_p$ norm of the persistence landscape. Through optimization, we derive an optimal portfolio that minimizes this topological risk. Numerical experiments conducted using nearly a decade long S\&amp;P 500 data demonstrate the superior performance of our TDA-based portfolios in comparison to the seven popular portfolio optimization models and two benchmark portfolio strategies, the naive $1/N$ portfolio and the S\&amp;P 500 market index, in terms of excess mean return, and several financial ratios. The outcome remains consistent through out the computational analysis conducted for the varying size of holding and investment time horizon. These results underscore the potential of our TDA-based topological risk metric in providing a more comprehensive understanding of portfolio dynamics than traditional statistical measures. As such, it holds significant relevance for modern portfolio management practices.</description>

      <title>Lambda Expected Shortfall</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23139v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Lambda Value-at-Risk (Lambda-VaR) is a generalization of the Value-at-Risk (VaR), which has been actively studied in quantitative finance. Over the past two decades, the Expected Shortfall (ES) has become one of the most important risk measures alongside VaR because of its various desirable properties in the practice of optimization, risk management, and financial regulation. Analogously to the intimate relation between ES and VaR, we introduce the Lambda Expected Shortfall (Lambda-ES), as a generalization of ES and a counterpart to Lambda-VaR. Our definition of Lambda-ES has an explicit formula and many convenient properties, and we show that it is the smallest quasi-convex and law-invariant risk measure dominating Lambda-VaR under mild assumptions. We examine further properties of Lambda-ES, its dual representation, and related optimization problems.</description>
