      <title>On the rate of convergence of estimating the Hurst parameter of rough stochastic volatility models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In [8], easily computable scale-invariant estimator $\widehat{\mathscr{R}}^s_n$ was constructed to estimate the Hurst parameter of the drifted fractional Brownian motion $X$ from its antiderivative. This paper extends this convergence result by proving that $\widehat{\mathscr{R}}^s_n$ also consistently estimates the Hurst parameter when applied to the antiderivative of $g \circ X$ for a general nonlinear function $g$. We also establish an almost sure rate of convergence in this general setting. Our result applies, in particular, to the estimation of the Hurst parameter of a wide class of rough stochastic volatility models from discrete observations of the integrated variance, including the fractional stochastic volatility model.</description>

      <title>On the implied volatility of Inverse options under stochastic volatility models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00539v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study short-time behavior of the at-the-money implied volatility for Inverse European options with fixed strike price. The asset price is assumed to follow a general stochastic volatility process. Using techniques of the Malliavin calculus such as the anticipating It^o's formula we first compute the level of the implied volatility of the option when the maturity converges to zero. Then, we find a short maturity asymptotic formula for the skew of the implied volatility that depends on the roughness of the volatility model. We also show that our results extend easily to Quanto-Inverse options. We apply our general results to the SABR and fractional Bergomi models, and provide some numerical simulations that confirm the accurateness of the asymptotic formula for the skew. Finally, we provide an empirical application using Bitcoin options traded on Debirit to show how our theoretical formulas can be used to model real market data of such options.</description>

      <title>Multi-asset return risk measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08763v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the recently introduced concept of return risk measures (RRMs) and extend it by incorporating risk management via multiple so-called eligible assets. The resulting new class of risk measures, termed multi-asset return risk measures (MARRMs), introduces a novel economic model for multiplicative risk sharing. We analyze properties of these risk measures. In particular, we prove that a positively homogeneous MARRM is quasi-convex if and only if it is convex. Furthermore, we provide conditions to avoid inconsistent risk evaluations. Then, we point out the connection between MARRMs and the well-known concept of multi-asset risk measures (MARMs). This is used to obtain various dual representations of MARRMs. Moreover, we conduct a series of case studies, in which we use typical continuous-time financial markets and different notions of acceptability of losses to compare RRMs, MARMs, and MARRMs and draw conclusions about the cost of risk mitigation.</description>

      <title>The Support and Resistance Line Method: An Analysis via Optimal Stopping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.02331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2103.02331v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a mathematical model motivated by the support/resistance line method in technical analysis where the underlying stock price transitions between three states of nature in a path-dependent manner. For optimal stopping problems with respect to a general class of reward functions and dynamics, using probabilistic methods, we show that the value function is $C^1$ (with respect to the corresponding scale function) and solves a general free boundary problem. Moreover, for a range of utilities, we prove that the best times to buy and sell the stock are obtained by solving free boundary problems corresponding to two linked optimal stopping problems. We use this to compute optimal trading strategies for several types of dynamics and varying degrees of relative risk aversion.</description>
