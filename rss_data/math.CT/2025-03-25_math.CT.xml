      <title>Effectivity of Generalized Double $\infty$-Categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct an adjunction between $m$-categories internal to $(\infty,n)$-categories, called $(n,m)$-double $\infty$-categories, and filtrations $A_0\to \dots\to A_m$ where for all $i&lt;m$, $A_i$ is a $(n+i)$-category. We show that this adjunction induces an equivalence between $(n,m)$-double $\infty$-categories admitting enough companions and filtrations such that each morphism $A_i\to A_{i+1}$ is essentially surjective on cells of dimension lower than or equal to $i$.
  This result can be seen as a $(\infty,n)$-categorical generalization of the equivalence between internal groupoids and effective epimorphisms in the category of $\infty$-groupoids proven by Rezk and Lurie.
  In the case $n=0$, this recovers the characterization of flagged $m$-categories given by Ayala-Francis, and in the case $n=1$, it allows us to prove some conjectures concerning the square functor and its variants, stated by Gaitsgory-Rozenblyum in the appendix of their book on Derived Algebraic Geometry.</description>

      <title>Plus constructions, plethysm, and unique factorization categories with applications to graphs and operad-like theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.06121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.06121v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Baez-Dolan type plus constructions serve three main purposes:
  They (1) corepresent categorical bimodules that are monoids with respect to a plethysm product, (2) allow to define functors as bimodule monoids, and thereby algebras over functors, (3) provide a theory of twists of monads. Unital (monoidal) bimodule monoids yield (monoidal) categories and the corepresentation is for indexed enrichments of categories. The original Baez--Dolan construction constructed algebras over operads. We define several of these constructions in the general context of categories and (symmetric) monoidal categories, show that they are functorial, and prove their corepresentation properties. One application is that the structures corepresented by an FC, like operads, props, etc. can be defined as plethysm monoids if and only if the corepresenting FC is a plus construction. In one direction, we prove that such a plus construction is based on the new notion of {Unique Factorization Category} (UFC). We also prove that the resulting FC has special properties, like being cubical. This explains why there is no monoid formulation for cyclic or modular operads or props, but there is for operads and properads. Using the bimodule monoids point of view, we prove that as monoidal bimodule monoids FCs are characterized by the fact that the functor constructing free algebras preserves the property of being strongly monoidal. We give a local presentation, as well as a global description, and a graphical version using decorated groupoid colored graphs. The global presentation utilizes pasting diagrams from 2-categories or equivalently double categories. In the special case of a UFC, we also present a graphical formalism with groupoid colored graphs. This allows us to identify our plus constructions as the step-by-step generalization of the Baez-Dolan plus constructions.</description>

      <title>Towards a Unified Theory of Time-Varying Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00206v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: What is a time-varying graph, a time-varying topological space, or, more generally, a mathematical structure that evolves over time? In this work, we lay the foundations for a general theory of temporal data by introducing categories of narratives. These are sheaves on posets of time intervals that encode snapshots of a temporal object along with the relationships between them. This theory satisfies five desiderata distilled from the burgeoning field of time-varying graphs: (D1) it defines both time-varying objects and their morphisms; (D2) it distinguishes between cumulative and persistent interpretations and provides principled methods for transitioning between them; (D3) it systematically lifts static notions to their temporal analogues; (D4) it is object agnostic; (D5) it integrates with theories of dynamical systems. To achieve this, we build upon existing categorical and sheaf-theoretic approaches to temporal graph theory, generalizing them to any category with limits and colimits. We also formalize tacit intuitions that, while present, often remain implicit in temporal graph theory. Beyond synthesizing and reformulating existing ideas in categorical language, we introduce sheaf-theoretic constructions and prove results that, to our knowledge, have not appeared in the temporal data literature - such as the adjunction between persistent and cumulative narratives. More importantly, we integrate these existing and novel elements into a consistent and coherent framework, setting the stage for a unified theory of time-varying data.</description>

      <title>Lawvere's fourth open problem: Levels in the topos of symmetric simplicial sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03439v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the topos of simplicial sets, it makes sense to ask the following question about a given natural number $n$: what is the minimum value $m$ such that $n$-skeletality implies $m$-coskeletality? This is an instance of the Aufhebung relation in the sense of Lawvere, who introduced this notion for an arbitrary Grothendieck topos $\mathcal{E}$ in place of $\mathbf{sSet}$, and levels/essential subtopoi in place of dimensions.
  We compute this Aufhebung relation for the topos of symmetric simplicial sets. In particular, we show that it is given by $2l-1$ for the level labelled by $l\geq 3$, which coincides with the previously known case of simplicial sets. This result provides a solution to the fourth of the seven open problems in topos theory posed by Lawvere in 2009.</description>

      <title>Univalent Enriched Categories and the Enriched Rezk Completion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11752v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Enriched categories are categories whose sets of morphisms are enriched with extra structure. Such categories play a prominent role in the study of higher categories, homotopy theory, and the semantics of programming languages. In this paper, we study univalent enriched categories. We prove that all essentially surjective and fully faithful functors between univalent enriched categories are equivalences, and we show that every enriched category admits a Rezk completion. Finally, we use the Rezk completion for enriched categories to construct univalent enriched Kleisli categories.</description>
