      <title>Regularization methods for solving hierarchical variational inequalities with complexity guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider hierarchical variational inequality problems, or more generally, variational inequalities defined over the set of zeros of a monotone operator. This framework includes convex optimization over equilibrium constraints and equilibrium selection problems. In a real Hilbert space setting, we combine a Tikhonov regularization and a proximal penalization to develop a flexible double-loop method for which we prove asymptotic convergence and provide rate statements in terms of gap functions. Our method is flexible, and effectively accommodates a large class of structured operator splitting formulations for which fixed-point encodings are available. Finally, we validate our findings numerically on various examples.</description>

      <title>Extragradient methods with complexity guarantees for hierarchical variational inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the framework of a real Hilbert space we consider the problem of approaching solutions to a class of hierarchical variational inequality problems, subsuming several other problem classes including certain mathematical programs under equilibrium constraints, constrained min-max problems, hierarchical game problems, optimal control under VI constraints, and simple bilevel optimization problems. For this general problem formulation, we establish rates of convergence in terms of suitably constructed gap functions, measuring feasibility gaps and optimality gaps. We present worst-case iteration complexity results on both levels of the variational problem, as well as weak convergence under a geometric weak sharpness condition on the lower level solution set. Our results match and improve the state of the art in terms of their iteration complexity and the generality of the problem formulation.</description>

      <title>Model-free stochastic linear quadratic control for discrete-time systems with multiplicative and additive noises via semidefinite programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates a model-free solution to the stochastic linear quadratic regulation (LQR) problem for linear discrete-time systems with both multiplicative and additive noises. We formulate the stochastic LQR problem as a nonconvex optimization problem and rigorously analyze its dual problem structure. By exploiting the inherent convexity of the dual problem and analyzing Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions with respect to optimality in convex optimization, we establish an explicit relationship between the optimal point of the dual problem and the parameters of the associated Q-function. This theoretical insight, combined with the technique of the matrix direct sum, makes it possible to develop a novel model-free sample-efficient, non-iterative semidefinite programming algorithm that directly estimates optimal control gain without requiring an initial stabilizing controller, or noises measurability. The robustness of the model-free SDP method to errors is investigated. Our approach provides a new optimization-theoretic framework for understanding Q-learning algorithms while advancing the theoretical foundations of reinforcement learning in stochastic optimal control. Numerical validation on a pulse-width modulated inverter system demonstrates the algorithm's effectiveness, particularly in achieving a single-step non-iterative solution without hyper-parameter tuning.</description>

      <title>Energy-Gain Control of Time-Varying Systems: Receding Horizon Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Standard formulations of prescribed worstcase disturbance energy-gain control policies for linear time-varying systems depend on all forward model data. In a discrete-time setting, this dependence arises through a backward Riccati recursion. The aim herein is to consider the infinite-horizon $\ell_2$ gain performance of state feedback policies with only finite receding-horizon preview of the model parameters. The proposed synthesis of controllers subject to such a constraint leverages the strict contraction of lifted Riccati operators under uniform controllability and observability. The main approximation result establishes a sufficient number of preview steps for the performance loss to remain below any set tolerance, relative to the baseline gain bound of the associated infinite-preview controller. Aspects of the main result are explored in the context of a numerical example.</description>

      <title>Identification with Orthogonal Basis Functions: Convergence Speed, Asymptotic Bias, and Rate-Optimal Pole Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with performance analysis and pole selection problem in identifying linear time-invariant (LTI) systems using orthogonal basis functions (OBFs), a system identification approach that consists of solving least-squares problems and selecting poles within the OBFs. Specifically, we analyze the convergence properties and asymptotic bias of the OBF algorithm, and propose a pole selection algorithm that robustly minimizes the worst-case identification bias, with the bias measured under the $\mathcal{H}_2$ error criterion. Our results include an analytical expression for the convergence rate and an explicit bound on the asymptotic identification bias, which depends on both the true system poles and the preselected model poles. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the pole selection algorithm is asymptotically optimal, achieving the fundamental lower bound on the identification bias. The algorithm explicitly determines the model poles as the so-called Tsuji points, and the asymptotic identification bias decreases exponentially with the number of basis functions, with the rate of decrease governed by the hyperbolic Chebyshev constant. Numerical experiments validate the derived bounds and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed pole selection algorithm.</description>

      <title>$\mathcal{K}$-Lorentzian Polynomials, Semipositive Cones, and Cone-Stable EVI Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lorentzian and completely log-concave polynomials have recently emerged as a unifying framework for negative dependence, log-concavity, and convexity in combinatorics and probability. We extend this theory to variational analysis and cone-constrained dynamics by studying $K$-Lorentzian and $K$-completely log-concave polynomials over a proper convex cone $K\subset\mathbb{R}^n$. For a $K$-Lorentzian form $f$ and $v\in\operatorname{int}K$, we define an open cone $K^\circ(f,v)$ and a closed cone $K(f,v)$ via directional derivatives along $v$, recovering the usual hyperbolicity cone when $f$ is hyperbolic. We prove that $K^\circ(f,v)$ is a proper cone and equals $\operatorname{int}K(f,v)$. If $f$ is $K(f,v)$-Lorentzian, then $K(f,v)$ is convex and maximal among convex cones on which $f$ is Lorentzian.
  Using the Rayleigh matrix $M_f(x)=\nabla f(x)\nabla f(x)^T - f(x)\nabla^2 f(x)$, we obtain cone-restricted Rayleigh inequalities and show that two-direction Rayleigh inequalities on $K$ are equivalent to an acuteness condition for the bilinear form $v^T M_f(x) w$. This yields a cone-restricted negative-dependence interpretation linking the curvature of $\log f$ to covariance properties of associated Gibbs measures. For determinantal generating polynomials, we identify the intersection of the hyperbolicity cone with the nonnegative orthant as the classical semipositive cone, and we extend this construction to general proper cones via $K$-semipositive cones. Finally, for linear evolution variational inequality (LEVI) systems, we show that if $q(x)=x^T A x$ is (strictly) $K$-Lorentzian, then $A$ is (strictly) $K$-copositive and yields Lyapunov (semi-)stability on $K$, giving new Lyapunov criteria for cone-constrained dynamics.</description>

      <title>The Dynamical Anatomy of Anderson Acceleration:From Adaptive Momentum to Variable-Mass ODEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper provides a rigorous derivation and analysis of accelerated optimization algorithms through the lens of High-Resolution Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs). While classical Nesterov acceleration is well-understood via asymptotic vanishing damping, the dynamics of Anderson Acceleration (AA) remain less transparent. This work makes significant theoretical contributions to AA by bridging discrete acceleration algorithms with continuous dynamical systems, while also providing practical algorithmic innovations. Our work addresses fundamental questions about the physical nature of Anderson Acceleration that have remained unanswered since its introduction in 1965. Firstly, we prove that AA can be exactly rewritten as an adaptive momentum method and, in the high-resolution limit, converges to a second-order ODE with Variable Effective Mass. Through a Lyapunov energy analysis, we reveal the specific instability mechanism of standard AA: unchecked growth in effective mass acts as negative damping, physically injecting energy into the system and violating dissipation constraints. Conversely, high-resolution analysis identifies an implicit Hessian-driven damping term that provides stabilization in stiff regimes. Leveraging these dynamical insights, we then propose Energy-Guarded Anderson Acceleration (EG-AA), an algorithm that acts as an inertial governor to enforce thermodynamic consistency. Morevoer, our convergence analysis, formulated via the Acceleration Gain Factor, proves that EG-AA improves upon gradient descent by maximizing the geometric contraction of the linear subspace projection while actively suppressing nonlinear approximation errors. Theoretical bounds confirm that EG-AA is no worse than standard AA, and numerical experiments demonstrate strictly improved convergence stability and rates in ill-conditioned convex composite problems compared to standard Anderson mixing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.21275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a class of semilinear impulsive differential inclusions with infinite delay in Banach spaces. The model incorporates multivalued nonlinearities, impulsive effects, and infinite memory, allowing for the description of systems influenced by long-lasting past states and sudden changes. We prove the existence of mild solutions and the compactness of the solution set using fixed point methods and measures of noncompactness. The theoretical results are applied to an abstract optimization problem and to a population dynamics model.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Inspired Multi Agent Reinforcement Learning for Exploration Exploitation Optimization in UAV-Assisted 6G Network Deployment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study introduces a quantum inspired framework for optimizing the exploration exploitation tradeoff in multiagent reinforcement learning, applied to UAVassisted 6G network deployment. We consider a cooperative scenario where ten intelligent UAVs autonomously coordinate to maximize signal coverage and support efficient network expansion under partial observability and dynamic conditions. The proposed approach integrates classical MARL algorithms with quantum-inspired optimization techniques, leveraging variational quantum circuits VQCs as the core structure and employing the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm QAOA as a representative VQC based method for combinatorial optimization. Complementary probabilistic modeling is incorporated through Bayesian inference, Gaussian processes, and variational inference to capture latent environmental dynamics. A centralized training with decentralized execution CTDE paradigm is adopted, where shared memory and local view grids enhance local observability among agents. Comprehensive experiments including scalability tests, sensitivity analysis, and comparisons with PPO and DDPG baselines demonstrate that the proposed framework improves sample efficiency, accelerates convergence, and enhances coverage performance while maintaining robustness. Radar chart and convergence analyses further show that QI MARL achieves a superior balance between exploration and exploitation compared to classical methods. All implementation code and supplementary materials are publicly available on GitHub to ensure reproducibility.</description>

      <title>Fast and Exact Least Absolute Deviations Line Fitting via Piecewise Affine Lower-Bounding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Least-absolute-deviations (LAD) line fitting is robust to outliers but computationally more involved than least squares regression. Although the literature includes linear and near-linear time algorithms for the LAD line fitting problem, these methods are difficult to implement and, to our knowledge, lack maintained public implementations. As a result, practitioners often resort to linear programming (LP) based methods such as the simplex-based Barrodale-Roberts method and interior-point methods, or on iteratively reweighted least squares (IRLS) approximation which does not guarantee exact solutions. To close this gap, we propose the Piecewise Affine Lower-Bounding (PALB) method, an exact algorithm for LAD line fitting. PALB uses supporting lines derived from subgradients to build piecewise-affine lower bounds, and employs a subdivision scheme involving minima of these lower bounds. We prove correctness and provide bounds on the number of iterations. On synthetic datasets with varied signal types and noise including heavy-tailed outliers as well as a real dataset from the NOAA's Integrated Surface Database, PALB exhibits empirical log-linear scaling. It is consistently faster than publicly available implementations of LP based and IRLS based solvers. We provide a reference implementation written in Rust with a Python API.</description>

      <title>Fixed-time control with prescribed performance for path following of underwater gliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Underwater gliders are increasingly deployed in challenging missions - such as hurricane-season observations and long-endurance environmental monitoring - where strong currents and turbulence pose significant risks to navigation safety. To address these practical challenges, this paper presents a fixed-time prescribed performance control scheme for the 3D path following of underwater gliders subject to model uncertainties and environmental disturbances. The primary contribution is the integration of a finite-time performance function within a fixed-time control framework. This synthesis ensures that the tracking errors are constrained within prescribed performance bounds and converge to a compact set within a fixed time, independent of initial conditions. A second key contribution is the development of a fixed-time sliding mode disturbance observer that provides accurate finite-time estimation of lumped disturbances, enhancing the system's robustness. Integrated with an iLOS guidance law, the proposed controller enables precise and safe waypoint following. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms conventional sliding mode and prescribed performance controllers in tracking accuracy, convergence speed, and control effort smoothness, validating its efficacy for robust underwater navigation.</description>

      <title>Optimal Algorithms for Nonlinear Estimation with Convex Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A linear functional of an object from a convex symmetric set can be optimally estimated, in a worst-case sense, by a linear functional of observations made on the object. This well-known fact is extended here to a nonlinear setting: other simple functionals of the object can be optimally estimated by functionals of the observations that share a similar simple structure. This is established for the maximum of several linear functionals and even for the $\ell$th largest among them. Proving the latter requires an unusual refinement of the analytical Hahn--Banach theorem. The existence results are accompanied by practical recipes relying on convex optimization to construct the desired functionals, thereby justifying the term of estimation algorithms.</description>

      <title>Equilibrium investment under dynamic preference uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a continuous-time portfolio choice problem for an investor whose state-dependent preferences are determined by an exogenous factor that evolves as an It\^o diffusion process. Since risk attitudes at the end of the investment horizon are uncertain, terminal wealth is evaluated under a set of utility functions corresponding to all possible future preference states. These utilities are first converted into certainty equivalents at their respective levels of terminal risk aversion and then (nonlinearly) aggregated over the conditional distribution of future states, yielding an inherently time-inconsistent optimization criterion. We approach this problem by developing a general equilibrium framework for such state-dependent preferences and characterizing subgame-perfect equilibrium investment policies through an extended Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman system. This system gives rise to a coupled nonlinear partial integro-differential equation for the value functions associated with each state. We then specialize the model to a tractable constant relative risk aversion specification in which the preference factor follows an arithmetic Brownian motion. In this setting, the equilibrium policy admits a semi-explicit representation that decomposes into a standard myopic demand and a novel preference-hedging component that captures incentives to hedge against anticipated changes in risk aversion. Numerical experiments illustrate how features of the preference dynamics -- most notably the drift of the preference process and the correlation between preference shocks and asset returns -- jointly determine the sign and magnitude of the hedging demand and the evolution of the equilibrium risky investment over time.</description>

      <title>Analytic and Variational Stability of Deep Learning Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a unified analytic and variational framework for studying stability in deep learning systems viewed as coupled representation-parameter dynamics. The central object is the Learning Stability Profile, which tracks the infinitesimal response of representations, parameters, and update mechanisms to perturbations along the learning trajectory. We prove a Fundamental Analytic Stability Theorem showing that uniform boundedness of these stability signatures is equivalent, up to norm equivalence, to the existence of a Lyapunov-type energy that dissipates along the learning flow. In smooth regimes, the framework yields explicit stability exponents linking spectral norms, activation regularity, step sizes, and learning rates to contractivity of the learning dynamics. Classical spectral stability results for feedforward networks, a discrete CFL-type condition for residual architectures, and parametric and temporal stability laws for stochastic gradient methods arise as direct consequences. The theory extends to non-smooth learning systems, including ReLU networks, proximal and projected updates, and stochastic subgradient flows, by replacing classical derivatives with Clarke generalized derivatives and smooth energies with variational Lyapunov functionals. The resulting framework provides a unified dynamical description of stability across architectures and optimization methods, clarifying how architectural and algorithmic choices jointly govern robustness and sensitivity to perturbations. It also provides a foundation for further extensions to continuous-time limits and geometric formulations of learning dynamics.</description>

In our formulation, the classical relative entropy penalty is replaced by a general convex divergence, and terminal constraints are imposed in a weak sense. We establish well-posedness and a convex dual formulation of the problem, together with explicit structural characterizations of primal and dual optimizers. Specifically, the optimal path measure is shown to admit an explicit density relative to a reference diffusion, generalizing the classical Schr\"odinger system. For the pure Schr\"odinger case, i.e., when the transport cost is zero, we further characterize the flow of time marginals of the optimal bridge, recovering known results in the entropic setting and providing new descriptions for non-entropic divergences including the chi-divergence.</description>

Abstract: We develop a mathematical model for sailboat navigation that can play the same role that the Black and Scholes model plays in mathematical finance: it captures essential features of sailboat navigation, it can provide insights that might not be available otherwise, and it is a source of interesting mathematical problems. In our model, the motion of the sailboat, which would travel at speed $v&gt;0$ in a constant wind, is the solution of a system of two stochastic differential equations driven by a Brownian motion on a circle with speed $\sigma &gt; 0$. We formulate two stochastic control problems, in which the objective is to reach a circular upwind target of radius $\eta \geq 0$ as quickly as possible. In the first problem, there is a tacking cost $c &gt; 0$, while in the second problem, we assume that $c=0$. We establish the viability of both models (assuming that $\eta &gt; 0$ in the second model), that is, their value functions are finite, and we obtain bounds on these value functions related to the parameters of the problem. The first problem falls into the class of impulse control problems, while the second one involves singular controls. In this second case, since the state equation for the optimally controlled motion has discontinuous coefficients and is driven by a degenerate diffusion, standard results on existence and uniqueness of strong solutions do not apply, and we provide a proof via the Yamada-Watanabe argument.</description>

      <title>A min-max reformulation and proximal algorithms for a class of structured nonsmooth fractional optimization problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02254v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a class of structured nonsmooth fractional minimization, where the first part of the objective is the ratio of a nonnegative nonsmooth nonconvex function to a nonnegative nonsmooth convex function, while the second part is the difference of a smooth nonconvex function and a nonsmooth convex function. This model problem has many important applications, for example, the scale-invariant sparse signal recovery in signal processing. However, the existing methods for fractional programs are not suitable for solving this problem due to its special structure. We first present a novel nonfractional min-max reformulation for the original fractional program and show the connections between their global (local) optimal solutions and stationary points. Based on the reformulation, we propose an alternating maximization proximal descent algorithm and show its subsequential convergence towards a critical point of the original fractional program under a mild assumption. Moreover, we prove that the proposed algorithm can find an $\epsilon$-critical point of the considered problem within $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-2})$ iterations. By further assuming the Kurdyka-{\L}ojasiewicz (KL) property of an auxiliary function, we also establish the convergence of the entire solution sequence generated by the proposed algorithm. Finally, some numerical experiments on the $L_1/L_2$ least squares problem and scale-invariant sparse signal recovery are conducted to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Linear Stability Analysis of a Constant Quaternion Difference Attitude Controller</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03222v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is quite often claimed, and correctly so, that linear methods cannot achieve global stability results for attitude control, and conversely that nonlinear control is essential in order to achieve (almost) globally stable tracking of general attitude trajectories. On account of this definitive result, and also because of the existence of powerful nonlinear control techniques, there has been relatively very little work analyzing the limits and performance of linear attitude control. It is the purpose of this paper to provide a characterization of the stability achievable for one class of linear attitude control problems, namely those leading to a constant quaternion difference. In this paper, we analytically derive a critical error angle below which linearized dynamics lead to natural marginal stability for such a system, and above which the system is unstable. The dynamics are then used to derive a locally stable linear attitude controller whose performance is validated using simulations.</description>

      <title>Don't Look Back in Anger: Wasserstein Distributionally Robust Optimization with Nonstationary Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18566v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study data-driven decision problems where historical observations are generated by a time-evolving distribution whose consecutive shifts are bounded in Wasserstein distance. We address this nonstationarity using a distributionally robust optimization model with an ambiguity set that is a Wasserstein ball centered at a weighted empirical distribution, thereby allowing for the time decay of past data in a way which accounts for the drift of the data-generating distribution. Our main technical contribution is a concentration bound for weighted empirical distributions that explicitly captures both the effective sample size (i.e., the equivalent number of equally weighted observations) and the distributional drift. Using our concentration bound, we select observation weights that optimally balance variance, determined by the effective sample size, and drift, induced by the temporal changes in the data-generating process. The family of optimal weightings reveals a polynomial relationship between the order of the Wasserstein ambiguity ball and the time-decay profile of the optimal weights. We further characterize how the ambiguity radius must grow with the distributional drift to guarantee a prescribed confidence level. Classical weighting schemes, such as time windowing and simple exponential smoothing, emerge as special cases of our framework, for which we derive principled choices of parameters. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Optimal Quantization on Spherical Surfaces: Continuous and Discrete Models -- A Beginner-Friendly Expository Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05099v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This expository paper provides a unified and pedagogical introduction to optimal quantization for probability measures supported on spherical curves and discrete subsets of the sphere, emphasizing both continuous and discrete settings. We first present a detailed geometric and analytical foundation for intrinsic quantization on the unit sphere, including definitions of great and small circles, spherical triangles, geodesic distance, Slerp interpolation, the Frechet mean, spherical Voronoi regions, centroid conditions, and quantization dimensions. Building upon this framework, we develop explicit continuous and discrete quantization models on spherical curves, namely great circles, small circles, and great circular arcs supported by rigorous derivations and pedagogical exposition. For uniform continuous distributions, we compute optimal sets of $n$-means and the associated quantization errors on these curves; for discrete distributions, we analyze antipodal, equatorial, tetrahedral, and finite uniform configurations, illustrating convergence to the continuous model. The central conclusion is that for a uniform probability distribution supported on a one-dimensional geodesic subset of total length $L$, the optimal $n$-means form a uniform partition and the quantization error satisfies $V_n = L^2/(12n^2)$. The exposition emphasizes geometric intuition, detailed derivations, and clear step-by-step reasoning, making it accessible to beginning graduate students and researchers entering the study of quantization on manifolds. This article is intended as an expository and tutorial contribution, with the main emphasis on geometric reformulation and pedagogical clarity of intrinsic quantization on spherical curves, rather than on the development of new asymptotic quantization theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.10498v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a new framework for branched transport between probability measures which are allowed to vary in time. This framework can be used to model problems where the underlying transportation network displays a branched structure, but the source and target mass distributions can change cyclically over time, such as road networks or circulatory systems. We introduce the notion of time-dependent transport paths along with associated energies and distances, and prove existence of transport paths whose energy achieves the distance. We also show the time-dependent transport yields a metric structure on subsets of appropriately defined measure-valued Sobolev spaces.</description>

      <title>A note on Johnson's rule for minimizing makespan in the Two-Machine Flow Shop scheduling problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06119v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider Johnson's rule for minimizing the makespan in the two-machine flow shop scheduling problem. Although the worst-case complexity of Johnson's rule is O(n log n), due to the requirement of fully sorting the jobs, we show that it is possible to detect in O(n) time whether a complete sort can be avoided, and an optimal solution can be computed in linear time. For uniformly distributed processing times, a probabilistic analysis shows that linear-time complexity is achieved with probability at least 0.999 for instances of size n=100 and at least 0.999999999 for instances of size n=200. Computational experiments further indicate that linear-time complexity is consistently observed in practice on standard benchmark instances with uniformly distributed processing times, as well as on instances generated according to other widely used distributions.</description>

      <title>Distributed Online Economic Dispatch with Time-Varying Coupled Inequality Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16241v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the distributed online economic dispatch problem for power systems with time-varying coupled inequality constraints. The problem is formulated as a distributed online optimization problem in a multi-agent system. At each time step, each agent only observes its own instantaneous objective function and local inequality constraints; agents make decisions online and cooperate to minimize the sum of the time-varying objectives while satisfying the global coupled constraints. To solve the problem, we propose an algorithm based on the primal-dual approach combined with constraint-tracking. Under appropriate assumptions that the objective and constraint functions are convex, their gradients are uniformly bounded, and the path length of the optimal solution sequence grows sublinearly, we analyze theoretical properties of the proposed algorithm and prove that both the dynamic regret and the constraint violation are sublinear with time horizon T. Finally, we evaluate the proposed algorithm on a time-varying economic dispatch problem in power systems using both synthetic data and Australian Energy Market data. The results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm performs effectively in terms of tracking performance, constraint satisfaction, and adaptation to time-varying disturbances, thereby providing a practical and theoretically well-supported solution for real-time distributed economic dispatch.</description>

      <title>An alternative approach to well-posedness of McKean-Vlasov equations arising in Consensus-Based Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19446v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we study the mean-field description of Consensus-Based Optimization (CBO), a derivative-free particle optimization method. Such a description is provided by a non-local SDE of McKean-Vlasov type, whose fields lack of global Lipschitz continuity. We propose a novel approach to prove the well-posedness of the mean-field CBO equation based on a truncation argument. The latter is performed through the introduction of a cut-off function, defined on the space of probability measures, acting on the fields. This procedure allows us to study the well-posedness problem in the classical framework of Sznitman. Through this argument, we recover the established result on the existence of strong solutions, and we extend the class of solutions for which pathwise uniqueness holds.</description>

      <title>Nonholonomic Robot Parking by Feedback -- Part I: Modular Strict CLF Designs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.15119v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has been known in the robotics literature since about 1995 that, in polar coordinates, the nonholonomic unicycle is asymptotically stabilizable by smooth feedback, even globally. We introduce a modular design framework that selects the forward velocity to decouple the radial coordinate, allowing the steering subsystem to be stabilized independently. Within this structure, we develop families of feedback laws using passivity, backstepping, and integrator forwarding. Each law is accompanied by a strict control Lyapunov function, including barrier variants that enforce angular constraints. These strict CLFs provide constructive class KL convergence estimates and enable eigenvalue assignment at the target equilibrium. The framework generalizes and extends prior modular and nonmodular approaches, while preparing the ground for inverse optimal and adaptive redesigns in the sequel paper.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.15219v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For the unicycle system, we provide constructive methods for the design of feedback laws that have one or more of the following properties: being nonmodular and globally exponentially stabilizing, inverse optimal, robust to arbitrary decrease or increase of input coefficients, adaptive, prescribed/fixed-time stabilizing, and safe (ensuring the satisfaction of state constraints). Our nonmodular backstepping feedbacks are implementable with either unidirectional or bidirectional velocity actuation. Thanks to constructing families of strict CLFs for the unicycle, we introduce a general design framework and families of feedback laws for the unicycle, which are inverse optimal with respect to meaningful costs. These inverse optimal feedback laws are endowed with robustness to actuator uncertainty and arbitrarily low input saturation due to the unicycle's driftlessness. Besides ensuring robustness to unknown input coefficients, we also develop adaptive laws for these unknown coefficients, enabling the achievement of good transient performance with lower initial control effort. Additionally, we develop controllers that achieve stabilization within a user-specified time horizon using two systematic methods: time-dilated prescribed-time design with smooth-in-time convergence to zero of both the states and the inputs and homogeneity-based fixed-time control that provides an explicit bound on the settling time. Finally, with a nonovershooting design we guarantee strictly forward motion without curb violation. This article, along with its Part I, lays a broad constructive design foundation for stabilization of the nonholonomic unicycle.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.12878v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the influence of base states on the consistency of the dual variational formulation for quadratic systems of PDEs, which are not necessarily conservative (typical examples include the noise-free Nash system with a quadratic Hamiltonian and multiple players). We identify a sufficient condition under which consistency holds over large time intervals. In particular, in the single-player case, there exists a sequence of base states (each exhibiting full consistency) that converges in mean to zero. We also prove existence of variational dual solutions to the noise-free Nash system for arbitrary base states. Furthermore, we propose a scheme based on Hilbertian gradient flows that, starting from an arbitrary base state, generates a sequence of new base states that is expected to converge to a solution of the original PDE.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.13868v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a Safe Online Control-Informed Learning framework for safety-critical autonomous systems. The framework unifies optimal control, parameter estimation, and safety constraints into an online learning process. It employs an extended Kalman filter to incrementally update system parameters in real time, enabling robust and data-efficient adaptation under uncertainty. A softplus barrier function enforces constraint satisfaction during learning and control while eliminating the dependence on high-quality initial guesses. Theoretical analysis establishes convergence and safety guarantees, and the framework's effectiveness is demonstrated on cart-pole and robot-arm systems.</description>
