      <title>Observational Properties of Harmonic EMIC waves: Statistical Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electromagnetic ion cyclotron (EMIC) waves are discrete electromagnetic emissions separated by multiple ion gyrofrequencies. Harmonic EMIC waves are defined as waves with a strong electric or magnetic field (or both) at the harmonics of the fundamental EMIC mode. In this paper, for the first time, we present a statistical study on harmonic EMIC waves by the Van Allen Probes. The EMIC waves are categorized into three types based on their harmonics: (1) fundamental mode only (without higher harmonics), (2) electrostatic (ES) harmonics, and (3) electromagnetic (EM) harmonics. Our statistical study shows that ES and EM harmonic EMIC waves predominantly occur on the dayside, outside the plasmasphere with $L &gt;5$ and are associated with a low $f_{pe}/f_{ce}$, a high proton $\beta_H$, and a strong fundamental EMIC mode. The results will advance our understanding of harmonic EMIC waves and their generation mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Propagation of untwisting solar jets from the low-beta corona into the super-Alfv\'enic wind: Testing a solar origin scenario for switchbacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parker Solar Probe's (PSP) discovery of the prevalence of switchbacks (SBs), localised magnetic deflections in the nascent solar wind, has sparked interest in uncovering their origins. A prominent theory suggests these SBs originate in the lower corona through magnetic reconnection processes, closely linked to solar jet phenomena. Jets are impulsive events, observed across scales and solar atmosphere layers, associated with the release of magnetic twist and helicity. This study examines whether self-consistent jets can form and propagate into the super-Alfv\'enic wind, assesses the impact of distinct Parker solar wind profiles on jet dynamics, and determines if jet-induced magnetic untwisting waves display signatures typical of SBs. We employed parametric 3D numerical MHD simulations using the ARMS code to model the self-consistent generation of solar jets. Our study focuses on the propagation of solar jets in distinct atmospheric plasma $\beta$ and Alfv\'en velocity profiles, including a Parker solar wind. Our findings show that self-consistent coronal jets can form and propagate into the super-Alfv\'enic wind. Notable structures such as the leading Alfv\'enic wave and trailing dense-jet region were consistently observed across diverse plasma $\beta$ atmospheres. The jet propagation dynamics are significantly influenced by atmospheric variations, with changes in Alfv\'en velocity profiles affecting the group velocity and propagation ratio of the leading and trailing structures. U-loops, prevalent at jet onset, do not persist in the low-$\beta$ corona, but magnetic untwisting waves associated with jets show SB-like signatures. However, full-reversal SBs were not observed. These findings may explain the absence of full reversal SBs in the sub-Alfv\'enic wind and illustrate the propagation of magnetic deflections through jet-like events, shedding light on possible SB formation processes.</description>

      <title>Foreshock Ultra-Low Frequency Waves at Mars: Consequence on the Particle Acceleration Mechanisms at the Martian Bow Shock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09003v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN Magnetometer observations, we report the first statistical study of ultra-low frequency (ULF) waves at the Martian foreshock. The analyzed foreshock ULF wave events are observed in the 0.008-0.086 Hz frequency range, with nearly circular and elliptical left-handed polarization in the spacecraft reference frame. These waves are propagated quasi-parallel to the ambient magnetic field, with a moderate wave amplitude. All these properties are consistent with fast magnetosonic waves, most likely generated through the ion-ion right-hand resonant instability. In addition, our results suggest that the associated resonant backstreaming protons' velocities parallel to the mean magnetic field in the solar wind reference frame is $1.33 \pm 0.40$ times the solar wind velocity. The similarity between our results and previous reports at other foreshocks may indicate the presence of a common acceleration process acting in planetary bow shocks and that is responsible for this particular backstreaming population.</description>

      <title>Alfv\'en pulse at chromospheric footpoints of magnetic loops and generation of the super-Dreicer electric field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06463v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A self-similar solution of the linearised magnetohydrodynamic equations describing the propagation of the Alfv\'en pulse in an axially symmetric magnetic tube of variable diameter is obtained. The electric field component induced by the non-linear Alfv\'en wave and directed along the tube surface, i.e., accelerating particles along the magnetic field, is determined on the basis of the perturbation theory and specified to the case of a magnetic flux tube homogeneous over its cross section. For the chromospheric tubes, whose configuration is given by the barometric law of plasma pressure decrease, the conditions for achieving the super-Dreicer electric field limit necessary to drive the accelerated high-energy electrons into the coronal part of the loop are established.</description>
