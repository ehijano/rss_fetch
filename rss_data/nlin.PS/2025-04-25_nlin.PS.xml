      <title>The KP equation of plane elastodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17411v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The propagation of nonlinear and dispersive waves in various materials can be described by the well-known Kadomtsev-Petviashvili (KP) equation, which is a (2+1)-dimensional partial differential equation. In this paper, we show that the KP equation can be used to describe the in-plane motion of compressible elastic solids with dispersion. Furthermore, a modified KP equation with cubic nonlinearity is obtained in the case of incompressible solids with dispersion. Then, several solutions of these partial differential equations are discussed and computed using a Fourier spectral method. In particular, both equations admit solitary wave solutions.</description>

      <title>Fast and accurate modelling of Kerr-Brillouin combs in Fabry-Perot resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new mean-field equation for modeling Fabry-Perot resonators filled with a dispersive medium exhibiting both Brillouin and Kerr nonlinearities, e.g. an optical fiber. This model is derived from a unified framework that accounts for Brillouin scattering and four-wave mixing. It involves two coupled nonlinear Schrodinger equations for the forward and backward propagating fields, alongside a single equation governing the acoustic oscillation. Under standard assumptions for mean-field models -such as high finesse, weak nonlinearity, and weak dispersion- we demonstrate that our equation closely matches the original system. The simplified and elegant mathematical structure of our model provides valuable physical insights. As a key example, we derive an expression for the growth rate of harmonic perturbations of steady states. Additionally, our model facilitates fast and accurate numerical simulations using standard Fourier split-step methods. We highlight the effectiveness of this approach by simulating frequency comb generation in state-of-the-art high-Q fiber Fabry-Perot resonators.</description>

      <title>Unified view of scalar and vector dark matter solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05031v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The existence of solitons -- stable, long-lived, and localized field configurations -- is a generic prediction for ultralight dark matter. These solitons, known by various names such as boson stars, axion stars, oscillons, and Q-balls depending on the context, are typically treated as distinct entities in the literature. This study aims to provide a unified perspective on these solitonic objects for real or complex, scalar or vector dark matter, considering self-interactions and nonminimal gravitational interactions. We demonstrate that these solitons share universal nonrelativistic properties, such as conserved charges, mass-radius relations, stability and profiles. Without accounting for alternative interactions or relativistic effects, distinguishing between real and complex scalar dark matter is challenging. However, self-interactions differentiate real and complex vector dark matter due to their different dependencies on the macroscopic spin density of dark matter waves. Furthermore, gradient-dependent nonminimal gravitational interactions impose an upper bound on soliton amplitudes, influencing their mass distribution and phenomenology in the present-day universe.</description>
