      <title>Dependence of the Solar Wind Plasma Density on Moderate and Extremely High Geomagnetic Activity Elucidated by Potential Learning</title>

Abstract: The relationship between moderate and extremely high levels of geomagnetic activity, represented by the Kp index (2- - 5+ and 6- - 9), and solar wind conditions during southward IMF intervals was revealed utilizing a newly developed machine learning technique. Potential Learning (PL) is a neural network algorithm which learns with focusing the input parameter with the highest variance and can extract the most significant input parameter to the outputs, based on a computed value of "potentiality". It has poorly been understood from what stage of geomagnetic activity the solar wind density begins to control the Kp level. The IMF three components, solar wind flow speed, and plasma density obtained from the OMNI solar wind database, corresponding from solar cycle 23 to beginning of cycle 25, were used as the PL input parameters. PL selected the solar wind velocity as the most significant solar wind parameter for the moderate and extremely high Kp levels. The value of potentiality of solar wind density was, however, could not ignore an impact on geomagnetic activity. We statistically investigated the relation between solar wind speed and plasma density used as the PL input data under all Kp levels. At higher than the moderate Kp level, geomagnetic conditions become high even under slow solar wind velocity, if the plasma density is large, suggesting that not only solar wind velocity but also density might significantly contribute to geomagnetic activity. These PL and statistical investigations show that the solar wind density begins to regulate Kp higher than moderate geomagnetic activity level under southward IMF conditions. They also would greatly help not only understand general relationship between solar wind conditions and geomagnetic activity but also forecast geomagnetic activity under various IMF conditions.</description>
