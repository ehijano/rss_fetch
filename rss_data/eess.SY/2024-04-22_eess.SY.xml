      <title>The Development of a Microcontroller based Smoked Fish Machine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of a microcontroller-based smoked fish machine aims to combine and automate the boiling, smoking, and drying. The machine consists of an Arduino microcontroller, heater, spark gap igniter, stepper motor with motor driver, temperature sensor, exhaust fan, DC converter, relay module, power supply, and controller box. The main mechanism of the smoked fish machine is a stepper motor that automates the process. The PID is used to optimize the performance of controlling the machine's temperature. The machine used galvanized steel and food-grade material to support the heating of the fish, which helps minimize contamination and burns. The typical time of operation of the entire process using the proposed machine is up to 60 minutes.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Coordination of Distributed Energy Resources through Local Energy Markets and Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the energy landscape evolves toward sustainability, the accelerating integration of distributed energy resources poses challenges to the operability and reliability of the electricity grid. One significant aspect of this issue is the notable increase in net load variability at the grid edge. Transactive energy, implemented through local energy markets, has recently garnered attention as a promising solution to address the grid challenges in the form of decentralized, indirect demand response on a community level. Given the nature of these challenges, model-free control approaches, such as deep reinforcement learning, show promise for the decentralized automation of participation within this context. Existing studies at the intersection of transactive energy and model-free control primarily focus on socioeconomic and self-consumption metrics, overlooking the crucial goal of reducing community-level net load variability. This study addresses this gap by training a set of deep reinforcement learning agents to automate end-user participation in ALEX, an economy-driven local energy market. In this setting, agents do not share information and only prioritize individual bill optimization. The study unveils a clear correlation between bill reduction and reduced net load variability in this setup. The impact on net load variability is assessed over various time horizons using metrics such as ramping rate, daily and monthly load factor, as well as daily average and total peak export and import on an open-source dataset. Agents are then benchmarked against several baselines, with their performance levels showing promising results, approaching those of a near-optimal dynamic programming benchmark.</description>

      <title>Human Motor Learning Dynamics in High-dimensional Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional approaches to enhancing movement coordination, such as providing instructions and visual feedback, are often inadequate in complex motor tasks with multiple degrees of freedom (DoFs). To effectively address coordination deficits in such complex motor systems, it becomes imperative to develop interventions grounded in a model of human motor learning; however, modeling such learning processes is challenging due to the large DoFs. In this paper, we present a computational motor learning model that leverages the concept of motor synergies to extract low-dimensional learning representations in the high-dimensional motor space and the internal model theory of motor control to capture both fast and slow motor learning processes. We establish the model's convergence properties and validate it using data from a target capture game played by human participants. We study the influence of model parameters on several motor learning trade-offs such as speed-accuracy, exploration-exploitation, satisficing, and flexibility-performance, and show that the human motor learning system tunes these parameters to optimize learning and various output performance metrics.</description>

      <title>Integrating Physics-Informed Neural Networks into Power System Dynamic Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-domain simulations in power systems are crucial for ensuring power system stability and avoiding critical scenarios that could lead to blackouts. The proliferation of converter-connected resources, however, adds significant additional degrees of non-linearity and complexity to these simulations. This drastically increases the computational time and the number of critical scenarios to be considered. Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN) have been shown to accelerate these simulations by several orders of magnitude. This paper introduces the first natural step to remove the barriers for using PINNs in time-domain simulations: it proposes the first method to integrate PINNs in conventional numerical solvers. Integrating PINNs into conventional solvers unlocks a wide range of opportunities. First, PINNs can substantially accelerate simulation time, second, the modeling of components with PINNs allows new ways to reduce privacy concerns when sharing models, and last, enhance the applicability of PINN-based surrogate modeling. We demonstrate the training, integration, and simulation framework for several combinations of PINNs and numerical solution methods, using the IEEE 9-bus system.</description>

      <title>Cross-Forming Control and Fault Current Limiting for Grid-Forming Inverters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel "cross-forming" control concept for grid-forming inverters operating against grid faults. Cross-forming refers to voltage angle forming and current magnitude forming, differing from classical grid-forming and grid-following concepts, i.e., voltage magnitude-and-angle forming and current magnitude-and-angle forming, respectively. Unlike purely grid-forming or grid-following paradigms, the cross-forming concept is motivated by device security requirements for fault current limitation and meanwhile grid code requirements for voltage angle forming preserving. We propose two feasible control strategies to realize the cross-forming concept, enabling inverters to fast-limit the fault current at a prescribed level while preserving voltage angle forming for grid-forming-type synchronization and dynamic ancillary services provision during fault ride-through. Moreover, the cross-forming control yields an equivalent system featuring a constant virtual impedance and an "equivalent normal form" of representation, making transient stability analysis tractable. The equivalent system allows us to extend previous transient stability results to encompass scenarios of current saturation. Simulations and experiments validate the efficacy of the proposed control.</description>

      <title>Online Planning of Power Flows for Power Systems Against Bushfires Using Spatial Context</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 2019-20 Australia bushfire incurred numerous economic losses and significantly affected the operations of power systems. A power station or transmission line can be significantly affected due to bushfires, leading to an increase in operational costs. We study a fundamental but challenging problem of planning the optimal power flow (OPF) for power systems subject to bushfires. Considering the stochastic nature of bushfire spread, we develop a model to capture such dynamics based on Moore's neighborhood model. Under a periodic inspection scheme that reveals the in-situ bushfire status, we propose an online optimization modeling framework that sequentially plans the power flows in the electricity network. Our framework assumes that the spread of bushfires is non-stationary over time, and the spread and containment probabilities are unknown. To meet these challenges, we develop a contextual online learning algorithm that treats the in-situ geographical information of the bushfire as a 'spatial context'. The online learning algorithm learns the unknown probabilities sequentially based on the observed data and then makes the OPF decision accordingly. The sequential OPF decisions aim to minimize the regret function, which is defined as the cumulative loss against the clairvoyant strategy that knows the true model parameters. We provide a theoretical guarantee of our algorithm by deriving a bound on the regret function, which outperforms the regret bound achieved by other benchmark algorithms. Our model assumptions are verified by the real bushfire data from NSW, Australia, and we apply our model to two power systems to illustrate its applicability.</description>

      <title>Self-Adjusting Prescribed Performance Control for Nonlinear Systems with Input Saturation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Among the existing works on enhancing system performance via prescribed performance functions (PPFs), the decay rates of PPFs need to be predetermined by the designer, directly affecting the convergence time of the closed-loop system. However, if only considering accelerating the system convergence by selecting a big decay rate of the performance function, it may lead to the severe consequence of closed-loop system failure when considering the prevalent actuator saturation in practical scenarios. To address this issue, this work proposes a control scheme that can flexibly self-adjust the convergence rates of the performance functions (PFs), aiming to achieve faster steady-state convergence while avoiding the risk of error violation beyond the PFs' envelopes, which may arise from input saturation and improper decay rate selection in traditional prescribed performance control (PPC) methods. Specifically, a performance index function (PIF) is introduced as a reference criterion, based on which the self-adjusting rates of the PFs are designed for different cases, exhibiting the following appealing features: 1) It can eliminate the need to prespecify the initial values of the PFs. In addition, it can also accommodate arbitrary magnitudes of initial errors while avoiding excessive initial control efforts. 2) Considering actuator saturation, this method can not only reduce the decay rates of the PFs when necessary to avoid violation of the PFs, but also increase the decay rates to accelerate system convergence when there is remaining control capacity. Finally, several numerical simulations are conducted to confirm the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Application of Kalman Filter in Stochastic Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In areas such as finance, engineering, and science, we often face situations that change quickly and unpredictably. These situations are tough to handle and require special tools and methods capable of understanding and predicting what might happen next. Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs) are renowned for modeling and analyzing real-world dynamical systems. However, obtaining the parameters, boundary conditions, and closed-form solutions of SDEs can often be challenging. In this paper, we will discuss the application of Kalman filtering theory to SDEs, including Extended Kalman filtering and Particle Extended Kalman filtering. We will explore how to fit existing SDE systems through filtering and track the original SDEs by fitting the obtained closed-form solutions. This approach aims to gather more information about these SDEs, which could be used in various ways, such as incorporating them into parameters of data-based SDE models.</description>

      <title>Soar: Design and Deployment of A Smart Roadside Infrastructure System for Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently,smart roadside infrastructure (SRI) has demonstrated the potential of achieving fully autonomous driving systems. To explore the potential of infrastructure-assisted autonomous driving, this paper presents the design and deployment of Soar, the first end-to-end SRI system specifically designed to support autonomous driving systems. Soar consists of both software and hardware components carefully designed to overcome various system and physical challenges. Soar can leverage the existing operational infrastructure like street lampposts for a lower barrier of adoption. Soar adopts a new communication architecture that comprises a bi-directional multi-hop I2I network and a downlink I2V broadcast service, which are designed based on off-the-shelf 802.11ac interfaces in an integrated manner. Soar also features a hierarchical DL task management framework to achieve desirable load balancing among nodes and enable them to collaborate efficiently to run multiple data-intensive autonomous driving applications. We deployed a total of 18 Soar nodes on existing lampposts on campus, which have been operational for over two years. Our real-world evaluation shows that Soar can support a diverse set of autonomous driving applications and achieve desirable real-time performance and high communication reliability. Our findings and experiences in this work offer key insights into the development and deployment of next-generation smart roadside infrastructure and autonomous driving systems.</description>

      <title>Cell Balancing for the Transportation Sector: Techniques, Challenges, and Future Research Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient and reliable energy systems are key to progress of society. High performance batteries are essential for widely used technologies like Electric Vehicles (EVs) and portable electronics. Additionally, an effective Battery Management System (BMS) is crucial to oversee vital parameters of battery. However, BMS can experience cell imbalance due to charging/discharging dynamics, which reduce battery capacity, lifespan, and efficiency, and raise critical safety concerns. This calls for effective cell-balancing techniques. Notably, the existing literature on cell balancing is limited, urgently necessitating a thorough survey to pinpoint key research gaps and suggest prompt solutions. In this article, cell balancing and corresponding techniques are reviewed. Initially, we detail comparison of passive cell balancing techniques and assess their respective advantages, drawbacks, and practical applications. Then, we discuss the strengths and weaknesses of active cell balancing methods and applicability of cell balancing for both, series and parallel-connected cells. Additionally, we examine the need for cell balancing in commonly used batteries, and applications in EVs. Lastly, we present detailed prospects which include challenges and directions for future research.</description>

      <title>Data-Based System Representation and Synchronization for Multiagent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents novel solutions of the data-based synchronization problem for continuous-time multiagent systems. We consider the cases of homogeneous and heterogeneous systems. First, a data-based representation of the synchronization error dynamics is obtained for homogeneous systems, using input-state data collected from the agents. Then, we show how to extend existing data-based stabilization results to the multiagent case to stabilize the obtained synchronization errors. The proposed method relies on the solution of a set of linear matrix inequalities that are shown to be feasible. Then, we solve the synchronization problem for heterogeneous systems by means of dynamic controllers. Different from existing results, we do not require model knowledge for the followers and the leader. The theoretical results are finally validated using numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Autoencoder-assisted Feature Ensemble Net for Incipient Faults</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning has shown the great power in the field of fault detection. However, for incipient faults with tiny amplitude, the detection performance of the current deep learning networks (DLNs) is not satisfactory. Even if prior information about the faults is utilized, DLNs can't successfully detect faults 3, 9 and 15 in Tennessee Eastman process (TEP). These faults are notoriously difficult to detect, lacking effective detection technologies in the field of fault detection. In this work, we propose Autoencoder-assisted Feature Ensemble Net (AE-FENet): a deep feature ensemble framework that uses the unsupervised autoencoder to conduct the feature transformation. Compared with the principle component analysis (PCA) technique adopted in the original Feature Ensemble Net (FENet), autoencoder can mine more exact features on incipient faults, which results in the better detection performance of AE-FENet. With same kinds of basic detectors, AE-FENet achieves a state-of-the-art average accuracy over 96% on faults 3, 9 and 15 in TEP, which represents a significant enhancement in performance compared to other methods. Plenty of experiments have been done to extend our framework, proving that DLNs can be utilized efficiently within this architecture.</description>

      <title>Coordinated Planning for Stability Enhancement in High IBR-Penetrated Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Security and stability challenges in future power systems with high penetration Inverter-Based Resources (IBR) have been anticipated as the main barrier to decolonization. Grid-following IBRs may become unstable under small disturbances in weak grids, while, during transient processes, system stability and protection may be jeopardized due to the lack of sufficient Short-Circuit Current (SCC). To solve these challenges and achieve decarbonization, the future system has to be carefully planned. However, it remains unclear how both small-signal and transient processes can be considered during the system planning stage. In this context, this paper proposes a coordinated planning model of different resources to enhance system-level stability. The system strength and SCC constraints are analytically derived by considering the different characteristics of synchronous units and IBRs, which are further effectively linearized through a novel data-driven approach, where an active sampling method is proposed to generate a representative data set. The significant economic value of the proposed coordinated planning framework in both system asset investment and system operation is demonstrated through detailed case studies.</description>

      <title>Optimization-based Heuristic for Vehicle Dynamic Coordination in Mixed Traffic Intersections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we address a coordination problem for connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) in mixed traffic settings with human-driven vehicles (HDVs). The main objective is to have a safe and optimal crossing order for vehicles approaching unsignalized intersections. This problem results in a mixed-integer quadratic programming (MIQP) formulation which is unsuitable for real-time applications. Therefore, we propose a computationally tractable optimization-based heuristic that monitors platoons of CAVs and HDVs to evaluate whether alternative crossing orders can perform better. It first checks the future constraint violation that consistently occurs between pairs of platoons to determine a potential swap. Next, the costs of quadratic programming (QP) formulations associated with the current and alternative orders are compared in a depth-first branching fashion. In simulations, we show that the heuristic can be a hundred times faster than the original and simplified MIQPs and yields solutions that are close to optimal and have better order consistency.</description>

Abstract: Amid growing environmental concerns and resulting energy costs, there is a rising need for efficient Home Energy Management Systems (HEMS). Evaluating such innovative HEMS solutions typically relies on simulations that may not model the full complexity of a real-world scenario. On the other hand, real-world testing, while more accurate, is labor-intensive, particularly when dealing with diverse assets, each using a distinct communication protocol or API. Centralizing and synchronizing the control of such a heterogeneous pool of assets thus poses a significant challenge. In this paper, we introduce HomeLabGym, a real-world testbed to ease such real-world evaluations of HEMS and flexible assets control in general, by adhering to the well-known OpenAI Gym paradigm. HomeLabGym allows researchers to prototype, deploy, and analyze HEMS controllers within the controlled test environment of a real-world house (the IDLab HomeLab), providing access to all its available sensors and smart appliances. The easy-to-use Python interface eliminates concerns about intricate communication protocols associated with sensors and appliances, streamlining the evaluation of various control strategies. We present an overview of HomeLabGym, and demonstrate its usefulness to researchers in a comparison between real-world and simulated environments in controlling a residential battery in response to real-time prices.</description>

      <title>Dionysos.jl: a Modular Platform for Smart Symbolic Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Dionysos.jl, a modular package for solving optimal control problems for complex dynamical systems using state-of-the-art and experimental techniques from symbolic control, optimization, and learning. More often than not with Cyber-Physical systems, the only sensible way of developing a controller is by discretizing the different variables, thus transforming the control task into a purely combinatorial problem on a finite-state mathematical object, called an abstraction of this system. Although this approach offers a safety-critical framework, the available techniques suffer important scalability issues. In order to render these techniques practical, it is necessary to construct smarter abstractions that differ from classical techniques by partitioning the state-space in a non trivial way.</description>

      <title>Multi-Agent Hybrid SAC for Joint SS-DSA in CRNs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Opportunistic spectrum access has the potential to increase the efficiency of spectrum utilization in cognitive radio networks (CRNs). In CRNs, both spectrum sensing and resource allocation (SSRA) are critical to maximizing system throughput while minimizing collisions of secondary users with the primary network. However, many works in dynamic spectrum access do not consider the impact of imperfect sensing information such as mis-detected channels, which the additional information available in joint SSRA can help remediate. In this work, we examine joint SSRA as an optimization which seeks to maximize a CRN's net communication rate subject to constraints on channel sensing, channel access, and transmit power. Given the non-trivial nature of the problem, we leverage multi-agent reinforcement learning to enable a network of secondary users to dynamically access unoccupied spectrum via only local test statistics, formulated under the energy detection paradigm of spectrum sensing. In doing so, we develop a novel multi-agent implementation of hybrid soft actor critic, MHSAC, based on the QMIX mixing scheme. Through experiments, we find that our SSRA algorithm, HySSRA, is successful in maximizing the CRN's utilization of spectrum resources while also limiting its interference with the primary network, and outperforms the current state-of-the-art by a wide margin. We also explore the impact of wireless variations such as coherence time on the efficacy of the system.</description>

      <title>Analysing the interaction of expansion decisions by end customers and grid development in the context of a municipal energy system</title>

Abstract: In order to achieve greenhouse gas neutrality by 2045, the Climate Protection Act sets emission reduction targets for the years 2030 and 2040, as well as decreasing annual emission volumes for some sectors, including the building sector. Measures to decarbonize the building sector include energy retrofits and the expansion of renewable, decentralized power generators and low-CO2 heat generators. These measures thus change both the load and the generation of the future energy supply concept. Considering the interactions of the changed installed technologies on the building level and their influence on the electrical grid infrastructure is necessary. The grid operator will remedy the future congested grid states by grid expansion measures and pass on the costs to the connected grid users, which in turn could influence their behaviour and decisions. The aim of this work is a holistic analysis of the staggered interactions of generation expansion and grid expansion for a future decentralized energy supply concept conditioned by the expansion in the field of self-generation. To enable the analysis of the interactions, a multi-criteria optimization procedure for expansion and operation decisions at the building level is combined with an approach to determine grid expansion. As part of this work, the effect of an expansion of hosting capacity on the grid charges and thus the decision-making behaviour was investigated.</description>

      <title>Flexibility Pricing in Distribution Systems: A Direct Method Aligned with Flexibility Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective quantification of costs and values of distributed energy resources (DERs) can enhance the power system's utilization of their flexibility. This paper studies the flexibility pricing of DERs in distribution systems. We first propose a flexibility cost formulation based on adjustment ranges in both power and accumulated energy consumption. Compared with traditional power range-based approaches, the proposed method can quantify the potential inconvenience caused to DER users by flexibility activation and directly capture the time-dependent characteristics of DER's flexibility regions. We then propose a flexibility cost formulation aligned with the aggregated flexibility model and design a DSO flexibility market model to activate the aggregated flexibility in the distribution system to participate in the transmission system operation for energy arbitrage and ancillary services provision. Furthermore, we propose the concept of marginal flexibility price for the settlement of the DSO flexibility market, ensuring incentive compatibility, revenue adequacy, and a non-profit distribution system operator. Numerical tests on the IEEE 33-node distribution system verify the proposed methods.</description>

Abstract: Existence of quasi-static negative capacitance (QSNC) was proposed from an interpretation of the widely accepted Landau model of ferroelectrics. However, many works showed not to support the QSNC theory, making it controversial. In this letter we show the Landau model when used together with transition-state-theory, can connect various models including first-principles, Landau, Preisach and nucleation limited switching while it does not predict the existence of QSNC.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For many recommender systems the primary data source is a historical record of user clicks. The associated click matrix which is often very sparse, however, as the number of users x products can be far larger than the number of clicks, and such sparsity is accentuated in cold-start settings. The sparsity of the click matrix is the reason matrix factorization and autoencoders techniques remain highly competitive across collaborative filtering datasets. In this work, we propose a simple approach to address cold-start recommendations by leveraging content metadata, Metadata Alignment for cold-start Recommendation. we show that this approach can readily augment existing matrix factorization and autoencoder approaches, enabling a smooth transition to top performing algorithms in warmer set-ups. Our experimental results indicate three separate contributions: first, we show that our proposed framework largely beats SOTA results on 4 cold-start datasets with different sparsity and scale characteristics, with gains ranging from +8.4% to +53.8% on reported ranking metrics; second, we provide an ablation study on the utility of semantic features, and proves the additional gain obtained by leveraging such features ranges between +46.8% and +105.5%; and third, our approach is by construction highly competitive in warm set-ups, and we propose a closed-form solution outperformed by SOTA results by only 0.8% on average.</description>

      <title>Accelerated System-Reliability-based Disaster Resilience Analysis for Structural Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Resilience has emerged as a crucial concept for evaluating structural performance under disasters because of its ability to extend beyond traditional risk assessments, accounting for a system's ability to minimize disruptions and maintain functionality during recovery. To facilitate the holistic understanding of resilience performance in structural systems, a system-reliability-based disaster resilience analysis framework was developed. The framework describes resilience using three criteria: reliability, redundancy, and recoverability, and the system's internal resilience is evaluated by inspecting the characteristics of reliability and redundancy for different possible progressive failure modes. However, the practical application of this framework has been limited to complex structures with numerous sub-components, as it becomes intractable to evaluate the performances for all possible initial disruption scenarios. To bridge the gap between the theory and practical use, especially for evaluating reliability and redundancy, this study centers on the idea that the computational burden can be substantially alleviated by focusing on initial disruption scenarios that are practically significant. To achieve this research goal, we propose three methods to efficiently eliminate insignificant scenarios: the sequential search method, the n-ball sampling method, and the surrogate model-based adaptive sampling algorithm. Three numerical examples, including buildings and a bridge, are introduced to prove the applicability and efficiency of the proposed approaches. The findings of this study are expected to offer practical solutions to the challenges of assessing resilience performance in complex structural systems.</description>

Abstract: This paper studies a risk-sensitive decision-making problem under uncertainty. It considers a decision-making process that unfolds over a fixed number of stages, in which a decision-maker chooses among multiple alternatives, some of which are deterministic and others are stochastic. The decision-maker's cumulative value is updated at each stage, reflecting the outcomes of the chosen alternatives. After formulating this as a stochastic control problem, we delineate the necessary optimality conditions for it. Two illustrative examples from optimal betting and inventory management are provided to support our theory.</description>

Also, as the complexity of computing continuum systems intensifies, the role of AI in predictive maintenance (Pd.M.) becomes increasingly pivotal. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of the current state of Pd.M. in the computing continuum, with a focus on the combination of scalable AI technologies. Recognizing the limitations of traditional maintenance practices in the face of increasingly complex and heterogenous computing continuum systems, the study explores how AI, especially machine learning and neural networks, is being used to enhance Pd.M. strategies. The survey encompasses a thorough review of existing literature, highlighting key advancements, methodologies, and case studies in the field. It critically examines the role of AI in improving prediction accuracy for system failures and in optimizing maintenance schedules, thereby contributing to reduced downtime and enhanced system longevity. By synthesizing findings from the latest advancements in the field, the article provides insights into the effectiveness and challenges of implementing AI-driven predictive maintenance. It underscores the evolution of maintenance practices in response to technological advancements and the growing complexity of computing continuum systems. The conclusions drawn from this survey are instrumental for practitioners and researchers in understanding the current landscape and future directions of Pd.M. in distributed systems. It emphasizes the need for continued research and development in this area, pointing towards a trend of more intelligent, efficient, and cost-effective maintenance solutions in the era of AI.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Safe Control of Neural Network Dynamic Models with Sound Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13456v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Safe control of neural network dynamic models (NNDMs) is important to robotics and many applications. However, it remains challenging to compute an optimal safe control in real time for NNDM. To enable real-time computation, we propose to use a sound approximation of the NNDM in the control synthesis. In particular, we propose Bernstein over-approximated neural dynamics (BOND) based on the Bernstein polynomial over-approximation (BPO) of ReLU activation functions in NNDM. To mitigate the errors introduced by the approximation and to ensure persistent feasibility of the safe control problems, we synthesize a worst-case safety index using the most unsafe approximated state within the BPO relaxation of NNDM offline. For the online real-time optimization, we formulate the first-order Taylor approximation of the nonlinear worst-case safety constraint as an additional linear layer of NNDM with the l2 bounded bias term for the higher-order remainder. Comprehensive experiments with different neural dynamics and safety constraints show that with safety guaranteed, our NNDMs with sound approximation are 10-100 times faster than the safe control baseline that uses mixed integer programming (MIP), validating the effectiveness of the worst-case safety index and scalability of the proposed BOND in real-time large-scale settings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel distributed optimization technique for networked systems, which removes the dependency on specific parameter choices, notably the learning rate. Traditional parameter selection strategies in distributed optimization often lead to conservative performance, characterized by slow convergence or even divergence if parameters are not properly chosen. In this work, we propose a systems theory tool based on the port-Hamiltonian formalism to design algorithms for consensus optimization programs. Moreover, we propose the Mixed Implicit Discretization (MID), which transforms the continuous-time port-Hamiltonian system into a discrete time one, maintaining the same convergence properties regardless of the step size parameter. The consensus optimization algorithm enhances the convergence speed without worrying about the relationship between parameters and stability. Numerical experiments demonstrate the method's superior performance in convergence speed, outperforming other methods, especially in scenarios where conventional methods fail due to step size parameter limitations.</description>

Abstract: This paper introduces a safe force/position tracking control strategy designed for Free-Floating Mobile Manipulator Systems (MMSs) engaging in compliant contact with planar surfaces. The strategy uniquely integrates the Control Barrier Function (CBF) to manage operational limitations and safety concerns. It effectively addresses safety-critical aspects in the kinematic as well as dynamic level, such as manipulator joint limits, system velocity constraints, and inherent system dynamic uncertainties. The proposed strategy remains robust to the uncertainties of the MMS dynamic model, external disturbances, or variations in the contact stiffness model. The proposed control method has low computational demand ensures easy implementation on onboard computing systems, endorsing real-time operations. Simulation results verify the strategy's efficacy, reflecting enhanced system performance and safety.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Laser Additive Manufacturing (LAM) presents unparalleled opportunities for fabricating complex, high-performance structures and components with unique material properties. Despite these advancements, achieving consistent part quality and process repeatability remains challenging. This paper provides a comprehensive review of various state-of-the-art in-situ process monitoring techniques, including optical-based monitoring, acoustic-based sensing, laser line scanning, and operando X-ray monitoring. These techniques are evaluated for their capabilities and limitations in detecting defects within Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) and Laser Directed Energy Deposition (LDED) processes. Furthermore, the review discusses emerging multisensor monitoring and machine learning (ML)-assisted defect detection methods, benchmarking ML models tailored for in-situ defect detection. The paper also discusses in-situ adaptive defect remediation strategies that advance LAM towards zero-defect autonomous operations, focusing on real-time closed-loop feedback control and defect correction methods. Research gaps such as the need for standardization, improved reliability and sensitivity, and decision-making strategies beyond early stopping are highlighted. Future directions are proposed, with an emphasis on multimodal sensor fusion for multiscale defect prediction and fault diagnosis, ultimately enabling self-adaptation in LAM processes. This paper aims to equip researchers and industry professionals with a holistic understanding of the current capabilities, limitations, and future directions in in-situ process monitoring and adaptive quality enhancement in LAM.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article introduces a new transcription, change point localization, and mesh refinement scheme for direct optimization-based solutions and for uniform approximation of optimal control trajectories associated with a class of nonlinear constrained optimal control problems (OCPs). The base transcription algorithm for which we establish the refinement algorithm is a $\textit{direct multiple shooting technique}$ -- $\mathsf{QuITO}$ $\textsf{v.2}$ (Quasi-Interpolation based Trajectory Optimization). The mesh refinement technique consists of two steps -- localization of certain irregular regions in an optimal control trajectory via wavelets, followed by a targeted $h$-refinement approach around such regions of irregularity. Theoretical approximation guarantees on uniform grids are presented for optimal controls with certain regularity properties along with guarantees of localization of change points by wavelet transform. Numerical illustrations are provided for control profiles involving discontinuities to show the effectiveness of the localization and refinement strategy. We also announce and make freely available a new software package developed based on $\mathsf{QuITO}$ $\textsf{v.2}$ along with its functionalities to make the article complete.</description>

      <title>Seamless Underwater Navigation with Limited Doppler Velocity Log Measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) commonly utilize an inertial navigation system (INS) and a Doppler velocity log (DVL) for underwater navigation. To that end, their measurements are integrated through a nonlinear filter such as the extended Kalman filter (EKF). The DVL velocity vector estimate depends on retrieving reflections from the seabed, ensuring that at least three out of its four transmitted acoustic beams return successfully. When fewer than three beams are obtained, the DVL cannot provide a velocity update to bind the navigation solution drift. To cope with this challenge, in this paper, we propose a hybrid neural coupled (HNC) approach for seamless AUV navigation in situations of limited DVL measurements. First, we drive an approach to regress two or three missing DVL beams. Then, those beams, together with the measured beams, are incorporated into the EKF. We examined INS/DVL fusion both in loosely and tightly coupled approaches. Our method was trained and evaluated on recorded data from AUV experiments conducted in the Mediterranean Sea on two different occasions. The results illustrate that our proposed method outperforms the baseline loosely and tightly coupled model-based approaches by an average of 96.15%. It also demonstrates superior performance compared to a model-based beam estimator by an average of 12.41% in terms of velocity accuracy for scenarios involving two or three missing beams. Therefore, we demonstrate that our approach offers seamless AUV navigation in situations of limited beam measurements.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Heterogeneous Client Sampling for Federated Learning over Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) algorithms usually sample a fraction of clients in each round (partial participation) when the number of participants is large and the server's communication bandwidth is limited. Recent works on the convergence analysis of FL have focused on unbiased client sampling, e.g., sampling uniformly at random, which suffers from slow wall-clock time for convergence due to high degrees of system heterogeneity and statistical heterogeneity. This paper aims to design an adaptive client sampling algorithm for FL over wireless networks that tackles both system and statistical heterogeneity to minimize the wall-clock convergence time. We obtain a new tractable convergence bound for FL algorithms with arbitrary client sampling probability. Based on the bound, we analytically establish the relationship between the total learning time and sampling probability with an adaptive bandwidth allocation scheme, which results in a non-convex optimization problem. We design an efficient algorithm for learning the unknown parameters in the convergence bound and develop a low-complexity algorithm to approximately solve the non-convex problem. Our solution reveals the impact of system and statistical heterogeneity parameters on the optimal client sampling design. Moreover, our solution shows that as the number of sampled clients increases, the total convergence time first decreases and then increases because a larger sampling number reduces the number of rounds for convergence but results in a longer expected time per-round due to limited wireless bandwidth. Experimental results from both hardware prototype and simulation demonstrate that our proposed sampling scheme significantly reduces the convergence time compared to several baseline sampling schemes.</description>

      <title>Towards Using Behavior Trees in Industrial Automation Controllers</title>

Abstract: The Industry 4.0 paradigm manifests the shift towards mass customization and cyber-physical production systems (CPPS) and sets new requirements for industrial automation software in terms of modularity, flexibility, and short development cycles of control programs. Though programmable logical controllers (PLCs) have been evolving into versatile and powerful edge devices, there is a lack of PLC software flexibility and integration between low-level programs and high-level task-oriented control frameworks. Behavior trees (BTs) is a novel framework, which enables rapid design of modular hierarchical control structures. It combines improved modularity with a simple and intuitive design of control logic. This paper proposes an approach for improving the industrial control software design by integrating BTs into PLC programs and separating hardware related functionalities from the coordination logic. Several strategies for integration of BTs into PLCs are shown. The first two integrate BTs with the IEC 61131 based PLCs and are based on the use of the PLCopen Common Behavior Model. The last one utilized event-based BTs and shows the integration with the IEC 61499 based controllers. An application example demonstrates the approach.
  The paper contributes in the following ways. First, we propose a new PLC software design, which improves modularity, supports better separation of concerns, and enables rapid development and reconfiguration of the control software. Second, we show and evaluate the integration of the BT framework into both IEC 61131 and IEC 61499 based PLCs, as well as the integration of the PLCopen function blocks with the external BT library. This leads to better integration of the low-level PLC code and the AI-based task-oriented frameworks. It also improves the skill-based programming approach for PLCs by using BTs for skills composition.</description>

      <title>How Many Grid-Forming Converters Do We Need? A Perspective From Small Signal Stability and Power Grid Strength</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.10465v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Grid-forming (GFM) control has been considered a promising solution for accommodating large-scale power electronics converters into modern power grids thanks to its grid-friendly dynamics, in particular, voltage source behavior on the AC side. The voltage source behavior of GFM converters can provide voltage support for the power grid, and therefore enhance the power grid (voltage) strength. However, grid-following (GFL) converters can also perform constant AC voltage magnitude control by properly regulating their reactive current, which may also behave like a voltage source. Currently, it still remains unclear what are the essential differences between the voltage source behaviors of GFL and GFM converters, and which type of voltage source behavior can enhance the power grid strength. In this paper, we will demonstrate that only GFM converters can provide effective voltage source behavior and enhance the power grid strength in terms of small signal dynamics. Based on our analysis, we further study the problem of how to configure GFM converters in the grid and how many GFM converters we will need. We investigate how the capacity ratio between GFM and GFL converters affects the equivalent power grid strength and thus the small signal stability of the system. We give guidelines on how to choose this ratio to achieve a desired stability margin. We validate our analysis using high-fidelity simulations.</description>

      <title>Optimal Power Flow for Integrated Primary-Secondary Distribution Networks with Center-Tapped Service Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.13287v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Secondary distribution networks (SDNets) play an increasingly important role in smart grids due to a high proliferation of distributed energy resources (DERs) in SDNets. However, most existing optimal power flow (OPF) problems do not take into account SDNets with center-tapped service transformers. Handling the nonlinear and nonconvex SDNet power flow constraints is still an outstanding problem. To meet this gap, we first utilize the second-order cone programming relaxation and linearization to make center-tapped service transformer constraints convex, respectively. Then, a linearized triplex service line power flow model, including its compact matrix-vector form, is further developed to compose the SDNet OPF model with our proposed center-tapped service transformer model. This proposed SDNet OPF model can be easily embedded into existing primary distribution network (PDNet) OPF models, resulting in a holistic power system decision-making solution for integrated primary-secondary distribution networks. Case studies are presented for two different integrated primary-secondary distribution networks that demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of this model.</description>

      <title>Managing the Uncertainty in System Dynamics Through Distributionally Robust Stability-Constrained Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.03798v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the increasing penetration of Inverter-Based Resources (IBRs) and their impact on power system stability and operation, the concept of stability-constrained optimization has drawn significant attention from researchers. In order to manage the parametric uncertainty due to inaccurate modeling that influences the system dynamics, this work proposes a distributionally robust stability constraint formulation. However, the uncertainty of system dynamic parameters influences the stability constraints indirectly through a nonlinear and implicit relationship. To address this issue, a propagation mechanism from the uncertainty of the system dynamic parameters to the stability constraint coefficients is established. Since these coefficients are connected to the uncertain parameters through highly nonlinear and implicit functions, an approximation approach utilizing Taylor expansion and the Delta method is developed to estimate the statistical moments of the stability constraint coefficients based on the first and second-order derivatives, with which an ambiguity set for the distributionally robust optimization can be formulated. The accuracy of the uncertainty propagation as well as the effectiveness of the distributionally robust stability constraints are demonstrated through detailed case studies in the modified IEEE 39-bus system.</description>

      <title>Operational risk quantification of power grids using graph neural network surrogates of the DC OPF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.03661v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A DC OPF surrogate modeling framework is developed for Monte Carlo (MC) sampling-based risk quantification in power grid operation. MC simulation necessitates solving a large number of DC OPF problems corresponding to the samples of stochastic grid variables (power demand and renewable generation), which is computationally prohibitive. Computationally inexpensive surrogates of OPF provide an attractive alternative for expedited MC simulation. Graph neural network (GNN) surrogates of DC OPF, which are especially suitable to graph-structured data, are employed in this work. Previously developed DC OPF surrogate models have focused on accurate operational decision-making and not on risk quantification. Here, risk quantification-specific aspects of DC OPF surrogate evaluation is the main focus. To this end, the proposed GNN surrogates are evaluated using realistic joint probability distributions, quantification of their risk estimation accuracy, and investigation of their generalizability. Four synthetic grids (Case118, Case300, Case1354pegase, and Case2848rte) are used for surrogate model performance evaluation. It is shown that the GNN surrogates are sufficiently accurate for predicting the (bus-level, branch-level and system-level) grid state and enable fast as well as accurate operational risk quantification for power grids. The article thus develops tools for fast reliability and risk quantification in real-world power grids using GNN-based surrogates.</description>

      <title>Multi-Objective Transmission Expansion: An Offshore Wind Power Integration Case Study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.09563v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite ambitious offshore wind targets in the U.S. and globally, offshore grid planning guidance remains notably scarce, contrasting with well-established frameworks for onshore grids. This gap, alongside the increasing penetration of offshore wind and other clean-energy resources in onshore grids, highlights the urgent need for a coordinated planning framework. Our paper describes a multi-objective, multistage generation, storage and transmission expansion planning model to facilitate efficient and resilient large-scale adoption of offshore wind power. Recognizing regulatory emphasis and, in some cases, requirements to consider externalities, this model explicitly accounts for negative externalities: greenhouse gas emissions and local emission-induced air pollution. Utilizing an 8-zone ISO-NE test system and a 9-zone PJM test system, we explore grid expansion sensitivities such as impacts of optimizing Points of Interconnection (POIs) versus fixed POIs, negative externalities, and consideration of extreme operational scenarios resulting from offshore wind integration. Our results indicate that accounting for negative externalities necessitates greater upfront investment in clean generation and storage (balanced by lower expected operational costs). Optimizing POIs could significantly reshape offshore topology or POIs, and lower total cost. Finally, accounting for extreme operational scenarios typically results in greater operational costs and sometimes may alter onshore line investment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.14979v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time delay based control, recently proposed for non-collocated fourth-order systems, has several advantages over an observer-based state-feedback compensation of the low-damped oscillations in output. In this paper, we discuss a practical infeasibility of such observer-based approach and bring forward application of the time delay based controller, which is simple in both the structure and design. Moreover, robust estimation of the output oscillation frequency is used and extended by a bias canceling. The latter is required for positioning the oscillatory passive loads. This way, an adaptive version of time delay-based control is realized that does not require prior knowledge of the mass and stiffness parameters. The results are demonstrated on the oscillatory experimental setup with constraints in the operation range and control value.</description>

      <title>An Adversarial Approach to Evaluating the Robustness of Event Identification Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.12338v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Intelligent machine learning approaches are finding active use for event detection and identification that allow real-time situational awareness. Yet, such machine learning algorithms have been shown to be susceptible to adversarial attacks on the incoming telemetry data. This paper considers a physics-based modal decomposition method to extract features for event classification and focuses on interpretable classifiers including logistic regression and gradient boosting to distinguish two types of events: load loss and generation loss. The resulting classifiers are then tested against an adversarial algorithm to evaluate their robustness. The adversarial attack is tested in two settings: the white box setting, wherein the attacker knows exactly the classification model; and the gray box setting, wherein the attacker has access to historical data from the same network as was used to train the classifier, but does not know the classification model. Thorough experiments on the synthetic South Carolina 500-bus system highlight that a relatively simpler model such as logistic regression is more susceptible to adversarial attacks than gradient boosting.</description>

      <title>Long Duration Battery Sizing, Siting, and Operation Under Wildfire Risk Using Progressive Hedging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12296v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Battery sizing and siting problems are computationally challenging due to the need to make long-term planning decisions that are cognizant of short-term operational decisions. This paper considers sizing, siting, and operating batteries in a power grid to maximize their benefits, including price arbitrage and load shed mitigation, during both normal operations and periods with high wildfire ignition risk. We formulate a multi-scenario optimization problem for long duration battery storage while considering the possibility of load shedding during Public Safety Power Shutoff (PSPS) events that de-energize lines to mitigate severe wildfire ignition risk. To enable a computationally scalable solution of this problem with many scenarios of wildfire risk and power injection variability, we develop a customized temporal decomposition method based on a progressive hedging framework. Extending traditional progressive hedging techniques, we consider coupling in both placement variables across all scenarios and state-of-charge variables at temporal boundaries. This enforces consistency across scenarios while enabling parallel computations despite both spatial and temporal coupling. The proposed decomposition facilitates efficient and scalable modeling of a full year of hourly operational decisions to inform the sizing and siting of batteries. With this decomposition, we model a year of hourly operational decisions to inform optimal battery placement for a 240-bus WECC model in under 70 minutes of wall-clock time.</description>

      <title>Distributed Nonconvex Optimization: Gradient-free Iterations and $\epsilon$-Globally Optimal Solution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2008.00252v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Distributed optimization utilizes local computation and communication to realize a global aim of optimizing the sum of local objective functions. This article addresses a class of constrained distributed nonconvex optimization problems involving univariate objectives, aiming to achieve global optimization without requiring local evaluations of gradients at every iteration. We propose a novel algorithm named CPCA, exploiting the notion of combining Chebyshev polynomial approximation, average consensus, and polynomial optimization. The proposed algorithm is i) able to obtain $\epsilon$-globally optimal solutions for any arbitrarily small given accuracy $\epsilon$, ii) efficient in both zeroth-order queries (i.e., evaluations of function values) and inter-agent communication, and iii) distributed terminable when the specified precision requirement is met. The key insight is to use polynomial approximations to substitute for general local objectives, distribute these approximations via average consensus, and solve an easier approximate version of the original problem. Due to the nice analytic properties of polynomials, this approximation not only facilitates efficient global optimization, but also allows the design of gradient-free iterations to reduce cumulative costs of queries and achieve geometric convergence for solving nonconvex problems. We provide a comprehensive analysis of the accuracy and complexities of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2206.03861v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the decentralized online regularized linear regression algorithm over random time-varying graphs. At each time step, every node runs an online estimation algorithm consisting of an innovation term processing its own new measurement, a consensus term taking a weighted sum of estimations of its own and its neighbors with additive and multiplicative communication noises and a regularization term preventing over-fitting. It is not required that the regression matrices and graphs satisfy special statistical assumptions such as mutual independence, spatio-temporal independence or stationarity. We develop the nonnegative supermartingale inequality of the estimation error, and prove that the estimations of all nodes converge to the unknown true parameter vector almost surely if the algorithm gains, graphs and regression matrices jointly satisfy the sample path spatio-temporal persistence of excitation condition. Especially, this condition holds by choosing appropriate algorithm gains if the graphs are uniformly conditionally jointly connected and conditionally balanced, and the regression models of all nodes are uniformly conditionally spatio-temporally jointly observable, under which the algorithm converges in mean square and almost surely. In addition, we prove that the regret upper bound is $O(T^{1-\tau}\ln T)$, where $\tau\in (0.5,1)$ is a constant depending on the algorithm gains.</description>

      <title>Input Convex LSTM: A Convex Approach for Fast Model Predictive Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.07202v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Leveraging Input Convex Neural Networks (ICNNs), ICNN-based Model Predictive Control (MPC) successfully attains globally optimal solutions by upholding convexity within the MPC framework. However, current ICNN architectures encounter the issue of exploding gradients, which limits their ability to serve as deep neural networks for complex tasks. Additionally, the current neural network-based MPC, including conventional neural network-based MPC and ICNN-based MPC, faces slower convergence speed when compared to MPC based on first-principles models. In this study, we leverage the principles of ICNNs to propose a novel Input Convex LSTM for MPC, with the specific goals of mitigating the exploding gradient problems in current ICNNs and reducing convergence time for NN-based MPC. From a simulation study of a nonlinear chemical reactor, we observed a reduction in convergence time, with a percentage decrease of 46.7%, 31.3%, and 20.2% compared to baseline plain RNN, plain LSTM, and Input Convex RNN, respectively.</description>

Abstract: We propose a hierarchical architecture designed for scalable real-time Model Predictive Control (MPC) in complex, multi-modal traffic scenarios. This architecture comprises two key components: 1) RAID-Net, a novel attention-based Recurrent Neural Network that predicts relevant interactions along the MPC prediction horizon between the autonomous vehicle and the surrounding vehicles using Lagrangian duality, and 2) a reduced Stochastic MPC problem that eliminates irrelevant collision avoidance constraints, enhancing computational efficiency. Our approach is demonstrated in a simulated traffic intersection with interactive surrounding vehicles, showcasing a 12x speed-up in solving the motion planning problem.

      <description>arXiv:2402.19315v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work answers positively the question whether non-stop flights are possible for maintaining constant the pose of cable-suspended objects. Such a counterintuitive answer paves the way for a paradigm shift where energetically efficient fixed-wing flying carriers can replace the inefficient multirotor carriers that have been used so far in precise cooperative cable-suspended aerial manipulation.
  First, we show that one or two flying carriers alone cannot perform non-stop flights while maintaining a constant pose of the suspended object. Instead, we prove that three flying carriers can achieve this task provided that the orientation of the load at the equilibrium is such that the components of the cable forces that balance the external force (typically gravity) do not belong to the plane of the cable anchoring points on the load. Numerical tests are presented in support of the analytical results.</description>

      <title>Intrusion Tolerance for Networked Systems through Two-Level Feedback Control</title>

Abstract: We formulate intrusion tolerance for a system with service replicas as a two-level optimal control problem. On the local level node controllers perform intrusion recovery, and on the global level a system controller manages the replication factor. The local and global control problems can be formulated as classical problems in operations research, namely, the machine replacement problem and the inventory replenishment problem. Based on this formulation, we design TOLERANCE, a novel control architecture for intrusion-tolerant systems. We prove that the optimal control strategies on both levels have threshold structure and design efficient algorithms for computing them. We implement and evaluate TOLERANCE in an emulation environment where we run 10 types of network intrusions. The results show that TOLERANCE can improve service availability and reduce operational cost compared with state-of-the-art intrusion-tolerant systems.</description>
