      <title>A converse theorem for quasi-split even special orthogonal groups over finite fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a converse theorem for the case of quasi-split non-split even special orthogonal groups over finite fields. There are two main difficulties which arise from the outer automorphism and non-split part of the torus. The outer automorphism is handled similarly to the split case, while new ideas are developed to overcome the non-split part of the torus.</description>

      <title>Contractibility and total semi-stability conditions of Euclidean quivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the bounded derived category $\mathcal{D}$ of an Euclidean quiver, or equivalently, that of coherent sheaves on a tame weighted projective line. We give a description of the moduli space $\mathrm{ToSS}$ of the total semi-stability conditions on $\mathcal{D}$, which implies that $\mathrm{ToSS}$ can linearly contract to any chosen non-concentrated stability condition in it. For type $\widetilde{A_{p,q}}$, this gives an alternative proof of the contractibility of the whole space of stability conditions.</description>

      <title>Grothendieck positivity for normal square root crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Normal crystals (also known as Stembridge crystals) are commonly used to establish the Schur positivity of symmetric functions, as their characters are sums of Schur polynomials. In this paper, we develop a combinatorial framework for a novel family of objects called normal square root crystals, which are closely related to symmetric Grothendieck functions, the $K$-theoretic analogue of Schur functions. Among other applications, this tool leads to a new proof of Buch's combinatorial rule for the multiplication of symmetric Grothendieck functions. The definition of a normal square root crystal, originally formulated by the first two authors, largely mirrors that of normal crystals. Our main result is to show that the character of such a crystal is always a sum of symmetric Grothendieck polynomials. The proof relies on an unexpected connection between the raising operators for our crystals and the Hecke insertion algorithm developed by Buch, Kresch, Shimozono, Tamvakis, and Yong.</description>

      <title>Jordan-Holder property for shifted quantum affine algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that finite length representations of shifted quantum affine algebras in category $\mathcal{O}^{\mathrm{sh}}$ are stable by fusion product. This implies that in the topological Grothendieck ring $K_0(\mathcal{O}^{\mathrm{sh}})$ the Grothendieck group of finite length representations forms a non-topological subring. We also conjecture this subring is isomorphic to the cluster algebra discovered in \cite{GHL}. In the course of our proofs, we establish that any simple representation in category $\mathcal{O}^{\mathrm{sh}}$ descends to a truncation, for certain truncation parameters as conjectured in \cite{H} in terms of Langlands dual $q$-characters.</description>

      <title>Integrality of $\mathrm{GL}_2\times\mathrm{GL}_2$ Rankin-Selberg integrals for ramified representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\pi_1,\pi_2$ be irreducible admissible generic tempered representations of $\mathrm{GL}_2(F)$ for some $p$-adic field $F$ of odd residue characteristic. We introduce a natural notion of general $(\pi_1\times\pi_2)$-integral data $(\phi,g_1,g_2)\in \mathcal{S}(F^2)\times\mathrm{GL}_2(F)^2$ at which the Rankin-Selberg integral can be evaluated. This is inspired by work of Loeffler, and previous work of the author, on unramified zeta integrals. We then establish an integral variant of a result of Jacquet-Langlands for the local Rankin-Selberg zeta integral associated to $\pi_1\times\pi_2$; i.e. we show that for any such integral datum $(\phi,g_1,g_2)$, we have $$\frac{Z(\phi,g_1W_{\pi_1}^\mathrm{new},g_2W_{\pi_2}^\mathrm{new};s)}{L(\pi_1\times\pi_2,s)}=\Phi(\phi,g_1W_{\pi_1}^\mathrm{new},g_2W_{\pi_2}^\mathrm{new};q^s)\in \mathbf{Z}[q^{-1},\Sigma^1][q^s,q^{-s}]$$for a finite set $\Sigma^1\subseteq\mathbf{C}^\times$ of roots of unity and unitary character values, depending only on $\pi_1,\pi_2$. This is compatible with the notion of integrality coming from newforms $f_1,f_2$ of even integral weights, satisfying a mild local dihedral condition at $2$. We show that if $\pi_1,\pi_2$ are local pieces of $f_1,f_2$ at any prime $p$, the coefficient algebra is $\mathcal{O}_{K}[p^{-1}]$ with $K$ a number field only depending on $f_1,f_2$. Our approach relies on a reinterpretation of the local Rankin-Selberg integral, and works of Assing and Saha on values of $p$-adic Whittaker new-vectors.</description>

      <title>$\otimes$-Frobenius functors and exact module categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We call a tensor functor $F:\mathcal{C}\rightarrow\mathcal{D}$ between finite tensor categories $\otimes$-Frobenius if the left and right adjoints of $F$ are isomorphic as $\mathcal{C}$-bimodule functors. We provide various characterizations of $\otimes$-Frobenius functors such as the unimodularity of the centralizer $\mathcal{Z}({}_F\mathcal{D}_F)$. We analyze the procedure of pulling back actions of tensor categories on module categories along tensor functors, and show that properties like pivotality and unimodularity are preserved if and only if $F$ if $\otimes$-Frobenius. These results allow the transport of Frobenius algebras under certain conditions. We apply the results to internal natural transformations and examples coming from Hopf algebras.</description>

      <title>Arithmetic geometry of character varieties with regular monodromy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.02171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.02171v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study character varieties arising as moduli of representations of an orientable surface group into a reductive group $G$. We first show that if $G/Z$ acts freely on the representation variety, then both the representation variety and the character variety are smooth and equidimensional. Next, we count points on a family of smooth character varieties; namely, those involving both regular semisimple and regular unipotent monodromy. In particular, we show that these varieties are polynomial count and obtain an explicit expression for their $E$-polynomials. Finally, by analysing the $E$-polynomial, we determine certain topological invariants of these varieties such as the Euler characteristic and the number of connected components. As an application, we give an example of a cohomologically rigid representation which is not physically rigid.</description>

      <title>Cohen-Macaulay representations of invariant subrings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19282v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We classify two-dimensional complete local rings $(R,\mathfrak{m},k)$ of finite Cohen-Macaulay type where $k$ is an arbitrary field of characteristic zero, generalizing works of Auslander and Esnault for algebraically closed case. Our main result shows that they are precisely of the form $R=l[[x_1,x_2]]^G$ where $l/k$ is a finite Galois extension and $G$ is a finite group acting on $l[[x_1,x_2]]$ as a $k$-algebra. In fact, $G$ can be linearized to become a subgroup of $GL_2(l)\rtimes{\rm Gal}(l/k)$. Moreover, we establish algebraic McKay correspondence in this general setting and completely describe its McKay quiver, which is often non-simply laced, as a quotient of another certain McKay quiver. Combining these results, we classify the quivers that may arise as the Auslander-Reiten quivers of two-dimensional Gorenstein rings of finite Cohen-Macaulay type of equicharacteristic zero. These are shown to be either doubles of (not necessarily simply-laced!) extended Dynkin diagrams or of type $\widetilde{A}_0$ or $\widetilde{CL}_n$ having loops.
  More generally, we consider higher dimensional $R=l[[x_1,\cdots,x_d]]^G\ (G\subseteq GL_d(l)\rtimes{\rm Gal}(l/k))$ and show they have non-commutative crepant resolutions (NCCRs). Furthermore, we explicitely determine the quivers of the NCCRs as quotients of another certain quivers.
  To accomplish these, we establish two results which are of independent interest. First, we prove the existence of $(d-1)$-almost split sequences for arbitrary $d$-dimensional Cohen-Macaulay rings having NCCR, even when their singularities are not isolated. Second, we give an explicit recipe to determine irreducible representations of skew group algebras $l*G$ in terms of those over the group algebras $lH$ where $H$ is the kernel of the action of $G$ on $l$.</description>

      <title>The index of sub-laplacians: beyond contact manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00091v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study the following question: do sub-Laplacian type operators have non-trivial index theory on Carnot manifolds in higher degree of nilpotency? The problem relates to characterizing the structure of the space of hypoelliptic sub-Laplacian type operators, and results going back to Rothschild-Stein and Helffer-Nourrigat. In two degrees of nilpotency, there is a rich index theory by work of van Erp-Baum on contact manifolds, that was later extended to polycontact manifolds by Goffeng-Kuzmin. We provide a plethora of examples in higher degree of nilpotency where the index theory is trivial.</description>

      <title>Kac-Moody Algebras on Soft Group Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15892v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Within the so-called group geometric approach to (super)gravity and (super)string theories, any compact Lie group manifold $G_{c}$ can be smoothly deformed into a group manifold $G_{c}^{\mu }$ (locally diffeomorphic to $G_{c}$ itself), which is `soft', namely, based on a non-left-invariant, intrinsic one-form Vielbein $\mu $, which violates the Maurer-Cartan equations and consequently has a non-vanishing associated curvature two-form. Within the framework based on the above deformation (`softening'), we show how to construct an infinite-dimensional (infinite-rank), generalized Kac-Moody (KM) algebra associated to $G_{c}^{\mu }$, starting from the generalized KM algebras associated to $G_{c}$. As an application, we consider KM algebras associated to deformed manifolds such as the `soft' circle, the `soft' two-sphere and the `soft' three-sphere. While the generalized KM algebra associated to the deformed circle is trivially isomorphic to its undeformed analogue, and hence not new, the `softening' of the two- and three- sphere includes squashed manifolds (and in particular, the so-called Berger three-sphere) and yields to non-trivial results.</description>
