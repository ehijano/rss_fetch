      <title>New Numeric Invariants of an Unfolding of a Polycycle "Tears of the Heart"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper new numeric invariants of structurally unstable vector fields in the plane are found. One of the main tools is an improved asymptotics of sparkling saddle connections that occur when a separatrix loop of a hyperbolic saddle breaks. Another main tool is a new topological invariant of two arithmetic progressions, both perturbed and unperturbed, on the real line. For the pairs of the unperturbed arithmetic progressions we give a complete topological classification.</description>

      <title>A Variational Approach to Planar Choreographies via Ekeland's Principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a variational approach to obtain periodic solutions of the $N$-body problem, in particular the 'figure-eight' solution for three equal masses. The central idea is to explicitly optimize the \emph{spatial scale} within the Lagrangian action, leading to the functional $\mathcal F = K^{\alpha/(\alpha+2)} V^{2/(\alpha+2)}$. We prove the existence of critical points of $\mathcal F$ that enforce a curve with a single self-crossing, and show that every reparametrized critical curve satisfies Newton's equations and is free of collisions. This framework recovers the Chenciner-Montgomery 'eight' (for $\alpha=1$) and extends to the whole range $0&lt;\alpha&lt;2$.</description>

      <title>h-dichotomies via noncritical uniformity and expansiveness for evolution families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recent paper (Math. Ann. 393 (2025), 1769--1795), Elorreaga et al. have obtained a complete characterization of the notion of a $h$-dichotomy for ordinary differential equations on a finite-dimensional space in terms of the notions of $h$-expansiveness and $h$-noncriticality. Their results extended the previous results of Coppel and Palmer, which dealt with exponential dichotomies. The main objective of this note is to extend the results of Elorreaga et al. to arbitrary invertible evolution families that act on Banach spaces. We emphasize that our approach is completely different and considerably simpler from the one developed by Elorreaga et al. It is based on the time-rescaling method introduced by Dragicevic and Silva.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness of the measure of maximal entropy for geodesic flows on coarse hyperbolic manifolds without conjugate points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we study geodesic flows on closed Riemannian manifolds without conjugate points and divergence property of geodesic rays. If the fundamental group is Gromov hyperbolic and residually finite we prove, under appropriate assumptions on the expansive set, that the geodesic flow has a unique measure of maximal entropy. This generalizes corresponding results of Climenhaga, Knieper and War proved under the stronger assumption of the existence of a background metric of negative sectional curvature.</description>

      <title>Long-Lasting and Slowly Varying Transient Dynamics in Discrete-Time Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analysis of mathematical models in ecology and epidemiology often focuses on asymptotic dynamics, such as stable equilibria and periodic orbits. However, many systems exhibit long transient behaviors where certain aspects of the dynamics remain in a slowly evolving state for an extended period before undergoing rapid change. In this work, we analyze long-lasting and slowly varying transient dynamics in discrete-time systems based on extensions of previous theoretical frameworks developed for continuous-time systems. This involves clarifying the conditions under which we say an observable of the system exhibits prolonged transients, and deriving criteria for characterizing these dynamics. Our results show that specific points in the state space, analogous to previously defined transient centers in continuous-time systems, can generate and sustain long transients in discrete-time models. We demonstrate how these properties manifest in predator-prey models and epidemiological systems, particularly when populations or disease prevalence remain low for extended intervals before sudden shifts.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-induced activity patterns of active-inactive clusters in complex networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03300v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present activity patterns consisting of active and inactive clusters of synchronized nodes in networks. We call a cluster active if nodes in it have nonzero velocity and inactive vice versa. The simultaneous invariance of active and inactive clusters poses a challenge because fluctuations from active clusters must cancel out for a desired cluster to be inactive. With the help of permutation symmetries in network topology and selecting dynamics on top such that internal dynamics and coupling functions are odd functions in the phase space, we demonstrate that such a combination of structure and dynamics exhibits (stable) invariant patterns consisting of active and inactive clusters. Symmetry breaking of synchronized clusters creates active clusters that are in antisynchrony with each other, resulting in the cancellation of fluctuations for clusters connected with these antisynchronous clusters. Furthermore, as the coupling between nodes changes, active clusters lose their activity at different coupling values, and the network transitions from one activity pattern to another. Numerical simulations have been presented for networks of Van der Pol and Stuart-Landau oscillators. We extend the master stability approach to these patterns and provide stability conditions for their existence.</description>

      <title>Introduction to the theory of mixing for incompressible flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03360v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In these lecture notes, we provide a pedagogical introduction to the theory of mixing for incompressible flows from a PDE perspective. We discuss both the Lagrangian (ODE) and Eulerian (PDE, continuity equation) viewpoints, and introduce suitable notions of mixing scales that quantify the degree to which a scalar field transported by a velocity field becomes mixed. We then address the problem of establishing universal lower bounds on the time evolution of the mixing scale. This is first done in the smooth setting, using energy estimates and flow-based arguments, and later in the Sobolev setting, relying on quantitative estimates for regular Lagrangian flows. Finally, we present recent results concerning the sharpness of these lower bounds, their implications for the geometry and regularity of regular Lagrangian flows, and connections with more recent developments in the literature.</description>

      <title>On a Stationarity Theory for Stochastic Volterra Integral Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper provide a comprehensive analysis of the finite and long time behavior of continuous-time non-Markovian dynamical systems, with a focus on the forward Stochastic Volterra Integral Equations(SVIEs).We investigate the properties of solutions to such equations specifically their stationarity, both over a finite horizon and in the long run. In particular, we demonstrate that such an equation does not exhibit a strong stationary regime unless the kernel is constant or in a degenerate settings. However, we show that it is possible to induce a $\textit{fake stationary regime}$ in the sense that all marginal distributions share the same expectation and variance. This effect is achieved by introducing a deterministic stabilizer $\varsigma$ associated with the kernel.We also look at the $L^p$ -confluence (for $p&gt;0$) of such process as time goes to infinity(i.e. we investigate if its marginals when starting from various initial values are confluent in $L^p$ as time goes to infinity) and finally the functional weak long-run assymptotics for some classes of diffusion coefficients. Those results are applied to the case of Exponential-Fractional Stochastic Volterra Integral Equations, with an $\alpha$-gamma fractional integration kernel, where $\alpha\leq 1$ enters the regime of $\textit{rough path}$ whereas $\alpha&gt; 1$ regularizes diffusion paths and invoke $\textit{long-term memory}$, persistence or long range dependence. With this fake stationary Volterra processes, we introduce a family of stabilized volatility models.</description>

      <title>Exploiting Over-Approximation Errors as Preview Information for Nonlinear Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the control of nonlinear constrained systems via over-approximations. Our key observation is that the over-approximation error, rather than being an unknown disturbance, can be exploited as input-dependent preview information. This leads to the notion of informed policies, which depend on both the state and the error. We formulate the concretization problem -recovering a valid input for the true system from a preview-based policy- as a fixed-point equation. Existence of solutions follows from the Brouwer fixed-point theorem, while efficient computation is enabled through closed-form, linear, or convex programs for input-affine systems, and through an iterative method based on the Banach fixed-point theorem for nonlinear systems.</description>

      <title>Final state sensitivity and fractal basin boundaries from coupled Chialvo neurons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate and quantify the basin geometry and extreme final state uncertainty of two identical electrically asymmetrically coupled Chialvo neurons. The system's diverse behaviors are presented, along with the mathematical reasoning behind its chaotic and nonchaotic dynamics as determined by the structure of the coupled equations. The system is found to be multistable with two qualitatively different attractors. Although each neuron is individually nonchaotic, the chaotic basin takes up the vast majority of the coupled system's state space, but the nonchaotic basin stretches to infinity due to chance synchronization. The boundary between the basins is found to be fractal, leading to extreme final state sensitivity. This uncertainty and its potential effect on the synchronization of biological neurons may have significant implications for understanding human behavior and neurological disease.</description>

      <title>Impact of Resistance Development Mechanisms on Antibiotic Treatment Outcomes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bacteria develop resistance to antibiotics through various mechanisms, with the specific mechanism depending on the drug-bacteria pair. It remains unclear, however, which resistance mechanism best supports favorable treatment outcomes, specifically in clearing infections and inhibiting further resistance. In this study, we use periodic ordinary differential equation models to simulate different antibiotic treatment protocols for bacterial infections. Using stability analysis and numerical simulations, we investigate how different resistance mechanisms, including plasmid-induced and mutation-induced resistance, affect treatment outcomes. Our findings suggest that antibiotic treatments with fixed dosing schedules are more likely to be effective when resistance arises exclusively through plasmid-mediated transmission. Further, when treatment fails, mutation-driven mechanisms tend to favor the selection of fully resistant bacterial strains. We also investigated the efficacy of different treatment strategies based on these mechanisms, finding that a twice-daily regimen consistently outperforms a once-daily regimen in terms of infection clearance. Additionally, our simulations with short half-life antibiotics indicate that the "catch-up" strategy outperforms the "compensatory double-dose" approach after a missed dose, a finding that aligns with general pharmaceutical advice for short-half-life drugs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.03700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop an ab initio approach to describe the statistical behavior of finite-size fluctuations in the Kuramoto-Sakaguchi model. We obtain explicit expressions for the covariance function of fluctuations of the complex order parameter and determine the variance of its magnitude entirely in terms of the equation parameters. Our results rely on an explicit complex-valued formula for solutions of the Adler equation. We present analytical results for both the sub- and the super-critical case. Moreover, our framework does not require any prior knowledge about the structure of the partially synchronized state. We corroborate our results with numerical simulations of the full Kuramoto-Sakaguchi model. The proposed methodology is sufficiently general such that it can be applied to other interacting particle systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.03713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a conformal vector field on a closed, real-analytic, Lorentzian manifold we prove that the flow is locally isometric -- that it preserves a metric in the conformal class on a neighborhood of any point -- or the metric is everywhere conformally flat. The main theorem can be viewed as a local version of the Lorentzian Lichnerowicz conjecture in the real-analytic setting. The key result is an optimal improvement of the local normal forms for conformal vector fields of [FM13], which focused on non-linearizable singularities. This article is primarily concerned with essential linearizable singularities, and the proofs include global arguments which rely on the compactness assumption.</description>

Abstract: This study presents a mathematical model describing cloned hematopoiesis in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) through a nonlinear system of differential equations. The primary objective is to understand the progression from healthy hematopoiesis to the chronic and accelerated-acute phases in myeloid leukemia. The model incorporates intrinsic cellular division events in hematopoiesis and delineates the evolution of chronic myeloid leukemia into five compartments: cycling stem cells, quiescent stem cells, progenitor cells, differentiated cells and terminally differentiated cells. Our analysis reveals the existence of three distinct non-zero steady states within the dynamical system, representing healthy hematopoiesis, the chronic phase and the accelerated-acute stage of the disease. We investigate the local and global stability of these steady states and provide a characterization of the hematopoietic states based on this analysis. Additionally, numerical simulations are included to illustrate the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Causal Discovery in Nonlinear Dynamical Systems using Koopman Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10103v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a theory of causality in dynamical systems using Koopman operators. Our theory is grounded on a rigorous definition of causal mechanism in dynamical systems given in terms of flow maps. In the Koopman framework, we prove that causal mechanisms manifest as particular flows of observables between function subspaces. While the flow map definition is a clear generalization of the standard definition of causal mechanism given in the structural causal model framework, the flow maps are complicated objects that are not tractable to work with in practice. By contrast, the equivalent Koopman definition lends itself to a straightforward data-driven algorithm that can quantify multivariate causal relations in high-dimensional nonlinear dynamical systems. The coupled Rossler system provides examples and demonstrations throughout our exposition. We also demonstrate the utility of our data-driven Koopman causality measure by identifying causal flow in the Lorenz 96 system. We show that the causal flow identified by our data-driven algorithm agrees with the information flow identified through a perturbation propagation experiment. Our work provides new theoretical insights into causality for nonlinear dynamical systems, as well as a new toolkit for data-driven causal analysis.</description>

Abstract: We study a fast-slow version of the Bazykin-Berezovskaya predator-prey model with Allee effect evolving on two timescales, through the lenses of Geometric Singular Perturbation Theory (GSPT). The system we consider is in non-standard form. We completely characterize its dynamics, providing explicit threshold quantities to distinguish between a rich variety of possible asymptotic behaviors. Moreover, we propose numerical results to illustrate our findings. Lastly, we comment on the real-world interpretation of these results, in an economic framework and in the context of predator-prey models.</description>

      <title>High-dimensional dynamics in low-dimensional networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13727v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many networks in nature and applications have an approximate low-rank structure in the sense that their connectivity structure is dominated by a few dimensions. It is natural to expect that dynamics on such networks would also be low-dimensional. Indeed, theoretical results show that low-rank networks produce low-dimensional dynamics whenever the network is isolated from external perturbations or input. However, networks in nature are rarely isolated. Here, we study the dimensionality of dynamics in recurrent networks with low-dimensional structure driven by high-dimensional inputs or perturbations. We find that dynamics in such networks can be high- or low-dimensional and we derive precise conditions on the network structure under which dynamics are high-dimensional. In many low-rank networks, dynamics are suppressed in directions aligned with the network's low-rank structure, a phenomenon we term ``low-rank suppression.'' We show that several low-rank network structures arising in nature satisfy the conditions for generating high-dimensional dynamics and low-rank suppression. Our results clarify important, but counterintuitive relationships between a recurrent network's connectivity structure and the structure of the dynamics it generates.</description>

      <title>Retrodicting Chaotic Systems: An Algorithmic Information Theory Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04780v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Making accurate inferences about data is a key task in science and mathematics. Here we study the problem of \emph{retrodiction}, inferring past values of a series, in the context of chaotic dynamical systems. Specifically, we are interested in inferring the starting value $x_0$ in the series $x_0,x_1,x_2,\dots,x_n$ given the value of $x_n$, and the associated function $f$ which determines the series as $f(x_i)=x_{i+1}$. Even in the deterministic case this is a challenging problem, due to mixing and the typically exponentially many candidate past values in the pre-image of any given value $x_n$ (e.g., a current observation). We study this task from the perspective of algorithmic information theory, which motivates two approaches: One to search for the `simplest' value in the set of candidates, and one to look for the value in the lowest density region of the candidates. We test these methods numerically on the logistic map, Tent map, Bernoulli map, and Julia/Mandelbrot map, which are well-studied maps in chaos theory. The methods aid in retrodiction by assigning low ranks to candidates which are more likely to be the true starting value. Our approach works well in some parameter and map cases, and outperforms several other retrodiction techniques (each of which fails to outperform random guessing). Nonetheless, the approach is not effective in all cases, and several open problems remain including computational cost and sensitivity to noise. All of these methods are unified through a Gaussian Process (GP) perspective, motivating complexity-based priors for GPs.</description>

      <title>Exponential mixing of frame flows for three dimensional manifolds of quarter-pinched negative curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01593v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a compact three-dimensional smooth Riemannian manifold of strictly 1/4-pinched negative sectional curvature, we establish exponential mixing of the frame flow with respect to the normalized volume. More generally this result extends to a class of torus extensions of Anosov flows, subject to assumptions on the Brin transitivity group and the smoothness of the stable subbundle. Our approach is based on a simplified dynamical model for studying the extension flow, constructed via a Young tower of the underlying Anosov flow. Exponential mixing is then obtained through a strengthened Dolgopyat type estimate on the corresponding transfer operators.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we provide a finite random iterated function system satisfying the open set condition, for which the random version of Bowen's formula fails to hold.

      <title>Bifurcations of twisted solutions in a continuum limit for the Kuramoto model on nearest neighbor graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.22663v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study bifurcations of twisted solutions in a continuum limit (CL) for the Kuramoto model (KM) of identical oscillators defined on nearest neighbor graphs, which may be deterministic dense, random dense or random sparse, when it may have phase-lag. We use the center manifold reduction, which is a standard technique in dynamical systems theory, and prove that the CL suffers bifurcations at which the one-parameter family of twisted solutions becomes unstable and a stable or unstable two-parameter family of modulated twisted solutions that oscillate or not depending on whether the phase-lag exists or not is born. We demonstrate the theoretical results by numerical simulations for the KM on deterministic dense, random dense and random sparse graphs.</description>

      <title>Variational closures for composite homogenised fluid flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10408v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Homogenisation theory has seen recent applications in deriving stochastic transport models for fluid dynamics. In this work, we first derive the stochastic Lagrange-to-Euler map that underpins stochastic transport noise in fluid dynamics as the homogenisation limit of a parameterised flow map decomposing into rapidly fluctuating and slow components. Specifically, we prove convergence of this parameterised flow map to a scale-separated limit under the assumptions of a weak invariance principle for the rapidly fluctuating component and path continuity for the slow component. In this limit, the rapidly fluctuating component converges to a stochastic flow of diffeomorphisms that transforms the full flow dynamics into an SDE-governed stochastic flow through composition, while the slow component requires closure.
  Our second contribution formulates two distinct variational closures for the slow component of the homogenised flow that exploit the composite structure of the stochastic flow. For the first closure, the critical points of a new variational principle satisfy a system of random-coefficient PDEs, which can be transformed into a system of stochastic PDEs via the coadjoint action of the stochastic flow map obtained from homogenising the fluctuating component. We show that these equations coincide with the stochastic Euler-Poincar\'e equations previously derived in Holm, Proc. Royal Soc. (2015). For the second closure, we modify the assumptions on the slow component and the associated variational principle to derive averaged models inspired by previous work on mean flow dynamics such as the Generalised Lagrangian Mean.</description>

Abstract: We prove for a $\Theta-$positive representation from a discrete subgroup $\Gamma\subset \mathsf{PSL}(2,\mathbb{R})$, the critical exponent for any $\alpha\in \Theta$ is not greater than one. When $\Gamma$ is geometrically finite, the equality holds if and only if $\Gamma$ is a lattice.</description>

      <title>All fractional Shapiro steps in the RSJ model with two Josephson harmonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20502v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Synchronization between the internal dynamics of the superconducting phase in a Josephson junction (JJ) and an external ac signal is a fundamental physical phenomenon, manifesting as constant-voltage Shapiro steps in the current-voltage characteristic. Mathematically, this phase-locking effect is captured by the Resistively Shunted Junction (RSJ) model, an important example of a nonlinear dynamical system. The standard RSJ model considers an overdamped JJ with a sinusoidal (single-harmonic) current-phase relation (CPR) in the current-driven regime with a monochromatic ac component. While this model predicts only integer Shapiro steps, the inclusion of higher Josephson harmonics is known to generate fractional Shapiro steps. In this paper, we show that only two Josephson harmonics in the CPR are sufficient to produce all possible fractional Shapiro steps within the RSJ framework. Using perturbative methods, we analyze the amplitudes of these fractional steps. Furthermore, by introducing a phase shift between the two Josephson harmonics, we reveal an asymmetry between positive and negative fractional steps - a signature of the Josephson diode effect.</description>

      <title>Consecutive collision orbits in the restricted three-body problem above the first critical energy value</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01735v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the planar circular restricted three-body problem for energy levels slightly above the first critical value. We first observe that the energy hypersurfaces in the Birkhoff regularization corresponding to these energy levels are of contact type. Then, using a version of Rabinowitz Floer homology, we establish the existence of either a periodic symmetric collision orbit or infinitely many symmetric consecutive collision orbits. Furthermore, by an analytic continuation argument, for generic mass ratios and energy levels, we prove that there is no periodic symmetric collision orbit with odd number of collisions. This in turn implies the existence of at least two symmetric consecutive collision orbits.</description>

      <title>Degenerate symplectic fixed points and Gromov-Witten invariants</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04191v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we establish a connection between Gromov-Witten invariants and the number of degenerate fixed points of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms on a closed rational symplectic manifold via deformed Hamiltonian spectral invariants. We prove a new cuplength estimate, in particular including Arnol'd conjecture over complex numbers, for fixed points of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms on closed rational symplectic manifolds admitting nonzero Gromov-Witten invariants with two point insertions. We extend Schwarz's quantum cuplength to the notion of deformed quantum cuplength for symplectic periods and employ it to estimate the number of fixed points of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms on monotone symplectic manifolds with nonzero mixed Gromov-Witten invariants. We generalize Givental's symplectic fixed point theorem for toric manifolds to closed rational symplectic manifolds admitting nonzero Gromov-Witten invariants with fixed marked points and one point insertion.</description>
