      <title>Scaling limit for small blocks in the Chinese restaurant process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Chinese restaurant process is a basic sequential construction of consistent random partitions. We consider random point measures describing the composition of small blocks in such partitions and show that their scaling limit is given by the projective limit of certain inhomogeneous Poisson measures on spaces of increasing dimension. This result makes it possible to derive classical and functional limit theorems in the Skorokhod topology for various characteristics of the Chinese restaurant process.</description>

      <title>Strong law of large numbers for random walks in weakly dependent random scenery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this brief note, we study the strong law of large numbers for random walks in random scenery. Under the assumptions that the random scenery is non-stationary and satisfies weakly dependent condition with an appropriate rate, we establish strong law of large numbers for random walks in random scenery. Our results extend the known results in the literature.</description>

      <title>An estimate for $\beta$-Hermite ensembles via the zeros of Hermite polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X$ be an $N$-dimensional random vector which describes the ordered eigenvalues of a $\beta$-Hermite ensemble, and let $z$ the vector containing the ordered zeros of the Hermite poynomial $H_N$. We present an explicit estimate for $P(\|X-z\|_2\ge\epsilon)$ for small $\epsilon&gt;0$ and large parameters $\beta$. The proof is based on a central limit theorem for these ensembles for $\beta\to\infty$ with explicit eigenvalues of the covariance matrices of the limit. The estimate is similar to previous estimates of Dette and Imhof (2009).</description>

      <title>Uniqueness of generalized conformal restriction measures and Malliavin-Kontsevich-Suhov measures for $c\in(0,1]$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05890v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a unified approach to establish the uniqueness of generalized conformal restriction measures with central charge $c \in (0, 1]$ in both chordal and radial cases, by relating these measures to the Brownian loop soup. Our method also applies to the uniqueness of the Malliavin-Kontsevich-Suhov loop measures for $c \in (0,1]$, which was recently obtained in [Baverez-Jego, arXiv:2407.09080] for all $c \leq 1$ through deep algebraic structures of SLE loop measures. In contrast, though only valid for $c \in (0,1]$, our proof is significantly simpler, as it directly links natural quantities of MKS measures to loop-soup observables.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity analysis of path-dependent options in an incomplete market with pathwise functional Ito calculus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Functional It^o calculus is based on an extension of the classical It^o calculus to functionals depending on the entire past evolution of the underlying paths and not only on its current value. The calculus builds on Follmer's deterministic proof of the It^o formula, see [3], and a notion of pathwise functional derivatives introduced by [5]. There are no smoothness assumptions required on the functionals, however, they are required to possess certain directional derivatives which may be computed pathwise, see [6, 9, 8]. Using functional It^o calculus and the notion of quadratic variation, we derive the functional It^o formula along with the Feynman-Kac formula for functional processes. Furthermore, we express the Greeks for path-dependent options as expectations, which can be efficiently computed numerically using Monte Carlo simulations. We illustrate these results by applying the formulae to digital options within the Black-Scholes model framework.</description>

      <title>Cutoff for congestion dynamics and related generalized exclusion processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider congestion dynamics with $n$ players and $Q$ resources under the constraint that the number of each resource is $\kappa$ and that $n&lt;\kappa Q$ in the regime that $n$ and $\kappa$ diverge but $Q$ is fixed with $n=\lfloor{\rho \kappa Q\rfloor}$ for a fixed constant $\rho \in (0, 1/2]$. We show that the Glauber dynamics and its unlabeled version exhibit cutoff at time $(1/2)n \log n$ and $(1/2)(1-\rho)n\log n$ in total variation respectively. The unlabeled version is a special case of natural Markov chains for sampling from log M-concave distributions. We also show that a family of Markov chains for uniform sampling on M-convex sets does not necessarily exhibit cutoff.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Universality of Products Over Split Reductive Groups and the Satake Isomorphism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish that the singular numbers (arising from Cartan decomposition) and corners (emerging from Iwasawa decomposition) in split reductive groups over non-archimedean fields are fundamentally determined by Hall-Littlewood polynomials. Through applications of the Satake isomorphism, we extend Van Peski's results (arXiv:2011.09356, Theorem 1.3) to encompass arbitrary root systems. Leveraging this theoretical foundation, we further develop Shen's work (arXiv:2411.01104, Theorem 1.1) to demonstrate that both singular numbers and corners of such products exhibit minimal separation. This characterization enables the derivation of asymptotic properties for singular numbers in matrix products, particularly establishing the strong law of large numbers and central limit theorem for these quantities. Our results provide a unified framework connecting algebraic decomposition structures with probabilistic limit theorems in non-archimedean settings.</description>

      <title>Nonasymptotic and distribution-uniform Koml\'os-Major-Tusn\'ady approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present nonasymptotic concentration inequalities for sums of independent and identically distributed random variables that yield asymptotic strong Gaussian approximations of Koml\'os, Major, and Tusn\'ady (KMT) [1975,1976]. The constants appearing in our inequalities are either universal or explicit, and thus as corollaries, they imply distribution-uniform generalizations of the aforementioned KMT approximations. In particular, it is shown that uniform integrability of a random variable's $q^{\text{th}}$ moment is both necessary and sufficient for the KMT approximations to hold uniformly at the rate of $o(n^{1/q})$ for $q &gt; 2$ and that having a uniformly lower bounded Sakhanenko parameter -- equivalently, a uniformly upper-bounded Bernstein parameter -- is both necessary and sufficient for the KMT approximations to hold uniformly at the rate of $O(\log n)$. Instantiating these uniform results for a single probability space yields the analogous results of KMT exactly.</description>

      <title>Maximum flow and self-avoiding walk on bunkbed graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider two combinatorial models on bunkbed graphs: maximum flow and self-avoiding walks. A bunkbed graph is defined as the Cartesian product $G\times K_2$, where $G$ is a finite graph and $K_2$ is the complete graph on two vertices, labelled $0$ and $1$. For the maximum flow problem, we show that if the bunkbed graph $G\times K_2$ has non-negative, reflection-symmetric edge capacities, then for any $u, v\in V(G)$, the maximum flow strength from $(u,0)$ to $(v,0)$ in $G\times K_2$ is at least as large as that from $(u,0)$ to $(v,1)$.
  For the self-avoiding walk model on a bunkbed graph $G\times K_2$, we investigate whether there are more self-avoiding walks from $(u,0)$ to $(v,1)$ than from $(u,0)$ to $(v,0)$. We prove that this holds when $G=K_n$ is a complete graph and $n$ is sufficiently large. Additionally, we provide examples where the statement does not holds and pose the question of whether it remains true when $\{u,v\}$ is not a cut-edge of $G$.</description>

      <title>Cutoff for geodesic paths on hyperbolic manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish new instances of the cutoff phenomenon for geodesic paths and for the Brownian motion on compact hyperbolic manifolds. We prove that for any fixed compact hyperbolic manifold, the geodesic path started on a spatially localized initial condition exhibits cutoff. Our work also extends results obtained by Golubev and Kamber on hyperbolic surfaces of large volume to any dimension. Our proof builds upon a spectral strategy introduced by Lubetzky and Peres for Ramanujan graphs and on a detailed spectral analysis of the spherical mean operator.</description>

      <title>On the limit of random hives with GUE boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that hives chosen at random with independent GUE boundary conditions on two sides, weighted by a Vandermonde factor depending on the third side (which is necessary in the context of the randomized Horn problem), when normalized so that the eigenvalues at the edge are asymptotically constant, converge in probability to a continuum hive as $n \rightarrow \infty.$ It had previously been shown in joint work with Sheffield and Tao \cite{NST} that the variance of these scaled random hives tends to $0$ and consequently, from compactness, that they converge in probability subsequentially. In the present paper, building on \cite{NST}, we prove convergence in probability to a single continuum hive, without having to pass to a subsequence. We moreover show that the value at a given point $v$ of this continuum hive equals the supremum of a certain functional acting on asymptotic height functions of lozenge tilings.</description>

      <title>On uniform in time propagation of chaos in metastable cases: the Curie-Weiss model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many low temperature particle systems in mean-field interaction are ergodic with respect to a unique invariant measure, while their (non-linear) mean-field limit may possess several steady states. In particular, in such cases, propagation of chaos (i.e. the convergence of the particle system to its mean-field limit as n, the number of particles, goes to infinity) cannot hold uniformly in time since the long-time behaviors of the two processes are a priori incompatible. However, the particle system may be metastable, and the time needed to exit the basin of attraction of one of the steady states of its limit, and go to another, is exponentially (in n) long. Before this exit time, the particle system reaches a (quasi-)stationary distribution, which we expect to be a good approximation of the corresponding non-linear steady state. Our goal is to study the typical metastable behavior of the empirical measure of such mean-field systems, starting in this work with the Curie-Weiss model. We thus show uniform in time propagation of chaos of the spin system conditioned to keeping a positive magnetization.</description>

      <title>Gradient flow of the infinite-volume free energy for lattice systems of continuous spins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider an infinite lattice system of interacting spins living on a smooth compact manifold, with short- but not necessarily finite-range pairwise interactions. We construct the gradient flow of the infinite-volume free energy on the space of translation-invariant spin measures, using an adaptation of the variational approach in Wasserstein space pioneered by Jordan, Kinderlehrer, and Otto. We also construct the infinite-volume diffusion corresponding to the so-called overdamped Langevin dynamics of the spins under the effect of the interactions and of thermal agitation.
  We show that the trajectories of the gradient flow and of the law of the spins under this diffusion both satisfy, in a weak sense, the same hierarchy of coupled parabolic PDE's, which we interpret as an infinite-volume Fokker--Planck--Kolmogorov equation. We prove regularity of weak solutions and derive an Evolution Variational Inequality for regular solutions, which implies uniqueness. Thus, in particular, the trajectories of the gradient flow coincide with those obtained from the Langevin dynamics.
  Concerning the long-time evolution, we check that the free energy is always non-increasing along the flow and that moreover, if the Ricci curvature of the spin space is uniformly positive, then at high enough temperature the dynamics converges exponentially, in free energy and in specific Wasserstein distance, to the unique minimizer of the infinite-volume free energy.</description>

      <title>Quasi-stationary distributions for subcritical population models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Subcritical population processes are attracted to extinction and do not have stationary distributions, which prompts the study of quasi-stationary distributions (QSDs) instead. In contrast to what generally happens for stationary distributions, QSDs may not be unique, even under irreducibility conditions. The characteristics of the process that may prevent it from possessing multiple QSDs are not entirely clear. For the branching process, besides the quasi-limiting distribution there are many other QSDs. In this paper, we investigate whether adding little extra information to the branching process is enough to obtain uniqueness. We consider the branching process with genealogy and branching random walks, and show that they have a unique QSD.</description>

      <title>Scaling limit of the Aldous-Broder chain on regular graphs: the transient regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The continuum random tree is the scaling limit of the uniform spanning tree on the complete graph with $N$ vertices. The Aldous-Broder chain on a graph $G=(V,E)$ is a discrete-time stochastic process with values in the space of rooted trees whose vertex set is a subset of $V$ which is stationary under the uniform distribution on the space of rooted trees spanning $G$. In Evans, Pitman and Winter (2006) the so-called root growth with re-grafting process (RGRG) was constructed. Further it was shown that the suitable rescaled Aldous-Broder chain converges to the RGRG weakly with respect to the Gromov-Hausdorff topology. It was shown in Peres and Revelle (2005) that (up to a dimension depending constant factor) the continuum random tree is, with respect to the Gromov-weak topology, the scaling limit of the uniform spanning tree on $\mathbb{Z}_N^d$, $d\ge 5$. This result was recently strengthens in Archer, Nachmias and Shalev (2024) to convergence with respect to the Gromov-Hausdorff-weak topology, and therefore also with respect to the Gromov-Hausdorff topology. In the present paper we show that also the suitable rescaled Aldous-Broder chain converges to the RGRG weakly with respect to the Gromov-Hausdorff topology when initially started in the trivial rooted tree. We give conditions on the increasing graph sequence under which the result extends to regular graphs and give probabilistic expressions scales at which time has to be speed up and edge lengths have to be scaled down.</description>

      <title>Talagrand Meets Talagrand: Upper and Lower Bounds on Expected Soft Maxima of Gaussian Processes with Finite Index Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analysis of extremal behavior of stochastic processes is a key ingredient in a wide variety of applications, including probability, statistical physics, theoretical computer science, and learning theory. In this paper, we consider centered Gaussian processes on finite index sets and investigate expected values of their smoothed, or ``soft,'' maxima. We obtain upper and lower bounds for these expected values using a combination of ideas from statistical physics (the Gibbs variational principle for the equilibrium free energy and replica-symmetric representations of Gibbs averages) and from probability theory (Sudakov minoration). These bounds are parametrized by an inverse temperature $\beta &gt; 0$ and reduce to the usual Gaussian maximal inequalities in the zero-temperature limit $\beta \to \infty$. We provide an illustration of our methods in the context of the Random Energy Model, one of the simplest models of physical systems with random disorder.</description>

      <title>Operator $\ell^\infty \to \ell^\infty$ norm of products of random matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the $\ell^\infty \to \ell^\infty$ operator norm of products of independent random matrices with independent and identically distributed entries. For $n$-by-$n$ matrices whose entries are centered, have unit variance, and have a finite moment of order $4\alpha$ for some $\alpha &gt; 1$, we find that the operator norm of the product of $p$ matrices behaves asymptotically like $n^{\frac {p+1}{2}}\sqrt{2/\pi}$. The case of products of possibly non-square matrices with possibly non-centered entries is also covered.</description>

      <title>A switching identity for cable-graph loop soups and Gaussian free fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06754v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a "switching identity" that can be stated for critical Brownian loop-soups or for the Gaussian free field on a cable graph: It basically says that at the level of cluster configurations and at the more general level of the occupation time fields, conditioning two points on the cable-graph to belong to the same cluster of Brownian loops (or equivalently to the same sign-cluster of the GFF) amounts to adding a random odd number of independent Brownian excursions between these points to an otherwise unconditioned configuration. This explicit simple description of the conditional law of the clusters when a connection occurs has various direct consequences, in particular about the large scale behaviour of these sign-clusters on infinite graphs.</description>

      <title>Loss Functions for Inventory Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide analytic expressions for the first-order loss function, the complementary loss function and the second-order loss function for several probability distributions. These loss functions are important functions in inventory optimization and other quantitative fields. For several reasons, which will become apparent throughout this paper, the implementation of these loss functions prefers the use of an analytic expression, only using standard probability functions. However, complete and consistent references of analytic expressions for these loss functions are lacking in literature. This paper aims to close this gap and can serve as a reference for researchers, software engineers and practitioners that are concerned with the optimization of a quantitative system. This should lead directly to easily using different probability distributions in quantitive models which is at the core of optimization. Also, this paper serves as a broad introduction to loss functions and their use in inventory control.</description>

      <title>Approximating the total variation distance between spin systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin systems form an important class of undirected graphical models. For two Gibbs distributions $\mu$ and $\nu$ induced by two spin systems on the same graph $G = (V, E)$, we study the problem of approximating the total variation distance $d_{TV}(\mu,\nu)$ with an $\epsilon$-relative error. We propose a new reduction that connects the problem of approximating the TV-distance to sampling and approximate counting. Our applications include the hardcore model and the antiferromagnetic Ising model in the uniqueness regime, the ferromagnetic Ising model, and the general Ising model satisfying the spectral condition.
  Additionally, we explore the computational complexity of approximating the total variation distance $d_{TV}(\mu_S,\nu_S)$ between two marginal distributions on an arbitrary subset $S \subseteq V$. We prove that this problem remains hard even when both $\mu$ and $\nu$ admit polynomial-time sampling and approximate counting algorithms.</description>

      <title>Characterisation of optimal solutions to second-order Beckmann problem through bimartingale couplings and leaf decompositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05683v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We completely characterise the optimal solutions for the three-marginal optimal transport problem - introduced in [K. Bolbotowski, G. Bouchitt\'e, Kantorovich-Rubinstein duality theory for the Hessian, 2024, preprint], and whose relaxation is the second-order Beckmann problem - for arbitrary pairs $\mu,\nu\in\mathcal{P}_2(\mathbb{R}^n)$ of absolutely continuous measures with common barycentre.
  In our work, we define the concept of bimartingale couplings for a pair of measures and establish several equivalent conditions that ensure such couplings exist. One of these conditions is that the pair is ordered according to the convex-concave order, thereby generalising the classical Strassen theorem. Another equivalent condition is that the dual problem associated with the second-order Beckmann problem attains its optimum at a $\mathcal{C}^{1,1}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ function with isometric derivative.
  We prove that the problem for $\mu,\nu$ completely decomposes into a collection of simpler problems on the leaves of the $1$-Lipschitz derivative $Du$ of an optimal solution $u\in\mathcal{C}^{1,1}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ for the dual problem. On each such, leaf the solution is expressed in terms of bimartingale couplings between conditional measures of $\mu,\nu$, where the conditioning is defined relative to the foliation induced by $Du$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For sink-free orientations in graphs of minimum degree at least $3$, we show that there is a deterministic approximate counting algorithm that runs in time $O((n^{73}/\varepsilon^{72})\log(n/\varepsilon))$, a near-linear time sampling algorithm, and a randomised approximate counting algorithm that runs in time $O((n/\varepsilon)^2\log(n/\varepsilon))$, where $n$ denotes the number of vertices of the input graph and $0&lt;\varepsilon&lt;1$ is the desired accuracy. All three algorithms are based on a local implementation of the sink popping method (Cohn, Pemantle, Propp, 2002) under the partial rejection sampling framework (Guo, Jerrum, Liu, 2019).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05896v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: These notes introduce probabilistic landscape models defined on high-dimensional discrete sequence spaces. The models are motivated primarily by fitness landscapes in evolutionary biology, but links to statistical physics and computer science are mentioned where appropriate. Elementary and advanced results on the structure of landscapes are described with a focus on features that are relevant to evolutionary searches, such as the number of local maxima and the existence of fitness-monotonic paths. The recent discovery of submodularity as a biologically meaningful property of fitness landscapes and its consequences for their accessibility is discussed in detail.</description>

Abstract: We consider a strategic M/M/1 queueing model under a first-come-first-served regime, where customers are split into two classes and class $A$ has priority over class $B$. Customers can decide whether to join the queue or balk, and, in case they have joined the queue, whether and when to renege. We study the equilibrium strategies and compare the equilibrium outcome and the social optimum in the two cases where the social optimum is or is not constrained by priority.</description>

We prove that if we have $\psi_k(f) \le t$ for all $k$, then the threshold interval of $f$ has length $\displaystyle O \left(\frac {1}{\log (1/t)}\right)$. We also prove that if $f$ is balanced and $b_k(f) \le t$ for every $k$, then $\displaystyle \max_{k} \psi_k(f) \le O\left(\frac {\log \log (1/t)}{\log(1/t)}\right) $.</description>

      <title>ID policy (with reassignment) is asymptotically optimal for heterogeneous weakly-coupled MDPs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Heterogeneity poses a fundamental challenge for many real-world large-scale decision-making problems but remains largely understudied. In this paper, we study the fully heterogeneous setting of a prominent class of such problems, known as weakly-coupled Markov decision processes (WCMDPs). Each WCMDP consists of $N$ arms (or subproblems), which have distinct model parameters in the fully heterogeneous setting, leading to the curse of dimensionality when $N$ is large. We show that, under mild assumptions, a natural adaptation of the ID policy, although originally proposed for a homogeneous special case of WCMDPs, in fact achieves an $O(1/\sqrt{N})$ optimality gap in long-run average reward per arm for fully heterogeneous WCMDPs as $N$ becomes large. This is the first asymptotic optimality result for fully heterogeneous average-reward WCMDPs. Our techniques highlight the construction of a novel projection-based Lyapunov function, which witnesses the convergence of rewards and costs to an optimal region in the presence of heterogeneity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show how the AGM framework for belief change (expansion, revision, contraction) can be extended to deal with conditioning in the so-called Desirability-Indifference framework, based on abstract notions of accepting and rejecting options, as well as on abstract notions of events. This level of abstraction allows us to deal simultaneously with classical and quantum probability theory.</description>

Abstract: We can learn (more) about the state a quantum system is in through measurements. We look at how to describe the uncertainty about a quantum system's state conditional on executing such measurements. We show that by exploiting the interplay between desirability, coherence and indifference, a general rule for conditioning can be derived. We then apply this rule to conditioning on measurement outcomes, and show how it generalises to conditioning on a set of measurement outcomes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, Cella and Martin proved how, under an assumption called consonance, a credal set (i.e. a closed and convex set of probabilities) can be derived from the conformal transducer associated with transductive conformal prediction. We show that the Imprecise Highest Density Region (IHDR) associated with such a credal set corresponds to the classical Conformal Prediction Region. In proving this result, we relate the set of probability density/mass functions (pdf/pmf's) associated with the elements of the credal set to the imprecise probabilistic concept of a cloud. As a result, we establish new relationships between Conformal Prediction and Imprecise Probability (IP) theories. A byproduct of our presentation is the discovery that consonant plausibility functions are monoid homomorphisms, a new algebraic property of an IP tool.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06356v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we make a survey on the so called randomization method, a recent methodology to study stochastic optimization problems. It allows to represent the value function of an optimal control problem by a suitable backward stochastic differential equation (BSDE), by means of an auxiliary optimization problem having the same value as the starting one. This method works for a large class of control problems and provides a BSDE representation to many related PDEs of Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman type, even in the fully non linear case. After a general informal introduction we explain the method giving full details in a basic case. Then we try to give a complete picture of the existing applications and we present some related open problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the problem of estimating the drift parameter in a system of $N$ interacting particles driven by additive fractional Brownian motion of Hurst index \( H \geq 1/2 \). Considering continuous observation of the interacting particles over a fixed interval \([0, T]\), we examine the asymptotic regime as \( N \to \infty \). Our main tool is a random variable reminiscent of the least squares estimator but unobservable due to its reliance on the Skorohod integral. We demonstrate that this object is consistent and asymptotically normal by establishing a quantitative propagation of chaos for Malliavin derivatives, which holds for any \( H \in (0,1) \). Leveraging a connection between the divergence integral and the Young integral, we construct computable estimators of the drift parameter. These estimators are shown to be consistent and asymptotically Gaussian. Finally, a numerical study highlights the strong performance of the proposed estimators.</description>

      <title>Decay of correlation for edge colorings when $q&gt;3\Delta$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine various perspectives on the decay of correlation for the uniform distribution over proper $q$-edge colorings of graphs with maximum degree $\Delta$.
  First, we establish the coupling independence property when $q\ge 3\Delta$ for general graphs. Together with the work of Chen et al. (2024), this result implies a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme (FPTAS) for counting the number of proper $q$-edge colorings.
  Next, we prove the strong spatial mixing property on trees, provided that $q&gt; (3+o(1))\Delta$. The strong spatial mixing property is derived from the spectral independence property of a version of the weighted edge coloring distribution, which is established using the matrix trickle-down method developed in Abdolazimi, Liu and Oveis Gharan (FOCS, 2021) and Wang, Zhang and Zhang (STOC, 2024).
  Finally, we show that the weak spatial mixing property holds on trees with maximum degree $\Delta$ if and only if $q\ge 2\Delta-1$.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Approximation and Multiplier Bootstrap for Stochastic Gradient Descent</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish non-asymptotic convergence rates in the central limit theorem for Polyak-Ruppert-averaged iterates of stochastic gradient descent (SGD). Our analysis builds on the result of the Gaussian approximation for nonlinear statistics of independent random variables of Shao and Zhang (2022). Using this result, we prove the non-asymptotic validity of the multiplier bootstrap for constructing the confidence sets for the optimal solution of an optimization problem. In particular, our approach avoids the need to approximate the limiting covariance of Polyak-Ruppert SGD iterates, which allows us to derive approximation rates in convex distance of order up to $1/\sqrt{n}$.</description>

Abstract: We derive first-order Pontryagin optimality conditions for stochastic optimal control with deterministic controls for systems modeled by rough differential equations (RDE) driven by Gaussian rough paths. This Pontryagin Maximum Principle (PMP) applies to systems following stochastic differential equations (SDE) driven by Brownian motion, yet it does not rely on forward-backward SDEs and involves the same Hamiltonian as the deterministic PMP. The proof consists of first deriving various integrable error bounds for solutions to nonlinear and linear RDEs by leveraging recent results on Gaussian rough paths. The PMP then follows using standard techniques based on needle-like variations. As an application, we propose the first indirect shooting method for nonlinear stochastic optimal control and show that it converges 10x faster than a direct method on a stabilization task.</description>

      <title>Local asymptotic properties for the growth rate of a jump-type CIR process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.00358</link>
      <description>arXiv:1903.00358v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a one-dimensional jump-type Cox-Ingersoll-Ross process driven by a Brownian motion and a subordinator, whose growth rate is an unknown parameter. Considering the process observed continuously or discretely at high frequency, we derive the local asymptotic properties for the growth rate in both ergodic and non-ergodic cases. Local asymptotic normality (LAN) is proved in the subcritical case, local asymptotic quadraticity (LAQ) is derived in the critical case, and local asymptotic mixed normality (LAMN) is shown in the supercritical case. To obtain these results, techniques of Malliavin calculus and a subtle analysis on the jump structure of the subordinator involving the amplitude of jumps and number of jumps are essentially used.</description>

      <title>Rate of convergence of the smoothed empirical Wasserstein distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.02128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.02128v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider an empirical measure $\mathbb{P}_n$ induced by $n$ iid samples from a $d$-dimensional $K$-subgaussian distribution $\mathbb{P}$ and let $\gamma = N(0,\sigma^2 I_d)$ be the isotropic Gaussian measure. We study the speed of convergence of the smoothed Wasserstein distance $W_2(\mathbb{P}_n * \gamma, \mathbb{P}*\gamma) = n^{-\alpha + o(1)}$ with $*$ being the convolution of measures. For $K&lt;\sigma$ and in any dimension $d\ge 1$ we show that $\alpha = {1\over2}$. For $K&gt;\sigma$ in dimension $d=1$ we show that the rate is slower and is given by $\alpha = {(\sigma^2 + K^2)^2\over 4 (\sigma^4 + K^4)} &lt; 1/2$. This resolves several open problems in [GGNWP20], and in particular precisely identifies the amount of smoothing $\sigma$ needed to obtain a parametric rate. In addition, for any $d$-dimensional $K$-subgaussian distribution $\mathbb{P}$, we also establish that $D_{KL}(\mathbb{P}_n * \gamma \|\mathbb{P}*\gamma)$ has rate $O(1/n)$ for $K&lt;\sigma$ but only slows down to $O({(\log n)^{d+1}\over n})$ for $K&gt;\sigma$. The surprising difference of the behavior of $W_2^2$ and KL implies the failure of $T_{2}$-transportation inequality when $\sigma &lt; K$. Consequently, it follows that for $K&gt;\sigma$ the log-Sobolev inequality (LSI) for the Gaussian mixture $\mathbb{P} * N(0, \sigma^{2})$ cannot hold. This closes an open problem in [WW+16], who established the LSI under the condition $K&lt;\sigma$ and asked if their bound can be improved.</description>

      <title>Jointly invariant measures for the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang Equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.17276v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give an explicit description of the jointly invariant measures for the KPZ equation. These are couplings of Brownian motions with drift, and can be extended to a process defined for all drift parameters simultaneously. We term this process the KPZ horizon (KPZH). As a corollary of this description, we resolve a recent conjecture of Janjigian, and the second and third authors by showing the existence of a random, countably infinite dense set of directions at which the Busemann process of the KPZ equation is discontinuous. This signals instability and shows the failure of the one force--one solution principle and the existence of at least two extremal semi-infinite polymer measures in the exceptional directions. As the inverse temperature parameter $\beta$ for the KPZ equation goes to $\infty$, the KPZH converges to the stationary horizon (SH) first introduced by Busani, and studied further by Busani and the third and fourth authors. As $\beta \searrow 0$, the KPZH converges to a coupling of Brownian motions that differ by linear shifts, which is a jointly invariant measure for the Edwards-Wilkinson fixed point.</description>

      <title>First-order behavior of the time constant in non-isotropic continuous first-passage percolation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07509v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider $\Xi$ a homogeneous Poisson point process on $\mathbb{R}^d$ ($d\geq 2$) with unit intensity  with respect to the Lebesgue measure. For $\varepsilon\geq 0$,  we define the Boolean model $\Sigma_{p, \varepsilon}$ as the union of the balls of volume $\varepsilon$ for the $p$-norm ($p\in [1,\infty]$) and centered at the points of $\Xi$. We define a random pseudo-metric on $\mathbb{R}^d$ by associating with any path a travel time equal to its $p$-length outside $\Sigma_{p,\varepsilon}$. This defines a continuous model of first-passage percolation, that has been studied in \cite{GT17,GT22} for $p=2$, the Euclidean norm. For $p=1$, this model is expected to share common properties with the classical first-passage percolation on the graph $\mathbb{Z}^d$ with a distribution of passage times of the form $\varepsilon \delta_0 + (1-\varepsilon) \delta_1$. The exact calculation of the time constant of this model $\tilde \mu_{p,\varepsilon} (x)$ is out of reach. We investigate here the behavior of $\varepsilon \mapsto \tilde \mu_{p,\varepsilon} (x)$ near $0$, and enlighten how the speed at which $\| x \|_p -  \tilde \mu_{p,\varepsilon} (x) $ goes to $0$ depends on $x$ and $p$. For instance, for $p\in (1,\infty)$, we prove that $\| x \|_p  - \tilde \mu_{p,\epsilon} (x)$ is of order $\varepsilon ^{\kappa_p(x)}$ with $$\kappa_p(x): = \frac{1}{d- \frac{d_1(x)-1}{2} - \frac{d-d_1 (x)}{p}}\,,$$where $d_1(x)$ is the number of non null coordinates of $x$. The exact order of $\| x \|_p  - \tilde \mu_{p,\epsilon} (x)$ is also given for $p=1$ and $p=\infty$. Related results are also discussed, about properties of the geodesics, and analog properties on closely related models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03275v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the stationary measure for the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process on a segment with open boundaries is given by a marginal of a two-line measure with a simple and explicit description. We use this representation to analyze asymptotic fluctuations of the height function near the triple point for a larger set of parameters than was previously studied. As a second application, we determine a single expression for the rate function in the large deviation principle for the height function in the fan and in the shock region. We then discuss how this expression relates to the expressions available in the literature.</description>

      <title>Sharp deviation bounds for midpoint and endpoint of geodesics in exponential last passage percolation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18056v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For exponential last passage percolation on the plane we analyse the probability that the point-to-line geodesic exhibits an atypically large transversal fluctuation at the endpoint as well as the probability that the point-to-point geodesic exhibits an atypically large transversal fluctuation at the halfway point. In particular, we show that $p^*_n(t)$, the probability that the point-to-line geodesic from the origin to the line $x+y=2n$ ends at $(n-t(2n)^{2/3}, n+t(2n)^{2/3})$ satisfies that $n^{2/3}p^*_n(t)=\exp(-(\frac{4}{3}+o(1))t^{3})$ for $t$ large and $p_{n,\frac{1}{2}}(t)$, the probability that the geodesic from the origin to the point $(n,n)$ passes through the point $(\frac{1}{2}n-tn^{2/3}, \frac{1}{2} n+tn^{2/3})$, satisfies $n^{2/3}p_{n,\frac{1}{2}}(t)=\exp(-(\frac{8}{3}+o(1))t^3)$ for $t$ large. The latter result solves a special case of a conjecture from Liu (PTRF, 2022).</description>

      <title>From asymmetric simple exclusion processes with open boundaries to stationary measures of open KPZ fixed point: the shock region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09252v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We continue the investigation of limit fluctuations of stationary measures of the asymmetric simple exclusion processes with open boundaries (open ASEP), complementing the recent result by Bryc et al. (2023). It was shown therein that in the fan region of the phase diagram, an appropriate scaling limit of the height function of open ASEP converges in distribution to a stochastic process introduced by Barraquand and Le Doussal (2022), known as the stationary measure of the (conjectural) open KPZ fixed point. In this paper, we establish the corresponding convergence in the shock region. Our proof is based on the integral representation of the matrix product ansatz in terms of Askey-Wilson signed measures introduced by Wang et al. (2024). The analysis of the asymptotic behavior is more delicate here than in the fan region. In particular, our proof of the duality formula for the stationary measures of the open KPZ fixed point in the shock region is different from the approach by Bryc et al. (2023) taken in the fan region: ours relies crucially on a recent result by Bryc and Zatitskii (2024).</description>

      <title>Metastability in Glauber dynamics for heavy-tailed spin glasses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11874v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Glauber dynamics for heavy-tailed spin glasses, in which the couplings are in the domain of attraction of an $\alpha$-stable law for $\alpha\in (0,1)$. We show a sharp description of metastability on exponential timescales, in a form that is believed to hold for Glauber/Langevin dynamics for many mean-field spin glass models, but only known rigorously for the Random Energy Models. Namely, we establish a decomposition of the state space into sub-exponentially many wells, and show that the projection of the Glauber dynamics onto which well it resides in, asymptotically behaves like a Markov chain on wells with certain explicit transition rates. In particular, mixing inside wells occurs on much shorter timescales than transit times between wells, and the law of the next well the Glauber dynamics will fall into depends only on which well it currently resides in, not its full configuration. We can deduce consequences like an exact expression for the two-time autocorrelation functions that appear in the activated aging literature.</description>

      <title>Annulus crossing formulae for critical planar percolation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04767v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive exact formulae for three basic annulus crossing events for the critical planar Bernoulli percolation in the continuum limit. The first is for the probability that there is an open path connecting the two boundaries of an annulus of inner radius $r$ and outer radius $R$. The second is for the probability that there are both open and closed paths connecting the two annulus boundaries. These two results were predicted by Cardy based on non-rigorous Coulomb gas arguments. Our third result gives the probability that there are two disjoint open paths connecting the two boundaries. Its leading asymptotic as $r/R\to 0$ is captured by the so-called backbone exponent, a transcendental number recently determined by Nolin, Qian and two of the authors. This exponent is the unique real root to the equation $\frac{\sqrt{36 x +3}}{4} + \sin (\frac{2 \pi \sqrt{12 x +1}}{3} ) =0$, other than $-\frac{1}{12}$ and $\frac{1}{4}$. Besides these three real roots, this equation has countably many complex roots. Our third result shows that these roots appear exactly as exponents of the subleading terms in the crossing formula. This suggests that the backbone exponent is part of a conformal field theory (CFT) whose bulk spectrum contains this set of roots. Expanding the same crossing probability as $r/R\to 1$, we obtain a series with logarithmic corrections at every order, suggesting that the backbone exponent is related to a logarithmic boundary CFT. Our proofs are based on the coupling between SLE curves and Liouville quantum gravity (LQG). The key is to encode the annulus crossing probabilities by the random moduli of certain LQG surfaces with annular topology, whose law can be extracted from the dependence of the LQG annuli partition function on their boundary lengths.</description>

      <title>On the randomized Horn problem and the surface tension of hives</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12619v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given two nonincreasing $n$-tuples of real numbers $\lambda_n$, $\mu_n$, the Horn problem asks for a description of all nonincreasing $n$-tuples of real numbers $\nu_n$ such that there exist Hermitian matrices $X_n$, $Y_n$ and $Z_n$ respectively with these spectra such that $X_n + Y_n = Z_n$. There is also a randomized version of this problem where $X_n$ and $Y_n$ are sampled uniformly at random from orbits of Hermitian matrices arising from the conjugacy action by elements of the unitary group. One then asks for a description of the probability measure of the spectrum of the sum $Z_n$. Both the original Horn problem and its randomized version have solutions using the hives introduced by Knutson and Tao. In an asymptotic sense, as $n \rightarrow \infty$, large deviations for the randomized Horn problem were given by Narayanan and Sheffield in terms of the surface tension of hives. In this paper, we provide upper and lower bounds on this surface tension function. We also obtain a closed-form expression for the total entropy of a surface tension minimizing continuum hive with boundary conditions arising from GUE eigenspectra. Finally, we give several empirical results for random hives and lozenge tilings arising from an application of the octahedron recurrence for large $n$ and a numerical approximation of the surface tension function.</description>

Abstract: The exponential ergodicity in the \( L^1 \)-Wasserstein distance for partially dissipative McKean-Vlasov SDEs has been extensively studied. However, the question of exponential ergodicity in the \( L^2 \)-Wasserstein distance and relative entropy has remained unresolved. This paper addresses the problem by establishing the log-Sobolev inequality for both the time-marginal distributions and the invariant probability measure, providing a positive resolution. As part of the groundwork, the log-Sobolev inequality is investigated for the associated time-inhomogeneous semigroup. The main results are further extended to degenerate diffusion.</description>

      <title>Almost sure central limit theorems via chaos expansions and related results</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00759v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the asymptotic behavior of integral functionals of stationary Gaussian random fields as the integration domain tends to be the whole space. More precisely, using the Wiener chaos expansion and Malliavin-Stein method, we establish an almost sure central limit theorem (ASCLT) only under mild conditions on the covariance function of the underlying stationary Gaussian field. In this setting, we additionally derive a quantitative central limit theorem with rate of convergence in Wasserstein distance, and show certain regularity property for the said integral functionals (the latter under weaker conditions). In particular, we solved an open question on the Malliavin differentiability of the excursion volume of Berry's random wave model. As a key consequence of our analysis, we obtain the exact asymptotic rate (as a function of the exponent) for moments of Bessel functions, thus confirming a conjecture based on existing numerical simulations. In the end, we provide two applications of our result: (i) ASCLT in the context of Breuer-Major central limit theorems, (ii) ASCLT for Berry's random wave model. It is worth stressing that our approach does not require any knowledge on the regularity properties of random variables (e.g., Malliavin differentiability) and hence not only complements the existing literature, but also leads to novel results that are of independent interest.</description>

      <title>q-Whittaker functions, finite fields, and Jordan forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.12590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.12590v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The $q$-Whittaker function $W_\lambda(\mathbf{x};q)$ associated to a partition $\lambda$ is a $q$-analogue of the Schur function $s_\lambda(\mathbf{x})$, and is defined as the $t=0$ specialization of the Macdonald polynomial $P_\lambda(\mathbf{x};q,t)$. We show combinatorially how to expand $W_\lambda(\mathbf{x};q)$ in terms of partial flags compatible with a nilpotent endomorphism over the finite field of size $1/q$. This yields an expression analogous to a well-known formula for the Hall-Littlewood functions. We show that considering pairs of partial flags and taking Jordan forms leads to a probabilistic bijection between nonnegative-integer matrices and pairs of semistandard tableaux of the same shape, proving the Cauchy identity for $q$-Whittaker functions. We call our probabilistic bijection the $q$-Burge correspondence, and prove that in the limit as $q\to 0$, we recover a description of the classical Burge correspondence (also known as column RSK) due to Rosso (2012). A key step in the proof is the enumeration of an arbitrary double coset of $\text{GL}_n$ modulo two parabolic subgroups, which we find to be of independent interest. As an application, we use the $q$-Burge correspondence to count isomorphism classes of certain modules over the preprojective algebra of a type $A$ quiver (i.e. a path), refined according to their socle filtrations. This develops a connection between the combinatorics of symmetric functions and the representation theory of preprojective algebras.</description>

      <title>Multivariate Hahn polynomials and difference equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.09170v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The multivariate Hahn polynomials are constructed explicitly as the common eigenvectors of a family of second order difference operators. They are orthogonal with respect to the hypergeometric multinomial distribution. The main difference operator is adopted from the work of Karlin-McGregor in 1975. The minor ones are the subsets of the main one containing less and less variables. These operators commute with each other. In contrast to the multivariate Krawtchouk and Rahman like polynomials derived recently, the entire multivariate Hahn polynomials are rational functions of the system parameters. Complete sets of multivariate Krawtchouk and Meixner polynomials are derived by limiting procedures.</description>

      <title>DP-Coloring of Graphs from Random Covers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.13742v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: DP-coloring (also called correspondence coloring) of graphs is a generalization of list coloring that has been widely studied since its introduction by Dvo\v{r}\'{a}k and Postle in $2015$. Intuitively, DP-coloring generalizes list coloring by allowing the colors that are identified as the same to vary from edge to edge. Formally, DP-coloring of a graph $G$ is equivalent to an independent transversal in an auxiliary structure called a DP-cover of $G$. In this paper, we introduce the notion of random DP-covers and study the behavior of DP-coloring from such random covers. We prove a series of results about the probability that a graph is or is not DP-colorable from a random cover. These results support the following threshold behavior on random $k$-fold DP-covers as $\rho\to\infty$ where $\rho$ is the maximum density of a graph: graphs are non-DP-colorable with high probability when $k$ is sufficiently smaller than $\rho/\ln\rho$, and graphs are DP-colorable with high probability when $k$ is sufficiently larger than $\rho/\ln\rho$. Our results depend on $\rho$ growing fast enough and imply a sharp threshold for dense enough graphs. For sparser graphs, we analyze DP-colorability in terms of degeneracy. We also prove fractional DP-coloring analogs to these results.</description>

Abstract: We prove a weak iterated invariance principle for a large class of non-uniformly expanding random dynamical systems. In addition, we give a quenched homogenization result for fast-slow systems in the case when the fast component corresponds to a uniformly expanding random system.
  Our techniques rely on the appropriate martingale decomposition.</description>

      <title>From Zero-Freeness to Strong Spatial Mixing via a Christoffel-Darboux Type Identity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09317v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a unifying proof to derive the strong spatial mixing (SSM) property for the general 2-spin system from zero-free regions of its partition function. Our proof works for the multivariate partition function over all three complex parameters $(\beta, \gamma, \lambda)$, and we allow the zero-free regions of $\beta, \gamma$ or $\lambda$ to be of arbitrary shapes. Our main technical contribution is to establish a Christoffel-Darboux type identity for the 2-spin system on trees so that we are able to handle zero-free regions of the three different parameters $\beta, \gamma$ or $\lambda$ in a unified way. We use Riemann mapping theorem to deal with zere-free regions of arbitrary shapes.
  Our result comprehensively turns all existing zero-free regions (to our best knowledge) of the partition function of the 2-spin system where pinned vertices are allowed into the SSM property. As a consequence, we obtain novel SSM properties for the 2-spin system beyond the direct argument for SSM based on tree recurrence. Moreover, we extend our result to handle the 2-spin system with non-uniform external fields. As an application, we obtain a new SSM property and two new forms of spatial mixing property, namely plus and minus spatial mixing for the non-uniform ferromagnetic Ising model from the celebrated Lee-Yang circle theorem.</description>

      <title>A Harris theorem for enhanced dissipation, and an example of Pierrehumbert</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19858v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In many situations, the combined effect of advection and diffusion greatly increases the rate of convergence to equilibrium -- a phenomenon known as enhanced dissipation. Here we study the situation where the advecting velocity field generates a random dynamical system satisfying certain Harris conditions. If $\kappa$ denotes the strength of the diffusion, then we show that with probability at least $1 - o(\kappa^N)$ enhanced dissipation occurs on time scales of order $|\ln \kappa|$, a bound which is known to be optimal. Moreover, on long time scales, we show that the rate of convergence to equilibrium is almost surely independent of diffusivity. As a consequence we obtain enhanced dissipation for the randomly shifted alternating shears introduced by Pierrehumbert '94.</description>

Abstract: Let $\alpha \colon \mathbb{N} \to S^1$ be the Steinhaus multiplicative function: a completely multiplicative function such that $(\alpha(p))_{p\text{ prime}}$ are i.i.d.~random variables uniformly distributed on the complex unit circle $S^1$. Helson conjectured that $\mathbb{E}|\sum_{n\le x}\alpha(n)|=o(\sqrt{x})$ as $x \to \infty$, and this was solved in a strong form by Harper. We give a short proof of the conjecture using a result of Saksman and Webb on a random model for the zeta function.</description>

      <title>Comparative Analyses of the Type D ASEP: Stochastic Fusion and Crystal Bases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21015v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Type D asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP) is a particle system involving two classes of particles that can be viewed from both a probabilistic and an algebraic perspective (arXiv:2011.13473). From a probabilistic perspective, we perform stochastic fusion on the Type D ASEP and analyze the outcome on generator matrices, limits of drift speed, stationary distributions, and Markov self-duality. From an algebraic perspective, we construct a fused Type D ASEP system from a Casimir element of $U_q(so_6)$, using crystal bases to analyze and manipulate various representations of $U_q(so_6)$. We conclude that both approaches produce different processes and therefore the previous method of arXiv:1908.02359, which analyzed the usual ASEP, does not generalize to all finite-dimensional simple Lie algebras.</description>

      <title>The Extreme Points of Fusions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10779v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Our work explores fusions, the multidimensional counterparts of mean-preserving contractions and their extreme and exposed points. We reveal an elegant geometric/combinatorial structure for these objects. Of particular note is the connection between Lipschitz-exposed points (measures that are unique optimizers of Lipschitz-continuous objectives) and power diagrams, which are divisions of a space into convex polyhedral ``cells'' according to a weighted proximity criterion. These objects are frequently seen in nature--in cell structures in biological systems, crystal and plant growth patterns, and territorial division in animal habitats--and, as we show, provide the essential structure of Lipschitz-exposed fusions. We apply our results to several questions concerning categorization.</description>

      <title>Exact full-RSB SAT/UNSAT transition in infinitely wide two-layer neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06717v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the problem of storing random pattern-label associations using two classes of continuous non-convex weights models, namely the perceptron with negative margin and an infinite-width two-layer neural network with non-overlapping receptive fields and generic activation function. Using a full-RSB ansatz we compute the exact value of the SAT/UNSAT transition. Furthermore, in the case of the negative perceptron we show that the overlap distribution of typical states displays an overlap gap (a disconnected support) in certain regions of the phase diagram defined by the value of the margin and the density of patterns to be stored. This implies that some recent theorems that ensure convergence of Approximate Message Passing (AMP) based algorithms to capacity are not applicable. Finally, we show that Gradient Descent is not able to reach the maximal capacity, irrespectively of the presence of an overlap gap for typical states. This finding, similarly to what occurs in binary weight models, suggests that gradient-based algorithms are biased towards highly atypical states, whose inaccessibility determines the algorithmic threshold.</description>

      <title>Counterexamples to a Weitz-Style Reduction for Multispin Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06541v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a seminal paper, Weitz showed that for two-state spin systems, such as the Ising and hardcore models from statistical physics, correlation decay on trees implies correlation decay on arbitrary graphs. The key gadget in Weitz's reduction has been instrumental in recent advances in approximate counting and sampling, from analysis of local Markov chains like Glauber dynamics to the design of deterministic algorithms for estimating the partition function. A longstanding open problem in the field has been to find such a reduction for more general multispin systems like the uniform distribution over proper colorings of a graph.
  In this paper, we show that for a rich class of multispin systems, including the ferromagnetic Potts model, there are fundamental obstacles to extending Weitz's reduction to the multispin setting. A central component of our investigation is establishing nonconvexity of the image of the belief propagation functional, the standard tool for analyzing spin systems on trees. On the other hand, we provide evidence of convexity for the antiferromagnetic Potts model.</description>

Abstract: Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) has been a go-to algorithm for nonconvex stochastic optimization problems arising in machine learning. Its theory however often requires a strong framework to guarantee convergence properties. We hereby present a full scope convergence study of biased nonconvex SGD, including weak convergence, function-value convergence and global convergence, and also provide subsequent convergence rates and complexities, all under relatively mild conditions in comparison with literature.</description>

      <title>Non-Stationary Gradient Descent for Optimal Auto-Scaling in Serverless Platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01284v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To efficiently manage serverless computing platforms, a key aspect is the auto-scaling of services, i.e., the set of computational resources allocated to a service adapts over time as a function of the traffic demand. The objective is to find a compromise between user-perceived performance and energy consumption. In this paper, we consider the \emph{scale-per-request} auto-scaling pattern and investigate how many function instances (or servers) should be spawned each time an \emph{unfortunate} job arrives, i.e., a job that finds all servers busy upon its arrival. We address this problem by following a stochastic optimization approach: we develop a stochastic gradient descent scheme of the Kiefer--Wolfowitz type that applies \emph{over a single run of the state evolution}. At each iteration, the proposed scheme computes an estimate of the number of servers to spawn each time an unfortunate job arrives to minimize some cost function. Under natural assumptions, we show that the sequence of estimates produced by our scheme is asymptotically optimal almost surely. In addition, we prove that its convergence rate is $O(n^{-2/3})$ where $n$ is the number of iterations.
  From a mathematical point of view, the stochastic optimization framework induced by auto-scaling exhibits non-standard aspects that we approach from a general point of view. We consider the setting where a controller can only get samples of the \emph{transient} -- rather than stationary -- behavior of the underlying stochastic system. To handle this difficulty, we develop arguments that exploit properties of the mixing time of the underlying Markov chain. By means of numerical simulations, we validate the proposed approach and quantify its gain with respect to common existing scale-up rules.</description>

      <title>Separated determinantal point processes and generalized Fock spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02237v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study conditions so that the determinantal point process $\Lambda_\phi$ associated to a generalized Fock space defined by a doubling subharmonic weight $\phi$ is almost surely a separated sequence in $\mathbb C$. Under a natural assumption on $\phi$, we provide a characterization of such processes. Additionally, we emphasize the role of intrinsic repulsion in determinantal processes by comparing $\Lambda_\phi$ with the Poisson process of the same first intensity. As an application, we show that the determinantal process $\Lambda_\alpha$ associated to the canonical weight $\phi_\alpha(z)=|z|^\alpha$, $\alpha&gt;0$, is almost surely separated if and only if $\alpha&lt;4/3$. In contrast, the Poisson process $\Lambda_\alpha^P$ having the same first intensity as $\Lambda_\alpha$ is almost surely separated if and only if $\alpha&lt;1$.</description>
