      <title>Long-term prediction of ENSO with physics-guided Deep Echo State Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The El Ni\~{n}o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is a dominant mode of interannual climate variability, yet the mechanisms limiting its long-lead predictability remain unclear. Here we develop a physics-guided Deep Echo State Network (DESN) that operates on physically interpretable climate modes selected from the extended recharge oscillator (XRO) framework. DESN achieves skillful Ni\~{n}o3.4 predictions up to 16-20 months ahead with minimal computational cost. Mechanistic experiments show that extended predictability arises from nonlinear coupling between warm water volume and inter-basin climate modes. Error-growth analysis further indicates a finite ENSO predictability horizon of approximately 30 months. These results demonstrate that physics-guided reservoir computing provides an efficient and interpretable framework for diagnosing and predicting ENSO at long lead times.</description>

      <title>An Eclipse-Ballooning Study of Shadow Bands During the April 2024 Total Eclipse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study we searched for shadow bands associated with the total solar eclipse of April 8, 2024. Our aim was to improve our understanding of their origin. Shadow bands are debated to arise either from atmospheric turbulence within Earth's planetary boundary layer (PBL) or from a diffraction-interference effect occurring above the atmosphere. To test these theories, high altitude balloons (HABs) equipped with light sensors, similar ground light sensors, radiosondes launched with weather balloons, and an aircraft-mounted light sensor were deployed. Our team was located in Concan, TX, except for the plane which flew to NE Vermont to find clear weather. Unlike Pitt's 2017 HAB study, which detected a 4.5 Hz signal attributed to shadow bands above the PBL and on the ground, no shadow bands were detected above the PBL in Texas or in northeast Vermont, despite the use of improved instrumentation. Cloud cover prevented useful ground based measurements in Texas, limiting our conclusions about the nature of shadow bands. These findings suggest that shadow bands may not always be present or, if they are, may be primarily due to atmospheric turbulence. The results of this study and Pitt's 2017 study emphasize the need for future work.</description>

      <title>A stable hothouse triggered by a tipping mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The climate system's nonlinear dynamics is influenced by various external forcings and internal feedbacks that can give rise to regional and even global tipping points that may lead to significant and potentially irreversible changes. Paleoclimatic records reveal that Earth's climate has shifted between distinct equlibria, including a "hothouse Earth" state with temperatures about 10 K higher than present. However, a specific mechanism for a sudden tipping to an alternate stable state, several degrees warmer than the present climate, has yet to be presented. We introduce a temperature-carbon-vegetation (TCV) model comprising an energy balance model of global temperature, coupled with global terrestrial and ocean CO2 dynamics, and with vegetation ecosystem change. Our model exhibits a new tipping mechanism that leads to a hothouse Earth under a high-emissions scenario. Its simulations align with both observations and IPCC-class global climate models prior to tipping. The two processes that produce global tipping are: (i) temperature-albedo feedback due to darkening of the terrestrial cryosphere by glacial microalgae; and (ii) limits to vegetation adaptation that lead to reduced carbon absorption.</description>

      <title>Full Reaction Pathway Dynamics for Atmospheric Decomposition Reactions: The Photodissociation of H$_2$COO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Branching ratios for fragmentation channels of important meta- and unstable species are essential for a molecular-level characterization of atmospheric chemistry. Here, the molecular product channels for the decomposition dynamics of the smallest Criegee intermediate, H$_2$COO, are quantitatively investigated. Using a high-quality, full-dimensional machine learned potential energy surface (CASPT2/aug-cc-pVTZ), the translational, rotational, and vibrational energy distributions of the CO$_2$+H$_2$, H$_2$O+CO, and HCO+OH fragmentation channels were analyzed to elucidate partitioning of the available energy. The CO$_2$ + H$_2$ product forms through two different pathways that bifurcate after formation of the OCH$_2$O intermediate. Along the direct pathway, CO$_2$ is preferentially vibrationally excited with H$_2$in its vibrational ground state, whereas for the indirect pathway going through formic acid, H$_2$ can populate levels with $v &gt; 0$. For all product channels passing through energized formic acid, the lifetime distributions are described by stretched exponentials with $\beta$ ranging from 1.1 to 1.7. This is a clear signature of non-RRKM effects and suggests that the explicit molecular dynamics needs to be followed for a quantitative and realistic description of the photodissociation dynamics.</description>

      <title>sangkuriang: A pseudo-spectral Python library for Korteweg-de Vries soliton simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation serves as a foundational model in nonlinear wave physics, describing the balance between dispersive spreading and nonlinear steepening that gives rise to solitons. This article introduces sangkuriang, an open-source Python library for solving this equation using Fourier pseudo-spectral spatial discretization coupled with adaptive high-order time integration. The implementation leverages just-in-time (JIT) compilation for computational efficiency while maintaining accessibility for instructional purposes. Validation encompasses progressively complex scenarios including isolated soliton propagation, symmetric two-wave configurations, overtaking collisions between waves of differing amplitudes, and three-body interactions. Conservation of the classical invariants is monitored throughout, with deviations remaining small across all test cases. Measured soliton velocities conform closely to theoretical predictions based on the amplitude-velocity relationship characteristic of integrable systems. Complementary diagnostics drawn from information theory and recurrence analysis confirm that computed solutions preserve the regular phase-space structure expected for completely integrable dynamics. The solver outputs data in standard scientific formats compatible with common analysis tools and generates visualizations of spatiotemporal wave evolution. By combining numerical accuracy with practical accessibility on modest computational resources, sangkuriang offers a platform suitable for both classroom demonstrations of nonlinear wave phenomena and exploratory research into soliton dynamics.</description>

      <title>A unified neural background-error covariance model for midlatitude and tropical atmospheric data assimilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11968v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Estimating background-error covariances remains a core challenge in variational data assimilation (DA). Operational systems typically approximate these covariances by transformations that separate geostrophically balanced components from unbalanced inertio-gravity modes - an approach well-suited for the midlatitudes but less applicable in the tropics, where different physical balances prevail. This study estimates background-error covariances in a reduced-dimension latent space learned by a neural-network autoencoder (AE). The AE was trained using 40 years of ERA5 reanalysis data, enabling it to capture flow-dependent atmospheric balances from a diverse set of weather states.
  We demonstrate that performing DA in the latent space yields analysis increments that preserve multivariate horizontal and vertical physical balances in both tropical and midlatitude atmosphere. Assimilating a single 500 hPa geopotential height observation in the midlatitudes produces increments consistent with geostrophic and thermal wind balance, while assimilating a total column water vapor observation with a positive departure in the nearly-saturated tropical atmosphere generates an increment resembling the tropical response to (latent) heat-induced perturbations. The resulting increments are localized and flow-dependent, and shaped by orography and land-sea contrasts. Forecasts initialized from these analyses exhibit realistic weather evolution, including the excitation of an eastward-propagating Kelvin wave in the tropics.
  Finally, we explore the transition from using synthetic ensembles and a climatology-based background error covariance matrix to an operational ensemble of data assimilations. Despite significant compression-induced variance loss in some variables, latent-space assimilation produces balanced, flow-dependent increments - highlighting its potential for ensemble-based latent-space 4D-Var.</description>

      <title>NeuralOM: Neural Ocean Model for Subseasonal-to-Seasonal Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21020v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Long-term, high-fidelity simulation of slow-changing physical systems, such as the ocean and climate, presents a fundamental challenge in scientific computing. Traditional autoregressive machine learning models often fail in these tasks as minor errors accumulate and lead to rapid forecast degradation. To address this problem, we propose NeuralOM, a general neural operator framework designed for simulating complex, slow-changing dynamics. NeuralOM's core consists of two key innovations: (1) a Progressive Residual Correction Framework that decomposes the forecasting task into a series of fine-grained refinement steps, effectively suppressing long-term error accumulation; and (2) a Physics-Guided Graph Network whose built-in adaptive messaging mechanism explicitly models multi-scale physical interactions, such as gradient-driven flows and multiplicative couplings, thereby enhancing physical consistency while maintaining computational efficiency. We validate NeuralOM on the challenging task of global Subseasonal-to-Seasonal (S2S) ocean simulation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NeuralOM not only surpasses state-of-the-art models in forecast accuracy and long-term stability, but also excels in simulating extreme events. For instance, at a 60-day lead time, NeuralOM achieves a 13.3% lower RMSE compared to the best-performing baseline, offering a stable, efficient, and physically-aware paradigm for data-driven scientific computing.
