      <title>The enteric nervous system is 10 times stiffer than the brain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural tissues of the central nervous system are among the softest and most fragile in the human body, protected from mechanical perturbation by the skull and the spine. In contrast, the enteric nervous system is embedded in a compliant, contractile tissue and subject to chronic, high-magnitude mechanical stress. Do neurons and glia of the enteric nervous system display specific mechanical properties to withstand these forces? Using nano-indentation combined with immunohistochemistry and second harmonic generation imaging of collagen, we discovered that enteric ganglia in adult mice are an order of magnitude more resistant to deformation than brain tissue. We found that glia-rich regions in ganglia have a similar stiffness to neuron-rich regions and to the surrounding smooth muscle, of ~3 kPa at 3 $\mu$m indentation depth and of ~7 kPa at 8 $\mu$m depth. Differences in the adhesion strength of the different tissue layers to the glass indenter were scarce. The collagen shell surrounding ganglia and inter-ganglionic fibers may play a key role in strengthening the enteric nervous system to resist the manifold mechanical challenges it faces.</description>

      <title>Contact temporal network during motility induced phase separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motility-induced phase separation (MIPS) is a paradigmatic non-equilibrium transition in active matter, determined by the P\'eclet number and packing fraction. We investigate the single-phase and phase-separated regimes of MIPS using a complex network approach, where networks are constructed from particle interactions over finite time windows. In the single-phase (gas-like) regime, the degree distributions $P(k)$ exhibit Gaussian behavior and resemble those of random graphs. Plotting the location and height of the $P(k)$ peak reveals a universal curve across different P\'eclet numbers at fixed packing fraction. In the phase-separated regime, we analyze the dense and dilute phases independently. The $P(k)$ distributions unveil distinct collective dynamics, including caging in the dense phase and the emergence of active solid-like structures at longer times. Clustering coefficients and average path lengths in both phases stabilize rapidly, indicating that short simulations are sufficient to capture essential network features. Overall, our results show that network metrics expose both universal and phase-specific aspects of active matter dynamics. Notably, we identify distinct and previously unreported topological structures arising in the dense and dilute phases within the MIPS regime.</description>

      <title>Optical tweezers as a tool for quantitative imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical tweezers equipped with position detection allow for application of piconewton-scale forces and high-temporal-resolution measurements of nanometer-scale motion. While typically used for trapping microscopic objects, the optical tweezer detection pathway can also be used for a microscopy technique sensitive to nanometer-sized structures. Optical tweezers most commonly use back-focal-plane detection to determine the position of the trapped object. This technique involves analyzing the interference pattern between scattered and unscattered light. Despite the reliance on interference, we show that an image of an extended object can be understood as a sum of the images of individual point-like particles that make up the object. This allows for optical tweezers with back-focal-plane detection to be used as an imaging tool capable of determining the mass distribution of scanned structures. Furthermore, the sample-orientation-dependent detector response allows for a unique method of background subtraction. We demonstrate the quantitative imaging capabilities of optical tweezer microscopy by determining the size distributions multiple nearby particles and measuring the changing diameter of collagen fibrils. The background subtraction technique is demonstrated by imaging surface-bound microtubules with a strong background from protein aggregate co-adsorption. Optical tweezer microscopy allows for quantitative imaging of objects far from the coverslip surface. This makes it an excellent tool for studying the link between the structure and mechanics of microscopic systems.</description>

      <title>Diffusive spreading of a polydisperse polymer solution in a channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Long DNA molecules can be mapped by cutting them with restriction enzymes inside a narrow channel. Once cut, the individual fragments thus produced move away from each other due to diffusion and entropic effects. We investigate how long it takes for these fragments to travel distances large enough for an experimental device to distinguish them and (possibly) estimate their size. In essence, this is a single-file diffusion process in which molecules of different sizes and hence different diffusion coefficients spread out from an initially dense configuration. We use Monte Carlo methods to investigate this class of problems and define the time taken to reach the required final state as a first-passage \textit{spreading time}. Our results demonstrate that the stochastic nature of the diffusion process is as significant as the specifics of the molecular size distribution in determining the spreading time. We examine the relationship between the spreading time and the final space occupied by the fragments as a function of the experimental parameters and determine the fundamental length scale governing this process. We introduce a molecular sequence randomness parameter, $Z$, which is linearly correlated with the final spreading time. Finally, we show that the distribution function of spreading times follows a well-known form for first-passage time problems, and that its variance decreases linearly with the number of fragments.</description>

      <title>Mathematical Modelling of Mechanotransduction via RhoA Signalling Pathways</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04407v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive and simulate a mathematical model for mechanotransduction related to the Rho GTPase signalling pathway. The model addresses the bidirectional coupling between signalling processes and cell mechanics. A numerical method based on bulk-surface finite elements is proposed for the approximation of the coupled system of nonlinear reaction-diffusion equations, defined inside the cell and on the cell membrane, and the equations of elasticity. Our simulation results illustrate novel emergent features such as the strong dependence of the dynamics on cell shape, a threshold-like response to changes in substrate stiffness, and the fact that coupling mechanics and signalling can lead to the robustness of cell deformation to larger changes in substrate stiffness, ensuring mechanical homeostasis in agreement with experiments.</description>

      <title>Correlation Between DNA Double-Strand Break Distribution in 3D Genome and Radiation-Induced Cell Death</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07579v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The target theory is the most classical hypothesis explaining radiation-induced cell death, the physical or biological nature of the "target" remains ambiguous. This study hypothesizes that the distribution of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) within the 3D genome is a pivotal factor affecting the probability of radiation-induced cell death. We propose that clustered DSBs in DNA segments with high interaction frequencies are more susceptible to leading to cell death than isolated DSBs. Topologically associating domains (TAD) can be regarded as the reference unit for evaluating the impact of DSB clustering in the 3D genome. To quantify this correlation between the DSB distribution in 3D genome and radiation-induced effect, we developed a simplified model considering the DSB distribution across TADs. Utilizing track-structure Monte Carlo codes to simulate the electron and carbon ion irradiation, we calculated the incidence of each case across a variety of radiation doses and LETs. Our simulation results indicate that DSBs in TADs with frequent interactions (case 3) are significantly more likely to induce cell death than clustered DSBs within a single TAD (case 2). Moreover, case 2 is significantly more likely to induce cell death than isolated DSBs (case 1). The curves of the incidence of case 2 and case 3 versus LETs have a similar shape to the radiation quality factor used in radiation protection. This indicates that these two cases are also associated with the stochastic effects induced by high LET irradiation. Our study underscores the significance of the 3D genome structure in the fundamental mechanisms of radiobiological effects. The hypothesis in our research offers novel perspectives on the mechanisms that regulate radiobiological effects. Moreover, it serves as a valuable reference for establishing mechanistic models that can predict cell survival under different doses and LETs.</description>

      <title>Phase separation in a mixture of proliferating and motile active matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05288v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Proliferation and motility are ubiquitous drivers of activity in biological systems. Here, we study a dense binary mixture of motile and proliferating particles with exclusively repulsive interactions, where homeostasis in the proliferating subpopulation is maintained by pressure-induced removal. Using computer simulations, we show that phase separation emerges naturally in this system at high density and weak enough self-propulsion. We show that condensation is caused by interactions between motile particles induced by the growing phase, and recapitulate this behavior in an effective model of only motile particles with attractive interactions. Our results establish a new type of phase transition and pave a way to reinterpret the physics of dense cellular populations, such as bacterial colonies or tumors, as systems of mixed active matter.</description>
