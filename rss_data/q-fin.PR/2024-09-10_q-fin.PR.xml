      <title>Semi-analytical pricing of options written on SOFR futures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04903v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a semi-analytical approach to pricing options on SOFR futures where the underlying SOFR follows a time-dependent CEV model. By definition, these options change their type at the beginning of the reference period: before this time, this is an American option written on a SOFR forward price as an underlying, and after this point, this is an arithmetic Asian option with an American style exercise written on the daily SOFR rates. We develop a new version of the GIT method and solve both problems semi-analytically, obtaining the option price, the exercise boundary, and the option Greeks. This work is intended to address the concern that the transfer from LIBOR to SOFR has resulted in a situation in which the options of the key money market (i.e., futures on the reference rate) are options without any pricing model available. Therefore, the trading in options on 3M SOFR futures currently ends before their reference quarter starts, to eliminate the final metamorphosis into exotic options.</description>

      <title>Learning to Optimally Stop Diffusion Processes, with Financial Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09242v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study optimal stopping for diffusion processes with unknown model primitives within the continuous-time reinforcement learning (RL) framework developed by Wang et al. (2020), and present applications to option pricing and portfolio choice. By penalizing the corresponding variational inequality formulation, we transform the stopping problem into a stochastic optimal control problem with two actions. We then randomize controls into Bernoulli distributions and add an entropy regularizer to encourage exploration. We derive a semi-analytical optimal Bernoulli distribution, based on which we devise RL algorithms using the martingale approach established in Jia and Zhou (2022a), and prove a policy improvement theorem. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithms in pricing finite-horizon American put options and in solving Merton's problem with transaction costs, and show that both the offline and online algorithms achieve high accuracy in learning the value functions and characterizing the associated free boundaries.</description>
