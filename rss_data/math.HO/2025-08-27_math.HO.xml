      <title>Modeling Social Systems: Transparency, Reproducibility, and Responsibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mathematical models of complex social systems can enrich social scientific theory, inform interventions, and shape policy. From voting behavior to economic inequality and urban development, such models influence decisions that affect millions of lives. Thus, it is especially important to formulate and present them with transparency, reproducibility, and humility. Modeling in social domains, however, is often uniquely challenging. Unlike in physics or engineering, researchers often lack controlled experiments or abundant, clean data. Observational data is sparse, noisy, partial, and missing in systematic ways. In such an environment, how can we build models that can inform science and decision-making in transparent and responsible ways?</description>

      <title>Development of the Measure of Assessment Self-Efficacy (MASE) for Quizzes and Exams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-efficacy is a significant construct in education due to its predictive relationship with achievement. Existing measures of assessment-related self-efficacy concentrate on students' beliefs about content-specific tasks but omit beliefs around assessment-taking. This research aimed to develop and test the Measure of Assessment Self-Efficacy (MASE), designed to assess two types of efficacy beliefs related to assessment (i.e., 'comprehension and execution' and 'emotional regulation') in two scenarios (i.e., a low-stakes online quiz and a high-stakes final exam). Results from confirmatory factor analysis in Study 1 (N = 301) supported the hypothesised two-factor measurement models for both assessment scenarios. In Study 2, results from MGCFA (N = 277) confirmed these models were invariant over time and provided evidence for the scales' validity. Study 3 demonstrated the exam-related MASE was invariant across cohorts of students (Ns = 277; 329). Potential uses of the developed scales in educational research are discussed.</description>

      <title>On the occasion of Dr. Ivan Dmitrievich Remizov's 40th birthday</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article celebrates the 40th anniversary of Dr. Ivan Dmitrievich Remizov, a mathematician who made a number of important contributions to the theory of one-parameter operator semigroups -- a branch of functional analysis which has applications to differential equations, mathematical physics, random processes, control theory, and quantum mechanics. Born on December 7, 1984, Dr. Remizov obtained his Ph.D. in 2018 from Moscow State University and has made substantial contributions, particularly in the study of Chernoff approximations of one-parameter semigroups of operators. This article reviews his academic background, research achievements, and his impact on the mathematical community.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic information theory and martingales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/0906.2614</link>
      <description>arXiv:0906.2614v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The notion of an individual random sequence goes back to von Mises. We describe the evolution of this notion, especially the use of martingales (suggested by Ville), and the development of algorithmic information theory in 1960s and 1970s (Solomonov, Kolmogorov, Martin-Lof, Levin, Chaitin, Schnorr and others). We conclude with some remarks about the use of the algorithmic information theory in the foundations of probability theory.</description>
