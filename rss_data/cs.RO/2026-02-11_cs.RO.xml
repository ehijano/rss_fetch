      <title>Feasible Static Workspace Optimization of Tendon Driven Continuum Robot based on Euclidean norm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the optimal design of a tendon-driven continuum robot (TDCR) based on its feasible static workspace (FSW). The TDCR under consideration is a two-segment robot driven by eight tendons, with four tendon actuators per segment. Tendon forces are treated as design variables, while the feasible static workspace (FSW) serves as the optimization objective. To determine the robot's feasible static workspace, a genetic algorithm optimization approach is employed to maximize a Euclidian norm of the TDCR's tip position over the workspace. During the simulations, the robot is subjected to external loads, including torques and forces. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in identifying optimal tendon forces to maximize the feasible static workspace, even under the influence of external forces and torques.</description>

      <title>Legs Over Arms: On the Predictive Value of Lower-Body Pose for Human Trajectory Prediction from Egocentric Robot Perception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting human trajectory is crucial for social robot navigation in crowded environments. While most existing approaches treat human as point mass, we present a study on multi-agent trajectory prediction that leverages different human skeletal features for improved forecast accuracy. In particular, we systematically evaluate the predictive utility of 2D and 3D skeletal keypoints and derived biomechanical cues as additional inputs. Through a comprehensive study on the JRDB dataset and another new dataset for social navigation with 360-degree panoramic videos, we find that focusing on lower-body 3D keypoints yields a 13% reduction in Average Displacement Error and augmenting 3D keypoint inputs with corresponding biomechanical cues provides a further 1-4% improvement. Notably, the performance gain persists when using 2D keypoint inputs extracted from equirectangular panoramic images, indicating that monocular surround vision can capture informative cues for motion forecasting. Our finding that robots can forecast human movement efficiently by watching their legs provides actionable insights for designing sensing capabilities for social robot navigation.</description>

      <title>Agile asymmetric multi-legged locomotion: contact planning via geometric mechanics and spin model duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Legged robot research is presently focused on bipedal or quadrupedal robots, despite capabilities to build robots with many more legs to potentially improve locomotion performance. This imbalance is not necessarily due to hardware limitations, but rather to the absence of principled control frameworks that explain when and how additional legs improve locomotion performance. In multi-legged systems, coordinating many simultaneous contacts introduces a severe curse of dimensionality that challenges existing modeling and control approaches. As an alternative, multi-legged robots are typically controlled using low-dimensional gaits originally developed for bipeds or quadrupeds. These strategies fail to exploit the new symmetries and control opportunities that emerge in higher-dimensional systems. In this work, we develop a principled framework for discovering new control structures in multi-legged locomotion. We use geometric mechanics to reduce contact-rich locomotion planning to a graph optimization problem, and propose a spin model duality framework from statistical mechanics to exploit symmetry breaking and guide optimal gait reorganization. Using this approach, we identify an asymmetric locomotion strategy for a hexapod robot that achieves a forward speed of 0.61 body lengths per cycle (a 50% improvement over conventional gaits). The resulting asymmetry appears at both the control and hardware levels. At the control level, the body orientation oscillates asymmetrically between fast clockwise and slow counterclockwise turning phases for forward locomotion. At the hardware level, two legs on the same side remain unactuated and can be replaced with rigid parts without degrading performance. Numerical simulations and robophysical experiments validate the framework and reveal novel locomotion behaviors that emerge from symmetry reforming in high-dimensional embodied systems.</description>

      <title>SceneSmith: Agentic Generation of Simulation-Ready Indoor Scenes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulation has become a key tool for training and evaluating home robots at scale, yet existing environments fail to capture the diversity and physical complexity of real indoor spaces. Current scene synthesis methods produce sparsely furnished rooms that lack the dense clutter, articulated furniture, and physical properties essential for robotic manipulation. We introduce SceneSmith, a hierarchical agentic framework that generates simulation-ready indoor environments from natural language prompts. SceneSmith constructs scenes through successive stages$\unicode{x2013}$from architectural layout to furniture placement to small object population$\unicode{x2013}$each implemented as an interaction among VLM agents: designer, critic, and orchestrator. The framework tightly integrates asset generation through text-to-3D synthesis for static objects, dataset retrieval for articulated objects, and physical property estimation. SceneSmith generates 3-6x more objects than prior methods, with &lt;2% inter-object collisions and 96% of objects remaining stable under physics simulation. In a user study with 205 participants, it achieves 92% average realism and 91% average prompt faithfulness win rates against baselines. We further demonstrate that these environments can be used in an end-to-end pipeline for automatic robot policy evaluation.</description>

      <title>Elements of Robot Morphology: Supporting Designers in Robot Form Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robot morphology, the form, shape, and structure of robots, is a key design space in human-robot interaction (HRI), shaping how robots function, express themselves, and interact with people. Yet, despite its importance, little is known about how design frameworks can guide systematic form exploration. To address this gap, we introduce Elements of Robot Morphology, a framework that identifies five fundamental elements: perception, articulation, end effectors, locomotion, and structure. Derived from an analysis of existing robots, the framework supports structured exploration of diverse robot forms. To operationalize the framework, we developed Morphology Exploration Blocks (MEB), a set of tangible blocks that enable hands-on, collaborative experimentation with robot morphologies. We evaluate the framework and toolkit through a case study and design workshops, showing how they support analysis, ideation, reflection, and collaborative robot design.</description>

      <title>Risk-Aware Obstacle Avoidance Algorithm for Real-Time Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robust navigation in changing marine environments requires autonomous systems capable of perceiving, reasoning, and acting under uncertainty. This study introduces a hybrid risk-aware navigation architecture that integrates probabilistic modeling of obstacles along the vehicle path with smooth trajectory optimization for autonomous surface vessels. The system constructs probabilistic risk maps that capture both obstacle proximity and the behavior of dynamic objects. A risk-biased Rapidly Exploring Random Tree (RRT) planner leverages these maps to generate collision-free paths, which are subsequently refined using B-spline algorithms to ensure trajectory continuity. Three distinct RRT* rewiring modes are implemented based on the cost function: minimizing the path length, minimizing risk, and optimizing a combination of the path length and total risk. The framework is evaluated in experimental scenarios containing both static and dynamic obstacles. The results demonstrate the system's ability to navigate safely, maintain smooth trajectories, and dynamically adapt to changing environmental risks. Compared with conventional LIDAR or vision-only navigation approaches, the proposed method shows improvements in operational safety and autonomy, establishing it as a promising solution for risk-aware autonomous vehicle missions in uncertain and dynamic environments.</description>

      <title>From Legible to Inscrutable Trajectories: (Il)legible Motion Planning Accounting for Multiple Observers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In cooperative environments, such as in factories or assistive scenarios, it is important for a robot to communicate its intentions to observers, who could be either other humans or robots. A legible trajectory allows an observer to quickly and accurately predict an agent's intention. In adversarial environments, such as in military operations or games, it is important for a robot to not communicate its intentions to observers. An illegible trajectory leads an observer to incorrectly predict the agent's intention or delays when an observer is able to make a correct prediction about the agent's intention. However, in some environments there are multiple observers, each of whom may be able to see only part of the environment, and each of whom may have different motives. In this work, we introduce the Mixed-Motive Limited-Observability Legible Motion Planning (MMLO-LMP) problem, which requires a motion planner to generate a trajectory that is legible to observers with positive motives and illegible to observers with negative motives while also considering the visibility limitations of each observer. We highlight multiple strategies an agent can take while still achieving the problem objective. We also present DUBIOUS, a trajectory optimizer that solves MMLO-LMP. Our results show that DUBIOUS can generate trajectories that balance legibility with the motives and limited visibility regions of the observers. Future work includes many variations of MMLO-LMP, including moving observers and observer teaming.</description>

      <title>STaR: Scalable Task-Conditioned Retrieval for Long-Horizon Multimodal Robot Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mobile robots are often deployed over long durations in diverse open, dynamic scenes, including indoor setting such as warehouses and manufacturing facilities, and outdoor settings such as agricultural and roadway operations. A core challenge is to build a scalable long-horizon memory that supports an agentic workflow for planning, retrieval, and reasoning over open-ended instructions at variable granularity, while producing precise, actionable answers for navigation. We present STaR, an agentic reasoning framework that (i) constructs a task-agnostic, multimodal long-term memory that generalizes to unseen queries while preserving fine-grained environmental semantics (object attributes, spatial relations, and dynamic events), and (ii) introduces a Scalable TaskConditioned Retrieval algorithm based on the Information Bottleneck principle to extract from long-term memory a compact, non-redundant, information-rich set of candidate memories for contextual reasoning. We evaluate STaR on NaVQA (mixed indoor/outdoor campus scenes) and WH-VQA, a customized warehouse benchmark with many visually similar objects built with Isaac Sim, emphasizing contextual reasoning. Across the two datasets, STaR consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving higher success rates and markedly lower spatial error. We further deploy STaR on a real Husky wheeled robot in both indoor and outdoor environments, demonstrating robust longhorizon reasoning, scalability, and practical utility.</description>

      <title>Data-centric Design of Learning-based Surgical Gaze Perception Models in Multi-Task Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery (RMIS), reduced haptic feedback and depth cues increase reliance on expert visual perception, motivating gaze-guided training and learning-based surgical perception models. However, operative expert gaze is costly to collect, and it remains unclear how the source of gaze supervision, both expertise level (intermediate vs. novice) and perceptual modality (active execution vs. passive viewing), shapes what attention models learn. We introduce a paired active-passive, multi-task surgical gaze dataset collected on the da Vinci SimNow simulator across four drills. Active gaze was recorded during task execution using a VR headset with eye tracking, and the corresponding videos were reused as stimuli to collect passive gaze from observers, enabling controlled same-video comparisons. We quantify skill- and modality-dependent differences in gaze organization and evaluate the substitutability of passive gaze for operative supervision using fixation density overlap analyses and single-frame saliency modeling. Across settings, MSI-Net produced stable, interpretable predictions, whereas SalGAN was unstable and often poorly aligned with human fixations. Models trained on passive gaze recovered a substantial portion of intermediate active attention, but with predictable degradation, and transfer was asymmetric between active and passive targets. Notably, novice passive labels approximated intermediate-passive targets with limited loss on higher-quality demonstrations, suggesting a practical path for scalable, crowd-sourced gaze supervision in surgical coaching and perception modeling.</description>

      <title>Disambiguating Anthropomorphism and Anthropomimesis in Human-Robot Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this preliminary work, we offer an initial disambiguation of the theoretical concepts anthropomorphism and anthropomimesis in Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) and social robotics. We define anthropomorphism as users perceiving human-like qualities in robots, and anthropomimesis as robot developers designing human-like features into robots. This contribution aims to provide a clarification and exploration of these concepts for future HRI scholarship, particularly regarding the party responsible for human-like qualities - robot perceiver for anthropomorphism, and robot designer for anthropomimesis. We provide this contribution so that researchers can build on these disambiguated theoretical concepts for future robot design and evaluation.</description>

      <title>CAPER: Constrained and Procedural Reasoning for Robotic Scientific Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robotic assistance in scientific laboratories requires procedurally correct long-horizon manipulation, reliable execution under limited supervision, and robustness in low-demonstration regimes. Such conditions greatly challenge end-to-end vision-language-action (VLA) models, whose assumptions of recoverable errors and data-driven policy learning often break down in protocol-sensitive experiments. We propose CAPER, a framework for Constrained And ProcEdural Reasoning for robotic scientific experiments, which explicitly restricts where learning and reasoning occur in the planning and control pipeline. Rather than strengthening end-to-end policies, CAPER enforces a responsibility-separated structure: task-level reasoning generates procedurally valid action sequences under explicit constraints, mid-level multimodal grounding realizes subtasks without delegating spatial decision-making to large language models, and low-level control adapts to physical uncertainty via reinforcement learning with minimal demonstrations. By encoding procedural commitments through interpretable intermediate representations, CAPER prevents execution-time violations of experimental logic, improving controllability, robustness, and data efficiency. Experiments on a scientific workflow benchmark and a public long-horizon manipulation dataset demonstrate consistent improvements in success rate and procedural correctness, particularly in low-data and long-horizon settings.</description>

      <title>Certified Gradient-Based Contact-Rich Manipulation via Smoothing-Error Reachable Tubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gradient-based methods can efficiently optimize controllers using physical priors and differentiable simulators, but contact-rich manipulation remains challenging due to discontinuous or vanishing gradients from hybrid contact dynamics. Smoothing the dynamics yields continuous gradients, but the resulting model mismatch can cause controller failures when executed on real systems. We address this trade-off by planning with smoothed dynamics while explicitly quantifying and compensating for the induced errors, providing formal guarantees of constraint satisfaction and goal reachability on the true hybrid dynamics. Our method smooths both contact dynamics and geometry via a novel differentiable simulator based on convex optimization, which enables us to characterize the discrepancy from the true dynamics as a set-valued deviation. This deviation constrains the optimization of time-varying affine feedback policies through analytical bounds on the system's reachable set, enabling robust constraint satisfaction guarantees for the true closed-loop hybrid dynamics, while relying solely on informative gradients from the smoothed dynamics. We evaluate our method on several contact-rich tasks, including planar pushing, object rotation, and in-hand dexterous manipulation, achieving guaranteed constraint satisfaction with lower safety violation and goal error than baselines. By bridging differentiable physics with set-valued robust control, our method is the first certifiable gradient-based policy synthesis method for contact-rich manipulation.</description>

      <title>Phase-Aware Policy Learning for Skateboard Riding of Quadruped Robots via Feature-wise Linear Modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Skateboards offer a compact and efficient means of transportation as a type of personal mobility device. However, controlling them with legged robots poses several challenges for policy learning due to perception-driven interactions and multi-modal control objectives across distinct skateboarding phases. To address these challenges, we introduce Phase-Aware Policy Learning (PAPL), a reinforcement-learning framework tailored for skateboarding with quadruped robots. PAPL leverages the cyclic nature of skateboarding by integrating phase-conditioned Feature-wise Linear Modulation layers into actor and critic networks, enabling a unified policy that captures phase-dependent behaviors while sharing robot-specific knowledge across phases. Our evaluations in simulation validate command-tracking accuracy and conduct ablation studies quantifying each component's contribution. We also compare locomotion efficiency against leg and wheel-leg baselines and show real-world transferability.</description>

      <title>Sci-VLA: Agentic VLA Inference Plugin for Long-Horizon Tasks in Scientific Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robotic laboratories play a critical role in autonomous scientific discovery by enabling scalable, continuous experimental execution. Recent vision-language-action (VLA) models offer a promising foundation for robotic laboratories. However, scientific experiments typically involve long-horizon tasks composed of multiple atomic tasks, posing a fundamental challenge to existing VLA models. While VLA models fine-tuned for scientific tasks can reliably execute atomic experimental actions seen during training, they often fail to perform composite tasks formed by reordering and composing these known atomic actions. This limitation arises from a distributional mismatch between training-time atomic tasks and inference-time composite tasks, which prevents VLA models from executing necessary transitional operations between atomic tasks. To address this challenge, we propose an Agentic VLA Inference Plugin for Long-Horizon Tasks in Scientific Experiments. It introduces an LLM-based agentic inference mechanism that intervenes when executing sequential manipulation tasks. By performing explicit transition inference and generating transitional robotic action code, the proposed plugin guides VLA models through missing transitional steps, enabling reliable execution of composite scientific workflows without any additional training. This inference-only intervention makes our method computationally efficient, data-efficient, and well-suited for open-ended and long-horizon robotic laboratory tasks. We build 3D assets of scientific instruments and common scientific operating scenes within an existing simulation environment. In these scenes, we have verified that our method increases the average success rate per atomic task by 42\% during inference. Furthermore, we show that our method can be easily transferred from the simulation to real scientific laboratories.</description>

      <title>LLM-Grounded Dynamic Task Planning with Hierarchical Temporal Logic for Human-Aware Multi-Robot Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLM) enable non-experts to specify open-world multi-robot tasks, the generated plans often lack kinematic feasibility and are not efficient, especially in long-horizon scenarios. Formal methods like Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) offer correctness and optimal guarantees, but are typically confined to static, offline settings and struggle with computational scalability. To bridge this gap, we propose a neuro-symbolic framework that grounds LLM reasoning into hierarchical LTL specifications and solves the corresponding Simultaneous Task Allocation and Planning (STAP) problem. Unlike static approaches, our system resolves stochastic environmental changes, such as moving users or updated instructions via a receding horizon planning (RHP) loop with real-time perception, which dynamically refines plans through a hierarchical state space. Extensive real-world experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms baseline methods in success rate and interaction fluency while minimizing planning latency.</description>

      <title>Optimal Control of Microswimmers for Trajectory Tracking Using Bayesian Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trajectory tracking for microswimmers remains a key challenge in microrobotics, where low-Reynolds-number dynamics make control design particularly complex. In this work, we formulate the trajectory tracking problem as an optimal control problem and solve it using a combination of B-spline parametrization with Bayesian optimization, allowing the treatment of high computational costs without requiring complex gradient computations. Applied to a flagellated magnetic swimmer, the proposed method reproduces a variety of target trajectories, including biologically inspired paths observed in experimental studies. We further evaluate the approach on a three-sphere swimmer model, demonstrating that it can adapt to and partially compensate for wall-induced hydrodynamic effects. The proposed optimization strategy can be applied consistently across models of different fidelity, from low-dimensional ODE-based models to high-fidelity PDE-based simulations, showing its robustness and generality. These results highlight the potential of Bayesian optimization as a versatile tool for optimal control strategies in microscale locomotion under complex fluid-structure interactions.</description>

      <title>Sample-Efficient Real-World Dexterous Policy Fine-Tuning via Action-Chunked Critics and Normalizing Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-world fine-tuning of dexterous manipulation policies remains challenging due to limited real-world interaction budgets and highly multimodal action distributions. Diffusion-based policies, while expressive, do not permit conservative likelihood-based updates during fine-tuning because action probabilities are intractable. In contrast, conventional Gaussian policies collapse under multimodality, particularly when actions are executed in chunks, and standard per-step critics fail to align with chunked execution, leading to poor credit assignment. We present SOFT-FLOW, a sample-efficient off-policy fine-tuning framework with normalizing flow (NF) to address these challenges. The normalizing flow policy yields exact likelihoods for multimodal action chunks, allowing conservative, stable policy updates through likelihood regularization and thereby improving sample efficiency. An action-chunked critic evaluates entire action sequences, aligning value estimation with the policy's temporal structure and improving long-horizon credit assignment. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a likelihood-based, multimodal generative policy combined with chunk-level value learning on real robotic hardware. We evaluate SOFT-FLOW on two challenging dexterous manipulation tasks in the real world: cutting tape with scissors retrieved from a case, and in-hand cube rotation with a palm-down grasp -- both of which require precise, dexterous control over long horizons. On these tasks, SOFT-FLOW achieves stable, sample-efficient adaptation where standard methods struggle.</description>

      <title>Preference Aligned Visuomotor Diffusion Policies for Deformable Object Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Humans naturally develop preferences for how manipulation tasks should be performed, which are often subtle, personal, and difficult to articulate. Although it is important for robots to account for these preferences to increase personalization and user satisfaction, they remain largely underexplored in robotic manipulation, particularly in the context of deformable objects like garments and fabrics. In this work, we study how to adapt pretrained visuomotor diffusion policies to reflect preferred behaviors using limited demonstrations. We introduce RKO, a novel preference-alignment method that combines the benefits of two recent frameworks: RPO and KTO. We evaluate RKO against common preference learning frameworks, including these two, as well as a baseline vanilla diffusion policy, on real-world cloth-folding tasks spanning multiple garments and preference settings. We show that preference-aligned policies (particularly RKO) achieve superior performance and sample efficiency compared to standard diffusion policy fine-tuning. These results highlight the importance and feasibility of structured preference learning for scaling personalized robot behavior in complex deformable object manipulation tasks.</description>

      <title>AnyTouch 2: General Optical Tactile Representation Learning For Dynamic Tactile Perception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-world contact-rich manipulation demands robots to perceive temporal tactile feedback, capture subtle surface deformations, and reason about object properties as well as force dynamics. Although optical tactile sensors are uniquely capable of providing such rich information, existing tactile datasets and models remain limited. These resources primarily focus on object-level attributes (e.g., material) while largely overlooking fine-grained tactile temporal dynamics during physical interactions. We consider that advancing dynamic tactile perception requires a systematic hierarchy of dynamic perception capabilities to guide both data collection and model design. To address the lack of tactile data with rich dynamic information, we present ToucHD, a large-scale hierarchical tactile dataset spanning tactile atomic actions, real-world manipulations, and touch-force paired data. Beyond scale, ToucHD establishes a comprehensive tactile dynamic data ecosystem that explicitly supports hierarchical perception capabilities from the data perspective. Building on it, we propose AnyTouch 2, a general tactile representation learning framework for diverse optical tactile sensors that unifies object-level understanding with fine-grained, force-aware dynamic perception. The framework captures both pixel-level and action-specific deformations across frames, while explicitly modeling physical force dynamics, thereby learning multi-level dynamic perception capabilities from the model perspective. We evaluate our model on benchmarks that covers static object properties and dynamic physical attributes, as well as real-world manipulation tasks spanning multiple tiers of dynamic perception capabilities-from basic object-level understanding to force-aware dexterous manipulation. Experimental results demonstrate consistent and strong performance across sensors and tasks.</description>

      <title>TeleGate: Whole-Body Humanoid Teleoperation via Gated Expert Selection with Motion Prior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-time whole-body teleoperation is a critical method for humanoid robots to perform complex tasks in unstructured environments. However, developing a unified controller that robustly supports diverse human motions remains a significant challenge. Existing methods typically distill multiple expert policies into a single general policy, which often inevitably leads to performance degradation, particularly on highly dynamic motions. This paper presents TeleGate, a unified whole-body teleoperation framework for humanoid robots that achieves high-precision tracking across various motions while avoiding the performance loss inherent in knowledge distillation. Our key idea is to preserve the full capability of domain-specific expert policies by training a lightweight gating network, which dynamically activates experts in real-time based on proprioceptive states and reference trajectories. Furthermore, to compensate for the absence of future reference trajectories in real-time teleoperation, we introduce a VAE-based motion prior module that extracts implicit future motion intent from historical observations, enabling anticipatory control for motions requiring prediction such as jumping and standing up. We conducted empirical evaluations in simulation and also deployed our technique on the Unitree G1 humanoid robot. Using only 2.5 hours of motion capture data for training, our TeleGate achieves high-precision real-time teleoperation across diverse dynamic motions (e.g., running, fall recovery, and jumping), significantly outperforming the baseline methods in both tracking accuracy and success rate.</description>

      <title>AutoFly: Vision-Language-Action Model for UAV Autonomous Navigation in the Wild</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-language navigation (VLN) requires intelligent agents to navigate environments by interpreting linguistic instructions alongside visual observations, serving as a cornerstone task in Embodied AI. Current VLN research for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) relies on detailed, pre-specified instructions to guide the UAV along predetermined routes. However, real-world outdoor exploration typically occurs in unknown environments where detailed navigation instructions are unavailable. Instead, only coarse-grained positional or directional guidance can be provided, requiring UAVs to autonomously navigate through continuous planning and obstacle avoidance. To bridge this gap, we propose AutoFly, an end-to-end Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model for autonomous UAV navigation. AutoFly incorporates a pseudo-depth encoder that derives depth-aware features from RGB inputs to enhance spatial reasoning, coupled with a progressive two-stage training strategy that effectively aligns visual, depth, and linguistic representations with action policies. Moreover, existing VLN datasets have fundamental limitations for real-world autonomous navigation, stemming from their heavy reliance on explicit instruction-following over autonomous decision-making and insufficient real-world data. To address these issues, we construct a novel autonomous navigation dataset that shifts the paradigm from instruction-following to autonomous behavior modeling through: (1) trajectory collection emphasizing continuous obstacle avoidance, autonomous planning, and recognition workflows; (2) comprehensive real-world data integration. Experimental results demonstrate that AutoFly achieves a 3.9% higher success rate compared to state-of-the-art VLA baselines, with consistent performance across simulated and real environments.</description>

      <title>RANT: Ant-Inspired Multi-Robot Rainforest Exploration Using Particle Filter Localisation and Virtual Pheromone Coordination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents RANT, an ant-inspired multi-robot exploration framework for noisy, uncertain environments. A team of differential-drive robots navigates a 10 x 10 m terrain, collects noisy probe measurements of a hidden richness field, and builds local probabilistic maps while the supervisor maintains a global evaluation. RANT combines particle-filter localisation, a behaviour-based controller with gradient-driven hotspot exploitation, and a lightweight no-revisit coordination mechanism based on virtual pheromone blocking. We experimentally analyse how team size, localisation fidelity, and coordination influence coverage, hotspot recall, and redundancy. Results show that particle filtering is essential for reliable hotspot engagement, coordination substantially reduces overlap, and increasing team size improves coverage but yields diminishing returns due to interference.</description>

      <title>Fast Motion Planning for Non-Holonomic Mobile Robots via a Rectangular Corridor Representation of Structured Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a complete framework for fast motion planning of non-holonomic autonomous mobile robots in highly complex but structured environments. Conventional grid-based planners struggle with scalability, while many kinematically-feasible planners impose a significant computational burden due to their search space complexity. To overcome these limitations, our approach introduces a deterministic free-space decomposition that creates a compact graph of overlapping rectangular corridors. This method enables a significant reduction in the search space, without sacrificing path resolution. The framework then performs online motion planning by finding a sequence of rectangles and generating a near-time-optimal, kinematically-feasible trajectory using an analytical planner. The result is a highly efficient solution for large-scale navigation. We validate our framework through extensive simulations and on a physical robot. The implementation is publicly available as open-source software.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Visual-Language-Action Model Scaling: Alignment, Mixture, and Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models show strong promise for generalist robot control, it remains unclear whether -- and under what conditions -- the standard "scale data" recipe translates to robotics, where training data is inherently heterogeneous across embodiments, sensors, and action spaces. We present a systematic, controlled study of VLA scaling that revisits core training choices for pretraining across diverse robots. Using a representative VLA framework that combines a vision-language backbone with flow-matching, we ablate key design decisions under matched conditions and evaluate in extensive simulation and real-robot experiments. To improve the reliability of real-world results, we introduce a Grouped Blind Ensemble protocol that blinds operators to model identity and separates policy execution from outcome judgment, reducing experimenter bias. Our analysis targets three dimensions of VLA scaling. (1) Physical alignment: we show that a unified end-effector (EEF)-relative action representation is critical for robust cross-embodiment transfer. (2) Embodiment mixture: we find that naively pooling heterogeneous robot datasets often induces negative transfer rather than gains, underscoring the fragility of indiscriminate data scaling. (3) Training regularization: we observe that intuitive strategies, such as sensory dropout and multi-stage fine-tuning, do not consistently improve performance at scale. Together, this study challenge some common assumptions about embodied scaling and provide practical guidance for training large-scale VLA policies from diverse robotic data.

      <title>NavDreamer: Video Models as Zero-Shot 3D Navigators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previous Vision-Language-Action models face critical limitations in navigation: scarce, diverse data from labor-intensive collection and static representations that fail to capture temporal dynamics and physical laws. We propose NavDreamer, a video-based framework for 3D navigation that leverages generative video models as a universal interface between language instructions and navigation trajectories. Our main hypothesis is that video's ability to encode spatiotemporal information and physical dynamics, combined with internet-scale availability, enables strong zero-shot generalization in navigation. To mitigate the stochasticity of generative predictions, we introduce a sampling-based optimization method that utilizes a VLM for trajectory scoring and selection. An inverse dynamics model is employed to decode executable waypoints from generated video plans for navigation. To systematically evaluate this paradigm in several video model backbones, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark covering object navigation, precise navigation, spatial grounding, language control, and scene reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate robust generalization across novel objects and unseen environments, with ablation studies revealing that navigation's high-level decision-making nature makes it particularly suited for video-based planning.</description>

      <title>Diverse Skill Discovery for Quadruped Robots via Unsupervised Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning necessitates meticulous reward shaping by specialists to elicit target behaviors, while imitation learning relies on costly task-specific data. In contrast, unsupervised skill discovery can potentially reduce these burdens by learning a diverse repertoire of useful skills driven by intrinsic motivation. However, existing methods exhibit two key limitations: they typically rely on a single policy to master a versatile repertoire of behaviors without modeling the shared structure or distinctions among them, which results in low learning efficiency; moreover, they are susceptible to reward hacking, where the reward signal increases and converges rapidly while the learned skills display insufficient actual diversity. In this work, we introduce an Orthogonal Mixture-of-Experts (OMoE) architecture that prevents diverse behaviors from collapsing into overlapping representations, enabling a single policy to master a wide spectrum of locomotion skills. In addition, we design a multi-discriminator framework in which different discriminators operate on distinct observation spaces, effectively mitigating reward hacking. We evaluated our method on the 12-DOF Unitree A1 quadruped robot, demonstrating a diverse set of locomotion skills. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework boosts training efficiency and yields an 18.3\% expansion in state-space coverage compared to the baseline.</description>

      <title>Design and Evaluation of an Assisted Programming Interface for Behavior Trees in Robotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The possibility to create reactive robot programs faster without the need for extensively trained programmers is becoming increasingly important. So far, it has not been explored how various techniques for creating Behavior Tree (BT) program representations could be combined with complete graphical user interfaces (GUIs) to allow a human user to validate and edit trees suggested by automated methods. In this paper, we introduce BEhavior TRee GUI (BETR-GUI) for creating BTs with the help of an AI assistant that combines methods using large language models, planning, genetic programming, and Bayesian optimization with a drag-and-drop editor. A user study with 60 participants shows that by combining different assistive methods, BETR-GUI enables users to perform better at solving the robot programming tasks. The results also show that humans using the full variant of BETR-GUI perform better than the AI assistant running on its own.</description>

      <title>BagelVLA: Enhancing Long-Horizon Manipulation via Interleaved Vision-Language-Action Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Equipping embodied agents with the ability to reason about tasks, foresee physical outcomes, and generate precise actions is essential for general-purpose manipulation. While recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have leveraged pre-trained foundation models, they typically focus on either linguistic planning or visual forecasting in isolation. These methods rarely integrate both capabilities simultaneously to guide action generation, leading to suboptimal performance in complex, long-horizon manipulation tasks. To bridge this gap, we propose BagelVLA, a unified model that integrates linguistic planning, visual forecasting, and action generation within a single framework. Initialized from a pretrained unified understanding and generative model, BagelVLA is trained to interleave textual reasoning and visual prediction directly into the action execution loop. To efficiently couple these modalities, we introduce Residual Flow Guidance (RFG), which initializes from current observation and leverages single-step denoising to extract predictive visual features, guiding action generation with minimal latency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BagelVLA outperforms existing baselines by a significant margin on multiple simulated and real-world benchmarks, particularly in tasks requiring multi-stage reasoning.</description>

      <title>TriPilot-FF: Coordinated Whole-Body Teleoperation with Force Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mobile manipulators broaden the operational envelope for robot manipulation. However, the whole-body teleoperation of such robots remains a problem: operators must coordinate a wheeled base and two arms while reasoning about obstacles and contact. Existing interfaces are predominantly hand-centric (e.g., VR controllers and joysticks), leaving foot-operated channels underexplored for continuous base control. We present TriPilot-FF, an open-source whole-body teleoperation system for a custom bimanual mobile manipulator that introduces a foot-operated pedal with lidar-driven pedal haptics, coupled with upper-body bimanual leader-follower teleoperation. Using only a low-cost base-mounted lidar, TriPilot-FF renders a resistive pedal cue from proximity-to-obstacle signals in the commanded direction, shaping operator commands toward collision-averse behaviour without an explicit collision-avoidance controller. The system also supports arm-side force reflection for contact awareness and provides real-time force and visual guidance of bimanual manipulability to prompt mobile base repositioning, thereby improving reach. We demonstrate the capability of TriPilot-FF to effectively ``co-pilot'' the human operator over long time-horizons and tasks requiring precise mobile base movement and coordination. Finally, we incorporate teleoperation feedback signals into an Action Chunking with Transformers (ACT) policy and demonstrate improved performance when the additional information is available. We release the pedal device design, full software stack, and conduct extensive real-world evaluations on a bimanual wheeled platform.

      <title>TaCo: A Benchmark for Lossless and Lossy Codecs of Heterogeneous Tactile Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tactile sensing is crucial for embodied intelligence, providing fine-grained perception and control in complex environments. However, efficient tactile data compression, which is essential for real-time robotic applications under strict bandwidth constraints, remains underexplored. The inherent heterogeneity and spatiotemporal complexity of tactile data further complicate this challenge. To bridge this gap, we introduce TaCo, the first comprehensive benchmark for Tactile data Codecs. TaCo evaluates 30 compression methods, including off-the-shelf compression algorithms and neural codecs, across five diverse datasets from various sensor types. We systematically assess both lossless and lossy compression schemes on four key tasks: lossless storage, human visualization, material and object classification, and dexterous robotic grasping. Notably, we pioneer the development of data-driven codecs explicitly trained on tactile data, TaCo-LL (lossless) and TaCo-L (lossy). Results have validated the superior performance of our TaCo-LL and TaCo-L. This benchmark provides a foundational framework for understanding the critical trade-offs between compression efficiency and task performance, paving the way for future advances in tactile perception.</description>

      <title>Instruct2Act: From Human Instruction to Actions Sequencing and Execution via Robot Action Network for Robotic Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robots often struggle to follow free-form human instructions in real-world settings due to computational and sensing limitations. We address this gap with a lightweight, fully on-device pipeline that converts natural-language commands into reliable manipulation. Our approach has two stages: (i) the instruction to actions module (Instruct2Act), a compact BiLSTM with a multi-head-attention autoencoder that parses an instruction into an ordered sequence of atomic actions (e.g., reach, grasp, move, place); and (ii) the robot action network (RAN), which uses the dynamic adaptive trajectory radial network (DATRN) together with a vision-based environment analyzer (YOLOv8) to generate precise control trajectories for each sub-action. The entire system runs on a modest system with no cloud services. On our custom proprietary dataset, Instruct2Act attains 91.5% sub-actions prediction accuracy while retaining a small footprint. Real-robot evaluations across four tasks (pick-place, pick-pour, wipe, and pick-give) yield an overall 90% success; sub-action inference completes in &lt; 3.8s, with end-to-end executions in 30-60s depending on task complexity. These results demonstrate that fine-grained instruction-to-action parsing, coupled with DATRN-based trajectory generation and vision-guided grounding, provides a practical path to deterministic, real-time manipulation in resource-constrained, single-camera settings.</description>

      <title>Hydra-Nav: Object Navigation via Adaptive Dual-Process Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While large vision-language models (VLMs) show promise for object goal navigation, current methods still struggle with low success rates and inefficient localization of unseen objects--failures primarily attributed to weak temporal-spatial reasoning. Meanwhile, recent attempts to inject reasoning into VLM-based agents improve success rates but incur substantial computational overhead. To address both the ineffectiveness and inefficiency of existing approaches, we introduce Hydra-Nav, a unified VLM architecture that adaptively switches between a deliberative slow system for analyzing exploration history and formulating high-level plans, and a reactive fast system for efficient execution. We train Hydra-Nav through a three-stage curriculum: (i) spatial-action alignment to strengthen trajectory planning, (ii) memory-reasoning integration to enhance temporal-spatial reasoning over long-horizon exploration, and (iii) iterative rejection fine-tuning to enable selective reasoning at critical decision points. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Hydra-Nav achieves state-of-the-art performance on the HM3D, MP3D, and OVON benchmarks, outperforming the second-best methods by 11.1%, 17.4%, and 21.2%, respectively. Furthermore, we introduce SOT (Success weighted by Operation Time), a new metric to measure search efficiency across VLMs with varying reasoning intensity. Results show that adaptive reasoning significantly enhances search efficiency over fixed-frequency baselines.</description>

      <title>RoboInter: A Holistic Intermediate Representation Suite Towards Robotic Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advances in large vision-language models (VLMs) have stimulated growing interest in vision-language-action (VLA) systems for robot manipulation. However, existing manipulation datasets remain costly to curate, highly embodiment-specific, and insufficient in coverage and diversity, thereby hindering the generalization of VLA models. Recent approaches attempt to mitigate these limitations via a plan-then-execute paradigm, where high-level plans (e.g., subtasks, trace) are first generated and subsequently translated into low-level actions, but they critically rely on extra intermediate supervision, which is largely absent from existing datasets. To bridge this gap, we introduce the RoboInter Manipulation Suite, a unified resource including data, benchmarks, and models of intermediate representations for manipulation. It comprises RoboInter-Tool, a lightweight GUI that enables semi-automatic annotation of diverse representations, and RoboInter-Data, a large-scale dataset containing over 230k episodes across 571 diverse scenes, which provides dense per-frame annotations over more than 10 categories of intermediate representations, substantially exceeding prior work in scale and annotation quality. Building upon this foundation, RoboInter-VQA introduces 9 spatial and 20 temporal embodied VQA categories to systematically benchmark and enhance the embodied reasoning capabilities of VLMs. Meanwhile, RoboInter-VLA offers an integrated plan-then-execute framework, supporting modular and end-to-end VLA variants that bridge high-level planning with low-level execution via intermediate supervision. In total, RoboInter establishes a practical foundation for advancing robust and generalizable robotic learning via fine-grained and diverse intermediate representations.</description>

      <title>Acoustic Drone Package Delivery Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, the illicit use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for deliveries in restricted area such as prisons became a significant security challenge. While numerous studies have focused on UAV detection or localization, little attention has been given to delivery events identification. This study presents the first acoustic package delivery detection algorithm using a ground-based microphone array. The proposed method estimates both the drone's propeller speed and the delivery event using solely acoustic features. A deep neural network detects the presence of a drone and estimates the propeller's rotation speed or blade passing frequency (BPF) from a mel spectrogram. The algorithm analyzes the BPFs to identify probable delivery moments based on sudden changes before and after a specific time. Results demonstrate a mean absolute error of the blade passing frequency estimator of 16 Hz when the drone is less than 150 meters away from the microphone array. The drone presence detection estimator has a accuracy of 97%. The delivery detection algorithm correctly identifies 96% of events with a false positive rate of 8%. This study shows that deliveries can be identified using acoustic signals up to a range of 100 meters.</description>

      <title>A Collaborative Safety Shield for Safe and Efficient CAV Lane Changes in Congested On-Ramp Merging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lane changing in dense traffic is a significant challenge for Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs). Existing lane change controllers primarily either ensure safety or collaboratively improve traffic efficiency, but do not consider these conflicting objectives together. To address this, we propose the Multi-Agent Safety Shield (MASS), designed using Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) to enable safe and collaborative lane changes. The MASS enables collaboration by capturing multi-agent interactions among CAVs through interaction topologies constructed as a graph using a simple algorithm. Further, a state-of-the-art Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) lane change controller is extended by integrating MASS to ensure safety and defining a customised reward function to prioritise efficiency improvements. As a result, we propose a lane change controller, known as MARL-MASS, and evaluate it in a congested on-ramp merging simulation. The results demonstrate that MASS enables collaborative lane changes with safety guarantees by strictly respecting the safety constraints. Moreover, the proposed custom reward function improves the stability of MARL policies trained with a safety shield. Overall, by encouraging the exploration of a collaborative lane change policy while respecting safety constraints, MARL-MASS effectively balances the trade-off between ensuring safety and improving traffic efficiency in congested traffic. The code for MARL-MASS is available with an open-source licence at https://github.com/hkbharath/MARL-MASS</description>

      <title>Learning Force-Regulated Manipulation with a Low-Cost Tactile-Force-Controlled Gripper</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Successfully manipulating many everyday objects, such as potato chips, requires precise force regulation. Failure to modulate force can lead to task failure or irreversible damage to the objects. Humans can precisely achieve this by adapting force from tactile feedback, even within a short period of physical contact. We aim to give robots this capability. However, commercial grippers exhibit high cost or high minimum force, making them unsuitable for studying force-controlled policy learning with everyday force-sensitive objects. We introduce TF-Gripper, a low-cost (~$150) force-controlled parallel-jaw gripper that integrates tactile sensing as feedback. It has an effective force range of 0.45-45N and is compatible with different robot arms. Additionally, we designed a teleoperation device paired with TF-Gripper to record human-applied grasping forces. While standard low-frequency policies can be trained on this data, they struggle with the reactive, contact-dependent nature of force regulation. To overcome this, we propose RETAF (REactive Tactile Adaptation of Force), a framework that decouples grasping force control from arm pose prediction. RETAF regulates force at high frequency using wrist images and tactile feedback, while a base policy predicts end-effector pose and gripper open/close action. We evaluate TF-Gripper and RETAF across five real-world tasks requiring precise force regulation. Results show that compared to position control, direct force control significantly improves grasp stability and task performance. We further show that tactile feedback is essential for force regulation, and that RETAF consistently outperforms baselines and can be integrated with various base policies. We hope this work opens a path for scaling the learning of force-controlled policies in robotic manipulation. Project page: https://force-gripper.github.io .</description>

      <title>RoboSubtaskNet: Temporal Sub-task Segmentation for Human-to-Robot Skill Transfer in Real-World Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Temporally locating and classifying fine-grained sub-task segments in long, untrimmed videos is crucial to safe human-robot collaboration. Unlike generic activity recognition, collaborative manipulation requires sub-task labels that are directly robot-executable. We present RoboSubtaskNet, a multi-stage human-to-robot sub-task segmentation framework that couples attention-enhanced I3D features (RGB plus optical flow) with a modified MS-TCN employing a Fibonacci dilation schedule to capture better short-horizon transitions such as reach-pick-place. The network is trained with a composite objective comprising cross-entropy and temporal regularizers (truncated MSE and a transition-aware term) to reduce over-segmentation and to encourage valid sub-task progressions. To close the gap between vision benchmarks and control, we introduce RoboSubtask, a dataset of healthcare and industrial demonstrations annotated at the sub-task level and designed for deterministic mapping to manipulator primitives. Empirically, RoboSubtaskNet outperforms MS-TCN and MS-TCN++ on GTEA and our RoboSubtask benchmark (boundary-sensitive and sequence metrics), while remaining competitive on the long-horizon Breakfast benchmark. Specifically, RoboSubtaskNet attains F1 @ 50 = 79.5%, Edit = 88.6%, Acc = 78.9% on GTEA; F1 @ 50 = 30.4%, Edit = 52.0%, Acc = 53.5% on Breakfast; and F1 @ 50 = 94.2%, Edit = 95.6%, Acc = 92.2% on RoboSubtask. We further validate the full perception-to-execution pipeline on a 7-DoF Kinova Gen3 manipulator, achieving reliable end-to-end behavior in physical trials (overall task success approx 91.25%). These results demonstrate a practical path from sub-task level video understanding to deployed robotic manipulation in real-world settings.</description>

      <title>A Collision-Free Sway Damping Model Predictive Controller for Safe and Reactive Forestry Crane Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Forestry cranes operate in dynamic, unstructured outdoor environments where simultaneous collision avoidance and payload sway control are critical for safe navigation. Existing approaches address these challenges separately, either focusing on sway damping with predefined collision-free paths or performing collision avoidance only at the global planning level. We present the first collision-free, sway-damping model predictive controller (MPC) for a forestry crane that unifies both objectives in a single control framework. Our approach integrates LiDAR-based environment mapping directly into the MPC using online Euclidean distance fields (EDF), enabling real-time environmental adaptation. The controller simultaneously enforces collision constraints while damping payload sway, allowing it to (i) replan upon quasi-static environmental changes, (ii) maintain collision-free operation under disturbances, and (iii) provide safe stopping when no bypass exists. Experimental validation on a real forestry crane demonstrates effective sway damping and successful obstacle avoidance. A video can be found at https://youtu.be/tEXDoeLLTxA.</description>

      <title>Humanoid Factors: Design Principles for AI Humanoids in Human Worlds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human factors research has long focused on optimizing environments, tools, and systems to account for human performance. Yet, as humanoid robots begin to share our workplaces, homes, and public spaces, the design challenge expands. We must now consider not only factors for humans but also factors for humanoids, since both will coexist and interact within the same environments. Unlike conventional machines, humanoids introduce expectations of human-like behavior, communication, and social presence, which reshape usability, trust, and safety considerations. In this article, we introduce the concept of humanoid factors as a framework structured around four pillars - physical, cognitive, social, and ethical - that shape the development of humanoids to help them effectively coexist and collaborate with humans. This framework characterizes the overlap and divergence between human capabilities and those of general-purpose humanoids powered by AI foundation models. To demonstrate our framework's practical utility, we then apply the framework to evaluate a real-world humanoid control algorithm, illustrating how conventional task completion metrics in robotics overlook key human cognitive and interaction principles. We thus position humanoid factors as a foundational framework for designing, evaluating, and governing sustained human-humanoid coexistence.</description>

      <title>UniVTAC: A Unified Simulation Platform for Visuo-Tactile Manipulation Data Generation, Learning, and Benchmarking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robotic manipulation has seen rapid progress with vision-language-action (VLA) policies. However, visuo-tactile perception is critical for contact-rich manipulation, as tasks such as insertion are difficult to complete robustly using vision alone. At the same time, acquiring large-scale and reliable tactile data in the physical world remains costly and challenging, and the lack of a unified evaluation platform further limits policy learning and systematic analysis. To address these challenges, we propose UniVTAC, a simulation-based visuo-tactile data synthesis platform that supports three commonly used visuo-tactile sensors and enables scalable and controllable generation of informative contact interactions. Based on this platform, we introduce the UniVTAC Encoder, a visuo-tactile encoder trained on large-scale simulation-synthesized data with designed supervisory signals, providing tactile-centric visuo-tactile representations for downstream manipulation tasks. In addition, we present the UniVTAC Benchmark, which consists of eight representative visuo-tactile manipulation tasks for evaluating tactile-driven policies. Experimental results show that integrating the UniVTAC Encoder improves average success rates by 17.1% on the UniVTAC Benchmark, while real-world robotic experiments further demonstrate a 25% improvement in task success.

      <title>VLA-JEPA: Enhancing Vision-Language-Action Model with Latent World Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pretraining Vision-Language-Action (VLA) policies on internet-scale video is appealing, yet current latent-action objectives often learn the wrong thing: they remain anchored to pixel variation rather than action-relevant state transitions, making them vulnerable to appearance bias, nuisance motion, and information leakage. We introduce VLA-JEPA, a JEPA-style pretraining framework that sidesteps these pitfalls by design. The key idea is \emph{leakage-free state prediction}: a target encoder produces latent representations from future frames, while the student pathway sees only the current observation -- future information is used solely as supervision targets, never as input. By predicting in latent space rather than pixel space, VLA-JEPA learns dynamics abstractions that are robust to camera motion and irrelevant background changes. This yields a simple two-stage recipe -- JEPA pretraining followed by action-head fine-tuning -- without the multi-stage complexity of prior latent-action pipelines. Experiments on LIBERO, LIBERO-Plus, SimplerEnv and real-world manipulation tasks show that VLA-JEPA achieves consistent gains in generalization and robustness over existing methods.</description>

      <title>Robo3R: Enhancing Robotic Manipulation with Accurate Feed-Forward 3D Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D spatial perception is fundamental to generalizable robotic manipulation, yet obtaining reliable, high-quality 3D geometry remains challenging. Depth sensors suffer from noise and material sensitivity, while existing reconstruction models lack the precision and metric consistency required for physical interaction. We introduce Robo3R, a feed-forward, manipulation-ready 3D reconstruction model that predicts accurate, metric-scale scene geometry directly from RGB images and robot states in real time. Robo3R jointly infers scale-invariant local geometry and relative camera poses, which are unified into the scene representation in the canonical robot frame via a learned global similarity transformation. To meet the precision demands of manipulation, Robo3R employs a masked point head for sharp, fine-grained point clouds, and a keypoint-based Perspective-n-Point (PnP) formulation to refine camera extrinsics and global alignment. Trained on Robo3R-4M, a curated large-scale synthetic dataset with four million high-fidelity annotated frames, Robo3R consistently outperforms state-of-the-art reconstruction methods and depth sensors. Across downstream tasks including imitation learning, sim-to-real transfer, grasp synthesis, and collision-free motion planning, we observe consistent gains in performance, suggesting the promise of this alternative 3D sensing module for robotic manipulation.</description>

      <title>DexImit: Learning Bimanual Dexterous Manipulation from Monocular Human Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data scarcity fundamentally limits the generalization of bimanual dexterous manipulation, as real-world data collection for dexterous hands is expensive and labor-intensive. Human manipulation videos, as a direct carrier of manipulation knowledge, offer significant potential for scaling up robot learning. However, the substantial embodiment gap between human hands and robotic dexterous hands makes direct pretraining from human videos extremely challenging. To bridge this gap and unleash the potential of large-scale human manipulation video data, we propose DexImit, an automated framework that converts monocular human manipulation videos into physically plausible robot data, without any additional information. DexImit employs a four-stage generation pipeline: (1) reconstructing hand-object interactions from arbitrary viewpoints with near-metric scale; (2) performing subtask decomposition and bimanual scheduling; (3) synthesizing robot trajectories consistent with the demonstrated interactions; (4) comprehensive data augmentation for zero-shot real-world deployment. Building on these designs, DexImit can generate large-scale robot data based on human videos, either from the Internet or video generation models. DexImit is capable of handling diverse manipulation tasks, including tool use (e.g., cutting an apple), long-horizon tasks (e.g., making a beverage), and fine-grained manipulations (e.g., stacking cups).</description>

      <title>EgoHumanoid: Unlocking In-the-Wild Loco-Manipulation with Robot-Free Egocentric Demonstration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human demonstrations offer rich environmental diversity and scale naturally, making them an appealing alternative to robot teleoperation. While this paradigm has advanced robot-arm manipulation, its potential for the more challenging, data-hungry problem of humanoid loco-manipulation remains largely unexplored. We present EgoHumanoid, the first framework to co-train a vision-language-action policy using abundant egocentric human demonstrations together with a limited amount of robot data, enabling humanoids to perform loco-manipulation across diverse real-world environments. To bridge the embodiment gap between humans and robots, including discrepancies in physical morphology and viewpoint, we introduce a systematic alignment pipeline spanning from hardware design to data processing. A portable system for scalable human data collection is developed, and we establish practical collection protocols to improve transferability. At the core of our human-to-humanoid alignment pipeline lies two key components. The view alignment reduces visual domain discrepancies caused by camera height and perspective variation. The action alignment maps human motions into a unified, kinematically feasible action space for humanoid control. Extensive real-world experiments demonstrate that incorporating robot-free egocentric data significantly outperforms robot-only baselines by 51\%, particularly in unseen environments. Our analysis further reveals which behaviors transfer effectively and the potential for scaling human data.</description>

      <title>ST4VLA: Spatially Guided Training for Vision-Language-Action Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) excel at multimodal understanding but fall short when extended to embodied tasks, where instructions must be transformed into low-level motor actions. We introduce ST4VLA, a dual-system Vision-Language-Action framework that leverages Spatial Guided Training to align action learning with spatial priors in VLMs. ST4VLA includes two stages: (i) spatial grounding pre-training, which equips the VLM with transferable priors via scalable point, box, and trajectory prediction from both web-scale and robot-specific data, and (ii) spatially guided action post-training, which encourages the model to produce richer spatial priors to guide action generation via spatial prompting. This design preserves spatial grounding during policy learning and promotes consistent optimization across spatial and action objectives. Empirically, ST4VLA achieves substantial improvements over vanilla VLA, with performance increasing from 66.1 -&gt; 84.6 on Google Robot and from 54.7 -&gt; 73.2 on WidowX Robot, establishing new state-of-the-art results on SimplerEnv. It also demonstrates stronger generalization to unseen objects and paraphrased instructions, as well as robustness to long-horizon perturbations in real-world settings. These results highlight scalable spatially guided training as a promising direction for robust, generalizable robot learning.

      <title>Learning Agile Quadrotor Flight in the Real World</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning-based controllers have achieved impressive performance in agile quadrotor flight but typically rely on massive training in simulation, necessitating accurate system identification for effective Sim2Real transfer. However, even with precise modeling, fixed policies remain susceptible to out-of-distribution scenarios, ranging from external aerodynamic disturbances to internal hardware degradation. To ensure safety under these evolving uncertainties, such controllers are forced to operate with conservative safety margins, inherently constraining their agility outside of controlled settings. While online adaptation offers a potential remedy, safely exploring physical limits remains a critical bottleneck due to data scarcity and safety risks. To bridge this gap, we propose a self-adaptive framework that eliminates the need for precise system identification or offline Sim2Real transfer. We introduce Adaptive Temporal Scaling (ATS) to actively explore platform physical limits, and employ online residual learning to augment a simple nominal model. {Based on the learned hybrid model, we further propose Real-world Anchored Short-horizon Backpropagation Through Time (RASH-BPTT) to achieve efficient and robust in-flight policy updates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our quadrotor reliably executes agile maneuvers near actuator saturation limits. The system evolves a conservative base policy with a peak speed of 1.9 m/s to 7.3 m/s within approximately 100 seconds of flight time. These findings underscore that real-world adaptation serves not merely to compensate for modeling errors, but as a practical mechanism for sustained performance improvement in aggressive flight regimes.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in sampling-based motion planning algorithms for high DOF arms leverage GPUs to provide SOTA performance. These algorithms can be used to control multiple arms jointly, but this approach scales poorly. To address this, we extend STORM, a sampling-based model-predictive-control (MPC) motion planning algorithm, to handle multiple robots in a distributed fashion. First, we modify STORM to handle dynamic obstacles. Then, we let each arm compute its own motion plan prefix, which it shares with the other arms, which treat it as a dynamic obstacle. Finally, we add a dynamic priority scheme. The new algorithm, MR-STORM, demonstrates clear empirical advantages over SOTA algorithms when operating with both static and dynamic obstacles.</description>

      <title>LiDAR-based 3D Change Detection at City Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21112v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-definition 3D city maps enable city planning and change detection, which is essential for municipal compliance, map maintenance, and asset monitoring, including both built structures and urban greenery. Conventional Digital Surface Model (DSM) and image differencing are sensitive to vertical bias and viewpoint mismatch, while original point cloud or voxel models require large memory, assume perfect alignment, and degrade thin structures. We propose an uncertainty-aware, object-centric method for city-scale LiDAR-based change detection. Our method aligns data from different time periods using multi-resolution Normal Distributions Transform (NDT) and a point-to-plane Iterative Closest Point (ICP) method, normalizes elevation, and computes a per-point level of detection from registration covariance and surface roughness to calibrate change decisions. Geometry-based associations are refined by semantic and instance segmentation and optimized using class-constrained bipartite assignment with augmented dummies to handle split-merge cases. Tiled processing bounds memory and preserves narrow ground changes, while instance-level decisions integrate overlap, displacement, and volumetric differences under local detection gating. We perform experiments on a Subiaco (Western Australia) dataset captured in 2023 and again in 2025. Our method achieves 95.3% accuracy, 90.8% mF1, and 82.9% mIoU, improving over the strongest baseline, Triplet KPConv, by 0.3, 0.6, and 1.1 points, respectively. The datasets are available on IEEE DataPort (2023: https://ieee-dataport.org/documents/2023-subiaco-wa-3d-hd-lidar-point-cloud-maps-dataset and 2025: https://ieee-dataport.org/documents/2025-subiaco-wa-3d-hd-lidar-gnss-point-cloud-maps-dataset).

      <title>Finite-time Stable Pose Estimation on TSE(3) using Point Cloud and Velocity Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents a finite-time stable pose estimator (FTS-PE) for rigid bodies undergoing rotational and translational motion in three dimensions, using measurements from onboard sensors that provide position vectors to inertially-fixed points and body velocities. The FTS-PE is a full-state observer for the pose (position and orientation) and velocities and is obtained through a Lyapunov analysis that shows its stability in finite time and its robustness to bounded measurement noise. Further, this observer is designed directly on the state space, the tangent bundle of the Lie group of rigid body motions, SE(3), without using local coordinates or (dual) quaternion representations. Therefore, it can estimate arbitrary rigid body motions without encountering singularities or the unwinding phenomenon and be readily applied to autonomous vehicles. A version of this observer that does not need translational velocity measurements and uses only point clouds and angular velocity measurements from rate gyros, is also obtained. It is discretized using the framework of geometric mechanics for numerical and experimental implementations. The numerical simulations compare the FTS-PE with a dual-quaternion extended Kalman filter and our previously developed variational pose estimator (VPE). The experimental results are obtained using point cloud images and rate gyro measurements obtained from a Zed 2i stereo depth camera sensor. These results validate the stability and robustness of the FTS-PE.</description>

      <title>Lateral tracking control of all-wheel steering vehicles with intelligent tires</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.09427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The accurate characterization of tire dynamics is critical for advancing control strategies in autonomous road vehicles, as tire behavior significantly influences handling and stability through the generation of forces and moments at the tire-road interface. Smart tire technologies have emerged as a promising tool for sensing key variables such as road friction, tire pressure, and wear states, and for estimating kinematic and dynamic states like vehicle speed and tire forces. However, most existing estimation and control algorithms rely on empirical correlations or machine learning approaches, which require extensive calibration and can be sensitive to variations in operating conditions. In contrast, model-based techniques, which leverage infinite-dimensional representations of tire dynamics using partial differential equations (PDEs), offer a more robust approach. This paper proposes a novel model-based, output-feedback lateral tracking control strategy for all-wheel steering vehicles that integrates distributed tire dynamics with smart tire technologies. The primary contributions include the suppression of micro-shimmy phenomena at low speeds and path-following via force control, achieved through the estimation of tire slip angles, vehicle kinematics, and lateral tire forces. The proposed controller and observer are based on formulations using ODE-PDE systems, representing rigid body dynamics and distributed tire behavior. This work marks the first rigorous control strategy for vehicular systems equipped with distributed tire representations in conjunction with smart tire technologies.</description>

      <title>First-order friction models with bristle dynamics: lumped and distributed formulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamic models, particularly rate-dependent models, have proven effective in capturing the key phenomenological features of frictional processes, whilst also possessing important mathematical properties that facilitate the design of control and estimation algorithms. However, many rate-dependent formulations are built on empirical considerations, whereas physical derivations may offer greater interpretability. In this context, starting from fundamental physical principles, this paper introduces a novel class of first-order dynamic friction models that approximate the dynamics of a bristle element by inverting the friction characteristic. Amongst the developed models, a specific formulation closely resembling the LuGre model is derived using a simple rheological equation for the bristle element. This model is rigorously analyzed in terms of stability and passivity -- important properties that support the synthesis of observers and controllers. Furthermore, a distributed version, formulated as a hyperbolic partial differential equation (PDE), is presented, which enables the modeling of frictional processes commonly encountered in rolling contact phenomena. The tribological behavior of the proposed description is evaluated through classical experiments and validated against the response predicted by the LuGre model, revealing both notable similarities and key differences.</description>

      <title>Perception with Guarantees: Certified Pose Estimation via Reachability Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Agents in cyber-physical systems are increasingly entrusted with safety-critical tasks. Ensuring safety of these agents often requires localizing the pose for subsequent actions. Pose estimates can, e.g., be obtained from various combinations of lidar sensors, cameras, and external services such as GPS. Crucially, in safety-critical domains, a rough estimate is insufficient to formally determine safety, i.e., guaranteeing safety even in the worst-case scenario, and external services might additionally not be trustworthy. We address this problem by presenting a certified pose estimation in 3D solely from a camera image and a well-known target geometry. This is realized by formally bounding the pose, which is computed by leveraging recent results from reachability analysis and formal neural network verification. Our experiments demonstrate that our approach efficiently and accurately localizes agents in both synthetic and real-world experiments.</description>

      <title>SAGE: Scalable Agentic 3D Scene Generation for Embodied AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real-world data collection for embodied agents remains costly and unsafe, calling for scalable, realistic, and simulator-ready 3D environments. However, existing scene-generation systems often rely on rule-based or task-specific pipelines, yielding artifacts and physically invalid scenes. We present SAGE, an agentic framework that, given a user-specified embodied task (e.g., "pick up a bowl and place it on the table"), understands the intent and automatically generates simulation-ready environments at scale. The agent couples multiple generators for layout and object composition with critics that evaluate semantic plausibility, visual realism, and physical stability. Through iterative reasoning and adaptive tool selection, it self-refines the scenes until meeting user intent and physical validity. The resulting environments are realistic, diverse, and directly deployable in modern simulators for policy training. Policies trained purely on this data exhibit clear scaling trends and generalize to unseen objects and layouts, demonstrating the promise of simulation-driven scaling for embodied AI. Code, demos, and the SAGE-10k dataset can be found on the project page here: https://nvlabs.github.io/sage.</description>

      <title>xFLIE: Leveraging Actionable Hierarchical Scene Representations for Autonomous Semantic-Aware Inspection Missions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19571v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel architecture aimed towards incremental construction and exploitation of a hierarchical 3D scene graph representation during semantic-aware inspection missions. Inspection planning, particularly of distributed targets in previously unseen environments, presents an opportunity to exploit the semantic structure of the scene during reasoning, navigation and scene understanding. Motivated by this, we propose the 3D Layered Semantic Graph (3DLSG), a hierarchical inspection scene graph constructed in an incremental manner and organized into abstraction layers that support planning demands in real-time. To address the task of semantic-aware inspection, a mission framework, termed as Enhanced First-Look Inspect Explore (xFLIE), that tightly couples the 3DLSG with an inspection planner is proposed. We assess the performance through simulations and experimental trials, evaluating target-selection, path-planning and semantic navigation tasks over the 3DLSG model. The scenarios presented are diverse, ranging from city-scale distributed to solitary infrastructure targets in simulated worlds and subsequent outdoor and subterranean environment deployments onboard a quadrupedal robot. The proposed method successfully demonstrates incremental construction and planning over the 3DLSG representation to meet the objectives of the missions. Furthermore, the framework demonstrates successful semantic navigation tasks over the structured interface at the end of the inspection missions. Finally, we report multiple orders of magnitude reduction in path-planning time compared to conventional volumetric-map-based methods over various environment scale, demonstrating the planning efficiency and scalability of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>TURBO: Utility-Aware Bandwidth Allocation for Cloud-Augmented Autonomous Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20127v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Autonomous driving system progress has been driven by improvements in machine learning models, whose computational demands now exceed what edge devices alone can provide. The cloud offers abundant compute, but the network has long been treated as an unreliable bottleneck rather than a co-equal part of the autonomous vehicle control loop. We argue that this separation is no longer tenable: safety-critical autonomy requires co-design of control, models, and network resource allocation itself.
  We introduce TURBO, a cloud-augmented control framework that addresses this challenge, formulating bandwidth allocation and control pipeline configuration across both the car and cloud as a joint optimization problem. TURBO maximizes benefit to the car while guaranteeing safety in the face of highly variable network conditions. We implement TURBO and evaluate it in both simulation and real-world deployment, showing it can improve average accuracy by up to 15.6%pt over existing on-vehicle-only pipelines. Our code is made available at www.github.com/NetSys/turbo.</description>

Abstract: The ocean is warming and acidifying, increasing the risk of mass mortality events for temperature-sensitive shellfish such as oysters. This motivates the development of long-term monitoring systems. However, human labor is costly and long-duration underwater work is highly hazardous, thus favoring robotic solutions as a safer and more efficient option. To enable underwater robots to make real-time, environment-aware decisions without human intervention, we must equip them with an intelligent "brain." This highlights the need for persistent,wide-area, and low-cost benthic monitoring. To this end, we present DREAM, a Vision Language Model (VLM)-guided autonomy framework for long-term underwater exploration and habitat monitoring. The results show that our framework is highly efficient in finding and exploring target objects (e.g., oysters, shipwrecks) without prior location information. In the oyster-monitoring task, our framework takes 31.5% less time than the previous baseline with the same amount of oysters. Compared to the vanilla VLM, it uses 23% fewer steps while covering 8.88% more oysters. In shipwreck scenes, our framework successfully explores and maps the wreck without collisions, requiring 27.5% fewer steps than the vanilla model and achieving 100% coverage, while the vanilla model achieves 60.23% average coverage in our shipwreck environments.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous Calibration of Noise Covariance and Kinematics for State Estimation of Legged Robots via Bi-level Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11539v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate state estimation is critical for legged and aerial robots operating in dynamic, uncertain environments. A key challenge lies in specifying process and measurement noise covariances, which are typically unknown or manually tuned. In this work, we introduce a bi-level optimization framework that jointly calibrates covariance matrices and kinematic parameters in an estimator-in-the-loop manner. The upper level treats noise covariances and model parameters as optimization variables, while the lower level executes a full-information estimator. Differentiating through the estimator allows direct optimization of trajectory-level objectives, resulting in accurate and consistent state estimates. We validate our approach on quadrupedal and humanoid robots, demonstrating significantly improved estimation accuracy and uncertainty calibration compared to hand-tuned baselines. Our method unifies state estimation, sensor, and kinematics calibration into a principled, data-driven framework applicable across diverse robotic platforms.</description>

      <title>VDRive: Leveraging Reinforced VLA and Diffusion Policy for End-to-end Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15446v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In autonomous driving, dynamic environment and corner cases pose significant challenges to the robustness of ego vehicle's state understanding and decision making. We introduce VDRive, a novel pipeline for end-to-end autonomous driving that explicitly models state-action mapping to address these challenges, enabling interpretable and robust decision making. By leveraging the advancement of the state understanding of the Vision Language Action Model (VLA) with generative diffusion policy-based action head, our VDRive guides the driving contextually and geometrically. Contextually, VLA predicts future observations through token generation pre-training, where the observations are represented as discrete codes by a Conditional Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (CVQ-VAE). Geometrically, we perform reinforcement learning fine-tuning of the VLA to predict future trajectories and actions based on current driving conditions. VLA supplies the current state tokens and predicted state tokens for the action policy head to generate hierarchical actions and trajectories. During policy training, a learned critic evaluates the actions generated by the policy and provides gradient-based feedback, forming an actor-critic framework that enables a reinforcement-based policy learning pipeline. Experiments show that our VDRive achieves state-of-the-art performance in the Bench2Drive closed-loop benchmark and nuScenes open-loop planning.</description>

      <title>Implicit State Estimation via Video Replanning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17315v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Video-based representations have gained prominence in planning and decision-making due to their ability to encode rich spatiotemporal dynamics and geometric relationships. These representations enable flexible and generalizable solutions for complex tasks such as object manipulation and navigation. However, existing video planning frameworks often struggle to adapt to failures at interaction time due to their inability to reason about uncertainties in partially observed environments. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a novel framework that integrates interaction-time data into the planning process. Our approach updates model parameters online and filters out previously failed plans during generation. This enables implicit state estimation, allowing the system to adapt dynamically without explicitly modeling unknown state variables. We evaluate our framework through extensive experiments on a new simulated manipulation benchmark, demonstrating its ability to improve replanning performance and advance the field of video-based decision-making.</description>

      <title>From Spatial to Actions: Grounding Vision-Language-Action Model in Spatial Foundation Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17439v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Existing vision-language-action (VLA) models act in 3D real-world but are typically built on 2D encoders, leaving a spatial reasoning gap that limits generalization and adaptability. Recent 3D integration techniques for VLAs either require specialized sensors and transfer poorly across modalities, or inject weak cues that lack geometry and degrade vision-language alignment. In this work, we introduce FALCON (From Spatial to Action), a novel paradigm that injects rich 3D spatial tokens into the action head. FALCON leverages spatial foundation models to deliver strong geometric priors from RGB alone, and includes an Embodied Spatial Model that can optionally fuse depth, or pose for higher fidelity when available, without retraining or architectural changes. To preserve language reasoning, spatial tokens are consumed by a Spatial-Enhanced Action Head rather than being concatenated into the vision-language backbone. These designs enable FALCON to address limitations in spatial representation, modality transferability, and alignment. In comprehensive evaluations across three simulation benchmarks and eleven real-world tasks, our proposed FALCON achieves state-of-the-art performance, consistently surpasses competitive baselines, and remains robust under clutter, spatial-prompt conditioning, and variations in object scale and height.</description>

      <title>Model Predictive Control via Probabilistic Inference: A Tutorial and Survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.08019v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper provides a tutorial and a survey of probabilistic inference-based model predictive control (PI-MPC) for robotics. PI-MPC defines an optimal control distribution shaped by trajectory cost, a control prior, and a temperature parameter. In the tutorial part, we derive this view and describe action generation via variational inference, highlighting Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) control as a representative algorithm. In the survey part, we organize the PI-MPC literature around the principal design choices identified in the tutorial: prior distribution design, multi-modal distribution handling, constraint satisfaction, scalability to high-degree-of-freedom robots, hardware acceleration, and theoretical foundations. Overall, this paper aims to serve as a coherent entry point for researchers and practitioners interested in understanding, implementing, and extending PI-MPC.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04884v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a dataset for force-grounded, cross-view articulated manipulation that couples what is seen with what is done and what is felt during real human interaction. The dataset contains 3048 sequences across 381 articulated objects in 38 environments. Each object is operated under four embodiments - (i) human hand, (ii) human hand with a wrist-mounted camera, (iii) handheld UMI gripper, and (iv) a custom Hoi! gripper - where the tool embodiment provides synchronized end-effector forces and tactile sensing. Our dataset offers a holistic view of interaction understanding from video, enabling researchers to evaluate how well methods transfer between human and robotic viewpoints, but also investigate underexplored modalities such as force sensing and prediction.

      <title>Toward Efficient and Robust Behavior Models for Multi-Agent Driving Simulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.05812v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scalable multi-agent driving simulation requires behavior models that are both realistic and computationally efficient. We address this by optimizing the behavior model that controls individual traffic participants. To improve efficiency, we adopt an instance-centric scene representation, where each traffic participant and map element is modeled in its own local coordinate frame. This design enables efficient, viewpoint-invariant scene encoding and allows static map tokens to be reused across simulation steps. To model interactions, we employ a query-centric symmetric context encoder with relative positional encodings between local frames. We use Adversarial Inverse Reinforcement Learning to learn the behavior model and propose an adaptive reward transformation that automatically balances robustness and realism during training. Experiments demonstrate that our approach scales efficiently with the number of tokens, significantly reducing training and inference times, while outperforming several agent-centric baselines in terms of positional accuracy and robustness.</description>

Abstract: Recent progress in humanoid robots has unlocked agile locomotion skills, including backflipping, running, and crawling. Yet it remains challenging for a humanoid robot to perform forceful manipulation tasks such as moving objects, wiping, and pushing a cart. We propose adaptive Compliance Humanoid control through hIsight Perturbation (CHIP), a plug-and-play module that enables controllable end-effector stiffness while preserving agile tracking of dynamic reference motions. CHIP is easy to implement and requires neither data augmentation nor additional reward tuning. We show that a generalist motion-tracking controller trained with CHIP can perform a diverse set of forceful manipulation tasks that require different end-effector compliance, such as multi-robot collaboration, wiping, box delivery, and door opening.</description>

      <title>CoLA-Flow Policy: Temporally Coherent Imitation Learning via Continuous Latent Action Flow Matching for Robotic Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23087v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Learning long-horizon robotic manipulation requires jointly achieving expressive behavior modeling, real-time inference, and stable execution, which remains challenging for existing generative policies. Diffusion-based approaches provide strong modeling capacity but typically incur high inference latency, while flow matching enables fast one-step generation yet often leads to unstable execution when applied directly in the raw action space.
  We propose LG-Flow Policy, a trajectory-level imitation learning framework that performs flow matching in a continuous latent action space. By encoding action sequences into temporally regularized latent trajectories and learning an explicit latent-space flow, the proposed approach decouples global motion structure from low-level control noise, resulting in smooth and reliable long-horizon execution.
  LG-Flow Policy further incorporates geometry-aware point cloud conditioning and execution-time multimodal modulation, with visual cues evaluated as a representative modality in real-world settings. Experimental results in simulation and on physical robot platforms demonstrate that LG-Flow Policy achieves near single-step inference, substantially improves trajectory smoothness and task success over flow-based baselines operating in the raw action space, and remains significantly more efficient than diffusion-based policies.</description>

      <title>Toward Reliable Sim-to-Real Predictability for MoE-based Robust Quadrupedal Locomotion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.00678v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning has shown strong promise for quadrupedal agile locomotion, even with proprioception-only sensing. In practice, however, sim-to-real gap and reward overfitting in complex terrains can produce policies that fail to transfer, while physical validation remains risky and inefficient. To address these challenges, we introduce a unified framework encompassing a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) locomotion policy for robust multi-terrain representation with RoboGauge, a predictive assessment suite that quantifies sim-to-real transferability. The MoE policy employs a gated set of specialist experts to decompose latent terrain and command modeling, achieving superior deployment robustness and generalization via proprioception alone. RoboGauge further provides multi-dimensional proprioception-based metrics via sim-to-sim tests over terrains, difficulty levels, and domain randomizations, enabling reliable MoE policy selection without extensive physical trials. Experiments on a Unitree Go2 demonstrate robust locomotion on unseen challenging terrains, including snow, sand, stairs, slopes, and 30 cm obstacles. In dedicated high-speed tests, the robot reaches 4 m/s and exhibits an emergent narrow-width gait associated with improved stability at high velocity.</description>

      <title>Going with the Flow: Koopman Behavioral Models as Implicit Planners for Visuo-Motor Dexterity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07413v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There has been rapid and dramatic progress in learning complex visuo-motor manipulation skills from demonstrations, thanks in part to expressive policy classes that employ diffusion- and transformer-based backbones. However, these design choices require significant data and computational resources and remain far from reliable, particularly within the context of multi-fingered dexterous manipulation. Fundamentally, they model skills as reactive mappings and rely on fixed-horizon action chunking to mitigate jitter, creating a rigid trade-off between temporal coherence and reactivity. In this work, we introduce Unified Behavioral Models (UBMs), a framework that learns to represent dexterous skills as coupled dynamical systems that capture how visual features of the environment (visual flow) and proprioceptive states of the robot (action flow) co-evolve. By capturing such behavioral dynamics, UBMs can ensure temporal coherence by construction rather than by heuristic averaging. To operationalize these models, we propose Koopman-UBM, a first instantiation of UBMs that leverages Koopman Operator theory to effectively learn a unified representation in which the joint flow of latent visual and proprioceptive features is governed by a structured linear system. We demonstrate that Koopman-UBM can be viewed as an implicit planner: given an initial condition, it computes the desired robot behavior with the resulting flow of visual features over the entire skill horizon. To enable reactivity, we introduce an online replanning strategy in which the model acts as its own runtime monitor that automatically triggers replanning when predicted and observed visual flow diverge. Across seven simulated and two real-world tasks, we demonstrate that K-UBM matches or exceeds the performance of SOTA baselines, while offering faster inference, smooth execution, robustness to occlusions, and flexible replanning.</description>

      <title>LCLA: Language-Conditioned Latent Alignment for Vision-Language Navigation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.07629v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose LCLA (Language-Conditioned Latent Alignment), a framework for vision-language navigation that learns modular perception-action interfaces by aligning sensory observations to a latent representation of an expert policy. The expert is first trained with privileged state information, inducing a latent space sufficient for control, after which its latent interface and action head are frozen. A lightweight adapter is then trained to map raw visual-language observations, via a frozen vision-language model, into the expert's latent space, reducing the problem of visuomotor learning to supervised latent alignment rather than end-to-end policy optimization. This decoupling enforces a stable contract between perception and control, enabling expert behavior to be reused across sensing modalities and environmental variations. We instantiate LCLA and evaluate it on a vision-language indoor navigation task, where aligned latent spaces yield strong in-distribution performance and robust zero-shot generalization to unseen environments, lighting conditions, and viewpoints while remaining lightweight at inference time.</description>

      <title>RLinf-USER: A Unified and Extensible System for Real-World Online Policy Learning in Embodied AI</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.07837v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Online policy learning directly in the physical world is a promising yet challenging direction for embodied intelligence. Unlike simulation, real-world systems cannot be arbitrarily accelerated, cheaply reset, or massively replicated, which makes scalable data collection, heterogeneous deployment, and long-horizon effective training difficult. These challenges suggest that real-world policy learning is not only an algorithmic issue but fundamentally a systems problem. We present USER, a Unified and extensible SystEm for Real-world online policy learning. USER treats physical robots as first-class hardware resources alongside GPUs through a unified hardware abstraction layer, enabling automatic discovery, management, and scheduling of heterogeneous robots. To address cloud-edge communication, USER introduces an adaptive communication plane with tunneling-based networking, distributed data channels for traffic localization, and streaming-multiprocessor-aware weight synchronization to regulate GPU-side overhead. On top of this infrastructure, USER organizes learning as a fully asynchronous framework with a persistent, cache-aware buffer, enabling efficient long-horizon experiments with robust crash recovery and reuse of historical data. In addition, USER provides extensible abstractions for rewards, algorithms, and policies, supporting online imitation or reinforcement learning of CNN/MLP, generative policies, and large vision-language-action (VLA) models within a unified pipeline. Results in both simulation and the real world show that USER enables multi-robot coordination, heterogeneous manipulators, edge-cloud collaboration with large models, and long-running asynchronous training, offering a unified and extensible systems foundation for real-world online policy learning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.08425v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bimanual manipulation is imperative yet challenging for robots to execute complex tasks, requiring coordinated collaboration between two arms. However, existing methods for bimanual manipulation often rely on costly data collection and training, struggling to generalize to unseen objects in novel categories efficiently. In this paper, we present Bi-Adapt, a novel framework designed for efficient generalization for bimanual manipulation via semantic correspondence. Bi-Adapt achieves cross-category affordance mapping by leveraging the strong capability of vision foundation models. Fine-tuning with restricted data on novel categories, Bi-Adapt exhibits notable generalization to out-of-category objects in a zero-shot manner. Extensive experiments conducted in both simulation and real-world environments validate the effectiveness of our approach and demonstrate its high efficiency, achieving a high success rate on different benchmark tasks across novel categories with limited data.

      <title>Symmetry-Guided Memory Augmentation for Efficient Locomotion Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01521v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Training reinforcement learning (RL) policies for legged locomotion often requires extensive environment interactions, which are costly and time-consuming. We propose Symmetry-Guided Memory Augmentation (SGMA), a framework that improves training efficiency by combining structured experience augmentation with memory-based context inference. Our method leverages robot and task symmetries to generate additional, physically consistent training experiences without requiring extra interactions. To avoid the pitfalls of naive augmentation, we extend these transformations to the policy's memory states, enabling the agent to retain task-relevant context and adapt its behavior accordingly. We evaluate the approach on quadruped and humanoid robots in simulation, as well as on a real quadruped platform. Across diverse locomotion tasks involving joint failures and payload variations, our method achieves efficient policy training while maintaining robust performance, demonstrating a practical route toward data-efficient RL for legged robots.</description>

      <title>Affective and Conversational Predictors of Re-Engagement in Human-Robot Interactions -- A Student-Centered Study with A Humanoid Social Robot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16449v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Humanoid social robots are increasingly present in daily life, making sustained user engagement a critical factor for their effectiveness and acceptance. While prior work has often examined affective evaluations or anthropomorphic design, less is known about the relative influence of dynamic conversational qualities and perceived robot characteristics in determining a user's intention to re-engage with Large Language Model (LLM)-driven social robots. In this study, 68 participants interacted in open-ended conversations with the Nadine humanoid social robot, completing pre- and post-interaction surveys to assess changes in robot perception, conversational quality, and intention to re-engage. The results showed that verbal interaction significantly improved the robot's perceived characteristics, with statistically significant increases in pleasantness ($p&lt;.0001$) and approachability ($p&lt;.0001$), and a reduction in creepiness ($p&lt;.001$). However, these affective changes were not strong and unique predictors of users' intention to re-engage in a multiple regression model. Instead, participants' perceptions of the interestingness ($\beta=0.60$, $p&lt;.001$) and naturalness ($\beta=0.31$, $p=0.015$) of the robot's conversation emerged as the most significant and robust independent predictors of intention to re-engage. Overall, the results highlight that conversational quality, specifically perceived interestingness and naturalness, is the dominant driver of re-engagement, indicating that LLM-driven robot design should prioritize engaging, natural dialogue over affective impression management or anthropomorphic cues.</description>

      <title>What Do You Need for Compositional Generalization in Diffusion Planning?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18083v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In policy learning, stitching and compositional generalization refer to the extent to which the policy is able to piece together sub-trajectories of data it is trained on to generate new and diverse behaviours. While stitching has been identified as a significant strength of offline reinforcement learning, recent generative behavioural cloning (BC) methods have also shown proficiency at stitching. However, the main factors behind this are poorly understood, hindering the development of new algorithms that can reliably stitch by design. Focusing on diffusion planners trained via generative behavioural cloning, and without resorting to dynamic programming or TD-learning, we find three properties are key enablers for composition: shift equivariance, local receptive fields, and inference choices. We use these properties to explain architecture, data, and inference choices in existing generative BC methods based on diffusion planning including replanning frequency, data augmentation, and data scaling. Our experiments show that while local receptive fields are more important than shift equivariance in creating a diffusion planner capable of composition, both are crucial. Using findings from our experiments, we develop a new architecture for diffusion planners called Eq-Net, that is simple, produces diverse trajectories competitive with more computationally expensive methods such as replanning or scaling data, and can be guided to enable generalization in goal-conditioned settings. We show that Eq-Net exhibits significant compositional generalization in a variety of navigation and manipulation tasks designed to test planning diversity.</description>

      <title>UFM: A Simple Path towards Unified Dense Correspondence with Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09278v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dense image correspondence is central to many applications, such as visual odometry, 3D reconstruction, object association, and re-identification. Historically, dense correspondence has been tackled separately for wide-baseline scenarios and optical flow estimation, despite the common goal of matching content between two images. In this paper, we develop a Unified Flow &amp; Matching model (UFM), which is trained on unified data for pixels that are co-visible in both source and target images. UFM uses a simple, generic transformer architecture that directly regresses the (u,v) flow. It is easier to train and more accurate for large flows compared to the typical coarse-to-fine cost volumes in prior work. UFM is 28% more accurate than state-of-the-art flow methods (Unimatch), while also having 62% less error and 6.7x faster than dense wide-baseline matchers (RoMa). UFM is the first to demonstrate that unified training can outperform specialized approaches across both domains. This result enables fast, general-purpose correspondence and opens new directions for multi-modal, long-range, and real-time correspondence tasks.</description>

      <title>VIMD: Monocular Visual-Inertial Motion and Depth Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19713v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate and efficient dense metric depth estimation is crucial for 3D visual perception in robotics and XR. In this paper, we develop a monocular visual-inertial motion and depth (VIMD) learning framework to estimate dense metric depth by leveraging accurate and efficient MSCKF-based monocular visual-inertial motion tracking. At the core the proposed VIMD is to exploit multi-view information to iteratively refine per-pixel scale, instead of globally fitting an invariant affine model as in the prior work. The VIMD framework is highly modular, making it compatible with a variety of existing depth estimation backbones. We conduct extensive evaluations on the TartanAir and VOID datasets and demonstrate its zero-shot generalization capabilities on the AR Table dataset. Our results show that VIMD achieves exceptional accuracy and robustness, even with extremely sparse points as few as 10-20 metric depth points per image. This makes the proposed VIMD a practical solution for deployment in resource constrained settings, while its robust performance and strong generalization capabilities offer significant potential across a wide range of scenarios.</description>

      <title>GenTrack2: An Improved Hybrid Approach for Multi-Object Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24410v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a visual multi-object tracking method that jointly employs stochastic and deterministic mechanisms to ensure identifier consistency for unknown and time-varying target numbers under nonlinear dynamics. A stochastic particle filter addresses nonlinear dynamics and non-Gaussian noise, with support from particle swarm optimization (PSO) to guide particles toward state distribution modes and mitigate divergence through proposed fitness measures incorporating motion consistency, appearance similarity, and social-interaction cues with neighboring targets. Deterministic association further enforces identifier consistency via a proposed cost matrix incorporating spatial consistency between particles and current detections, detection confidences, and track penalties. Subsequently, a novel scheme is proposed for the smooth updating of target states while preserving their identities, particularly for weak tracks during interactions with other targets and prolonged occlusions. Moreover, velocity regression over past states provides trend-seed velocities, enhancing particle sampling and state updates. The proposed tracker is designed to operate flexibly for both pre-recorded videos and camera live streams, where future frames are unavailable. Experimental results confirm superior performance compared to state-of-the-art trackers. The source-code reference implementations of both the proposed method and compared-trackers are provided on GitHub: https://github.com/SDU-VelKoTek/GenTrack2</description>

      <title>Modelling Pedestrian Behaviour in Autonomous Vehicle Encounters Using Naturalistic Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05142v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding how pedestrians adjust their movement when interacting with autonomous vehicles (AVs) is essential for improving safety in mixed traffic. This study examines micro-level pedestrian behaviour during midblock encounters in the NuScenes dataset using a hybrid discrete choice-machine learning framework based on the Residual Logit (ResLogit) model. The model incorporates temporal, spatial, kinematic, and perceptual indicators. These include relative speed, visual looming, remaining distance, and directional collision risk proximity (CRP) measures. Results suggest that some of these variables may meaningfully influence movement adjustments, although predictive performance remains moderate. Marginal effects and elasticities indicate strong directional asymmetries in risk perception, with frontal and rear CRP showing opposite influences. The remaining distance exhibits a possible mid-crossing threshold. Relative speed cues appear to have a comparatively less effect. These patterns may reflect multiple behavioural tendencies driven by both risk perception and movement efficiency.</description>

      <title>karl. -- A Research Vehicle for Automated and Connected Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08842v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As highly automated driving is transitioning from single-vehicle closed-access testing to commercial deployments of public ride-hailing in selected areas (e.g., Waymo), automated driving and connected cooperative intelligent transport systems (C-ITS) remain active fields of research. Even though simulation is omnipresent in the development and validation life cycle of automated and connected driving technology, the complex nature of public road traffic and software that masters it still requires real-world integration and testing with actual vehicles. Dedicated vehicles for research and development allow testing and validation of software and hardware components under real-world conditions early on. They also enable collecting and publishing real-world datasets that let others conduct research without vehicle access, and support early demonstration of futuristic use cases. In this paper, we present karl., our new research vehicle for automated and connected driving. Apart from major corporations, few institutions worldwide have access to their own L4-capable research vehicles, restricting their ability to carry out independent research. This paper aims to help bridge that gap by sharing the reasoning, design choices, and technical details that went into making karl. a flexible and powerful platform for research, engineering, and validation in the context of automated and connected driving.
