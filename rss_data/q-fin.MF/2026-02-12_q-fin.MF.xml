      <title>A novel approach to trading strategy parameter optimization using double out-of-sample data and walk-forward techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study introduces a novel approach to walk-forward optimization by parameterizing the lengths of training and testing windows. We demonstrate that the performance of a trading strategy using the Exponential Moving Average (EMA) evaluated within a walk-forward procedure based on the Robust Sharpe Ratio is highly dependent on the chosen window size. We investigated the strategy on intraday Bitcoin data at six frequencies (1 minute to 60 minutes) using 81 combinations of walk-forward window lengths (1 day to 28 days) over a 19-month training period. The two best-performing parameter sets from the training data were applied to a 21-month out-of-sample testing period to ensure data independence. The strategy was only executed once during the testing period. To further validate the framework, strategy parameters estimated on Bitcoin were applied to Binance Coin and Ethereum. Our results suggest the robustness of our custom approach. In the training period for Bitcoin, all combinations of walk-forward windows outperformed a Buy-and-Hold strategy. During the testing period, the strategy performed similarly to Buy-and-Hold but with lower drawdown and a higher Information Ratio. Similar results were observed for Binance Coin and Ethereum. The real strength was demonstrated when a portfolio combining Buy-and-Hold with our strategies outperformed all individual strategies and Buy-and-Hold alone, achieving the highest overall performance and a 50 percent reduction in drawdown. A conservative fee of 0.1 percent per transaction was included in all calculations. A cost sensitivity analysis was performed as a sanity check, revealing that the strategy's break-even point was around 0.4 percent per transaction. This research highlights the importance of optimizing walk-forward window lengths and emphasizing the value of single-time out-of-sample testing for reliable strategy evaluation.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Geometry and the Stability of Minimum Differentiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01985v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a framework for horizontal differentiation in which firms compete on a product manifold representing the feasible combinations of characteristics. This approach generalizes both the Hotelling line and Salop circle to any Riemannian space, allowing for a unified analysis of product space. We show that equilibrium existence and stability are governed by intrinsic geometric properties, specifically curvature, symmetry and dimension. We prove that negative curvature and high intrinsic dimension act as stabilizers of minimum differentiation equilibria, moving the analysis beyond the symmetry-induced instabilities found in simpler, fixed domains. By characterizing curvature as a measure of consumer heterogeneity, we demonstrate that intrinsic geometry is a fundamental determinant of competitive outcomes.</description>
