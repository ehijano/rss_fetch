      <title>Existence and Configuration of Invariant Sets in $C^\infty([a,b])$ on which the Differential Operator Exhibits Devaney's Chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the chaotic behavior of the differential operator $\frac{d}{dx}$ on the space of smooth functions $C^\infty([a,b])$ equipped with the $L^p$-norm ($1\le p\le\infty$). We explicitly construct a homeomorphism between a subset of $C^\infty([a,b])$ and the shift space. Moreover, inspired by symbolic dynamics, we demonstrate that invariant sets, on which the differential operator behaves analogously to the shift, are densely configured in $C^\infty([a,b])$. We also prove that the differential operator is chaotic on the entire space $C^\infty([a,b])$ using a similar approach.</description>

      <title>An inverse theorem for all finite abelian groups via nilmanifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a first inverse theorem for Gowers norms on all finite abelian groups that uses only nilmanifolds (rather than possibly more general nilspaces). This makes progress toward confirming the Jamneshan--Tao conjecture. The correlating function in our theorem is a projected nilsequence, obtained as the fiber-wise average of a nilsequence defined on a boundedly-larger abelian group extending the original abelian group. This result is tight in the following sense: we prove also that $k$-step projected nilsequences of bounded complexity are genuine obstructions to having small Gowers $U^{k+1}$-norm. This inverse theorem relies on a new result concerning compact finite-rank (CFR) nilspaces, which is the main contribution in this paper: every $k$-step CFR nilspace is a factor of a $k$-step nilmanifold. This new connection between the classical theory of nilmanifolds and the more recent theory of nilspaces has applications beyond arithmetic combinatorics. We illustrate this with an application in topological dynamics, by proving the following result making progress on a question of Jamneshan, Shalom and Tao: every minimal $\mathbb{Z}^\omega$-system of order $k$ is a factor of an inverse limit of $\mathbb{Z}^\omega$-polynomial orbit systems of order $k$, these being natural generalizations of nilsystems alternative to translational systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.17571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a subjective selection of methods for complex systems analysis ranging from statistical tools through numerical methods based on AI to both linear and non-linear ODEs and PDEs. All the notions apply the network structure and are presented in the context of applied problems to visualise the strengths and drawbacks of the approach. The major aim of capturing such a broad overview is to understand the interrelations between network theories that seem to be distant from the mathematical perspective.</description>

      <title>EBIF: Exact Bilinearization Iterative Form for Control-Affine Nonlinear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a novel framework, Exact Bilinearization Iterative Form (EBIF), for transforming a nonlinear control-affine system into an exact finite-dimensional bilinear representation. In contrast to most existing approaches which generally lead to an infinite-dimensional representation, the proposed EBIF approach yields an iterative procedure for constructing a finite set of smooth coordinate functions that define an embedding, enabling an exact bilinear representation of the original nonlinear dynamics. Leveraging tools from algebra and differential geometry, we establish both necessary and sufficient conditions for a nonlinear system to be exactly bilinearizable. We further illustrate how the EBIF-induced bilinear systems facilitate reachability analysis and control design. Through theoretical analysis and numerical simulations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the EBIF framework and highlight its potential in simplifying control synthesis for nonlinear systems.</description>

      <title>Graphings with few circulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 2021, motivated by graph limit theory Lov\'asz extended most of the theory of flows to a measure theoretic setting. Using this framework, the first author constructed $d$-regular treeings that are measurably bipartite, and have no nonzero measurable circulations, that is, flows without sources or sinks. In particular, these treeings do not admit a measurable perfect matching.
  In this paper, we develop tools to build $d$-regular treeings where the space of circulations is exactly $k$-dimensional for any positive integer $k$. As applications, we construct 1) a treeing with a single balanced orientation, but no Schreier decoration; 2) a treeing with a single Schreier decoration; 3) and a treeing with a proper edge $d$-coloring, but no further perfect matchings.
  The first answers a question raised by Lov\'asz, as this particular balanced orientation does not decompose as a linear combination of finite cycles and infinite paths.</description>

      <title>Intersecting well approximable and missing digit sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $b\geq3$ be an integer and $C(b,D)$ be the set of real numbers in $[0,1]$ whose $b$-ary expansion consists of digits restricted to a given set $D\subseteq\{0,\ldots,b-1\}$. Given an integer $t\geq2$ and a real, positive function $\psi$, let $W_{t}(\psi)$ denote the set of $x$ in $[0,1]$ for which $|x-p/t^{n}|&lt;\psi(n)$ for infinitely many $(p,n)\in\mathbb{Z}\times\mathbb{N}$. We prove a general Hausdorff dimension result concerning the intersection of $W_{t}(\psi)$ with an arbitrary self similar set which implies that $\dim_{\rm H}(W_{t}(\psi)\cap C(b,D))\le\dim_{\rm H}W_{t}(\psi)\times \dim_{\rm H}C(b,D)$. When $b$ and $t$ have the same prime divisors, under certain restrictions on the digit set $D$, we give a sufficient condition for the Hausdorff measure of $W_{t}(\psi)\cap C(b,D)$ to be zero. This closes a gap in a result of Li, Li and Wu \cite{LLW2025} and shows that the dimension of the intersection can be strictly less than the product of the dimensions. The latter disproves the product conjecture of Li, Li and Wu.</description>

      <title>Circular orders: Topology and continuous actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the topology of abstract circularly ordered sets. While the algebraic notion is classical, the general topological theory has received comparatively little attention.
  This work provides a self-contained topological exposition and presents several new directions and results. Specifically, we:
  Initiate a systematic study of Generalized Circularly Ordered Topological Spaces (GCOTS).
  Analyze in detail Nov\'ak's regular completion and prove that it is the canonical minimal circularly ordered compactification. Provide a convex uniform structure description of circularly ordered compactifications. This implies several new results in the theory of compactifications for topological group actions. Reexamine functions of Bounded Variation on abstract circularly ordered sets and prove generalizations of Helly's selection theorem (for circular and linear orders).
  These developments and a systematic analysis of circular order topologies are motivated also by recent applications in topological dynamics, particularly in joint works with E. Glasner, which demonstrate that circularly ordered dynamical systems provide a natural class of ``tame" dynamics.</description>

      <title>Variational Dissipative Mechanics on Lie Algebroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We formulate a Herglotz-type variational principle on a Lie algebroid and derive the corresponding Euler--Lagrange--Herglotz equations for a Lagrangian depending on an additional scalar variable $z$. This provides a geometric framework for dissipative systems on Lie algebroids and recovers, as special cases, the classical Euler--Lagrange--Herglotz equations on tangent bundles, the Euler--Poincar\'e--Herglotz equations on a Lie algebra, and the Lagrange--Poincar\'e--Herglotz equations on Atiyah algebroids of principal bundles. Starting from the local formulation, we then use Lie algebroid connections to obtain a coordinate-free Euler--Lagrange--Poincar\'e--Herglotz and Hamilton--Pontryagin--Herglotz theory. Finally, we establish energy balance laws and Noether--Herglotz-type results, in which classical conserved quantities are replaced by dissipated invariants.</description>

      <title>St\"ackel problem for non-diagonal Killing tensors: Yano-Patterson lifts, algebra of strong symmetries and quadratic in momenta integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17609v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct integrable Hamiltonian systems such that functionally independent Poisson commuting integrals are quadratic in the momenta. Unlike the classical St\"ackel setting, we allow the associated self-adjoint $(1,1)$-tensors $K_\alpha$ to be non-diagonalisable and have Jordan blocks and points where the Segre characteristic changes. Our construction is covariant and is based on Nijenhuis geometry: starting from a gl-regular Nijenhuis operator $L$ and its symmetry algebra, we obtain a large class of such integrable systems in a coordinate-free and signature-independent way; it is explicit once we have chosen a gl-regular Nijnhuis operator. In the diagonalisable case, our construction reproduces the St\"ackel construction, and in dimension $n=2$ it recovers all known systems of this type; for $n\ge 3$ most of our systems are new. Finally, we establish applications to infinite-dimensional integrable systems of hydrodynamic type: namely, we show that for Killing $(1,1)$-tensors $ K_\alpha$ corresponding to our example the evolutionarly PDE system of hydrodynamic type $u_t = K_\alpha(u)u_x$ is integrable. We describe its symmetries, and use generalised reciprocal transformations to reduce it to a system with constant coefficient matrices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.02027v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Faure and Tsujii recently proposed a new quantization theory for symplectic Anosov diffeomorphisms. It combines prequantization with the study of the Pollicott--Ruelle resonances of an associated transfer operator. We apply this framework to the hyperbolic symplectic automorphisms of the $2n$-dimensional torus, the so-called cat maps. Our main result gives an explicit relation between the resonances of the prequantum transfer operator and the eigenvalues of the standard quantum cat maps, generalizing the case $n=1$ previously treated by Faure.</description>

      <title>Sparsity of postcritically finite maps of $\mathbb{P}^k$ and beyond: A complex analytic approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.02246v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An endomorphism $f:\mathbb{P}^k\to\mathbb{P}^k$ of degree $d\geq2$ is said to be postcritically finite (or PCF) if its critical set $\mathrm{Crit}(f)$ is preperiodic, i.e. if there are integers $m&gt;n\geq0$ such that $f^m(\mathrm{Crit}(f))\subseteq f^n(\mathrm{Crit}(f))$. When $k\geq2$, it was conjectured by Ingram, Ramadas and Silverman that, in the space $\mathrm{End}_d^k$ of all endomorphisms of degree $d$ of $\mathbb{P}^k$, such endomorphisms are not Zariski dense. We prove this conjecture. Further, in the space $\mathrm{Poly}_d^2$ of all regular polynomial endomorphisms of degree $d\geq2$ of the affine plane $\mathbb{A}^2$, we construct a dense and Zariski open subset where we have a uniform bound on the number of preperiodic points lying in the critical set.
  The proofs are a combination of the theory of heights in arithmetic dynamics and methods from real dynamics to produce open subsets with maximal bifurcation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04379v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We classify the finite orbits of the mapping class group action on the character variety of Deroin--Tholozan representations of punctured spheres. In particular, we prove that the action has no finite orbits if the underlying sphere has 7 punctures or more. When the sphere has six punctures, we show that there is a unique 1-parameter family of finite orbits. Our methods also recover Tykhyy's classification of finite orbits for 5-punctured spheres. The proof is inductive and uses Lisovyy--Tykhyy's classification of finite mapping class group orbits for 4-punctured spheres as the base case for the induction.
  Our results on Deroin--Tholozan representations cover the last missing cases to complete the proof of Tykhyy's Conjecture on finite mapping class group orbits for $\mathrm{SL}_2\mathbb{C}$ representations of punctured spheres, after the recent work by Lam--Landesman--Litt.</description>

      <title>The Return Times Theorem, Auto-Correlation and Sequences with an Empty Fourier-Bohr Spectrum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07453v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper explores the proof by J. Bourgain, H. Furstenberg, Y. Katznelson and D.S. Ornstein of their return times theorem [2] and lights a corner in it regarding the role of auto-correlation. As for pointwise convergence, this was already observed in [5], and here we exploit the opportunity to write down the proof. This yields a more intrinsic characterization of the sequences satisfying the pointwise theorem. Then we proceed and obtain a characterization linked to auto-correlation also to sequences satisfying the mean theorem - by that theorem those were already known to be exactly the sequences with an empty Fourier-Bohr spectrum. Some further investigation is done and examples are provided regarding generic sequences satisfying the pointwise theorem for which the measure on the circle that the auto-correlation function represents (by Fourier transform) is not atomless, and also regarding the existence of sequences that satisfy the mean theorem but not the pointwise one.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15503v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish the conditioned stochastic stability of equilibrium states for H\"older potentials on uniformly hyperbolic sets. While standard stochastic stability characterises measures on attractors, we analyse the statistics of transient dynamics on non-attracting sets by conditioning small random perturbations of the dynamics to not escape from our regions of interest. We prove that as the noise intensity vanishes, the quasi-ergodic measure of the $e^\phi$-weighted process generated by $\e$-small random perturbations of the deterministic dynamics converges to the unique equilibrium state associated with the potential $\phi - \log \left|\det \left. D T\right|_{E^u}\right|$. The results are obtained via perturbative spectral analysis of transfer operators acting on anisotropic Banach spaces and topological hyperbolic dynamics arguments. Furthermore, we extend this framework globally to Axiom A diffeomorphisms with multiple basic sets using dynamical filtrations. This work provides a rigorous characterisation of natural measures on uniformly hyperbolic repellers, which are fundamental in the context of transient chaos.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04656v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we build a geometric model for the renormalisation of irrationally indifferent fixed points of holomorphic maps with two critical points. The model incorporates arithmetic properties of the rotation number at the fixed point, as well as the ``angle" between the two critical points. Using this model for the renormalisation, we build a topological model for the local dynamics of such maps. We also explain the topology of the maximal invariant set for the model, and the dynamics of the map on the maximal invariant set.</description>

      <title>Effective Gaps between singular values of non-stationary matrix products subject to non-degenerate noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04058v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the singular values and Lyapunov exponents of non-stationary random matrix products subject to small, absolutely continuous, additive noise. Consider a fixed sequence of matrices of bounded norm. Independently perturb the matrices by additive noise distributed according to Lebesgue measure on matrices with norm less than $\epsilon$. Then the gaps between the logarithms of the singular values of the random product of $n$ of these matrices are all of order at least $\epsilon^2n$, both in expectation; and almost surely for large $n$.
  To prove this, we develop recent work of Gorodetski and Kleptsyn \cite{gorodetski2023nonstationary}. That paper gives a very flexible method, based on relative entropy, for showing that a non-stationary product of matrices in SL(d,R) has a strictly positive Lyapunov exponent. We extend their work in two ways, firstly by making the estimates quantitative in the context of absolutely continuous distributions, giving the universal estimates described above; and secondly by developing a fibered version of their methods, working on flag bundles instead of the projective space to estimate gaps between arbitrary consecutive exponents. Our methods retain much of the flexibility of those of Gorodetski and Kleptsyn, and we hope that they will find application in other related problems.</description>

      <title>Incremental Generation is Necessary and Sufficient for Universality in Flow-Based Modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09902</link>

Abstract: Incremental flow-based denoising models have reshaped generative modelling, but their empirical advantage still lacks a rigorous approximation-theoretic foundation. We show that incremental generation is necessary and sufficient for universal flow-based generation on the largest natural class of self-maps of $[0,1]^d$ compatible with denoising pipelines, namely the orientation-preserving homeomorphisms of $[0,1]^d$. All our guarantees are uniform on the underlying maps and hence imply approximation both samplewise and in distribution.
  Using a new topological-dynamical argument, we first prove an impossibility theorem: the class of all single-step autonomous flows, independently of the architecture, width, depth, or Lipschitz activation of the underlying neural network, is meagre and therefore not universal in the space of orientation-preserving homeomorphisms of $[0,1]^d$. By exploiting algebraic properties of autonomous flows, we conversely show that every orientation-preserving Lipschitz homeomorphism on $[0,1]^d$ can be approximated at rate $O(n^{-1/d})$ by a composition of at most $K_d$ such flows, where $K_d$ depends only on the dimension. Under additional smoothness assumptions, the approximation rate can be made dimension-free, and $K_d$ can be chosen uniformly over the class being approximated. Finally, by linearly lifting the domain into one higher dimension, we obtain structured universal approximation results for continuous functions and for probability measures on $[0,1]^d$, the latter realized as pushforwards of empirical measures with vanishing $1$-Wasserstein error.</description>

      <title>Action de groupe sur la compactification hybride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00201v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $X$ be an algebraic variety over $\mathbb{C}$ and $G$ be an algebraic group acting on $X$ whose action is closed. J. Poineau defined a compactification $X^\urcorner$ of $X(\mathbb{C})$ by using hybrid Berkovich spaces. We will focus on the extension of the action of $G$ on this compactification by characterising the set $\mathcal{U} \subset X^\urcorner$ where the action is well defined. We will also show that the quotient of $\mathcal{U}$ by the action of $G$ is homeomorphic to $(X/G)^\urcorner$, the compactification of $(X/G)(\mathbb{C})$. We then apply these results to $X = \mathrm{Rat}_d$, the space of rational maps and $G = \mathrm{SL}_2$. It gives the results of C. Favre-C. Gong in a more general setting. Furthermore, we get a compactification of $\mathrm{M}_d = \mathrm{Rat}_d/\mathrm{SL}_2$ where the boundary is made of orbits of non-archimedean rational maps. The results still holds if $\mathbb{C}$ is replaced by $k$ a non-trivially valued field and complex analytic spaces by Berkovich spaces over $k$ or if $X$ is the set of stable points of a $k$-variety defined in the sense of GIT.</description>
