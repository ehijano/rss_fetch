      <title>Effective subfactor theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterize when a subfactor $N\subseteq M$ is oracle computable relative to a presentation of the ambient factor $M$ in terms of computability of the Jones basic construction, in terms of computable Pismner-Popa bases, and in terms of computability of the conditional expectation map. We illustrate our main theorem with some examples.</description>

      <title>Computably strongly self-absorbing C*-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of a computably strongly self-absorbing C*-algebra and show that the following C*-algebras are computably strongly self-absorbing: the Cuntz algebras $\mathcal{O}_2$ and $\mathcal{O}_\infty$, the UHF algebra $M_{\mathfrak{n}}(\mathbb{C})$ and the tensor product $M_{\mathfrak{n}}(\mathbb{C})\otimes \mathcal{O}_\infty$, where $\mathfrak{n}$ is a supernatural number of infinite type with computably enumerable support, and the Jiang-Su algebra $\mathcal{Z}$. In connection with the last example, we show that $\mathcal{Z}$ has a computable presentation. The results above are a special instance of a computable version of the standard approximate intertwining argument due to Elliott.</description>

      <title>Diophantine Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To prove that Hilbert's tenth problem over a ring R has a negative answer, usually the integers or another ring for which Hilbert's tenth problem has a negative solution is modelled inside the ring of interest. In this paper, we formalize this practice by introducing the notions of a Diophantine map and a Diophantine equivalence map. We compare the Diophantine case to the recursive case. We formalise a general version of Hilbert's tenth problem and show that we can transfer a positive or negative answer to Hilbert's tenth problem using effective Diophantine maps.</description>

      <title>A realization theorem for the modal logic of transitive closure $\mathsf{K}^+$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04027v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a justification logic corresponding to the modal logic of transitive closure $\mathsf{K}^+$ and establish a normal realization theorem relating these two systems. The result is obtained by means of a sequent calculus allowing non-well-founded proofs.</description>

      <title>$T$-convexity, Weakly Immediate Types, and $T$-$\lambda$-Spherical Completions of o-minimal Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07646v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $T$ be the theory of an o-minimal field, and $T_{\mathrm{convex}}$ the theory of its expansion by a predicate $\mathcal{O}$ for a non-trivial $T$-convex valuation ring. For $\lambda$ an uncountable cardinal, say that a unary type $p(x)$ over a model of $T_{\mathrm{convex}}$ is \emph{$\lambda$-bounded weakly immediate} if its cut is defined by an empty intersection of fewer than $\lambda$ many nested valuation balls. Call an elementary extension \emph{$\lambda$-bounded wim-constructible} if it is obtained as a transfinite composition of extensions each generated by one element whose type is $\lambda$-bounded weakly immediate. I show that $\lambda$-bounded wim-constructible extensions do not extend the residue-field sort and that any two wim-constructible extensions can be amalgamated in an extension which is again $\lambda$-bounded wim-constructible over both. A consequence is that given an uncountable cardinal $\lambda$, every model of $T_{\mathrm{convex}}$ has a unique-up-to-non-unique-isomorphism $\lambda$-spherically complete $\lambda$-bounded wim-constructible extension. We call this extension the $T$-$\lambda$-spherical completion. When $T$ is power bounded wim-constructible extensions are just the immediate extensions. I discuss the example of power bounded theories expanded by $\exp$.</description>

      <title>Th\'eories g\'eom\'etriques pour l'alg\`ebre des nombres r\'eels sans test de signe ni axiome de choix d\'ependant</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15218v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this memoir, we seek to construct a dynamical theory as complete as possible to describe the algebraic properties of the field of real numbers in constructive mathematics without axiom of dependent choice. We propose a theory which turns out to be very close to the theory of real closed local rings in classical mathematics. The theory of real closed rings is presented here in constructive form as a natural purely equational theory, which uses virtual root functions introduced in previous work. This work is also a first step through an essential goal for the future, which is to obtain a constructive version of o-minimal structures.</description>

      <title>Geometric theories for real number algebra without sign test or dependent choice axiom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10290v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this memoir, we seek to construct a constructive theory that is as complete as possible to describe the algebraic properties of the real number field in constructive mathematics without a dependent choice axiom. To this purpose, we use a dynamical version of geometric theories. We obtain a nice description of the algebraic properties of the real number field, but also a first outline for a constructive theory of certain o-minimal structures. The memoir we present here is an unfinished development of the article by the authors https://inria.hal.science/hal-01426164. Compared to that paper, however, we have modified the definition of continuous semialgebraic functions, in the same spirit in which Bishop defines a continuous real function as a uniformly continuous function on any bounded interval. Despite its unfinished nature and the many questions that we do not currently know how to answer, we hope that this paper will arouse interest for its original approach to the subject. This paper is an English translation of a French version on arXiv:2406.15218</description>

      <title>Metric ultraproducts of groups -- simplicity, perfectness and torsion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.03394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2010.03394v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We characterise the simplicity of metric ultraproducts of a family of metric groups. We also present several new examples of simple groups, such as metric ultraproducts of finite and infinite symmetric groups, linear groups, and interval exchange transformation groups. Using similar methods, we also examine concepts such as genericity, perfectness, and torsion.</description>

      <title>Containment for Guarded Monotone Strict NP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.01254v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Guarded Monotone Strict NP (GMSNP) extends Monotone Monadic Strict NP (MMSNP) by guarded existentially quantified predicates of arbitrary arities. We prove that the containment problem for GMSNP is decidable, hereby settling an open question of Bienvenu, ten Cate, Lutz, and Wolter, later restated by Bourhis and Lutz. Our proof of decidability also comes with a 2NEXPTIME upper bound on the complexity of the problem, which matches the lower bound for containment of MMSNP previously obtained by Bourhis and Lutz. In order to obtain these results, we significantly improve the state of knowledge of the model-theoretic properties of GMSNP. Bodirsky, Kn\"auer, and Starke previously showed that every GMSNP sentence defines a finite union of CSPs of $\omega$-categorical structures. We refine their construction by adding a restricted form of homogeneity to the properties of these structures, making the logic amenable to future complexity classifications for query evaluation using techniques developed for infinite-domain CSPs.</description>
