      <title>Alphanetv4: Alpha Mining Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As AI and deep learning have become hot spots in the 21st century , they are widely used in the current quant market. In 2020, Huatai Securities constructed deep-learning-based AlphaNet for stock feature extraction and price prediction. At present, it has developed to the 3rd version and has formed a great influence in the market.
  However, the AlphaNet has some problems, such as underfitting caused by short sequence length of feature extraction, insufficient diversity of feature extraction, high complexity, instability of random sampling, which lead to the poor performance. So this paper proposes AlphaNetV4 to solve them. The main contributions of this paper are: 1) Increased the length of the sequence and reduced the step size of the extraction layer to improve the fitting effect; 2) Reduced the relevance of original input; 3) Used Spearman correlation coefficient to design dropout layer instead of random sampling to enhance the stability of feature extraction; 4) Applied Bi-LSTM to enrich the extraction layer, and Transformer to enhance the learning ability of the model. In addition, this paper also uses CNE5 Barra to redesign the fitting target, and optimizes the training process by modifying the training weight and using sharp EarlyStopping. This paper compares the performance between AlphaNetV4 and the previous AlphaNets. It verifies that increasing the sequence length can reduce the loss from 0.5 to 0.3, reducing the correlation of input can reduce the loss to 0.25, using Spearman Dropout can cut the computational complexity without damaging the accuracy, and that Transformer can reduce the loss to less than 0.1. Further, this paper conducts the back test to show that AlphaNetV4 has increased the annual excess return by about 7% - 10%. Finally, this paper provides suggestions on the future development of quant trading.</description>

      <title>GPT-Guided Monte Carlo Tree Search for Symbolic Regression in Financial Fraud Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the increasing number of financial services available online, the rate of financial fraud has also been increasing. The traffic and transaction rates on the internet have increased considerably, leading to a need for fast decision-making. Financial institutions also have stringent regulations that often require transparency and explainability of the decision-making process. However, most state-of-the-art algorithms currently used in the industry are highly parameterized black-box models that rely on complex computations to generate a score. These algorithms are inherently slow and lack the explainability and speed of traditional rule-based learners. This work introduces SR-MCTS (Symbolic Regression MCTS), which utilizes a foundational GPT model to guide the MCTS, significantly enhancing its convergence speed and the quality of the generated expressions which are further extracted to rules. Our experiments show that SR-MCTS can detect fraud more efficiently than widely used methods in the industry while providing substantial insights into the decision-making process.</description>

      <title>MISGUIDE: Security-Aware Attack Analytics for Smart Grid Load Frequency Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Incorporating advanced information and communication technologies into smart grids (SGs) offers substantial operational benefits while increasing vulnerability to cyber threats like false data injection (FDI) attacks. Current SG attack analysis tools predominantly employ formal methods or adversarial machine learning (ML) techniques with rule-based bad data detectors to analyze the attack space. However, these attack analytics either generate simplistic attack vectors detectable by the ML-based anomaly detection models (ADMs) or fail to identify critical attack vectors from complex controller dynamics in a feasible time. This paper introduces MISGUIDE, a novel defense-aware attack analytics designed to extract verifiable multi-time slot-based FDI attack vectors from complex SG load frequency control dynamics and ADMs, utilizing the Gurobi optimizer. MISGUIDE can identify optimal (maliciously triggering under/over frequency relays in minimal time) and stealthy attack vectors. Using real-world load data, we validate the MISGUIDE-identified attack vectors through real-time hardware-in-the-loop (OPALRT) simulations of the IEEE 39-bus system.</description>

      <title>Image-based adaptive domain decomposition for continuum damage models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel image-based adaptive domain decomposition FEM framework to accelerate the solution of continuum damage mechanics problems. The key idea is to use image-processing techniques in order to identify the moving interface between the healthy subdomain and unhealthy subdomain as damage propagates, and then use an iterative Schur complement approach to efficiently solve the problem. The implementation of the algorithm consists of several modular components. Following the FEM solution of a load increment, the damage detection module is activated, a step that is based on several image-processing operations including colormap manipulation and morphological convolution-based operations. Then, the damage tracking module is invoked, to identify the crack growth direction using geometrical operations and ray casting algorithm. This information is then passed into the domain decomposition module, where the domain is divided into the healthy subdomain which contains only undamaged elements, and the unhealthy subdomain which comprises both damaged and undamaged elements. Continuity between the two regions is restored using penalty constraints. The computational savings of our method stem from the Schur complement, which allows for the iterative solution of the system of equations appertaining only to the unhealthy subdomain. Through an exhaustive comparison between our approach and single domain computations, we demonstrate the accuracy, efficiency, and robustness of the framework. We ensure its compatibility against local and non-local damage laws, structured and unstructured meshes, as well as in cases where different damage paths eventually merge. Since the key novelty lies in using image processing tools to inform the decomposition, our framework can be readily extended beyond damage mechanics and model several classes of non-linear problems such as plasticity and phase-field.</description>

      <title>High Entropy Alloy property predictions using Transformer-based language model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces a language transformer-based machine learning model to predict key mechanical properties of high-entropy alloys (HEAs), addressing the challenges due to their complex, multi-principal element compositions and limited experimental data. By pre-training the transformer on extensive synthetic materials data and fine-tuning it with specific HEA datasets, the model effectively captures intricate elemental interactions through self-attention mechanisms. This approach mitigates data scarcity issues via transfer learning, enhancing predictive accuracy for properties like elongation (%) and ultimate tensile strength (UTS) compared to traditional regression models such as Random Forests and Gaussian Processes. The model's interpretability is enhanced by visualizing attention weights, revealing significant elemental relationships that align with known metallurgical principles. This work demonstrates the potential of transformer models to accelerate materials discovery and optimization, enabling accurate property predictions, thereby advancing the field of materials informatics.</description>

      <title>SPGD: Steepest Perturbed Gradient Descent Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optimization algorithms are pivotal in advancing various scientific and industrial fields but often encounter obstacles such as trapping in local minima, saddle points, and plateaus (flat regions), which makes the convergence to reasonable or near-optimal solutions particularly challenging. This paper presents the Steepest Perturbed Gradient Descent (SPGD), a novel algorithm that innovatively combines the principles of the gradient descent method with periodic uniform perturbation sampling to effectively circumvent these impediments and lead to better solutions whenever possible. SPGD is distinctively designed to generate a set of candidate solutions and select the one exhibiting the steepest loss difference relative to the current solution. It enhances the traditional gradient descent approach by integrating a strategic exploration mechanism that significantly increases the likelihood of escaping sub-optimal local minima and navigating complex optimization landscapes effectively. Our approach not only retains the directed efficiency of gradient descent but also leverages the exploratory benefits of stochastic perturbations, thus enabling a more comprehensive search for global optima across diverse problem spaces. We demonstrate the efficacy of SPGD in solving the 3D component packing problem, an NP-hard challenge. Preliminary results show a substantial improvement over four established methods, particularly on response surfaces with complex topographies and in multidimensional non-convex continuous optimization problems. Comparative analyses with established 2D benchmark functions highlight SPGD's superior performance, showcasing its ability to navigate complex optimization landscapes. These results emphasize SPGD's potential as a versatile tool for a wide range of optimization problems.</description>

      <title>Mortar Thin Shell Approximation for Analysis of Superconducting Accelerator Magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01076v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thin layers can lead to unfavorable meshes in a finite element (FE) analysis. Thin shell approximations (TSAs) avoid this issue by removing the need for a mesh of the thin layer while approximating the physics across the layer by an interface condition. Typically, a TSA requires the mesh of both sides of the TSA interface to be conforming. To alleviate this requirement, we propose to combine mortar methods and TSAs for solving the heat equation. The mortar TSA method's formulation is derived and enables an independent discretization of the subdomains on the two sides of the TSA depending on their accuracy requirements. The method is verified by comparison with a reference FE solution of a thermal model problem of a simplified superconducting accelerator magnet.</description>
