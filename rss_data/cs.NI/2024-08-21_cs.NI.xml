      <title>Self-Play Ensemble Q-learning enabled Resource Allocation for Network Slicing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 5G networks, network slicing has emerged as a pivotal paradigm to address diverse user demands and service requirements. To meet the requirements, reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms have been utilized widely, but this method has the problem of overestimation and exploration-exploitation trade-offs. To tackle these problems, this paper explores the application of self-play ensemble Q-learning, an extended version of the RL-based technique. Self-play ensemble Q-learning utilizes multiple Q-tables with various exploration-exploitation rates leading to different observations for choosing the most suitable action for each state. Moreover, through self-play, each model endeavors to enhance its performance compared to its previous iterations, boosting system efficiency, and decreasing the effect of overestimation. For performance evaluation, we consider three RL-based algorithms; self-play ensemble Q-learning, double Q-learning, and Q-learning, and compare their performance under different network traffic. Through simulations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of self-play ensemble Q-learning in meeting the diverse demands within 21.92% in latency, 24.22% in throughput, and 23.63\% in packet drop rate in comparison with the baseline methods. Furthermore, we evaluate the robustness of self-play ensemble Q-learning and double Q-learning in situations where one of the Q-tables is affected by a malicious user. Our results depicted that the self-play ensemble Q-learning method is more robust against adversarial users and prevents a noticeable drop in system performance, mitigating the impact of users manipulating policies.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Digital Twin Platform: A Case Study on Core Network Selection in Aeronautical Ad-Hoc Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of Digital Twins (DTs) is hindered by a lack of specialized, open-source solutions that can meet the demands of dynamic applications. This has caused state-of-the-art DT applications to be validated using offline data. However, this approach falls short of integrating real-time data, which is one of the most important characteristics of DTs. This can limit the validating effectiveness of DT applications in cases such as aeronautical ad-hoc networks (AANETs). Considering this, we develop a Real-Time Digital Twin Platform and implement core network selection in AANETs as a case study. In this, we implement microservice-based architecture and design a robust data pipeline. Additionally, we develop an interactive user interface using open-source tools. Using this, the platform supports real-time decision-making in the presence of data retrieval failures.</description>

      <title>Deep Reinforcement Learning for Network Energy Saving in 6G and Beyond Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Network energy saving has received great attention from operators and vendors to reduce energy consumption and CO2 emissions to the environment as well as significantly reduce costs for mobile network operators. However, the design of energy-saving networks also needs to ensure the mobile users' (MUs) QoS requirements such as throughput requirements (TR). This work considers a mobile cellular network including many ground base stations (GBSs), and some GBSs are intentionally turned off due to network energy saving (NES) or crash, so the MUs located in these outage GBSs are not served in time. Based on this observation, we propose the problem of maximizing the total achievable throughput in the network by optimizing the GBSs' antenna tilt and adaptive transmission power with a given number of served MUs satisfied. Notice that, the MU is considered successfully served if its Reference Signal Received Power (RSRP) and throughput requirement are satisfied. The formulated optimization problem becomes difficult to solve with multiple binary variables and non-convex constraints along with random throughput requirements and random placement of MUs. We propose a Deep Q-learning-based algorithm to help the network learn the uncertainty and dynamics of the transmission environment. Extensive simulation results show that our proposed algorithm achieves much better performance than the benchmark schemes.</description>

      <title>Smart Contract Coordinated Privacy Preserving Crowd-Sensing Campaigns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Crowd-sensing has emerged as a powerful data retrieval model, enabling diverse applications by leveraging active user participation. However, data availability and privacy concerns pose significant challenges. Traditional methods like data encryption and anonymization, while essential, may not fully address these issues. For instance, in sparsely populated areas, anonymized data can still be traced back to individual users. Additionally, the volume of data generated by users can reveal their identities. To develop credible crowd-sensing systems, data must be anonymized, aggregated and separated into uniformly sized chunks. Furthermore, decentralizing the data management process, rather than relying on a single server, can enhance security and trust. This paper proposes a system utilizing smart contracts and blockchain technologies to manage crowd-sensing campaigns. The smart contract handles user subscriptions, data encryption, and decentralized storage, creating a secure data marketplace. Incentive policies within the smart contract encourage user participation and data diversity. Simulation results confirm the system's viability, highlighting the importance of user participation for data credibility and the impact of geographical data scarcity on rewards. This approach aims to balance data origin and reduce cheating risks.</description>

      <title>Pluto and Charon: A Time and Memory Efficient Collaborative Edge AI Framework for Personal LLMs Fine-Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have unlocked a plethora of powerful applications at the network edge, such as intelligent personal assistants. Data privacy and security concerns have prompted a shift towards edge-based fine-tuning of personal LLMs, away from cloud reliance. However, this raises issues of computational intensity and resource scarcity, hindering training efficiency and feasibility. While current studies investigate parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques to mitigate resource constraints, our analysis indicates that these techniques are not sufficiently resource-efficient for edge devices. To tackle these challenges, we propose Pluto and Charon (PAC), a time and memory efficient collaborative edge AI framework for personal LLMs fine-tuning. PAC breaks the resource wall of personal LLMs fine-tuning with a sophisticated algorithm-system co-design. (1) Algorithmically, PAC implements a personal LLMs fine-tuning technique that is efficient in terms of parameters, time, and memory. It utilizes Parallel Adapters to circumvent the need for a full backward pass through the LLM backbone. Additionally, an activation cache mechanism further streamlining the process by negating the necessity for repeated forward passes across multiple epochs. (2) Systematically, PAC leverages edge devices in close proximity, pooling them as a collective resource for in-situ personal LLMs fine-tuning, utilizing a hybrid data and pipeline parallelism to orchestrate distributed training. The use of the activation cache eliminates the need for forward pass through the LLM backbone,enabling exclusive fine-tuning of the Parallel Adapters using data parallelism. Extensive evaluation based on prototype implementation demonstrates that PAC remarkably outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving up to 8.64x end-to-end speedup and up to 88.16% reduction in memory footprint.</description>

      <title>KeySpace: Public Key Infrastructure Considerations in Interplanetary Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As satellite networks grow larger and begin to incorporate interplanetary communication, there is an increasing interest in the unsolved problem of how to approach PKI in these conditions. In this paper we explore the goals and requirements for implementing key management systems in satellite networks, focusing on megaconstellations and interplanetary networks. We design a set of standardized experiments which can be used to compare systems against one another for particular network topologies. Using these, we demonstrate that terrestrial PKI techniques are feasible in highly distributed interplanetary networks, showing that it is possible to configure PKI systems to achieve efficient low-latency connection establishment, and minimize the impact of attacks through effective revocations.
  We evaluate this by building the Deep Space Network Simulator (DSNS), a novel network simulator aimed at efficient simulation of large space networks. We run simulations evaluating connection establishment and key revocation under a wide range of PKI configurations. Finally, we propose and evaluate two additional configuration options: OCSP Hybrid, and the use of relay nodes as a firewall. Together these minimize the extent of the network an attacker can reach with a compromised key, and reduce the attacker's load on interplanetary relay links.</description>

      <title>Semi-Persistent Scheduling in NR Sidelink Mode 2: MAC Packet Reception Ratio Model and ns-3 Validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.16680v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: 5G New Radio (NR) Sidelink (SL) has demonstrated the promising capability for infrastructure-less cellular coverage. Understanding the fundamentals of the NR SL channel access mechanism, Semi-Persistent Scheduling (SPS), which is specified by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), is a necessity to enhance the NR SL Packet Reception Ratio (PRR). However, most existing works fail to account for the new SPS features introduced in NR SL, which might be out-of-date for comprehensively describing the NR SL PRR. The existing models ignore the relationships between SPS parameters and, therefore, do not provide sufficient insights into the PRR of SPS. This work proposes a novel SPS PRR model incorporating MAC collisions based on new features in NR SL. We extend our model by loosening several simplifying assumptions made in our initial modeling. The extended models illustrate how the PRR is affected by various SPS parameters. The computed results are validated via simulations using the network simulator (ns-3), which provides important guidelines for future NR SL enhancement work.</description>

      <title>Device Sampling and Resource Optimization for Federated Learning in Cooperative Edge Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.04350v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The conventional federated learning (FedL) architecture distributes machine learning (ML) across worker devices by having them train local models that are periodically aggregated by a server. FedL ignores two important characteristics of contemporary wireless networks, however: (i) the network may contain heterogeneous communication/computation resources, and (ii) there may be significant overlaps in devices' local data distributions. In this work, we develop a novel optimization methodology that jointly accounts for these factors via intelligent device sampling complemented by device-to-device (D2D) offloading. Our optimization methodology aims to select the best combination of sampled nodes and data offloading configuration to maximize FedL training accuracy while minimizing data processing and D2D communication resource consumption subject to realistic constraints on the network topology and device capabilities. Theoretical analysis of the D2D offloading subproblem leads to new FedL convergence bounds and an efficient sequential convex optimizer. Using these results, we develop a sampling methodology based on graph convolutional networks (GCNs) which learns the relationship between network attributes, sampled nodes, and D2D data offloading to maximize FedL accuracy. Through evaluation on popular datasets and real-world network measurements from our edge testbed, we find that our methodology outperforms popular device sampling methodologies from literature in terms of ML model performance, data processing overhead, and energy consumption.</description>

      <title>Generative AI for Space-Air-Ground Integrated Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.06523v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, generative AI technologies have emerged as a significant advancement in artificial intelligence field, renowned for their language and image generation capabilities. Meantime, space-air-ground integrated network (SAGIN) is an integral part of future B5G/6G for achieving ubiquitous connectivity. Inspired by this, this article explores an integration of generative AI in SAGIN, focusing on potential applications and case study. We first provide a comprehensive review of SAGIN and generative AI models, highlighting their capabilities and opportunities of their integration. Benefiting from generative AI's ability to generate useful data and facilitate advanced decision-making processes, it can be applied to various scenarios of SAGIN. Accordingly, we present a concise survey on their integration, including channel modeling and channel state information (CSI) estimation, joint air-space-ground resource allocation, intelligent network deployment, semantic communications, image extraction and processing, security and privacy enhancement. Next, we propose a framework that utilizes a Generative Diffusion Model (GDM) to construct channel information map to enhance quality of service for SAGIN. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Finally, we discuss potential research directions for generative AI-enabled SAGIN.</description>

      <title>Wireless Resource Optimization in Hybrid Semantic/Bit Communication Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04162v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, semantic communication (SemCom) has shown great potential in significant resource savings and efficient information exchanges, thus naturally introducing a novel and practical cellular network paradigm where two modes of SemCom and conventional bit communication (BitCom) coexist. Nevertheless, the involved wireless resource management becomes rather complicated and challenging, given the unique background knowledge matching and time-consuming semantic coding requirements in SemCom. To this end, this paper jointly investigates user association (UA), mode selection (MS), and bandwidth allocation (BA) problems in a hybrid semantic/bit communication network (HSB-Net). Concretely, we first identify a unified performance metric of message throughput for both SemCom and BitCom links. Next, we specially develop a knowledge matching-aware two-stage tandem packet queuing model and theoretically derive the average packet loss ratio and queuing latency. Combined with practical constraints, we then formulate a joint optimization problem for UA, MS, and BA to maximize the overall message throughput of HSB-Net. Afterward, we propose an optimal resource management strategy by utilizing a Lagrange primal-dual transformation method and a preference list-based heuristic algorithm with polynomial-time complexity. Numerical results not only demonstrate the accuracy of our analytical queuing model, but also validate the performance superiority of our proposed strategy compared with different benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Online SLA Decomposition: Enabling Real-Time Adaptation to Evolving Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08968v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When a network slice spans multiple domains, each domain must uphold the End-to-End (E2E) Service Level Agreement (SLA) associated with the slice. This requires decomposing the E2E SLA into partial SLAs for each domain. In a two-level network slicing management system with an E2E orchestrator and local controllers, we propose an online learning-decomposition framework that dynamically updates risk models using recent feedback. This approach utilizes online gradient descent and FIFO memory buffers to enhance stability and robustness. Our empirical study shows the proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art static methods, offering more accurate and resilient SLA decomposition under varying conditions and sparse data.</description>

      <title>Time Complexity of Broadcast and Consensus for Randomized Oblivious Message Adversaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.11988v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Broadcast and consensus are most fundamental tasks in distributed computing. These tasks are particularly challenging in dynamic networks where communication across the network links may be unreliable, e.g., due to mobility or failures. Indeed, over the last years, researchers have derived several impossibility results and high time complexity lower bounds (i.e., linear in the number of nodes $n$) for these tasks, even for oblivious message adversaries where communication networks are rooted trees. However, such deterministic adversarial models may be overly conservative, as many processes in real-world settings are stochastic in nature rather than worst case.
  This paper initiates the study of broadcast and consensus on stochastic dynamic networks, introducing a randomized oblivious message adversary. Our model is reminiscent of the SI model in epidemics, however, revolving around trees (which renders the analysis harder due to the apparent lack of independence). In particular, we show that if information dissemination occurs along random rooted trees, broadcast and consensus complete fast with high probability, namely in logarithmic time. Our analysis proves the independence of a key variable, which enables a formal understanding of the dissemination process.
  More formally, for a network with $n$ nodes, we first consider the completely random case where in each round the communication network is chosen uniformly at random among rooted trees. We then introduce the notion of randomized oblivious message adversary, where in each round, an adversary can choose $k$ edges to appear in the communication network, and then a rooted tree is chosen uniformly at random among the set of all rooted trees that include these edges. We show that broadcast completes in $O(k+\log n)$ rounds, and that this it is also the case for consensus as long as $k \le 0.1n$.</description>

      <title>FedMFS: Federated Multimodal Fusion Learning with Selective Modality Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.07048v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal federated learning (FL) aims to enrich model training in FL settings where devices are collecting measurements across multiple modalities (e.g., sensors measuring pressure, motion, and other types of data). However, key challenges to multimodal FL remain unaddressed, particularly in heterogeneous network settings: (i) the set of modalities collected by each device will be diverse, and (ii) communication limitations prevent devices from uploading all their locally trained modality models to the server. In this paper, we propose Federated Multimodal Fusion learning with Selective modality communication (FedMFS), a new multimodal fusion FL methodology that can tackle the above mentioned challenges. The key idea is the introduction of a modality selection criterion for each device, which weighs (i) the impact of the modality, gauged by Shapley value analysis, against (ii) the modality model size as a gauge for communication overhead. This enables FedMFS to flexibly balance performance against communication costs, depending on resource constraints and application requirements. Experiments on the real-world ActionSense dataset demonstrate the ability of FedMFS to achieve comparable accuracy to several baselines while reducing the communication overhead by over 4x.</description>

      <title>WHALE-FL: Wireless and Heterogeneity Aware Latency Efficient Federated Learning over Mobile Devices via Adaptive Subnetwork Scheduling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00885v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As a popular distributed learning paradigm, federated learning (FL) over mobile devices fosters numerous applications, while their practical deployment is hindered by participating devices' computing and communication heterogeneity. Some pioneering research efforts proposed to extract subnetworks from the global model, and assign as large a subnetwork as possible to the device for local training based on its full computing and communications capacity. Although such fixed size subnetwork assignment enables FL training over heterogeneous mobile devices, it is unaware of (i) the dynamic changes of devices' communication and computing conditions and (ii) FL training progress and its dynamic requirements of local training contributions, both of which may cause very long FL training delay. Motivated by those dynamics, in this paper, we develop a wireless and heterogeneity aware latency efficient FL (WHALE-FL) approach to accelerate FL training through adaptive subnetwork scheduling. Instead of sticking to the fixed size subnetwork, WHALE-FL introduces a novel subnetwork selection utility function to capture device and FL training dynamics, and guides the mobile device to adaptively select the subnetwork size for local training based on (a) its computing and communication capacity, (b) its dynamic computing and/or communication conditions, and (c) FL training status and its corresponding requirements for local training contributions. Our evaluation shows that, compared with peer designs, WHALE-FL effectively accelerates FL training without sacrificing learning accuracy.</description>

Abstract: Flow-guided localization using in-body nanodevices in the bloodstream is expected to be beneficial for early disease detection, continuous monitoring of biological conditions, and targeted treatment. The nanodevices face size and power constraints that produce erroneous raw data for localization purposes. On-body anchors receive this data, and use it to derive the locations of diagnostic events of interest. Different Machine Learning (ML) approaches have been recently proposed for this task, yet they are currently restricted to a reference bloodstream of a resting patient. As such, they are unable to deal with the physical diversity of patients' bloodstreams and cannot provide continuous monitoring due to changes in individual patient's activities. Toward addressing these issues for the current State-of-the-Art (SotA) flow-guided localization approach based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), we propose a pipeline for GNN adaptation based on individual physiological indicators including height, weight, and heart rate. Our results indicate that the proposed adaptions are beneficial in reconciling the individual differences between bloodstreams and activities.</description>
