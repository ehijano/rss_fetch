      <title>FakeSV-VLM: Taming VLM for Detecting Fake Short-Video News via Progressive Mixture-Of-Experts Adapter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present FakeSV-VLM in this paper, a new VLM-based framework for detecting fake news on short video platforms. Despite significant efforts to combat this issue due to the severe threat that fake news videos pose to public information security, existing methods still fall short in detection accuracy, often due to lack of knowledge to verify the news is real or not. However, large Vision Language Models (VLMs) have absorbed extensive real-world knowledge from massive multimodal datasets. Motivated by this, we adapt advanced VLMs for fake news detection in short videos. Upon close examination of news samples, we observe that short video samples can be categorized into four distinct scenarios: both video and text are real (for real samples), or both are fake, or either the video or text is fake (for fake samples). Inspired by this insight, we design four experts tailored to handle each scenario and integrate them into VLM via Mixture of Experts. Specifically, we develop the Progressive MoE Adapter (PMOE) module where detection experts first provide an initial analysis, followed by attribution experts for a comprehensive diagnosis, leading to a robust decision. Additionally, we also note the fake news videos often show inconsistency between two modalities. Consequently, we further design the Alignment-driven Event Checking (ADEC) module, which perceives the fake news by capturing the inconsistency between different modalities. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets, FakeSV and FakeTT, verify the superiority of our model. It significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art models by +3.32% and +5.02%, establishing a new benchmark in the field.</description>

      <title>ProMSC-MIS: Prompt-based Multimodal Semantic Communication for Multi-Spectral Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal semantic communication has great potential to enhance downstream task performance by integrating complementary information across modalities. This paper introduces ProMSC-MIS, a novel Prompt-based Multimodal Semantic Communication framework for Multi-Spectral Image Segmentation. It enables efficient task-oriented transmission of spatially aligned RGB and thermal images over band-limited channels. Our framework has two main design novelties. First, by leveraging prompt learning and contrastive learning, unimodal semantic encoders are pre-trained to learn diverse and complementary semantic representations by using features from one modality as prompts for another. Second, a semantic fusion module that combines cross-attention mechanism and squeeze-and-excitation (SE) networks is designed to effectively fuse cross-modal features. Experimental results demonstrate that ProMSC-MIS substantially outperforms conventional image transmission combined with state-of-the-art segmentation methods. Notably, it reduces the required channel bandwidth by 50%--70% at the same segmentation performance, while also decreasing the storage overhead and computational complexity by 26% and 37%, respectively. Ablation studies also validate the effectiveness of the proposed pre-training and semantic fusion strategies. Our scheme is highly suitable for applications such as autonomous driving and nighttime surveillance.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a transformer-based rhythm quantization model that incorporates beat and downbeat information to quantize MIDI performances into metrically-aligned, human-readable scores. We propose a beat-based preprocessing method that transfers score and performance data into a unified token representation. We optimize our model architecture and data representation and train on piano and guitar performances. Our model exceeds state-of-the-art performance based on the MUSTER metric.</description>

      <title>PersoNo: Personalised Notification Urgency Classifier in Mixed Reality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mixed Reality (MR) is increasingly integrated into daily life, providing enhanced capabilities across various domains. However, users face growing notification streams that disrupt their immersive experience. We present PersoNo, a personalised notification urgency classifier for MR that intelligently classifies notifications based on individual user preferences. Through a user study (N=18), we created the first MR notification dataset containing both self-labelled and interaction-based data across activities with varying cognitive demands. Our thematic analysis revealed that, unlike in mobiles, the activity context is equally important as the content and the sender in determining notification urgency in MR. Leveraging these insights, we developed PersoNo using large language models that analyse users replying behaviour patterns. Our multi-agent approach achieved 81.5% accuracy and significantly reduced false negative rates (0.381) compared to baseline models. PersoNo has the potential not only to reduce unnecessary interruptions but also to offer users understanding and control of the system, adhering to Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence design principles.</description>

      <title>AudioStory: Generating Long-Form Narrative Audio with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-audio (TTA) generation excel at synthesizing short audio clips but struggle with long-form narrative audio, which requires temporal coherence and compositional reasoning. To address this gap, we propose AudioStory, a unified framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) with TTA systems to generate structured, long-form audio narratives. AudioStory possesses strong instruction-following reasoning generation capabilities. It employs LLMs to decompose complex narrative queries into temporally ordered sub-tasks with contextual cues, enabling coherent scene transitions and emotional tone consistency. AudioStory has two appealing features: (1) Decoupled bridging mechanism: AudioStory disentangles LLM-diffuser collaboration into two specialized components, i.e., a bridging query for intra-event semantic alignment and a residual query for cross-event coherence preservation. (2) End-to-end training: By unifying instruction comprehension and audio generation within a single end-to-end framework, AudioStory eliminates the need for modular training pipelines while enhancing synergy between components. Furthermore, we establish a benchmark AudioStory-10K, encompassing diverse domains such as animated soundscapes and natural sound narratives. Extensive experiments show the superiority of AudioStory on both single-audio generation and narrative audio generation, surpassing prior TTA baselines in both instruction-following ability and audio fidelity.

      <title>Human-Inspired Computing for Robust and Efficient Audio-Visual Speech Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16564v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Humans naturally perform audiovisual speech recognition (AVSR), enhancing the accuracy and robustness by integrating auditory and visual information. Spiking neural networks (SNNs), which mimic the brain's information-processing mechanisms, are well-suited for emulating the human capability of AVSR. Despite their potential, research on SNNs for AVSR is scarce, with most existing audio-visual multimodal methods focused on object or digit recognition. These models simply integrate features from both modalities, neglecting their unique characteristics and interactions. Additionally, they often rely on future information for current processing, which increases recognition latency and limits real-time applicability. Inspired by human speech perception, this paper proposes a novel human-inspired SNN named HI-AVSNN for AVSR, incorporating three key characteristics: cueing interaction, causal processing and spike activity. For cueing interaction, we propose a visual-cued auditory attention module (VCA2M) that leverages visual cues to guide attention to auditory features. We achieve causal processing by aligning the SNN's temporal dimension with that of visual and auditory features and applying temporal masking to utilize only past and current information. To implement spike activity, in addition to using SNNs, we leverage the event camera to capture lip movement as spikes, mimicking the human retina and providing efficient visual data. We evaluate HI-AVSNN on an audiovisual speech recognition dataset combining the DVS-Lip dataset with its corresponding audio samples. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed fusion method, outperforming existing audio-visual SNN fusion methods and achieving a 2.27% improvement in accuracy over the only existing SNN-based AVSR method.</description>

      <title>X-Prompt: Towards Universal In-Context Image Generation in Auto-Regressive Vision Language Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01824v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In-context generation is a key component of large language models' (LLMs) open-task generalization capability. By leveraging a few examples as context, LLMs can perform both in-domain and out-of-domain tasks. Recent advancements in auto-regressive vision-language models (VLMs) built upon LLMs have showcased impressive performance in text-to-image generation. However, the potential of in-context learning for general image generation tasks remains largely unexplored. To address this, we introduce X-Prompt, a purely auto-regressive large-vision language model designed to deliver competitive performance across a wide range of both seen and unseen image generation tasks, all within a unified in-context learning framework. X-Prompt incorporates a specialized design that efficiently compresses valuable features from in-context examples, supporting longer in-context token sequences and improving its ability to generalize to unseen tasks. A unified training task for both text and image prediction enables X-Prompt to handle general image generation with enhanced task awareness from in-context examples. Extensive experiments validate the model's performance across diverse seen image generation tasks and its capacity to generalize to previously unseen tasks.</description>

      <title>PediatricsMQA: a Multi-modal Pediatrics Question Answering Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16439v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) and vision-augmented LLMs (VLMs) have significantly advanced medical informatics, diagnostics, and decision support. However, these models exhibit systematic biases, particularly age bias, compromising their reliability and equity. This is evident in their poorer performance on pediatric-focused text and visual question-answering tasks. This bias reflects a broader imbalance in medical research, where pediatric studies receive less funding and representation despite the significant disease burden in children. To address these issues, a new comprehensive multi-modal pediatric question-answering benchmark, PediatricsMQA, has been introduced. It consists of 3,417 text-based multiple-choice questions (MCQs) covering 131 pediatric topics across seven developmental stages (prenatal to adolescent) and 2,067 vision-based MCQs using 634 pediatric images from 67 imaging modalities and 256 anatomical regions. The dataset was developed using a hybrid manual-automatic pipeline, incorporating peer-reviewed pediatric literature, validated question banks, existing benchmarks, and existing QA resources. Evaluating state-of-the-art open models, we find dramatic performance drops in younger cohorts, highlighting the need for age-aware methods to ensure equitable AI support in pediatric care.</description>
