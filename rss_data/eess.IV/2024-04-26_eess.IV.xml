      <title>Enhancing Diagnosis through AI-driven Analysis of Reflectance Confocal Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reflectance Confocal Microscopy (RCM) is a non-invasive imaging technique used in biomedical research and clinical dermatology. It provides virtual high-resolution images of the skin and superficial tissues, reducing the need for physical biopsies. RCM employs a laser light source to illuminate the tissue, capturing the reflected light to generate detailed images of microscopic structures at various depths. Recent studies explored AI and machine learning, particularly CNNs, for analyzing RCM images. Our study proposes a segmentation strategy based on textural features to identify clinically significant regions, empowering dermatologists in effective image interpretation and boosting diagnostic confidence. This approach promises to advance dermatological diagnosis and treatment.</description>

      <title>Light-weight Retinal Layer Segmentation with Global Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automatic retinal layer segmentation with medical images, such as optical coherence tomography (OCT) images, serves as an important tool for diagnosing ophthalmic diseases. However, it is challenging to achieve accurate segmentation due to low contrast and blood flow noises presented in the images. In addition, the algorithm should be light-weight to be deployed for practical clinical applications. Therefore, it is desired to design a light-weight network with high performance for retinal layer segmentation. In this paper, we propose LightReSeg for retinal layer segmentation which can be applied to OCT images. Specifically, our approach follows an encoder-decoder structure, where the encoder part employs multi-scale feature extraction and a Transformer block for fully exploiting the semantic information of feature maps at all scales and making the features have better global reasoning capabilities, while the decoder part, we design a multi-scale asymmetric attention (MAA) module for preserving the semantic information at each encoder scale. The experiments show that our approach achieves a better segmentation performance compared to the current state-of-the-art method TransUnet with 105.7M parameters on both our collected dataset and two other public datasets, with only 3.3M parameters.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning-based Prediction of Breast Cancer Tumor and Immune Phenotypes from Histopathology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interactions between tumor cells and the tumor microenvironment (TME) dictate therapeutic efficacy of radiation and many systemic therapies in breast cancer. However, to date, there is not a widely available method to reproducibly measure tumor and immune phenotypes for each patient's tumor. Given this unmet clinical need, we applied multiple instance learning (MIL) algorithms to assess activity of ten biologically relevant pathways from the hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) slide of primary breast tumors. We employed different feature extraction approaches and state-of-the-art model architectures. Using binary classification, our models attained area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) scores above 0.70 for nearly all gene expression pathways and on some cases, exceeded 0.80. Attention maps suggest that our trained models recognize biologically relevant spatial patterns of cell sub-populations from H&amp;E. These efforts represent a first step towards developing computational H&amp;E biomarkers that reflect facets of the TME and hold promise for augmenting precision oncology.</description>

      <title>A Deep Learning-Driven Pipeline for Differentiating Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy from Cardiac Amyloidosis Using 2D Multi-View Echocardiography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and cardiac amyloidosis (CA) are both heart conditions that can progress to heart failure if untreated. They exhibit similar echocardiographic characteristics, often leading to diagnostic challenges. This paper introduces a novel multi-view deep learning approach that utilizes 2D echocardiography for differentiating between HCM and CA. The method begins by classifying 2D echocardiography data into five distinct echocardiographic views: apical 4-chamber, parasternal long axis of left ventricle, parasternal short axis at levels of the mitral valve, papillary muscle, and apex. It then extracts features of each view separately and combines five features for disease classification. A total of 212 patients diagnosed with HCM, and 30 patients diagnosed with CA, along with 200 individuals with normal cardiac function(Normal), were enrolled in this study from 2018 to 2022. This approach achieved a precision, recall of 0.905, and micro-F1 score of 0.904, demonstrating its effectiveness in accurately identifying HCM and CA using a multi-view analysis.</description>

      <title>Image registration based automated lesion correspondence pipeline for longitudinal CT data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Patients diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer (mBC) typically undergo several radiographic assessments during their treatment. mBC often involves multiple metastatic lesions in different organs, it is imperative to accurately track and assess these lesions to gain a comprehensive understanding of the disease's response to treatment. Computerized analysis methods that rely on lesion-level tracking have often used manual matching of corresponding lesions, a time-consuming process that is prone to errors. This paper introduces an automated lesion correspondence algorithm designed to precisely track both targets' lesions and non-targets' lesions in longitudinal data. Here we demonstrate the applicability of our algorithm on the anonymized data from two Phase III trials. The dataset contains imaging data of patients for different follow-up timepoints and the radiologist annotations for the patients enrolled in the trials. Target and non-target lesions are annotated by either one or two groups of radiologists. To facilitate accurate tracking, we have developed a registration-assisted lesion correspondence algorithm. The algorithm employs a sequential two-step pipeline: (a) Firstly, an adaptive Hungarian algorithm is used to establish correspondence among lesions within a single volumetric image series which have been annotated by multiple radiologists at a specific timepoint. (b) Secondly, after establishing correspondence and assigning unique names to the lesions, three-dimensional rigid registration is applied to various image series at the same timepoint. Registration is followed by ongoing lesion correspondence based on the adaptive Hungarian algorithm and updating lesion names for accurate tracking. Validation of our automated lesion correspondence algorithm is performed through triaxial plots based on axial, sagittal, and coronal views, confirming its efficacy in matching lesions.</description>

      <title>Deep learning-based blind image super-resolution with iterative kernel reconstruction and noise estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Blind single image super-resolution (SISR) is a challenging task in image processing due to the ill-posed nature of the inverse problem. Complex degradations present in real life images make it difficult to solve this problem using na\"ive deep learning approaches, where models are often trained on synthetically generated image pairs. Most of the effort so far has been focused on solving the inverse problem under some constraints, such as for a limited space of blur kernels and/or assuming noise-free input images. Yet, there is a gap in the literature to provide a well-generalized deep learning-based solution that performs well on images with unknown and highly complex degradations. In this paper, we propose IKR-Net (Iterative Kernel Reconstruction Network) for blind SISR. In the proposed approach, kernel and noise estimation and high-resolution image reconstruction are carried out iteratively using dedicated deep models. The iterative refinement provides significant improvement in both the reconstructed image and the estimated blur kernel even for noisy inputs. IKR-Net provides a generalized solution that can handle any type of blur and level of noise in the input low-resolution image. IKR-Net achieves state-of-the-art results in blind SISR, especially for noisy images with motion blur.</description>

      <title>Multi-view Cardiac Image Segmentation via Trans-Dimensional Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel multi-stage trans-dimensional architecture for multi-view cardiac image segmentation. Our method exploits the relationship between long-axis (2D) and short-axis (3D) magnetic resonance (MR) images to perform a sequential 3D-to-2D-to-3D segmentation, segmenting the long-axis and short-axis images. In the first stage, 3D segmentation is performed using the short-axis image, and the prediction is transformed to the long-axis view and used as a segmentation prior in the next stage. In the second step, the heart region is localized and cropped around the segmentation prior using a Heart Localization and Cropping (HLC) module, focusing the subsequent model on the heart region of the image, where a 2D segmentation is performed. Similarly, we transform the long-axis prediction to the short-axis view, localize and crop the heart region and again perform a 3D segmentation to refine the initial short-axis segmentation. We evaluate our proposed method on the Multi-Disease, Multi-View &amp; Multi-Center Right Ventricular Segmentation in Cardiac MRI (M&amp;Ms-2) dataset, where our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in segmenting cardiac regions of interest in both short-axis and long-axis images. The pre-trained models, source code, and implementation details will be publicly available.</description>

      <title>Features Fusion for Dual-View Mammography Mass Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detection of malignant lesions on mammography images is extremely important for early breast cancer diagnosis. In clinical practice, images are acquired from two different angles, and radiologists can fully utilize information from both views, simultaneously locating the same lesion. However, for automatic detection approaches such information fusion remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose a new model called MAMM-Net, which allows the processing of both mammography views simultaneously by sharing information not only on an object level, as seen in existing works, but also on a feature level. MAMM-Net's key component is the Fusion Layer, based on deformable attention and designed to increase detection precision while keeping high recall. Our experiments show superior performance on the public DDSM dataset compared to the previous state-of-the-art model, while introducing new helpful features such as lesion annotation on pixel-level and classification of lesions malignancy.</description>

      <title>Transformer-Based Local Feature Matching for Multimodal Image Registration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrasound imaging is a cost-effective and radiation-free modality for visualizing anatomical structures in real-time, making it ideal for guiding surgical interventions. However, its limited field-of-view, speckle noise, and imaging artifacts make it difficult to interpret the images for inexperienced users. In this paper, we propose a new 2D ultrasound to 3D CT registration method to improve surgical guidance during ultrasound-guided interventions. Our approach adopts a dense feature matching method called LoFTR to our multimodal registration problem. We learn to predict dense coarse-to-fine correspondences using a Transformer-based architecture to estimate a robust rigid transformation between a 2D ultrasound frame and a CT scan. Additionally, a fully differentiable pose estimation method is introduced, optimizing LoFTR on pose estimation error during training. Experiments conducted on a multimodal dataset of ex vivo porcine kidneys demonstrate the method's promising results for intraoperative, trackerless ultrasound pose estimation. By mapping 2D ultrasound frames into the 3D CT volume space, the method provides intraoperative guidance, potentially improving surgical workflows and image interpretation.</description>

      <title>Exploring the limitations of blood pressure estimation using the photoplethysmography signal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hypertension, a leading contributor to cardiovascular morbidity, underscores the need for accurate and continuous blood pressure (BP) monitoring. Photoplethysmography (PPG) presents a promising approach to this end. However, the precision of BP estimates derived from PPG signals has been the subject of ongoing debate, necessitating a comprehensive evaluation of their effectiveness and constraints. We developed a calibration-based Siamese ResNet model for BP estimation, using a signal input paired with a reference BP reading. We compared the use of normalized PPG (N-PPG) against the normalized Invasive Arterial Blood Pressure (N-IABP) signals as input. The N-IABP signals do not directly present systolic and diastolic values but theoretically provide a more accurate BP measure than PPG signals since it is a direct pressure sensor inside the body. Our strategy establishes a critical benchmark for PPG performance, realistically calibrating expectations for PPG's BP estimation capabilities. Nonetheless, we compared the performance of our models using different signal-filtering conditions to evaluate the impact of filtering on the results. We evaluated our method using the AAMI and the BHS standards employing the VitalDB dataset. The N-IABP signals meet with AAMI standards for both Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP) and Diastolic Blood Pressure (DBP), with errors of 1.29+-6.33mmHg for systolic pressure and 1.17+-5.78mmHg for systolic and diastolic pressure respectively for the raw N-IABP signal. In contrast, N-PPG signals, in their best setup, exhibited inferior performance than N-IABP, presenting 1.49+-11.82mmHg and 0.89+-7.27mmHg for systolic and diastolic pressure respectively. Our findings highlight the potential and limitations of employing PPG for BP estimation, showing that these signals contain information correlated to BP but may not be sufficient for predicting it accurately.</description>

      <title>Mamba-360: Survey of State Space Models as Transformer Alternative for Long Sequence Modelling: Methods, Applications, and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sequence modeling is a crucial area across various domains, including Natural Language Processing (NLP), speech recognition, time series forecasting, music generation, and bioinformatics. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short Term Memory Networks (LSTMs) have historically dominated sequence modeling tasks like Machine Translation, Named Entity Recognition (NER), etc. However, the advancement of transformers has led to a shift in this paradigm, given their superior performance. Yet, transformers suffer from $O(N^2)$ attention complexity and challenges in handling inductive bias. Several variations have been proposed to address these issues which use spectral networks or convolutions and have performed well on a range of tasks. However, they still have difficulty in dealing with long sequences. State Space Models(SSMs) have emerged as promising alternatives for sequence modeling paradigms in this context, especially with the advent of S4 and its variants, such as S4nd, Hippo, Hyena, Diagnol State Spaces (DSS), Gated State Spaces (GSS), Linear Recurrent Unit (LRU), Liquid-S4, Mamba, etc. In this survey, we categorize the foundational SSMs based on three paradigms namely, Gating architectures, Structural architectures, and Recurrent architectures. This survey also highlights diverse applications of SSMs across domains such as vision, video, audio, speech, language (especially long sequence modeling), medical (including genomics), chemical (like drug design), recommendation systems, and time series analysis, including tabular data. Moreover, we consolidate the performance of SSMs on benchmark datasets like Long Range Arena (LRA), WikiText, Glue, Pile, ImageNet, Kinetics-400, sstv2, as well as video datasets such as Breakfast, COIN, LVU, and various time series datasets. The project page for Mamba-360 work is available on this webpage.\url{https://github.com/badripatro/mamba360}.</description>

      <title>Improving Multi-label Recognition using Class Co-Occurrence Probabilities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-label Recognition (MLR) involves the identification of multiple objects within an image. To address the additional complexity of this problem, recent works have leveraged information from vision-language models (VLMs) trained on large text-images datasets for the task. These methods learn an independent classifier for each object (class), overlooking correlations in their occurrences. Such co-occurrences can be captured from the training data as conditional probabilities between a pair of classes. We propose a framework to extend the independent classifiers by incorporating the co-occurrence information for object pairs to improve the performance of independent classifiers. We use a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to enforce the conditional probabilities between classes, by refining the initial estimates derived from image and text sources obtained using VLMs. We validate our method on four MLR datasets, where our approach outperforms all state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>CFMW: Cross-modality Fusion Mamba for Multispectral Object Detection under Adverse Weather Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cross-modality images that integrate visible-infrared spectra cues can provide richer complementary information for object detection. Despite this, existing visible-infrared object detection methods severely degrade in severe weather conditions. This failure stems from the pronounced sensitivity of visible images to environmental perturbations, such as rain, haze, and snow, which frequently cause false negatives and false positives in detection. To address this issue, we introduce a novel and challenging task, termed visible-infrared object detection under adverse weather conditions. To foster this task, we have constructed a new Severe Weather Visible-Infrared Dataset (SWVID) with diverse severe weather scenes. Furthermore, we introduce the Cross-modality Fusion Mamba with Weather-removal (CFMW) to augment detection accuracy in adverse weather conditions. Thanks to the proposed Weather Removal Diffusion Model (WRDM) and Cross-modality Fusion Mamba (CFM) modules, CFMW is able to mine more essential information of pedestrian features in cross-modality fusion, thus could transfer to other rarer scenarios with high efficiency and has adequate availability on those platforms with low computing power. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that targeted improvement and integrated both Diffusion and Mamba modules in cross-modality object detection, successfully expanding the practical application of this type of model with its higher accuracy and more advanced architecture. Extensive experiments on both well-recognized and self-created datasets conclusively demonstrate that our CFMW achieves state-of-the-art detection performance, surpassing existing benchmarks. The dataset and source code will be made publicly available at https://github.com/lhy-zjut/CFMW.</description>

      <title>Cross-sensor super-resolution of irregularly sampled Sentinel-2 time series</title>

Abstract: Satellite imaging generally presents a trade-off between the frequency of acquisitions and the spatial resolution of the images. Super-resolution is often advanced as a way to get the best of both worlds. In this work, we investigate multi-image super-resolution of satellite image time series, i.e. how multiple images of the same area acquired at different dates can help reconstruct a higher resolution observation. In particular, we extend state-of-the-art deep single and multi-image super-resolution algorithms, such as SRDiff and HighRes-net, to deal with irregularly sampled Sentinel-2 time series. We introduce BreizhSR, a new dataset for 4x super-resolution of Sentinel-2 time series using very high-resolution SPOT-6 imagery of Brittany, a French region. We show that using multiple images significantly improves super-resolution performance, and that a well-designed temporal positional encoding allows us to perform super-resolution for different times of the series. In addition, we observe a trade-off between spectral fidelity and perceptual quality of the reconstructed HR images, questioning future directions for super-resolution of Earth Observation data.</description>

      <title>Real-Time 4K Super-Resolution of Compressed AVIF Images. AIS 2024 Challenge Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel benchmark as part of the AIS 2024 Real-Time Image Super-Resolution (RTSR) Challenge, which aims to upscale compressed images from 540p to 4K resolution (4x factor) in real-time on commercial GPUs. For this, we use a diverse test set containing a variety of 4K images ranging from digital art to gaming and photography. The images are compressed using the modern AVIF codec, instead of JPEG. All the proposed methods improve PSNR fidelity over Lanczos interpolation, and process images under 10ms. Out of the 160 participants, 25 teams submitted their code and models. The solutions present novel designs tailored for memory-efficiency and runtime on edge devices. This survey describes the best solutions for real-time SR of compressed high-resolution images.</description>

      <title>ResVR: Joint Rescaling and Viewport Rendering of Omnidirectional Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the advent of virtual reality technology, omnidirectional image (ODI) rescaling techniques are increasingly embraced for reducing transmitted and stored file sizes while preserving high image quality. Despite this progress, current ODI rescaling methods predominantly focus on enhancing the quality of images in equirectangular projection (ERP) format, which overlooks the fact that the content viewed on head mounted displays (HMDs) is actually a rendered viewport instead of an ERP image. In this work, we emphasize that focusing solely on ERP quality results in inferior viewport visual experiences for users. Thus, we propose ResVR, which is the first comprehensive framework for the joint Rescaling and Viewport Rendering of ODIs. ResVR allows obtaining LR ERP images for transmission while rendering high-quality viewports for users to watch on HMDs. In our ResVR, a novel discrete pixel sampling strategy is developed to tackle the complex mapping between the viewport and ERP, enabling end-to-end training of ResVR pipeline. Furthermore, a spherical pixel shape representation technique is innovatively derived from spherical differentiation to significantly improve the visual quality of rendered viewports. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our ResVR outperforms existing methods in viewport rendering tasks across different fields of view, resolutions, and view directions while keeping a low transmission overhead.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Representation Learning for 3D MRI Super Resolution with Degradation Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.06891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.06891v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-resolution (HR) magnetic resonance imaging is critical in aiding doctors in their diagnoses and image-guided treatments. However, acquiring HR images can be time-consuming and costly. Consequently, deep learning-based super-resolution reconstruction (SRR) has emerged as a promising solution for generating super-resolution (SR) images from low-resolution (LR) images. Unfortunately, training such neural networks requires aligned authentic HR and LR image pairs, which are challenging to obtain due to patient movements during and between image acquisitions. While rigid movements of hard tissues can be corrected with image registration, aligning deformed soft tissues is complex, making it impractical to train neural networks with authentic HR and LR image pairs. Previous studies have focused on SRR using authentic HR images and down-sampled synthetic LR images. However, the difference in degradation representations between synthetic and authentic LR images suppresses the quality of SR images reconstructed from authentic LR images. To address this issue, we propose a novel Unsupervised Degradation Adaptation Network (UDEAN). Our network consists of a degradation learning network and an SRR network. The degradation learning network downsamples the HR images using the degradation representation learned from the misaligned or unpaired LR images. The SRR network then learns the mapping from the down-sampled HR images to the original ones. Experimental results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art networks and is a promising solution to the challenges in clinical settings.</description>

      <title>Coordinate-based neural representations for computational adaptive optics in widefield microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.03812v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Widefield microscopy is widely used for non-invasive imaging of biological structures at subcellular resolution. When applied to complex specimen, its image quality is degraded by sample-induced optical aberration. Adaptive optics can correct wavefront distortion and restore diffraction-limited resolution but require wavefront sensing and corrective devices, increasing system complexity and cost. Here, we describe a self-supervised machine learning algorithm, CoCoA, that performs joint wavefront estimation and three-dimensional structural information extraction from a single input 3D image stack without the need for external training dataset. We implemented CoCoA for widefield imaging of mouse brain tissues and validated its performance with direct-wavefront-sensing-based adaptive optics. Importantly, we systematically explored and quantitatively characterized the limiting factors of CoCoA's performance. Using CoCoA, we demonstrated the first in vivo widefield mouse brain imaging using machine-learning-based adaptive optics. Incorporating coordinate-based neural representations and a forward physics model, the self-supervised scheme of CoCoA should be applicable to microscopy modalities in general.</description>

      <title>Pix2HDR -- A pixel-wise acquisition and deep learning-based synthesis approach for high-speed HDR videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16139v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurately capturing dynamic scenes with wide-ranging motion and light intensity is crucial for many vision applications. However, acquiring high-speed high dynamic range (HDR) video is challenging because the camera's frame rate restricts its dynamic range. Existing methods sacrifice speed to acquire multi-exposure frames. Yet, misaligned motion in these frames can still pose complications for HDR fusion algorithms, resulting in artifacts. Instead of frame-based exposures, we sample the videos using individual pixels at varying exposures and phase offsets. Implemented on a monochrome pixel-wise programmable image sensor, our sampling pattern simultaneously captures fast motion at a high dynamic range. We then transform pixel-wise outputs into an HDR video using end-to-end learned weights from deep neural networks, achieving high spatiotemporal resolution with minimized motion blurring. We demonstrate aliasing-free HDR video acquisition at 1000 FPS, resolving fast motion under low-light conditions and against bright backgrounds - both challenging conditions for conventional cameras. By combining the versatility of pixel-wise sampling patterns with the strength of deep neural networks at decoding complex scenes, our method greatly enhances the vision system's adaptability and performance in dynamic conditions.</description>

      <title>SiMBA: Simplified Mamba-Based Architecture for Vision and Multivariate Time series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15360v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transformers have widely adopted attention networks for sequence mixing and MLPs for channel mixing, playing a pivotal role in achieving breakthroughs across domains. However, recent literature highlights issues with attention networks, including low inductive bias and quadratic complexity concerning input sequence length. State Space Models (SSMs) like S4 and others (Hippo, Global Convolutions, liquid S4, LRU, Mega, and Mamba), have emerged to address the above issues to help handle longer sequence lengths. Mamba, while being the state-of-the-art SSM, has a stability issue when scaled to large networks for computer vision datasets. We propose SiMBA, a new architecture that introduces Einstein FFT (EinFFT) for channel modeling by specific eigenvalue computations and uses the Mamba block for sequence modeling. Extensive performance studies across image and time-series benchmarks demonstrate that SiMBA outperforms existing SSMs, bridging the performance gap with state-of-the-art transformers. Notably, SiMBA establishes itself as the new state-of-the-art SSM on ImageNet and transfer learning benchmarks such as Stanford Car and Flower as well as task learning benchmarks as well as seven time series benchmark datasets.

      <title>The Brain Tumor Segmentation in Pediatrics (BraTS-PEDs) Challenge: Focus on Pediatrics (CBTN-CONNECT-DIPGR-ASNR-MICCAI BraTS-PEDs)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15009v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pediatric tumors of the central nervous system are the most common cause of cancer-related death in children. The five-year survival rate for high-grade gliomas in children is less than 20%. Due to their rarity, the diagnosis of these entities is often delayed, their treatment is mainly based on historic treatment concepts, and clinical trials require multi-institutional collaborations. Here we present the CBTN-CONNECT-DIPGR-ASNR-MICCAI BraTS-PEDs challenge, focused on pediatric brain tumors with data acquired across multiple international consortia dedicated to pediatric neuro-oncology and clinical trials. The CBTN-CONNECT-DIPGR-ASNR-MICCAI BraTS-PEDs challenge brings together clinicians and AI/imaging scientists to lead to faster development of automated segmentation techniques that could benefit clinical trials, and ultimately the care of children with brain tumors.</description>
