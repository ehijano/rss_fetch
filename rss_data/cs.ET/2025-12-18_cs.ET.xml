      <title>Information-Theoretic Constraints on Variational Quantum Optimization: Efficiency Transitions and the Dynamical Lie Algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms are the leading candidates for near-term quantum advantage, yet their scalability is limited by the ``Barren Plateau'' phenomenon. While traditionally attributed to geometric vanishing gradients, we propose an information-theoretic perspective. Using ancilla-mediated coherent feedback, we demonstrate an empirical constitutive relation $\Delta E \leq \eta I(S:A)$ linking work extraction to mutual information, with quantum entanglement providing a factor-of-2 advantage over classical Landauer bounds. By scaling the system size, we identify a distinct efficiency transition governed by the dimension of the Dynamical Lie Algebra. Systems with polynomial algebraic complexity exhibit sustained positive efficiency, whereas systems with exponential complexity undergo an ``efficiency collapse'' ($\eta \to 0$) at $N \approx 6$ qubits. These results suggest that the trainability boundary in variational algorithms correlates with information-theoretic limits of quantum feedback control.</description>

      <title>BLINDSPOT: Enabling Bystander-Controlled Privacy Signaling for Camera-Enabled Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Camera-equipped mobile devices, such as phones, smart glasses, and AR headsets, pose a privacy challenge for bystanders, who currently lack effective real-time mechanisms to control the capture of their picture, video, including their face. We present BlindSpot, an on-device system that enables bystanders to manage their own privacy by signaling their privacy preferences in real-time without previously sharing any sensitive information. Our main contribution is the design and comparative evaluation of three distinct signaling modalities: a hand gesture mechanism, a significantly improved visible light communication (VLC) protocol, and a novel ultra-wideband (UWB) communication protocol. For all these modalities, we also design a validation mechanism that uses geometric consistency checks to verify the origin of a signal relative to the sending bystander, and defend against impersonation attacks. We implement the complete system (BlindSpot) on a commodity smartphone and conduct a comprehensive evaluation of each modality's accuracy and latency across various distances, lighting conditions, and user movements. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of these novel bystander signaling techniques and their trade-offs in terms of system performance and convenience.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Learning of Attractors for Neuromorphic Computing with Wien Bridge Oscillator Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an oscillatory neuromorphic primitive implemented with networks of coupled Wien bridge oscillators and tunable resistive couplings. Phase relationships between oscillators encode patterns, and a local Hebbian learning rule continuously adapts the couplings, allowing learning and recall to emerge from the same ongoing analog dynamics rather than from separate training and inference phases. Using a Kuramoto-style phase model with an effective energy function, we show that learned phase patterns form attractor states and validate this behavior in simulation and hardware. We further realize a 2-4-2 architecture with a hidden layer of oscillators, whose bipartite visible-hidden coupling allows multiple internal configurations to produce the same visible phase states. When inputs are switched, transient spikes in energy followed by relaxation indicate how the network can reduce surprise by reshaping its energy landscape. These results support coupled oscillator circuits as a hardware platform for energy-based neuromorphic computing with autonomous, continuous learning.</description>

      <title>Practical Challenges in Executing Shor's Algorithm on Existing Quantum Platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15330v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computers pose a fundamental threat to widely deployed public-key cryptosystems, such as RSA and ECC, by enabling efficient integer factorization using Shor's algorithm. Theoretical resource estimates suggest that 2048-bit RSA keys could be broken using Shor's algorithm with fewer than a million noisy qubits. Although such machines do not yet exist, the availability of smaller, cloud-accessible quantum processors and open-source implementations of Shor's algorithm raises the question of what key sizes can realistically be factored with today's platforms. In this work, we experimentally investigate Shor's algorithm on several cloud-based quantum computers using publicly available implementations. Our results reveal a substantial gap between the capabilities of current quantum hardware and the requirements for factoring cryptographically relevant integers. In particular, we observe that circuit constructions still need to be highly specific for each modulus, and that machine fidelities are unstable, with high and fluctuating error rates.</description>

      <title>Enigma: Application-Layer Privacy for Quantum Optimization on Untrusted Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13546v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Early Fault-Tolerant (EFT) era is emerging, where modest Quantum Error Correction (QEC) can enable quantum utility before full-scale fault tolerance. Quantum optimization is a leading candidate for early applications, but protecting these workloads is critical since they will run on expensive cloud services where providers could learn sensitive problem details. Experience with classical computing systems has shown that treating security as an afterthought can lead to significant vulnerabilities. Thus, we must address the security implications of quantum computing before widespread adoption. However, current Secure Quantum Computing (SQC) approaches, although theoretically promising, are impractical in the EFT era: blind quantum computing requires large-scale quantum networks, and quantum homomorphic encryption depends on full QEC.
  We propose application-specific SQC, a principle that applies obfuscation at the application layer to enable practical deployment while remaining agnostic to algorithms, computing models, and hardware architectures. We present Enigma, the first realization of this principle for quantum optimization. Enigma integrates three complementary obfuscations: ValueGuard scrambles coefficients, StructureCamouflage inserts decoys, and TopologyTrimmer prunes variables. These techniques guarantee recovery of original solutions, and their stochastic nature resists repository-matching attacks. Evaluated against seven state-of-the-art AI models across five representative graph families, even combined adversaries, under a conservatively strong attacker model, identify the correct problem within their top five guesses in only 4.4% of cases. The protections come at the cost of problem size and T-gate counts increasing by averages of 1.07x and 1.13x, respectively, with both obfuscation and decoding completing within seconds for large-scale problems.</description>

      <title>Large Language Model-Based Intelligent Antenna Design System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18271v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Antenna simulation typically involves modeling and optimization, which are time-consuming and labor-intensive, slowing down antenna analysis and design. This paper presents a prototype of a large language model (LLM)-based antenna design system (LADS) to assist in antenna simulation. LADS generates antenna models with textual descriptions and images extracted from academic papers, patents, and technical reports (either one or multiple), and it interacts with engineers to iteratively refine the designs. After that, LADS configures and runs an optimizer to meet the design specifications. The effectiveness of LADS is demonstrated by a monopole slotted antenna generated from images and descriptions from the literature. To improve gain stability across the 3.1-10.6 GHz ultra-wide band, LADS modifies the cross-slot into an H-slot and changes substrate material, followed by parameter optimization. As a result, the gain variation is reduced while maintaining the same gain level. The LLM-enabled antenna modeling (LEAM) is available at: https://github.com/TaoWu974/LEAM.</description>

      <title>Embodied Co-Design for Rapidly Evolving Agents: Taxonomy, Frontiers, and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04770v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Brain-body co-evolution enables animals to develop complex behaviors in their environments. Inspired by this biological synergy, embodied co-design (ECD) has emerged as a transformative paradigm for creating intelligent agents-from virtual creatures to physical robots-by jointly optimizing their morphologies and controllers rather than treating control in isolation. This integrated approach facilitates richer environmental interactions and robust task performance. In this survey, we provide a systematic overview of recent advances in ECD. We first formalize the concept of ECD and position it within related fields. We then introduce a hierarchical taxonomy: a lower layer that breaks down agent design into three fundamental components-controlling brain, body morphology, and task environment-and an upper layer that integrates these components into four major ECD frameworks: bi-level, single-level, generative, and open-ended. This taxonomy allows us to synthesize insights from more than one hundred recent studies. We further review notable benchmarks, datasets, and applications in both simulated and real-world scenarios. Finally, we identify significant challenges and offer insights into promising future research directions. A project associated with this survey has been created at https://github.com/Yuxing-Wang-THU/SurveyBrainBody.</description>
