      <title>Study on Frustrated Quantum Phase Transition Achievable by Quantum Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computers, with parallel computing and entanglement effects, excel in cryptography analysis and big data processing. However, they are not fully developed yet, and their performance needs further evaluation. Traditional computer data, especially in simulating quantum phase transitions, are still needed for reference. Two-dimensional frustrated lattice systems can be chosen for studying quantum phase transitions. Currently, significant progress has been made in the study of frustrated square and triangular lattices using traditional computers, while research on hexagonal lattices is limited. This paper consists of four parts. The first part introduces the background of quantum computers and the concept of quantum phase transitions, with the selection of order parameters in hexagonal lattices. The second part elaborates the ideas of the quantum Monte Carlo algorithm. The third part presents numerical simulations, exploring the impact of different transverse magnetic fields on order parameters under low-temperature conditions and showcasing results for various lattice sizes. The fourth part summarizes and looks ahead, comparing the results with those of square and triangular lattices as well as relevant theoretical analyses.</description>

      <title>Fast gradient-free optimization of excitations in variational quantum eigensolvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce ExcitationSolve, a fast globally-informed gradient-free optimizer for physically-motivated ans\"atze constructed of excitation operators, a common choice in variational quantum eigensolvers. ExcitationSolve is to be classified as an extension of quantum-aware and hyperparameter-free optimizers such as Rotosolve, from parameterized unitaries with generators $G$ of the form $G^2=I$, e.g., rotations, to the more general class of $G^3=G$ exhibited by the physically-inspired excitation operators such as in the unitary coupled cluster approach. ExcitationSolve is capable of finding the global optimum along each variational parameter using the same quantum resources that gradient-based optimizers require for a single update step. We provide optimization strategies for both fixed- and adaptive variational ans\"atze, as well as a multi-parameter generalization for the simultaneous selection and optimization of multiple excitation operators. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of ExcitationSolve by conducting electronic ground state energy calculations of molecular systems and thereby outperforming state-of-the-art optimizers commonly employed in variational quantum algorithms. Across all tested molecules in their equilibrium geometry, ExcitationSolve remarkably reaches chemical accuracy in a single sweep over the parameters of a fixed ansatz. This sweep requires only the quantum circuit executions of one gradient descent step. In addition, ExcitationSolve achieves adaptive ans\"atze consisting of fewer operators than in the gradient-based adaptive approach, hence decreasing the circuit execution time.</description>

      <title>Scaling of Computational Order Parameters in Rydberg Atom Graph States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph states are computationally powerful quantum states with many applications including use as resource states for measurement-based quantum computing (MBQC). We demonstrate construction of graph states on a Rydberg atom quantum analogue simulator. We show how an always-on interaction can be used to simultaneously entangle all Rydberg atoms into a graph state. We construct and implement many-body computational order parameters for graph states using non-local measurement-based logic operations in the Clifford group. The order parameters measure the efficacy of entanglement to allow MBQC on graph states of any size. We parameterize finite-size scaling of these order parameters. Our results define a route to efficiently build and test computational order in quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Resource-efficient context-aware dynamical decoupling embedding for arbitrary large-scale quantum algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and implement GraphDD: an efficient method for real-time, circuit-specific, optimal embedding of dynamical decoupling (DD) into executable quantum algorithms. We demonstrate that for an arbitrary quantum circuit, GraphDD exactly refocuses both quasi-static single-qubit dephasing and crosstalk idling errors over the entire circuit, while using a minimal number of additional single-qubit gates embedded into idle periods. The method relies on a graph representation of the embedding problem, where the optimal decoupling sequence can be efficiently calculated using an algebraic computation that scales linearly with the number of idles. This allows optimal DD to be embedded during circuit compilation, without any calibration overhead, additional circuit execution, or numerical optimization. The method is generic and applicable to any arbitrary circuit; in compiler runtime the specific pulse-sequence solutions are tailored to the individual circuit, and consider a range of contextual information on circuit structure and device connectivity. We verify the ability of GraphDD to deliver enhanced circuit-level error suppression on 127-qubit IBM devices, showing that the optimal circuit-specific DD embedding resulting from GraphDD provides orders of magnitude improvements to measured circuit fidelities compared with standard embedding approaches available in Qiskit.</description>

      <title>Approximate second laws and energy extraction from quantum batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conservation of energy under thermal operations, \textbf{TO}, is ensured by commutation of the unitary generating such operations with the total Hamiltonian. However in realistic scenarios, perturbations or disturbances in the system are unavoidable, which in turn may alter the commutation relation and hence in succession may affect the physical processes governed by \textbf{TO}. We call the altered set of operations as approximate thermal operations, \textbf{TO}$_\epsilon$, where $\epsilon$ denotes a degree of disturbance. We provide state transformation conditions under such operations, providing what can be referred to as approximate second laws. We show that in presence of feeble perturbations in the system's Hamiltonian, the states transform in such a way that diagonal elements of the system states start talking not only with each other but also with the off-diagonal elements. In parallel, the off-diagonal elements transform in a way such that they start connecting with diagonal elements and other off-diagonal elements. Such cross-talk is disallowed in the unperturbed second laws. As an application, we show that approximate thermal operations may lead to finite ergotropy extraction from quantum batteries, something that the exact ones are unable to.</description>

      <title>Optimal Distillation of Coherent States with Phase-Insensitive Operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By combining multiple copies of noisy coherent states of light (or other bosonic systems), it is possible to obtain a single mode in a state with lesser noise, a process known as distillation or purification of coherent states. We investigate the distillation of coherent states from coherent thermal states under general phase-insensitive operations, and find a distillation protocol that is optimal in the asymptotic regime, i.e., when the number of input copies is much greater than 1. Remarkably, we find that in this regime, the error -- as quantified by infidelity (one minus the fidelity) of the output state with the desired coherent state -- is proportional to the inverse of the purity of coherence of the input state, a quantity obtained from the Right-Logarithmic-Derivative (RLD) Fisher information metric, hence revealing an operational interpretation of this quantity. The heart of this protocol is a phase-insensitive channel that optimally converts an input coherent thermal state with high amplitude, into an output with significantly lower amplitude and temperature. Under this channel, the purity of coherence remains asymptotically conserved. While both the input and desired output are Gaussian states, we find that the optimal protocol cannot be a Gaussian channel. Among Gaussian phase-insensitive channels, the optimal distillation protocol is a simple linear optical scheme that can be implemented with beam splitters.</description>

      <title>Transmon qubit modeling and characterization for Dark Matter search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents the design, simulation, and experimental characterization of a superconducting transmon qubit circuit prototype for potential applications in dark matter detection experiments. We describe a planar circuit design featuring two non-interacting transmon qubits, one with fixed frequency and the other flux tunable. Finite-element simulations were employed to extract key Hamiltonian parameters and optimize component geometries. The qubit was fabricated and then characterized at $20$ mK, allowing for a comparison between simulated and measured qubit parameters. Good agreement was found for transition frequencies and anharmonicities (within 1\% and 10\% respectively) while coupling strengths exhibited larger discrepancies (30\%). We discuss potential causes for measured coherence times falling below expectations ($T_1\sim\,$1-2 \textmu s) and propose strategies for future design improvements. Notably, we demonstrate the application of a hybrid 3D-2D simulation approach for energy participation ratio evaluation, yielding a more accurate estimation of dielectric losses. This work represents an important first step in developing planar Quantum Non-Demolition (QND) single-photon counters for dark matter searches, particularly for axion and dark photon detection schemes.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Dissipative State Preparation with Adaptive Open Quantum Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A wide variety of dissipative state preparation schemes suffer from a basic time-entanglement tradeoff: the more entangled the steady state, the slower the relaxation to the steady state. Here, we show how a minimal kind of adaptive dynamics can be used to completely circumvent this tradeoff, and allow the dissipative stabilization of maximally entangled states with a finite time-scale. Our approach takes inspiration from simple fermionic stabilization schemes, which surprisingly are immune to entanglement-induced slowdown. We describe schemes for accelerated stabilization of many-body entangled qubit states (including spin squeezed states), both in the form of discretized Floquet circuits, as well as continuous time dissipative dynamics. Our ideas are compatible with a number of experimental platforms.</description>

      <title>Peephole Optimization for Quantum Approximate Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Peephole optimization of quantum circuits provides a method of leveraging standard circuit synthesis approaches into scalable quantum circuit optimization. One application of this technique partitions an entire circuit into a series of peepholes and produces multiple approximations of each partitioned subcircuit. A single approximation of each subcircuit is then selected to form optimized result circuits. We propose a series of improvements to the final phase of this architecture, which include the addition of error awareness and a better method of approximating the correctness of the result. We evaluated these proposed improvements on a set of benchmark circuits using the IBMQ FakeWashington simulator. The results demonstrate that our best-performing method provides an average reduction in Total Variational Distance (TVD) and Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JSD) of 18.2% and 15.8%, respectively, compared with the Qiskit optimizer. This also constitutes an improvement in TVD of 11.4% and JSD of 9.0% over existing solutions.</description>

      <title>Steady-State Statistics of Classical Nonlinear Dynamical Systems from Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical nonlinear dynamical systems are often characterized by their steady-state probability distribution functions (PDFs). Typically, PDFs are accumulated from numerical simulations that involve solving the underlying dynamical equations of motion using integration techniques. An alternative procedure, direct statistical simulation (DSS), solves for the statistics directly. One approach to DSS is the Fokker-Planck Equation (FPE), which can be used to find the PDF of classical dynamical systems. Here, we investigate the utility of Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers to find steady-state solutions to the FPE. We employ the Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) and the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) algorithms to find the zero-mode of the FPE for one-dimensional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck problems enabling comparison with exact solutions. The quantum computed steady-state probability distribution functions (PDFs) are demonstrated to be in reasonable agreement with the classically computed PDFs. We conclude with a discussion of potential extensions to higher-dimensional dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Photonic bands and normal mode splitting in optical lattices interacting with cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong collective interaction of atoms with an optical cavity causes normal mode splitting of the cavity's resonances, whose width is given by the collective coupling strength. At low optical density of the atomic cloud the intensity distribution of light in the cavity is ruled by the cavity's mode function, which is solely determined by its geometry. In this regime the dynamics of the coupled atom-cavity system is conveniently described by the open Dicke model, which we apply to calculating normal mode splitting generated by periodically ordered clouds in linear and ring cavities. We also show how to use normal mode splitting as witness for Wannier-Bloch oscillations in the tight-binding limit. At high optical density the atomic distribution contributes to shaping the mode function. This regime escapes the open Dicke model, but can be treated by a transfer matrix model provided the saturation parameter is low. Applying this latter model to an atomic cloud periodically ordered into a one-dimensional lattice, we observe the formation of photonic bands gaps competing with the normal mode splitting. We discuss the limitations of both models and point out possible pathways to generalized theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If the standard 1D quantum infinite potential well initially in its ground state suffers a sudden expansion, it turns out that in the evolution of the system they may appear plateaux of probability for some fractional times, as noticed by C. Aslangul in 2008. We introduce a mathematical framework to explain this phenomenon. Remarkably, the characterization of these plateaux depends on nontrivial number theoretical considerations.</description>

      <title>Information geometry approach to quantum stochastic thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements have revealed new links between information geometry and classical stochastic thermodynamics, particularly through the Fisher information (FI) with respect to time. Recognizing the non-uniqueness of the quantum Fisher metric in Hilbert space, we exploit the fact that any quantum Fisher information (QFI) can be decomposed into a metric-independent incoherent part and a metric-dependent coherent contribution. We demonstrate that the incoherent component of any QFI can be directly linked to entropic acceleration, and for GKSL dynamics with local detailed balance, to the rate of change of generalized thermodynamic forces and entropic flow, paralleling the classical results. Furthermore, we show that the classical uncertainty relation between the geometric uncertainty of a path in state space and the time-integrated rate of information change also holds for quantum systems. We generalise a classical geometric bound on the entropy rate for far-from-equilibrium processes by incorporating a non-negative quantum contribution that arises from the geometric action due to coherent dynamics. Finally, we apply an information-geometric analysis to the recently proposed quantum-thermodynamic Mpemba effect, demonstrating this framework's ability to capture thermodynamic phenomena.</description>

      <title>Efficiently catching entangled microwave photons from a quantum transducer with shaped optical pumps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum transducer, when working as a microwave and optical entanglement generator, provides a practical way of coherently connecting optical communication channels and microwave quantum processors. The recent experiments on quantum transducer verifying entanglement between microwave and optical photons show the promise of approaching that goal. While flying optical photons can be efficiently controlled or detected, the microwave photon needs to be stored in a cavity or converted to the excitation of superconducting qubit for further quantum operations. However, to efficiently capture or detect a single microwave photon with arbitrary time profile remains challenging. This work focuses on this challenge in the setting of entanglement-based quantum transducer and proposes a solution by shaping the optical pump pulse. By Schmidt decomposing the output entangled state, we show the microwave-optical photon pair takes a specific temporal profile that is controlled by the optical pump. The microwave photon from the transducer can be absorbed near perfectly by a receiving cavity with tunable coupling and is ready to be converted to the excitation of superconducting qubits, enabling further quantum operations.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocal tripartite entanglement and asymmetric Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering via directional quantum squeezing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generation and manipulation of multipartite entanglement and EPR steering in macroscopic systems not only play a fundamental role in exploring the nature of quantum mechanics, but are also at the core of current developments of various nascent quantum technologies. Here we report a theoretical method using directional injection of quantum squeezing to produce nonreciprocal multipartite entanglement and EPR steering in a three-mode optomechanical system with closed-loop coupling. We show that by directionally applying a two-photon parametric driving field with a phase-matched squeezed vacuum reservoir to an optomechanical resonator, a squeezed optical mode can be introduced for one of its input directions, thereby yielding an asymmetric enhancement of optomechanical interaction and the time-reversal symmetry breaking of the system. Based on this feature, it is found that bipartite and tripartite entanglement and the associated EPR steering of the subsystems can only be generated when the coherent driving field input from the squeezing injection direction, namely, achieving nonreciprocity in such quantum correlations. More excitingly, it is also found that by properly adjusting the squeezing parameter, the overall asymmetry of EPR steering can be stepwise driven from no-way regime, one-way regime to two-way regime. These findings, holding promise for preparing rich types of entangled quantum resources with nonreciprocal correlations, may have potential applications in the area of quantum information processing such as quantum secure direct communication and one-way quantum computing.</description>

Abstract: We present an electrically-driven scheme for spin-photon quantum interfaces used in quantum networks. Through modulating the motion of a nano cantilever with voltages, optomechanical coupling and spin-mechanical coupling can be exponentially enhanced simultaneously. Numerical simulations show that by applying well-designed voltages high-fidelity quantum interface operations such as generation and absorption of a single-photon with a known wave packet are within the reach of current techniques.</description>

      <title>Comparing One- and Two-way Quantum Repeater Architectures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum repeaters are an essential building block for realizing long-distance quantum communications. However, due to the fragile nature of quantum information, these repeaters suffer from loss and operational errors. Prior works have classified repeaters into three broad categories based on their use of probabilistic or near-deterministic methods to mitigate these errors. Besides differences in classical communication times, these approaches also vary in technological complexity, with near-deterministic methods requiring more advanced technology. Recent increases in the number of available memories, and introduction of entanglement generation through multiplexing motivate a re-comparison of one-way and two-way repeater architectures. In this work, we propose a novel protocol that optimizes multiplexed elementary link generation and distillation in memory-unconstrained 'connection-oriented' two-way repeaters to boost the entanglement generation rates. We introduce a recursive formulation to derive the probability distribution of the number of Bell pairs in multiplexed two-way repeater architectures, compatible with probabilistic $n$-to-$k$ distillation protocols. We then compare the performance of this new protocol with one-way schemes in the parameter regime where one-way schemes have previously been shown to be advantageous, and find that the multiplexed two-way protocol provides better performance with lower resource and technology requirements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Driven by potential exponential speedups in business, security, and scientific scenarios, interest in quantum computing is surging. This interest feeds the development of quantum computing hardware, but several challenges arise in optimizing application performance for hardware metrics (e.g., qubit coherence and gate fidelity). In this work, we describe a visual analytics approach for analyzing the performance properties of quantum devices and quantum circuit optimization. Our approach allows users to explore spatial and temporal patterns in quantum device performance data and it computes similarities and variances in key performance metrics. Detailed analysis of the error properties characterizing individual qubits is also supported. We also describe a method for visualizing the optimization of quantum circuits. The resulting visualization tool allows researchers to design more efficient quantum algorithms and applications by increasing the interpretability of quantum computations.</description>

      <title>Experimental investigation of coherent ergotropy in a single spin system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ergotropy is defined as the maximum amount of work that can be extracted through a unitary cyclic evolution. It plays a crucial role in assessing the work capacity of a quantum system. Recently, the significance of quantum coherence in work extraction has been theoretically identified, revealing that quantum states with more coherence possess more ergotropy compared to their dephased counterparts. However, an experimental study of the coherent ergotropy remains absent. Here, we report an experimental investigation of the coherent ergotropy in a single spin system. Based on the method of measuring ergotropy with an ancilla qubit, both the coherent and incoherent components of the ergotropy for the non-equilibrium state were successfully extracted. The increase in ergotropy induced by the increase in the coherence of the system was observed by varying the coherence of the state. Our work reveals the interplay between quantum thermodynamics and quantum information theory, future investigations could further explore the role other quantum attributes play in thermodynamic protocols.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to process and store information on surrounding nuclear spins is a major requirement for group-IV color center-based repeater nodes. We demonstrate coherent control of a ${}^{13}$C nuclear spin strongly coupled to a negatively charged germanium-vacancy center in diamond with coherence times beyond 2.5s at mK temperatures, which is the longest reported for group-IV defects. Detailed analysis allows us to model the system's dynamics, extract the coupling parameters, and characterize noise. We estimate an achievable memory time of 18.1s with heating limitations considered, paving the way to successful applications as a quantum repeater node.</description>

      <title>The Black-Box Simulation Barrier Persists in a Fully Quantum World</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zero-Knowledge (ZK) protocols have been intensely studied due to their fundamental importance and versatility. However, quantum information's inherent differences significantly alter the landscape, necessitating a re-examination of ZK designs.
  A crucial aspect is round complexity, linked to $\textit{simulation}$, which forms the foundation of ZK definition and security proofs. In the $\textit{post-quantum}$ setting, where honest parties and channels are classical but adversaries quantum, Chia et al. [FOCS'21] showed constant-round $\textit{black-box-simulatable}$ ZK arguments (BBZK) for $\mathbf{NP}$ are impossible unless $\mathbf{NP} \subseteq \mathbf{BQP}$. But this problem remains open when all parties and communication are quantum.
  Indeed, this problem interests the broader theory of quantum computing. Investigating how quantum power alters tasks like the $\textit{unconditional}$ security of QKD and incorporating OT in MiniQCrypt has been crucial. Moreover, quantum communication has enabled round compression for commitments and interactive arguments. Along this line, understanding if quantum computing could fundamentally change ZK protocols is vital.
  We resolved this problem by proving that only languages in $\mathbf{BQP}$ admit constant-round $\textit{fully-quantum}$ BBZK. This result holds significant implications. Firstly, it illuminates the nature of quantum zero-knowledge and provides valuable insights for designing future protocols in the quantum realm. Secondly, it relates ZK round complexity with the intriguing problem of $\mathbf{BQP}$ vs $\mathbf{QMA}$, which is out of the reach of previous analogue impossibility results in the classical or post-quantum setting. Lastly, it justifies the need for the $\textit{non-black-box}$ simulation techniques or the relaxed security notions employed in existing constant-round fully-quantum BBZK protocols.</description>

      <title>Tailoring the light-matter interaction for high-fidelity holonomic gate operations in multiple systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Realization of quantum computing requires the development of high-fidelity quantum gates that are resilient to decoherence, control errors, and environmental noise. While non-adiabatic holonomic quantum computation (NHQC) offers a promising approach, it often necessitates system-specific adjustments. This work presents a versatile scheme for implementing NHQC gates across multiple qubit systems by optimizing multiple degrees of freedom using a genetic algorithm. The scheme is applied to three qubit systems: ensemble rare-earth ion (REI) qubits, single REI qubits, and superconducting transmon qubits. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the optimized gate operations are robust against frequency detuning and induce low off-resonant excitations, making the scheme effective for advancing fault-tolerant quantum computation across various platforms.</description>

      <title>Steady-state entanglement scaling in open quantum systems: A comparison between several master equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the scaling of the fermionic logarithmic negativity (FLN) between complementary intervals in the steady state of a driven-dissipative tight-binding critical chain, coupled to two thermal reservoirs at its edges. We compare the predictions of three different master equations, namely a nonlocal Lindblad equation, the Redfield equation, and the recently proposed universal Lindblad equation (ULE). Within the nonlocal Lindblad equation approach, the FLN grows logarithmically with the subsystem size $\ell$, for any value of the system-bath coupling and of the bath parameters. This is consistent with the logarithmic scaling of the mutual information analytically demonstrated in [Phys. Rev. B 106, 235149 (2022)]. In the ultraweak-coupling regime, the Redfield equation and the ULE exhibit the same logarithmic increase; such behavior holds even when moving to moderately weak coupling and intermediate values of $\ell$. However, when venturing beyond this regime, the FLN crosses over to superlogarithmic scaling for both equations.</description>

      <title>An Empirical Analysis on the Effectiveness of the Variational Quantum Linear Solver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) have emerged as promising methods for tackling complex problems on near-term quantum devices. Among these algorithms, the Variational Quantum Linear Solver (VQLS) addresses linear systems of the form $Ax=b$, aiming to prepare a quantum state $|x\rangle$ such that $A|x\rangle$ is proportional to the quantum state corresponding to $b$. A key advantage of VQLS is its use of amplitude encoding, which requires a number of qubits that scales logarithmically with the linear system size. However, the existing literature has primarily focused on linear systems of limited size or with a specific structure. In this study, we extend the application of VQLS to more general and larger problem instances, including problems where state preparation is non-trivial and problems within the real domain of fluid dynamics. Our investigation reveals some critical challenges inherent to VQLS, including the need for a sufficiently expressive ansatz, the large number of circuit executions required to estimate the cost function, and the high gate count in the circuits in the most general setting. Our analysis highlights the obstacles that need to be addressed for a broader application of VQLS and concludes that further research is necessary to fully leverage the algorithm's capabilities in addressing real-world problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computers are promising tools for the simulation of many-body systems, and among those, QCD stands out by its rich phenomenology. Every simulation starts with a codification, and here we succently review a newly developed compact encoding based on the identification between registers and particles; the quantum memory is divided into registers, and to each we associate a Hilbert space of dimension the number of degrees of freedom of the codified particles. In this way we gain an exponential compression over direct encodings for a low number of particles with many degrees of freedom. As an example we apply this encoding on a two-register memory and implement antisymmetrization and exponentiation algorithms.</description>

      <title>Simulating continuous-space systems with quantum-classical wave functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most non-relativistic interacting quantum many-body systems, such as atomic and molecular ensembles or materials, are naturally described in terms of continuous-space Hamiltonians. The simulation of their ground-state properties on digital quantum computers is challenging because current algorithms require discretization, which usually amounts to choosing a finite basis set, inevitably introducing errors. In this work, we propose an alternative, discretization-free approach that combines classical and quantum resources in a global variational ansatz, optimized using the framework of variational Monte Carlo. We introduce both purely quantum as well as hybrid quantum-classical ansatze and benchmark them on three paradigmatic continuous-space systems that are either very challenging or beyond the reach of current quantum approaches: the one-dimensional quantum rotor model, a system of Helium-3 particles in one and two dimensions, and the two-dimensional homogeneous electron gas. We embed relevant constraints such as the antisymmetry of fermionic wave functions directly into the ansatz. Many-body correlations are introduced via backflow transformations represented by parameterized quantum circuits. We demonstrate that the accuracy of the simulation can be systematically improved by increasing the number of circuit parameters and study the effects of shot noise. Furthermore, we show that the hybrid ansatz improves the ground-state energies obtained using the purely classical wave function.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Frequent applications of a mixing quantum operation to a quantum system slow down its time evolution and eventually drive it into the invariant subspace of the named operation. We prove this phenomenon, the quantum Zeno effect, and its continuous variant, strong damping, in a unified way for infinite-dimensional open quantum systems, while merely demanding that the respective mixing convergence holds pointwise for all states. Both results are quantitative in the following sense: Given the speed of convergence for the mixing limits, we can derive bounds on the convergence speed for the corresponding quantum Zeno and strong damping limits. We apply our results to prove quantum Zeno and strong damping limits for the photon loss channel with an explicit bound on the convergence speed.</description>

Abstract: The transition from unitary, reversible von Neumann-Everett quantum processes to non-unitary, irreversible processes and measurements is explored through infinite tensor products interpreted as nested, chained, or iterated Wigner's friend scenarios. Infinite tensor products can disrupt unitary equivalence through sectorization and factorization, drawing parallels to concepts from real analysis, recursive mathematics, and statistical physics.</description>

      <title>Relational Dynamics with Periodic Clocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss a systematic way in which a relational dynamics can be established relative to periodic clocks both in the classical and quantum theories, emphasising the parallels between them. We show that: (1) classical and quantum relational observables that encode the value of a quantity relative to a periodic clock are only invariant along the gauge orbits generated by the Hamiltonian constraint if the quantity itself is periodic, and otherwise the observables are only transiently invariant per clock cycle (this implies, in particular, that counting winding numbers does not lead to invariant observables relative to the periodic clock); (2) the quantum relational observables can be obtained from a partial group averaging procedure over a single clock cycle; (3) there is an equivalence ('trinity') between the quantum theories based on the quantum relational observables of the clock-neutral picture of Dirac quantisation, the relational Schr\"odinger picture of the Page-Wootters formalism, and the relational Heisenberg picture that follows from quantum deparametrisation, all three taken relative to periodic clocks (implying that the dynamics in all three is necessarily periodic); (4) in the context of periodic clocks, the original Page-Wootters definition of conditional probabilities fails for systems that have a continuous energy spectrum and, using the equivalence between the Page-Wootters and the clock-neutral, gauge-invariant formalism, must be suitably updated. Finally, we show how a system evolving periodically with respect to a periodic clock can evolve monotonically with respect to an aperiodic clock, without inconsistency. The presentation is illustrated by several examples, and we conclude with a brief comparison to other approaches in the literature that also deal with relational descriptions of periodic clocks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and explore the notion of texture of an arbitrary quantum state, in a selected basis. In the first part of this work we develop a resource theory and show that state texture is adequately described by an easily computable monotone, which is also directly measurable. It is shown that textures are useful in the characterization of unknown quantum gates in universal circuit layers. By using randomized input states and recording the textures of the output qubits we are able to fully characterize the circuit layer, whenever it contains at least one CNOT gate. This can be done without the need of tomographic protocols and the use of ancillary systems.</description>

Abstract: The integration of coherent emitters into low-loss photonic circuits is a key technology for quantum networking. In this context, nanophotonic silicon devices implanted with erbium are a promising hardware platform that combines advanced wafer-scale nanofabrication technology with coherent emission in the minimal-loss band of optical fibers. Recent studies have reported two distinct sites in the silicon lattice in which erbium can be reproducibly integrated with particularly promising properties. Here, for an in-depth analysis of these sites, resonant fluorescence spectroscopy is performed on a nanophotonic waveguide in magnetic fields applied along different orientations. In this way, the site symmetry is determined, the spin Hamiltonian is reconstructed and a partial fit of the crystal field Hamiltonian is performed. The obtained quantitative description of the magnetic interaction allows the optimization of Zeeman splittings, optical branching ratios or microwave driving to the needs of future experiments. Beyond that, the derived site symmetry constrains the location of the erbium dopant in the silicon unit cell. This is a key step towards a detailed microscopic understanding of the erbium sites, which may help to improve the integration yield, thus paving the way to efficient nanophotonic quantum memories based on the Er:Si platform.</description>

      <title>Deterministic generation of a 20-qubit two-dimensional photonic cluster state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multidimensional cluster states are a key resource for robust quantum communication, measurement-based quantum computing and quantum metrology. Here, we present a device capable of emitting large-scale entangled microwave photonic states in a two dimensional ladder structure. The device consists of a pair of coupled superconducting transmon qubits which are each tuneably coupled to a common output waveguide. This architecture permits entanglement between each transmon and a deterministically emitted photonic qubit. By interleaving two-qubit gates with controlled photon emission, we generate 2 x n grids of time- and frequency-multiplexed cluster states of itinerant microwave photons. We measure a signature of localizable entanglement across up to 20 photonic qubits. We expect the device architecture to be capable of generating a wide range of other tensor network states such as tree graph states, repeater states or the ground state of the toric code, and to be readily scalable to generate larger and higher dimensional states.</description>

      <title>Error Mitigation by Restricted Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Error mitigation techniques, while instrumental in extending the capabilities of near-term quantum computers, often suffer from exponential resource scaling with noise levels. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel approach, constant runtime Error Mitigation by Restricted Evolution (EMRE). Through numerical simulations, we demonstrate that EMRE surpasses the performance of Probabilistic Error Cancellation (PEC) while maintaining constant sample complexity. Moreover, we uncover a continuous family of error mitigation protocols, Hybrid EMREs (HEMREs), encompassing PEC and EMRE as special cases. HEMREs offer a tunable bias parameter, allowing for a trade-off between sample complexity and error reduction. Thus, our error mitigation protocols provide flexibility in balancing error mitigation with computational overhead, catering to practical application requirements of near-term and early-fault tolerant quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Amortized Stabilizer R\'enyi Entropy of Quantum Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unraveling the secrets of how much nonstabilizerness a quantum dynamic can generate is crucial for harnessing the power of magic states, the essential resources for achieving quantum advantage and realizing fault-tolerant quantum computation. In this work, we introduce the amortized $\alpha$-stabilizer R\'enyi entropy, a magic monotone for unitary operations that quantifies the nonstabilizerness generation capability of quantum dynamics. Amortization is key in quantifying the magic of quantum dynamics, as we reveal that nonstabilizerness generation can be enhanced by prior nonstabilizerness in input states when considering the $\alpha$-stabilizer R\'enyi entropy, while this is not the case for robustness of magic or stabilizer extent. We demonstrate the versatility of the amortized $\alpha$-stabilizer R\'enyi entropy in investigating the nonstabilizerness resources of quantum dynamics of computational and fundamental interest. In particular, we establish improved lower bounds on the $T$-count of quantum Fourier transforms and the quantum evolutions of one-dimensional Heisenberg Hamiltonians, showcasing the power of this tool in studying quantum advantages and the corresponding cost in fault-tolerant quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Frequency principle for quantum machine learning via Fourier analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum machine learning is one of the most exciting potential applications of quantum technology. While under intensive studies, the training process of quantum machine learning is relatively ambiguous and its quantum advantages are not very completely explained. Here we investigate the training process of quantum neural networks from the perspective of Fourier analysis. We empirically propose a frequency principle for parameterized quantum circuits that preferentially train frequencies within the primary frequency range of the objective function faster than other frequencies. We elaborate on the frequency principle in a curve fitting problem by initializing the parameterized quantum circuits as low, medium, and high-frequency functions and then observing the convergence behavior of each frequency during training. We further explain the convergence behavior by investigating the evolution of residues with quantum neural tangent kernels. Moreover, the frequency principle is verified with the discrete logarithmic problem for which the quantum advantage is provable. Our work suggests a new avenue for understanding quantum advantage from the training process.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum transduction is essential for future hybrid quantum networks, connecting devices across different spectral ranges. In this regard, molecular modulation in hollow-core fibers has proven to be exceptional for efficient frequency conversion. However, insights on this conversion method for quantum light have remained elusive beyond standard semiclassical models. This Letter introduces a framework to describe the quantum dynamics of both molecules and photons in agreement with recent experiments and capable of unveiling the ability of molecular modulation to preserve entanglement.</description>

      <title>Zero Flux Localization: Magic Revealed</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flat bands correspond to the spatial localization of a quantum particle moving in a field with discrete or continuous translational invariance. The canonical example is the flat Landau levels in a homogeneous magnetic field. Several significant problems -- including flat bands in moir\'e structures -- are related to the problem of a particle moving in an inhomogeneous magnetic field with zero total flux. We demonstrate that while perfectly flat bands in such cases are impossible, the introduction of a "non-Abelian component" -- a spin field with zero total curvature -- can lead to perfect localization. Several exactly solvable models are constructed: (i) a half-space up/down field with a sharp 1D boundary; (ii) an alternating up/down field periodic in one direction on a cylinder; and (iii) a doubly periodic alternating field on a torus. The exact solution on the torus is expressed in terms of elliptic functions. It is shown that flat bands are only possible for certain magic values of the field corresponding to a quantized flux through an individual tile. These exact solutions clarify the simple structure underlying flat bands in moir\'e materials and provide a springboard for constructing a novel class of fractional quantum Hall states.</description>

      <title>Multichannel, ultra-wideband Rydberg Electrometry with an Optical Frequency Comb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While Rydberg atoms have shown tremendous potential to serve as accurate and sensitive detectors of microwaves and millimeter waves, their response is generally limited to a single narrow frequency band around a chosen microwave transition. As a result, their potential to serve as agile and wideband electromagnetic receivers has not been fully realized. Here we demonstrate the use of a mid-infrared, frequency agile optical frequency comb as the coupling laser for three-photon Rydberg atom electrometry. This approach allows us to simultaneously prepare as many as seven individual Rydberg states, allowing for multichannel detection across a frequency range from 1 GHz to 40 GHz. The generality and flexibility of this method for wideband multiplexing is anticipated to have transformative effects in the field of Rydberg electrometry, paving the way for advanced information coding and arbitrary signal detection.</description>

      <title>Tantalum thin films sputtered on silicon and on different seed layers: material characterization and coplanar waveguide resonator performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06041v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconducting qubits are a promising platform for large-scale quantum computing. Besides the Josephson junction, most parts of a superconducting qubit are made of planar, patterned superconducting thin films. In the past, most qubit architectures have relied on niobium (Nb) as the material of choice for the superconducting layer. However, there is also a variety of alternative materials with potentially less losses, which may thereby result in increased qubit performance. One such material is tantalum (Ta), for which high-performance qubit components have already been demonstrated. In this study, we report the sputter-deposition of Ta thin films directly on heated and unheated silicon (Si) substrates as well as onto different, nanometer-thin seed layers from tantalum nitride (TaN), titanium nitride (TiN) or aluminum nitride (AlN) that were deposited first. The thin films are characterized in terms of surface morphology, crystal structure, phase composition, critical temperature, residual resistance ratio (RRR) and RF-performance. We obtain thin films indicative of pure alpha-Ta for high temperature (600{\deg}C) sputtering directly on silicon and for Ta deposited on TaN or TiN seed layers. Coplanar waveguide (CPW) resonator measurements show that the Ta deposited directly on the heated silicon substrate performs best with internal quality factors $Q_i$ reaching 1 x $10^6$ in the single-photon regime, measured at $T=100 {\space \rm mK}$.</description>

      <title>Effect of noise on quantum circuit realization of non-Hermitian time crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian quantum dynamics lie in an intermediate regime between unitary Hamiltonian dynamics and trace-preserving non-unitary open quantum system dynamics. Given differences in the noise tolerance of unitary and non-unitary dynamics, it is interesting to consider implementing non-Hermitian dynamics on a noisy quantum computer. In this paper, we do so for a non-Hermitian Ising Floquet model whose many-body dynamics gives rise to persistent temporal oscillations, a form of time crystallinity. In the simplest two qubit case that we consider, there is an infinitely long-lived periodic steady state at certain fine-tuned points. These oscillations remain reasonably long-lived over a range of parameters in the ideal non-Hermitean dynamics and for the levels of noise and imperfection expected of modern day quantum devices. Using a generalized Floquet analysis, we show that infinitely long-lived oscillations are generically lost for arbitrarily weak values of common types of noise and compute corresponding damping rate. We perform simulations using IBM's Qiskit platform to confirm our findings; however, experiments on a real device (ibmq-lima) do not show remnants of these oscillations.</description>

      <title>Cooperative dynamic polaronic picture of diamond color centers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polarons can control carrier mobility and can also be used in the design of quantum devices. Although much effort has been directed into investigating the nature of polarons, observation of defect-related polarons is challenging due to electron-defect scattering. Here we explore the polaronic behavior of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in a diamond crystal using an ultrafast pump-probe technique. A 10-fs optical pulse acts as a source of high electric field exceeding the dielectric breakdown threshold, in turn exerting a force on the NV charge distribution and polar optical phonons. The electronic and phononic responses are enhanced by an order of magnitude for a low density of NV centers, which we attribute to a combination of cooperative polaronic effects and scattering by defects. First-principles calculations support the presence of dipolar Fr\"ohlich interaction via non-zero Born effective charges. Our findings provide insights into the physics of color centers in diamonds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a comprehensive analysis of recent results in the context of measurement-induced phase transitions (MIPT) in quantum systems, with a particular focus on hybrid quantum circuits as a model system in one dimension. Our analysis shows how varying the rate of projective measurements can induce phase transitions, resulting in abrupt changes in the properties of the entanglement. Through mappings to classical statistical models and the application of replica field theory techniques, we investigate the interplay between unitary evolution and measurement processes. Starting from a low entangled state, we identify three regimes characterized by different dynamics of bipartite entanglement entropies for a portion of the system: high-rate measurements leading to rapid entanglement saturation (area law), low-rate measurements allowing linear entanglement growth (up to volume law), and a critical rate at which entanglement grows logarithmically. As a complementary subject, we explore the non-local effects of local measurements by examining the field theory of critical ground states in Tomonaga-Luttinger liquids.</description>

      <title>Photoactivation of color centers induced by laser irradiation in ion-implanted diamond</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Split-vacancy color centers in diamond are promising solid state platforms for the implementation of photonic quantum technologies. These luminescent defects are commonly fabricated upon low energy ion implantation and subsequent thermal annealing. Their technological uptake will require the availability of reliable methods for the controlled, large scale production of localized individual photon emitters. This task is partially achieved by controlled ion implantation to introduce selected impurities in the host material, and requires the development of challenging beam focusing or collimation procedures coupled with single-ion detection techniques. We report on protocol for the direct optical activation of split-vacancy color centers in diamond via localized processing with continuous wave laser at mW optical powers. We demonstrate the activation of photoluminescent Mg- and Sn-related centers at both the ensemble and single-photon emitter level in ion-implanted, high-purity diamond crystals without further thermal processing. The proposed lithographic method enables the activation of individual color centers at specific positions of a large area sample by means of a relatively inexpensive equipment offering the real-time, in situ monitoring of the process.</description>

      <title>Shortcuts to adiabaticity in open quantum critical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06387v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study shortcuts to adiabaticity (STA) through counterdiabatic driving in quantum critical systems, in the presence of dissipation. We evaluate unitary as well as non-unitary controls, such that the system density matrix follows a prescribed trajectory corresponding to the eigenstates of a time-dependent reference Hamiltonian, at any instant of time. The strength of the dissipator control term for the low energy states show universal scaling close to criticality. Using the example of the transverse-field Ising model, we show that in contrast to STA in closed quantum critical systems, here STA may require multi-body interactions terms, even away from criticality, owing to change in entropy of the time-dependent target state. Further, the associated heat current shows extremum, while power dissipated changes curvature, close to criticality, and analogous to unitary control, no operational cost is associated with implementation of the exact counterdiabatic Hamiltonian. We expect the counterdiabatic protocol studied here can be of fundamental importance for understanding STA in many-body open quantum systems, and can be highly relevant for varied topics involving open many-body quantum systems, such as quantum computation and many-body quantum heat engines.</description>

      <title>Thermalization is typical in large classical and quantum harmonic systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish an analytical criterion for dynamical thermalization within harmonic systems, applicable to both classical and quantum models. Specifically, we prove that thermalization of various observables, such as particle energies in physically relevant random quadratic Hamiltonians, is typical for large systems ($N \gg 1$) with initial conditions drawn from the microcanonical distribution. Moreover, we show that thermalization can also arise from non-typical initial conditions, where only a finite fraction of the normal modes is excited. Our findings provide a general dynamical basis for an approach to thermalization that bypasses chaos and ergodicity, focusing instead on observables dependent on a large number of normal modes, and build a bridge between the classical and quantum theories of thermalization.</description>

Abstract: Science is founded on the benchmarking of theoretical models against experimental measurements, with the challenge that for all but the simplest systems, the calculations required for high precision become extremely challenging. $\mathrm{H}_2^+$ is the simplest stable molecule, and its internal structure is calculable to high precision from first principles. This allows tests of theoretical models and the determination of fundamental constants. However, studying $\mathrm{H}_2^+$ experimentally presents significant challenges. Standard control methods such as laser cooling, fluorescence detection and optical pumping are not applicable to $\mathrm{H}_2^+$ due to the very long lifetimes of its excited rotational and vibrational states. Here we solve this issue by using Quantum Logic Spectroscopy techniques to demonstrate full quantum control of a single $\mathrm{H}_2^+$ molecule by co-trapping it with an atomic 'helper' ion and performing quantum operations between the two ions. This enables us to perform pure quantum state preparation, coherent control and non-destructive readout, which we use to perform high-resolution microwave spectroscopy of $\mathrm{H}_2^+$. Our results pave the way for high precision spectroscopy of $\mathrm{H}_2^+$ in both the microwave and optical domains, while offering techniques which are transferable to other molecular ions.</description>

      <title>Synthetic fractional flux quanta in a ring of superconducting qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06511v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A ring of capacitively-coupled transmons threaded by a synthetic magnetic field is studied as a realization of a strongly interacting bosonic system. The synthetic flux is imparted through a specific Floquet modulation scheme based on a suitable periodic sequence of Lorentzian pulses that are known as `Levitons'. Such scheme has the advantage to preserve the translation invariance of the system and to work at the qubits sweet spots. We employ this system to demonstrate the concept of fractional values of flux quanta. Although such fractionalization phenomenon was originally predicted for bright solitons in cold atoms, it may be in fact challenging to access with that platform. Here, we show how fractional flux quanta can be read-out in the absorption spectrum of a suitable 'scattering experiment' in which the qubit ring is driven by microwaves.</description>

      <title>Imaginary-time Mpemba effect in quantum many-body systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Various exotic phenomena emerge in non-equilibrium quantum many-body systems. The Mpemba effect, denoting the situation where a hot system freezes faster than the colder one, is a counterintuitive non-equilibrium phenomenon that has attracted enduring interest for more than half a century. In this Letter, we report a novel phenomenon of the Mpemba effect in the imaginary-time relaxation dynamics in quantum many-body systems, dubbed as imaginary-time Mpemba effect (ITME). Through numerically exact quantum Monte-Carlo (QMC) simulation, we unambiguously demonstrate that in different classes of interacting quantum models, the initial states with higher energy are relaxed faster than lower-energy initial states in the process of imaginary-time relaxation. The emergence of ITME is intimately associated with the low-energy excitations in quantum many-body systems. More crucially, since imaginary-time dynamics is broadly applied in numerical simulation on the quantum many-body ground states, the discovery of ITME potentially provides a new pathway to expedite the quantum many-body computation, particularly for QMC involving the sign problem.</description>

      <title>Modeling of a continuous superradiant laser on the sub-mHz $^1$S$_0\,\rightarrow\,^3$P$_0$ transition in neutral strontium-88</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06575v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Continuous superradiance using a narrow optical transition has the potential to improve the short-term stability of state-of-the-art optical clocks. Even though pulsed superradiant emission on a mHz linewidth clock transition has been shown, true continuous operation, without Fourier limitation, has turned out to be extremely challenging. The trade-off between maintaining a high atomic flux while minimizing decoherence effects presents a significant obstacle. Here, we discuss the design of a machine that could overcome this problem by combining a high-flux continuous beam of ultra cold strontium atoms with a bowtie cavity for the generation of superradiant lasing. To evaluate the feasibility of our design, we present simulation results for continuous high-efficiency cooling, loading, and pumping to the upper lasing state inside the bowtie cavity. We then present two different models for stimulating the generated superradiant field by taking into account position-dependent shifts, collisional decoherence, light shifts, and atom loss. Finally, we estimate a laser linewidth of less than 100 mHz, limited by atom number fluctuations, and resulting in an output power of hundreds of fW.</description>

      <title>Rovibrational Spectroscopy of Diatomic Molecules in Modified-Morse Potential using Nikiforov-Uvarov Functional Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The radial time-independent Schr\"odinger equation is solved for the diatomic molecules: H2, LiH, HCl, CO, VH, CrH, CuLi, TiC, NiC, and ScN using the recently developed Nikiforov-Uvarov Functional Analysis (NUFA) method. The Modified-Morse potential is considered and the Pekeris approximation is used to accommodate the centrifugal term. Accurate energy eigenvalues and eigenfunction solutions are obtained for vibrational ($\mathit{n}$) and rotational ($\ell$) states. For \ce{H2}, LiH, HCl, and CO, excellent agreement is observed between present values and literature, provided that the Pekeris approximation remains valid. For other molecules, a collection of low and high-lying states not found in literature are reported. The NUFA method is a simple, general and accurate approach that may be applied to other interatomic potentials.</description>

      <title>Duality via Sequential Quantum Circuit in the Topological Holography Formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two quantum theories which look different but are secretly describing the same low-energy physics are said to be dual to each other. When realized in the Topological Holography formalism, duality corresponds to changing the gapped boundary condition on the top boundary of a topological field theory, which determines the symmetry of the system, while not affecting the bottom boundary where all the dynamics take place. In this paper, we show that duality in the Topological Holography formalism can be realized with a Sequential Quantum Circuit applied to the top boundary. As a consequence, the Hamiltonians before and after the duality mapping have exactly the same spectrum in the corresponding symmetry sectors, and the entanglement in the corresponding low-energy eigenstates differs by at most an area law term.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2204.00578v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Programmable optical circuits form a key part of quantum technologies today, ranging from transceivers for quantum communication to integrated photonic chips for quantum information processing. As the size of such circuits is increased, maintaining precise control over every individual component becomes challenging, leading to a reduction in the quality of the operations performed. In parallel, minor imperfections in circuit fabrication are amplified in this regime, dramatically inhibiting their performance. Here we show how embedding an optical circuit in the higher-dimensional space of a large, ambient mode-mixer using inverse-design techniques allows us to forgo control over each individual circuit element, while retaining a high degree of programmability over the circuit. Using this approach, we implement high-dimensional linear optical circuits within a complex scattering medium consisting of a commercial multi-mode fibre placed between two controllable phase planes. We employ these circuits to manipulate high-dimensional spatial-mode entanglement in up to seven dimensions, demonstrating their application as fully programmable quantum gates. Furthermore, we show how their programmability allows us to turn the multi-mode fibre itself into a generalised multi-outcome measurement device, allowing us to both transport and certify entanglement within the transmission channel. Finally, we discuss the scalability of our approach, numerically showing how a high circuit fidelity can be achieved with a low circuit depth by harnessing the resource of a high-dimensional mode-mixer. Our work serves as an alternative yet powerful approach for realising precise control over high-dimensional quantum states of light, with clear applications in next-generation quantum communication and computing technologies.</description>

      <title>Superradiance and Subradiance in Dense Atomic Gases: An Integrated Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.15255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.15255v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When atoms are coupled to a common electromagnetic environment, the exchange of photons through dipole-dipole interactions leads to the emergence of cooperative effects. As a particular example, superradiance arises from spontaneous emission when this exchange leads to constructive interference of the emitted photons. Here, we introduce an integrated method for studying cooperative radiation in many-body systems. This method, which allows to study extended systems with arbitrarily large number of particles, can be formulated by an effective, nonlinear, two-atom master equation that describes the dynamics using a closed form which treats single- and many-body terms on an equal footing. We apply this method to a homogeneous gas of initially inverted two-level atoms, and demonstrate the appearance of both superradiance and subradiance, identifying a many-body coherence term as the source of these cooperative effects. We describe the many-body induced broadening -- which is analytically found to scale with the optical depth of the system -- and light shifts, and distinguish spontaneous effects from induced ones. In addition, we theoretically predict the time-dependence of subradiance, and the phase change of the radiated field during the cooperative decay.</description>

      <title>Observation of magnon bound states in the long-range, anisotropic Heisenberg model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.03899v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Over the recent years coherent, time-periodic modulation has been established as a versatile tool for realizing novel Hamiltonians. Using this approach, known as Floquet engineering, we experimentally realize a long-ranged, anisotropic Heisenberg model with tunable interactions in a trapped ion quantum simulator. We demonstrate that the spectrum of the model contains not only single magnon excitations but also composite magnon bound states. For the long-range interactions with the experimentally realized power-law exponent, the group velocity of magnons is unbounded. Nonetheless, for sufficiently strong interactions we observe bound states of these unconventional magnons which possess a non-diverging group velocity. By measuring the configurational mutual information between two disjoint intervals, we demonstrate the implications of the bound state formation on the entanglement dynamics of the system. Our observations provide key insights into the peculiar role of composite excitations in the non-equilibrium dynamics of quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Engineered dissipation to mitigate barren plateaus</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.15037v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms represent a powerful approach for solving optimization problems on noisy quantum computers, with a broad spectrum of potential applications ranging from chemistry to machine learning. However, their performances in practical implementations crucially depend on the effectiveness of quantum circuit training, which can be severely limited by phenomena such as barren plateaus. While, in general, dissipation is detrimental for quantum algorithms, and noise itself can actually induce barren plateaus, here we describe how the inclusion of properly engineered Markovian losses after each unitary quantum circuit layer can restore the trainability of quantum models. We identify the required form of the dissipation processes and establish that their optimization is efficient. We benchmark our proposal in both a synthetic and a practical quantum chemistry example, demonstrating its effectiveness and potential impact across different domains.</description>

      <title>Efficient entanglement purification based on noise guessing decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19914v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel bipartite entanglement purification protocol built upon hashing and upon the guessing random additive noise decoding (GRAND) approach recently devised for classical error correction codes. Our protocol offers substantial advantages over existing hashing protocols, requiring fewer qubits for purification, achieving higher fidelities, and delivering better yields with reduced computational costs. We provide numerical and semi-analytical results to corroborate our findings and provide a detailed comparison with the hashing protocol of Bennet et al. Although that pioneering work devised performance bounds, it did not offer an explicit construction for implementation. The present work fills that gap, offering both an explicit and more efficient purification method. We demonstrate that our protocol is capable of purifying states with noise on the order of 10% per Bell pair even with a small ensemble of 16 pairs. The work explores a measurement-based implementation of the protocol to address practical setups with noise. This work opens the path to practical and efficient entanglement purification using hashing-based methods with feasible computational costs. Compared to the original hashing protocol, the proposed method can achieve some desired fidelity with a number of initial resources up to one hundred times smaller. Therefore, the proposed method seems well-fit for future quantum networks with a limited number of resources and entails a relatively low computational overhead.</description>

      <title>Reducing Entanglement With Physically-Inspired Fermion-To-Qubit Mappings</title>

Abstract: In ab-initio electronic structure simulations, fermion-to-qubit mappings represent the initial encoding step of the fermionic problem into qubits. This work introduces a physically-inspired method for constructing mappings that significantly simplify entanglement requirements when simulating states of interest. The presence of electronic excitations drives the construction of our mappings, reducing correlations for target states in the qubit space. To benchmark our method, we simulate ground states of small molecules and observe an enhanced performance when compared to classical and quantum variational approaches from prior research employing conventional mappings. In particular, on the quantum side, our mappings require a reduced number of entangling layers to achieve accuracy for $LiH$, $H_2$, $(H_2)_2$, the $H_4$ stretching and benzene's {\pi} system using the RY hardware efficient ansatz. In addition, our mappings also provide an enhanced ground state simulation performance in the density matrix renormalization group algorithm for the $N_2$ molecule.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.03421v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the decoherence of a system of $N$ non-interacting heavy particles (atoms) due to coherent scattering with a background gas. We introduce a framework for computing the induced phase shift and loss of contrast for arbitrary preparations of $N$-particle quantum states. We find phase shifts that are inherently $(N\geq 2)$-body effects and may be searched for in future experiments. We analyze simple setups, including a two-mode approximation of an interferometer. We study fully entangled $N00N$ states, which resemble the correlated positions in a matter interferometer, as well as totally uncorrelated product states that are representative of a typical state in an atom interferometer. We find that the extent to which coherent enhancements increase the rate of decoherence depends on the observable of interest, state preparation, and details of the experimental design. In the context of future ultralow-recoil (e.g., light dark matter) searches with atom interferometers we conclude that: {\it i}) there exists a coherently enhanced scattering phase which can be searched for using standard (i.e., contrast/visibility and phase) interferometer observables; {\it ii}) although decoherence rates of one-body observables are {\it not} coherently enhanced, a coherently enhanced loss of contrast can still arise from dephasing; and {\it iii}) higher statistical moments (which are immediately accessible in a counting experiment) {\it are} coherently enhanced and may offer a new tool with which to probe the soft scattering of otherwise undetectable particles in the laboratory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09680v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Heisenberg uncertainty relation, together with Robertson's generalisation, serves as a fundamental concept in quantum mechanics, showing that noncommutative pairs of observables cannot be measured precisely. In this study, we explore the Robertson-type uncertainty relations to demonstrate their effectiveness in establishing a series of thermodynamic uncertainty relations and quantum speed limits in open quantum dynamics. The derivation utilises a scaled continuous matrix product state representation that maps the time evolution of the quantum continuous measurement to the time evolution of the system and field. Specifically, we consider the Maccone-Pati uncertainty relation, a refinement of the Robertson uncertainty relation, to derive thermodynamic uncertainty relations and quantum speed limits. These newly derived relations, which use a state orthogonal to the initial state, yield bounds that are tighter than previously known bounds. Moreover, we consider the Robertson-Schr\"odinger uncertainty, which extends the Robertson uncertainty relation. Our findings not only reinforce the significance of the Robertson-type uncertainty relations, but also expand its applicability in identifying uncertainty relations in open quantum dynamics.</description>

Abstract: We study brick wall quantum circuits enjoying a global fermionic symmetry. The constituent 2-qubit gate, and its fermionic symmetry, derive from a 2-particle scattering matrix in integrable, supersymmetric quantum field theory in 1+1 dimensions. Our 2-qubit gate, as a function of three free parameters, is of so-called free fermionic or matchgate form, allowing us to derive the spectral structure of both the brick wall unitary $U_F$ and its, non-trivial, hamiltonian limit $H_{\gamma}$ in closed form. We find that the fermionic symmetry pins $H_{\gamma}$ to a surface of critical points, whereas breaking that symmetry leads to non-trivial topological phases. We briefly explore quench dynamics for this class of circuits.</description>

      <title>Quantum Dynamical Emulation of Imaginary Time Evolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03350v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a constructive method for mapping non-unitary dynamics to a weighted set of unitary operations. We utilize this construction to derive a new correspondence between real and imaginary time, which we term Imaginary Time Quantum Dynamical Emulation (ITQDE). This correspondence enables an imaginary time evolution to be constructed from the overlaps of states evolved in opposite directions. We develop ITQDE as a tool for estimating the ground and thermal state properties associated with a given Hamiltonian. We additionally provide a prescription for leveraging ITQDE to estimate the complete Hamiltonian spectrum. We go on to develop a quantum algorithm for computing Hamiltonian spectra based on ITQDE, which we validate through numerical simulations and quantum hardware implementations. We conclude with a discussion of how ITQDE can be utilized more broadly to derive novel thermodynamic results, including a generalisation of the Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08388v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate nitrogen-vacancy center (NV) ensembles in diamond under the influence of strongly-correlated electron-spin baths. We thoroughly calculate the decoherence properties of the NV central spin for bath concentrations of 0.1-100 ppm using the cluster-correlation expansion (CCE) method. We systematically analyze possible origins of the significant deviations in the values of the $T_2$ coherence time reported in literature. We demonstrate that significant variations can originate from the choice of averaging and fitting procedures used for the ensemble average and we point out the respective aspects that need to be considered, when comparing the various theoretical studies. Our study may ease readers to perform reliable and fast simulations on the central spin problem. It provides an understanding and interpretation of the outcome parameters describing the dynamics of the local bath spins.</description>

      <title>Evaluating a quantum-classical quantum Monte Carlo algorithm with Matchgate shadows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18303v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solving the electronic structure problem of molecules and solids to high accuracy is a major challenge in quantum chemistry and condensed matter physics. The rapid emergence and development of quantum computers offer a promising route to systematically tackle this problem. Recent work by Huggins et al.[1] proposed a hybrid quantum-classical quantum Monte Carlo (QC-QMC) algorithm using Clifford shadows to determine the ground state of a Fermionic Hamiltonian. This approach displayed inherent noise resilience and the potential for improved accuracy compared to its purely classical counterpart. Nevertheless, the use of Clifford shadows introduces an exponentially scaling post-processing cost. In this work, we investigate an improved QC-QMC scheme utilizing the recently developed Matchgate shadows technique [2], which removes the aforementioned exponential bottleneck. We observe from experiments on quantum hardware that the use of Matchgate shadows in QC-QMC is inherently noise robust. We show that this noise resilience has a more subtle origin than in the case of Clifford shadows. Nevertheless, we find that classical post-processing, while asymptotically efficient, requires hours of runtime on thousands of classical CPUs for even the smallest chemical systems, presenting a major challenge to the scalability of the algorithm.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a novel method of efficiently simulating the non-equilibrium steady state of large many-body open quantum systems with highly non-local interactions, based on a variational Monte Carlo optimization of a matrix product operator ansatz. Our approach outperforms and offers several advantages over comparable algorithms, such as an improved scaling of the computational cost with respect to the bond dimension for periodic systems. We showcase the versatility of our approach by studying the phase diagrams and correlation functions of the dissipative quantum Ising model with collective dephasing and long-ranged power law interactions for spin chains of up to $N=100$ spins.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14967v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a hybrid quantum system consisting of a magnetic particle inductively coupled to two superconducting transmon qubits, where qubit-qubit interactions are mediated via magnons. We show that the system can be tuned into three different regimes of effective qubit-qubit interactions, namely a transverse ($XX + YY$), a longitudinal ($ZZ$) and a non-trivial $ZX$ interaction. In addition, we show that an enhanced coupling can be achieved by employing an ellipsoidal magnet, carrying anisotropic magnetic fluctuations. We propose a scheme for realizing two-qubit gates, and simulate their performance under realistic experimental conditions. We find that iSWAP and CZ gates can be performed in this setup with an average fidelity $\gtrsim 99 \% $ , while an iCNOT gate can be applied with an average fidelity $\gtrsim 88 \%$. Our proposed hybrid circuit architecture offers an alternative platform for realizing two-qubit gates between superconducting qubits and could be employed for constructing qubit networks using magnons as mediators.</description>

Abstract: Grover's algorithm solves the unstructured search problem. Grover's algorithm can find the target item with certainty only if searching one out of four. Grover's algorithm can be deterministic if the phase of the oracle or the diffusion operator is delicately designed. The precision of the phases could be a problem. We propose a near-deterministic quantum search algorithm without the phase control. Our algorithm has the same oracle and diffusion operators as Grover's algorithm. One additional component is the rescaled diffusion operator. It acts partially on the database. We show how to improve the success probability of Grover's algorithm by the partial diffusion operator in two different ways. The possible cost is one or two more queries to the oracle. We also design the deterministic search algorithm when searching one out of eight, sixteen, and thirty-two.</description>

      <title>Reliability Function of Classical-Quantum Channels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12403v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the reliability function of general classical-quantum channels, which describes the optimal exponent of the decay of decoding error when the communication rate is below the capacity. As main result, we prove a lower bound, in terms of the quantum Renyi information in Petz's form, for the reliability function. This resolves Holevo's conjecture proposed in 2000, a long-standing open problem in quantum information theory. It turns out that the obtained lower bound matches the upper bound derived by Dalai in 2013, when the communication rate is above a critical value. Thus we have determined the reliability function in this high-rate case. Our approach relies on Renes' breakthrough made in 2022, which relates classical-quantum channel coding to that of privacy amplification, as well as our new characterization of the channel Renyi information.</description>

      <title>A Relationship Between Nonphysical Quasi-probabilities and Nonlocality Objectivity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19061v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Density matrices are the most general descriptions of quantum states, covering both pure and mixed states. Positive semidefiniteness is a physical requirement of density matrices, imposing nonnegative probabilities of measuring physical values. Separately, nonlocality is a property shared by some bipartite quantum systems, indicating a correlation of the component parts that cannot be described by local classical variables. In this work, we show that breaking the positive-semidefinite requirement and allowing states with a negative minimal eigenvalue arbitrarily close to zero, allows for the construction of states that are nonlocal under one component labelling but local when the labelling is interchanged. This is an observer-dependent nonlocality, showing the connection between nonlocal objectivism and negative quasi-probabilities.</description>

      <title>Coordinating Decisions via Quantum Telepathy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21723v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum telepathy is the phenomenon where two non-communicating parties can exhibit correlated behaviors that are impossible to achieve using classical mechanics. This is also known as Bell inequality violation and is made possible by quantum entanglement. In this work, we present a conceptual framework for applying quantum telepathy to real-world problems. In general, the problems involve coordinating decisions given a set of observations without being able to communicate. We argue this inability is actually quite prevalent in the modern era where the decision-making timescales of computer processors are so short that the speed of light delay is actually quite appreciable in comparison. We highlight the example of high-frequency trading (HFT), where trades are made at microsecond timescales, but the speed of light delay between different exchanges can range from the order of 100 microseconds to 10 milliseconds. Due to the maturity of Bell inequality violation experiments, experimental realization of quantum telepathy schemes that can attain a quantum advantage for real-world problems $\textit{is already almost immediately possible}$. We demonstrate this by conducting a case study for a concrete HFT scenario that gives rise to a generalization of the CHSH game and evaluate different possible physical implementations for achieving a quantum advantage. It is well known that Bell inequality violation is a rigorous mathematical proof of a quantum advantage over any classical strategy and does not need any complexity-theoretic assumptions such as $\text{BQP}\neq\text{BPP}$. Moreover, fault tolerance is not necessary to realize a quantum advantage: for example, violating the CHSH inequality only requires single-qubit gates applied on two entangled physical qubits.</description>

      <title>End-to-End Protocol for High-Quality QAOA Parameters with Few Shots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00557v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) is a quantum heuristic for combinatorial optimization that has been demonstrated to scale better than state-of-the-art classical solvers for some problems. For a given problem instance, QAOA performance depends crucially on the choice of the parameters. While average-case optimal parameters are available in many cases, meaningful performance gains can be obtained by fine-tuning these parameters for a given instance. This task is especially challenging, however, when the number of circuit executions (shots) is limited. In this work, we develop an end-to-end protocol that combines multiple parameter settings and fine-tuning techniques. We use large-scale numerical experiments to optimize the protocol for the shot-limited setting and observe that optimizers with the simplest internal model (linear) perform best. We implement the optimized pipeline on a trapped-ion processor using up to 32 qubits and 5 QAOA layers, and we demonstrate that the pipeline is robust to small amounts of hardware noise. To the best of our knowledge, these are the largest demonstrations of QAOA parameter fine-tuning on a trapped-ion processor in terms of 2-qubit gate count.</description>

      <title>Controlling nonergodicity in quantum many-body systems by reinforcement learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11989v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Finding optimal control strategies to suppress quantum thermalization for arbitrarily initial states, the so-called quantum nonergodicity control, is important for quantum information science and technologies. Previous control methods largely relied on theoretical model of the target quantum system, but invertible model approximations and inaccuracies can lead to control failures. We develop a model-free and deep-reinforcement learning (DRL) framework for quantum nonergodicity control. It is a machine-learning method with the unique focus on balancing exploration and exploitation strategies to maximize the cumulative rewards so as to preserve the initial memory in the time-dependent nonergodic metrics over a long stretch of time. We use the paradigmatic one-dimensional tilted Fermi-Hubbard system to demonstrate that the DRL agent can efficiently learn the quantum many-body system solely through the interactions with the environment. The optimal policy obtained by the DRL provides broader control scenarios for managing nonergodicity in the phase diagram as compared to, e.g., the specific protocol for Wannier-Stark localization. The continuous control protocols and observations are experimentally feasible. The model-free nature of DRL and its versatile search space for control functions render promising nonergodicity control in more complex quantum many-body systems.</description>

Abstract: Reactive angular distributions of the benchmark F + H2(vi = 0) -&gt; F H(vf = 3) + H reaction show unusual propensity towards small scattering angles, a subject of a long debate in the literature. We use Regge trajectories to quantify the resonance contributions to state-to-state differential cross sections. Conversion to complex energy poles allows us to attribute the effect almost exclusively to a transition state resonance, long known to exist in the F +H2 system and its isotopic variant F +HD. For our detailed analysis of angular scattering we employ the package DCS Regge, recently developed for the purpose [Comp. Phys. Comm., 2022, 277, 108370.]</description>

Abstract: We present a general framework to implement massive Nambu-Goldstone quasi-particles in driven many-body systems. The underlying mechanism leverages an explicit Lie group structure imprinted into an effective Hamiltonian that governs the dynamics of slow degrees of freedom; the resulting emergent continuous symmetry is weakly explicitly broken, giving rise to a massive Nambu-Goldstone mode, with a spectral mass gap scaling linearly with the drive period. We discuss explicit and experimentally implementable realizations, such as Heisenberg-like spin models that support gapped spin-wave excitations. We provide a protocol to certify the existence of the massive Nambu-Goldstone mode from the dynamics of specific observables, and analyse the dispersion spectrum and their lifetime in the presence of weak explicit symmetry breaking.</description>

      <title>Subspace-thermal discrete time crystals from phase transitions between different n-tuple discrete time crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02848v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new Floquet time crystal model that responds in arbitrary multiples of the driving period. Such an $n$-tuple discrete time crystal is theoretically constructed by permuting spins in a disordered chain and is well suited for experiment implementations. Transitions between these time crystals with different periods give rise to a novel phase of matter that we call subspace-thermal discrete time crystals, where states within subspaces are fully thermalized at an early time. However, the whole system still robustly responds to the periodic driving subharmonically, with a period being the greatest common divisor of the original two periods. Existing theoretical analysis from many-body localization fails to understand the rigidity of such subspace-thermal time crystal phases. To resolve this, we develop a new theoretical framework from the perspective of the robust $2\pi/n$ quasi-energy gap. Its robustness is analytically proved, under a reasonable conjecture, by a new perturbation theory for unitary operators. The proof applies beyond the models considered here to other existing discrete time crystals realized by kicking disordered systems, thus offering a systematic way to construct new discrete time crystal models. We also introduce the notion of DTC-charges that allow us to probe the observables that spontaneously break the time-translation symmetry in both the regular discrete time crystals and subspace-thermal discrete time crystals. Moreover, our discrete time crystal models can be generalized to higher spin magnitudes or qudits, as well as higher spatial dimensions.</description>

Abstract: Among the variational wave functions for Fermionic Hamiltonians, neural network backflow (NNBF) and hidden fermion determinant states (HFDS) are two prominent classes to provide accurate approximations to the ground state. Here we develop a unifying view of fermionic neural quantum states casting them all in the framework of NNBF. NNBF wave-functions have configuration-dependent single-particle orbitals (SPO) which are parameterized by a neural network. We show that HFDS with $r$ hidden fermions can be written as a NNBF with an $r \times r$ determinant Jastrow and a restricted low-rank $r$ additive correction to the SPO. Furthermore, we show that in NNBF wave-functions, such determinant Jastrow's can generically be removed at the cost of further complicating the additive SPO correction increasing its rank by $r$. We numerically and analytically compare additive SPO corrections generated by the product of two matrices with inner dimension $r$. We find that larger $r$ wave-functions span a larger space and give evidence that simpler and more direct updates to the SPO's tend to be more expressive and better energetically. These suggest the standard NNBF approach is preferred amongst other related choices. Finally, we uncover that the row-selection used to select single-particle orbitals allows significant sign and amplitude modulation between nearby configurations and is partially responsible for the quality of NNBF and HFDS wave-functions.</description>

      <title>Compactness of quantics tensor train representations of local imaginary-time propagators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09161v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Space-time dependence of imaginary-time propagators, vital for \textit{ab initio} and many-body calculations based on quantum field theories, has been revealed to be compressible using Quantum Tensor Trains (QTTs) [Phys. Rev. X {\bf 13}, 021015 (2023)]. However, the impact of system parameters, like temperature, on data size remains underexplored. This paper provides a comprehensive numerical analysis of the compactness of local imaginary-time propagators in QTT for one-time/-frequency objects and two-time/-frequency objects, considering truncation in terms of the Frobenius and maximum norms. To study worst-case scenarios, we employ random pole models, where the number of poles grows logarithmically with the inverse temperature and coefficients are random. The Green's functions generated by these models are expected to be more difficult to compress than those from physical systems. The numerical analysis reveals that these propagators are highly compressible in QTT, outperforming the state-of-the-art approaches such as intermediate representation and discrete Lehmann representation. For one-time/-frequency objects and two-time/-frequency objects, the bond dimensions saturate at low temperatures, especially for truncation in terms of the Frobenius norm. We provide counting-number arguments for the saturation of bond dimensions for the one-time/-frequency objects, while the origin of this saturation for two-time/-frequency objects remains to be clarified. This paper's findings highlight the critical need for further research on the selection of truncation methods, tolerance levels, and the choice between imaginary-time and imaginary-frequency representations in practical applications.</description>

      <title>Analyticity and the Unruh effect: a study of local modular flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18937v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Unruh effect can be formulated as the statement that the Minkowski vacuum in a Rindler wedge has a boost as its modular flow. In recent years, other examples of states with geometrically local modular flow have played important roles in understanding energy and entropy in quantum field theory and quantum gravity. Here I initiate a general study of the settings in which geometric modular flow can arise, showing (i) that any geometric modular flow must be a conformal symmetry of the background spacetime, and (ii) that in a well behaved class of "weakly analytic" states, geometric modular flow must be future-directed. I further argue that if a geometric transformation is conformal but not isometric, then it can only be realized as modular flow in a conformal field theory. Finally, I discuss a few settings in which converse results can be shown -- i.e., settings in which a state can be constructed whose modular flow reproduces a given vector field.</description>

      <title>Modified mean field ansatz for charged polarons in a Bose-Einstein condensate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11387v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ionic Bose polarons are quantum entities emerging from the interaction between an ion and a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), featuring long-ranged interactions that can compete with the gas healing length. This can result in strong interparticle correlations and enhancement of gas density around the ion. One possible approach to describe this complex system with high accuracy relies on numerical treatment such as the quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) techniques. Nevertheless, it is computationally very expensive and does not easily allow to study the system dynamics. On the other hand, a mean-field based variational ansatz in the co-moving frame can capture a sizeable change in the gas density. We apply it to the case of regularized ion-atom potential and find that it qualitatively reproduces the full numerical results. In addition, we also study the system of two pinned ions, focusing on their effective interaction induced by the bath. This approach seems to be promising for studying transport and nonequilibrium dynamics of charged (bi)polarons in condensed media.</description>

      <title>Quantum mixtures of ultracold gases of neutral atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14562v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: After decades of improvements in cooling techniques of several atomic species and in finding methods for the achievement of stable quantum mixtures, the field is now ready for an extensive use of such a versatile experimental platform for the investigation of a variety of physical problems. Among them, relevant examples are the dynamics of impurities in a quantum gas, the miscibility condition of different gases, the study of exotic topological structures, the interplay between magnetism and superfluidity, the formation of artificial molecules, or new few-body states. We illustrate the differences among possible quantum mixtures, be they homonuclear spin mixtures or heteronuclear ones, and show how they can be exploited to investigate a plethora of topics from the few-body to the many-body regime. In particular, we discuss quantum mixtures of ultracold gases under three different perspectives: systems made of a few atoms of different kinds, single impurities immersed in a host quantum gas, and quantum mixtures of two interacting gases. We restrict the discussion to single harmonic or flat traps, predominantly in a three-dimensional configuration. A selection of results on recent experiments and possible interesting future directions are given.</description>

      <title>Second-order nonlocal shifts of scattered wave-packets: What can be measured by Goos-H\"anchen and Imbert-Fedorov effects ?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00375v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The scattering of wavepackets with arbitrary energy dispersion on surfaces has been analyzed. Expanding up to second order in scattering shifts, it is found that besides the known Goos-H\"anchen or Imbert-Fedorov spatial offset, as well as the Wigner delay time, new momentum and frequency shifts appear. Furthermore, the width of the scattered wave packet becomes modified as well, which can lead to a shrinking of pulses by multiple scattering. For a model of dielectric material characterized by a longitudinal and transverse dielectric function the shifts are calculated analytically. From the Goos-H\"anchen and Imbert-Fedorov shifts one can access the longitudinal and transversal dielectric function. Perfectly aligned crystal symmetry axes with respect to scattering beam shows no Imbert-Fedorov effect. It is found that the Goos-H\"anchen and Imbert-Fedorov effect are absent for homogeneous materials. Oppositely it is found that the Wigner delay time and the shrinking of the temporal pulse width allows to access the dielectric function independent on the beam geometry.</description>

      <title>Krylov Complexity as a Probe for Chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10194v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we explore in detail, the time evolution of Krylov complexity. We demonstrate, through analytical computations, that in finite many-body systems, while ramp and plateau are two generic features of Krylov complexity, the manner in which complexity saturates reveals the chaotic nature of the system. In particular, we show that the dynamics towards saturation precisely distinguish between chaotic and integrable systems. For chaotic models, the saturation value of complexity reaches its infinite time average at a finite saturation time. In this case, depending on the initial state, it may also exhibit a peak before saturation. In contrast, in integrable models, complexity approaches the infinite time average value from below at a much longer timescale. We confirm this distinction using numerical results for specific spin models.</description>
