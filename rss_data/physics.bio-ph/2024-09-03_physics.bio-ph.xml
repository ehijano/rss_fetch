      <title>Boundary layer heterogeneities can enhance scroll wave stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electrical activity in the heart is affected by the presence of scroll waves, causing lifethreatening arrhythmias. Clinical procedures to handle these electrical disorganizations create nonconductive heterogeneities in the cardiac tissue. We explore how boundary layer heterogeneities affect the scroll wave dynamics in a semidiscrete electrophysiological model. We show that decreasing the coupling strength near the boundaries of the tissue can prevent a meandering instability in the bulk enhancing the stability of scroll waves confined to thin geometries. Based on the coupling strength, the boundary layer length, the slab thickness, and wave deformation, we propose a forced model to reveal how a heterogeneity-induced slowing down of the waves governs the stabilization.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty Quantification of Antibody Measurements: Physical Principles and Implications for Standardization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Harmonizing serology measurements is critical for identifying reference materials that permit standardization and comparison of results across different diagnostic platforms. However, the theoretical foundations of such tasks have yet to be fully explored in the context of antibody thermodynamics and uncertainty quantification (UQ). This has restricted the usefulness of standards currently deployed and limited the scope of materials considered as viable reference material. To address these problems, we develop rigorous theories of antibody normalization and harmonization, as well as formulate a probabilistic framework for defining correlates of protection. We begin by proposing a mathematical definition of harmonization equipped with structure needed to quantify uncertainty associated with the choice of standard, assay, etc. We then show how a thermodynamic description of serology measurements (i) relates this structure to the Gibbs free-energy of antibody binding, and thereby (ii) induces a regression analysis that directly harmonizes measurements. We supplement this with a novel, optimization-based normalization (not harmonization!) method that checks for consistency between reference and sample dilution curves. Last, we relate these analyses to uncertainty propagation techniques to estimate correlates of protection. A key result of these analyses is that under physically reasonable conditions, the choice of reference material does not increase uncertainty associated with harmonization or correlates of protection. We provide examples and validate main ideas in the context of an interlab study that lays the foundation for using monoclonal antibodies as a reference for SARS-CoV-2 serology measurements.</description>

      <title>Switchable Conformation in Protein Subunits: Unveiling Assembly Dynamics of Icosahedral Viruses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The packaging of genetic material within a protein shell, called the capsid, marks a pivotal step in the life cycle of numerous single-stranded RNA viruses. Understanding how hundreds, or even thousands, of proteins assemble around the genome to form highly symmetrical structures remains an unresolved puzzle. In this paper, we design novel subunits and develop a model that enables us to explore the assembly pathways and genome packaging mechanism of icosahedral viruses, which were previously inaccessible. Using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we observe capsid fragments, varying in protein number and morphology, assembling at different locations along the genome. Initially, these fragments create a disordered structure that later merges to form a perfect symmetric capsid. The model demonstrates remarkable strength in addressing numerous unresolved issues surrounding virus assembly. For instance, it enables us to explore the advantages of RNA packaging by capsid proteins over linear polymers. Our MD simulations are in excellent agreement with our experimental findings from small-angle X-ray scattering and cryo-transmission electron microscopy, carefully analyzing the assembly products of viral capsid proteins around RNAs with distinct topologies.</description>

      <title>Prediction of excitable wave dynamics using machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Excitable systems, including cardiac tissue, can exhibit a variety of dynamics with different complexity, ranging from a single, stable spiral to spiral defect chaos (SDC), during which spiral waves are continuously formed and destroyed. Cardiac models typically involve a large number of variables and can be time-consuming to simulate. Here we trained a deep-learning (DL) model using snapshots from a single variable, obtained by simulating a single quasi-periodic spiral wave and spiral defect chaos (SDC) using a generic cardiac model. Using the trained DL model, we predicted the dynamics in both cases, using timesteps that are much larger than required for the simulations of the underlying equations. We show that the DL model is able to predict the trajectory of a quasi-periodic spiral wave and that the SDC activaton patterns can be predicted for approximately one Lyapunov time. Furthermore, we show that the DL model accurately captures the statistics of termination events in SDC, including the mean termination time. Finally, we show that a DL model trained using a specific domain size is able to replicate termination statistics on larger domains, resulting in significant computational savings.</description>

      <title>Physical mechanism reveals bacterial slowdown above a critical number of flagella</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerous studies have explored the link between bacterial swimming and the number of flagella, a distinguishing feature of motile multiflagellated bacteria. We revisit this open question using augmented slender-body theory simulations, in which we resolve the full hydrodynamic interactions within a bundle of helical filaments rotating and translating in synchrony. Unlike previous studies, our model considers the full torque-speed relationship of the bacterial flagellar motor, revealing its significant impact on multiflagellated swimming. Because the viscous load per motor decreases with flagellar number, the bacterial flagellar motor (BFM) transitions from the high-load to the low-load regime at a critical number of filaments, leading to bacterial slowdown as further flagella are added to the bundle. We explain the physical mechanism behind the observed slowdown as an interplay between the load-dependent generation of torque by the motor, and the load-reducing cooperativity between flagella, which consists of both hydrodynamic and non-hydrodynamic components. The theoretically predicted critical number of flagella is remarkably close to the values reported for the model organism \textit{Escherichia coli}. Our model further predicts that the critical number of flagella increases with viscosity, suggesting that bacteria can enhance their swimming capacity by growing more flagella in more viscous environments, consistent with empirical observations.</description>

      <title>Algebraic and diagrammatic methods for the rule-based modeling of multi-particle complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formation, dissolution, and dynamics of multi-particle complexes is of fundamental interest in the study of stochastic chemical systems. In 1976, Masao Doi introduced a Fock space formalism for modeling classical particles. Doi's formalism, however, does not support the assembly of multiple particles into complexes. Starting in the 2000's, multiple groups developed rule-based methods for computationally simulating biochemical systems involving large macromolecular complexes. However, these methods are based on graph-rewriting rules and/or process algebras that are mathematically disconnected from the statistical physics methods generally used to analyze equilibrium and nonequilibrium systems. Here we bridge these two approaches by introducing an operator algebra for the rule-based modeling of multi-particle complexes. Our formalism is based on a Fock space that supports not only the creation and annihilation of classical particles, but also the assembly of multiple particles into complexes, as well as the disassembly of complexes into their components. Rules are specified by algebraic operators that act on particles through a manifestation of Wick's theorem. We further describe diagrammatic methods that facilitate rule specification and analytic calculations. We demonstrate our formalism on systems in and out of thermal equilibrium, and for nonequilibrium systems we present a stochastic simulation algorithm based on our formalism. The results provide a unified approach to the mathematical and computational study of stochastic chemical systems in which multi-particle complexes play an important role.</description>

      <title>Bacteria exhibit optimal diffusivity near surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In natural environments, solid surfaces present both opportunities and challenges for bacteria. On one hand, they serve as platforms for biofilm formation, crucial for bacterial colonization and resilience in harsh conditions. On the other hand, surfaces can entrap bacteria, constraining their environmental exploration compared to the freedom they experience in bulk liquid. Here, through systematic single-cell behavioral measurements, phenomenological modeling, and theoretical analysis, we reveal how bacteria strategically navigate these factors. We observe that bacterial surface residence time decreases sharply with increasing tumble bias, transitioning to a plateau at a tumble bias of around 0.25, consistent with the mean tumble bias of wild-type Escherichia coli. Furthermore, we find that bacterial surface diffusivity peaks near the mean tumble bias of wild-type E. coli. This reflects a bet-hedging strategy: some bacteria swiftly escape from the surface, while others, with longer surface residence times, explore this two-dimensional environment most efficiently.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Prediction of Protein-Polyelectrolyte Binding Thermodynamics: Adsorption of Heparin-Analog Polysulfates to the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein RBD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interactions of polyelectrolytes (PEs) with proteins play a crucial role in numerous biological processes, such as the internalization of virus particles into host cells. Although docking, machine learning methods, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are utilized to estimate binding poses and binding free energies of small-molecule drugs to proteins, quantitative prediction of the binding thermodynamics of PE-based drugs presents a significant obstacle in computer-aided drug design. This is due to the sluggish dynamics of PEs caused by their size and strong charge-charge correlations. In this paper, we introduce advanced sampling methods based on a force-spectroscopy setup and theoretical modeling to overcome this barrier. We exemplify our method with explicit solvent all-atom MD simulations of interactions of anionic PEs that show antiviral properties, namely heparin and linear polyglycerol sulfate (LPGS), with the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD). Our prediction for the binding free energy of LPGS to the wild-type RBD matches experimentally measured dissociation constants within thermal energy, kT, and correctly reproduces the experimental PE-length dependence. We find that LPGS binds to the Delta-variant RBD with an additional free-energy gain of 2.4 kT, compared to the wild-type RBD, in accord with electrostatic arguments. We show that the LPGS-RBD binding is solvent-dominated and enthalpy-driven, though with a large entropy-enthalpy compensation. Our method is applicable to general polymer adsorption phenomena and predicts precise binding free energies and re-configurational friction as needed for drug and drug-delivery design.</description>

      <title>Attractive and repulsive terms in multi-object dispersion interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the dispersion (van der Waals, vdW) interaction among N parallel elongated objects such as DNA/RNA strands or metallic nanotubes, which are polarizable primarily along the long axis. Within a quasi-one-dimensional model, we prove that the irreducible N -object vdW energy contribution is negative (attractive) for even N and positive (repulsive) for odd N. We confirm these results up to $N=4$ via a 3-dimensional plasma cylinder model. This suggests a preference for even-N clustering of elongated structures in nanoscience and biology. This work could have implications e.g. for nanotube bundle formation and for the clustering of long-chain biomolecules at separations exceeding chemical bond lengths.</description>

      <title>Phase behaviors and dynamics of active particle systems in double-well potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the phase behaviors and dynamics of self-propelled particles with active reorientation in double-well potential. We observe the self-propelled particles exhibit flocking and clustering in an asymmetric potential trap. By MD simulations, we obtain a phase diagram of flocking with active reorientation and potential asymmetry as parameters. We compare the responses of inactive and active particles to the potential. It shows that active reorientation of particles amplifies the degree of aggregation on one side in the asymmetric potential well. Furthermore, we calculate the mean squared displacement and identify distinct diffusion regimes. These results highlight active particles with active reorientation exhibit greater sensitivity in double-well potentials.</description>

      <title>Tunable glassy dynamics in models of dense cellular tissue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Observations of glassy dynamics in experiments on confluent cellular tissue have inspired a wealth of computational and theoretical research to model their emergent collective behavior. Initial studies of the physical properties of several geometric cell models, including vertex-type models, have highlighted anomalous sub-Arrhenius, or "ultra-strong," scaling of the dynamics with temperature. Here we show that the dynamics and material properties of the 2d Voronoi model deviate even further from the standard glassforming paradigm. By varying the characteristic shape index $p_0$, we demonstrate that the system properties can be tuned between displaying expected glassforming behavior, including the breakdown of the Stokes-Einstein-Sutherland relation and the formation of dynamical heterogeneities, and an unusual regime in which the viscosity does not diverge as the characteristic relaxation time increase and dynamical heterogeneities are strongly suppressed. Our results provide further insight into the fundamental properties of this class of anomalous glassy materials, and provide a step towards designing materials with predetermined glassy dynamics.</description>

      <title>Transient contacts between filaments impart its elasticity to branched actin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Branched actin networks exert pushing forces in eukaryotic cells, and adapt their stiffness to their environment. The physical basis for their mechanics and adaptability is however not understood. Indeed, here we show that their high density and low connectivity place them outside the scope of standard elastic network models for actin. We combine high-precision mechanical experiments, molecular dynamics simulations and a mean-field elastic theory to show that they are instead dominated by the proliferation of interfilament contacts under compression. This places branched actin in the same category as undercoordinated, fibrous materials such as sheep's wool. When the network is grown under force, filaments entangle as if knitted together and trap contacts in their structure. Trapped contacts play a similar role as crosslinkers in rigidifying the network, and are thus key to its active adaptive mechanics.</description>

      <title>DNA transport is topologically sculpted by active microtubule dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The transport of macromolecules, such as DNA, through the cytoskeleton is critical to wide-ranging cellular processes from cytoplasmic streaming to transcription. The rigidity and steric hindrances imparted by the network of filaments comprising the cytoskeleton often leads to anomalous subdiffusion, while active processes such as motor-driven restructuring can induce athermal superdiffusion. Understanding the interplay between these seemingly antagonistic contributions to intracellular dynamics remains a grand challenge. Here, we use single-molecule tracking to show that the transport of large linear and circular DNA through motor-driven microtubule networks can be non-gaussian and multi-modal, with the degree and spatiotemporal scales over which these features manifest depending non-trivially on the state of activity and DNA topology. For example, active network restructuring increases caging and non-Gaussian transport modes of linear DNA, while dampening these mechanisms for rings. We further discover that circular DNA molecules exhibit either markedly enhanced subdiffusion or superdiffusion compared to their linear counterparts, in the absence or presence of kinesin activity, indicative of microtubules threading circular DNA. This strong coupling leads to both stalling and directed transport, providing a direct route towards parsing distinct contributions to transport and determining the impact of coupling on the transport signatures. More generally, leveraging macromolecular topology as a route to programming molecular interactions and transport dynamics is an elegant yet largely overlooked mechanism that cells may exploit for intracellular trafficking, streaming, and compartmentalization. This mechanism could be harnessed for the design of self-regulating, sensing, and reconfigurable biomimetic matter.</description>

      <title>Living porous ceramics for bacteria-regulated gas sensing and carbon capture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Microorganisms hosted in abiotic structures have led to engineered living materials that can grow, sense and adapt in ways that mimic biological systems. Although porous structures should favor colonization by microorganisms, they have not yet been exploited as abiotic scaffolds for the development of living materials. Here, we report porous ceramics that are colonized by bacteria to form an engineered living material with self-regulated and genetically programmable carbon capture and gas-sensing functionalities. The carbon capture capability is achieved using wild-type photosynthetic cyanobacteria, whereas the gas-sensing function is generated utilizing genetically engineered E. coli. Hierarchical porous clay is used as ceramic scaffold and evaluated in terms of bacterial growth, water uptake and mechanical properties. Using state-of-the-art chemical analysis techniques, we demonstrate the ability of the living porous ceramics to capture CO2 directly from the air and to metabolically turn minute amounts of a toxic gas into a benign scent detectable by humans.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study focused on the expansion in polydisperse granular materials owing to mechanical annealing, which involved compression and decompression. Following minor annealing, the polydisperse systems exhibited compaction as well as the systems having uniform-sized particles. However, following extensive annealing, only the polydisperse systems were observed to expand. Pressure history and structure analysis indicated that this expansion results from the size segregation of the particles. We attribute this segregation to particle-size-dependent effective attraction. The results of this study highlight the strong history dependence of the packing fraction and structure in polydisperse particles and reveal a potential-energy-driven segregation mechanism.</description>

      <title>Rapidly yawing spheroids in viscous shear flow: Emergent loss of symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the emergent dynamics of a rapidly yawing spheroidal swimmer interacting with a viscous shear flow. We show that the rapid yawing generates non-axisymmetric emergent effects, with the active swimmer behaving as an effective passive particle with two orthogonal planes of symmetry. The shape of the equivalent effective particle is different to the average shape of the active particle. Moreover, despite having two planes of symmetry, the equivalent passive particle is not an ellipsoid in general, except for specific scenarios in which the effective shape is a spheroid. We use a multiple scales analysis for systems to derive the emergent swimmer behaviour, which requires solving a nonautonomous nonlinear 3D dynamical system, and we validate our analysis via comparison to numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Optical Manipulation of Whispering Gallery Mode Microlasers for Precision Controlled Cellular Delivery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Whispering gallery mode microlasers are known for their high Q-factors, characteristic emission spectra and sensitivity to local refractive index changes. This sensitivity combined with the ability of various cell types to internalise these microlasers provide unique opportunities for advanced biological studies, e.g. in single-cell tracking and intracellular sensing. Despite many advancements, achieving precise delivery of lasers to cells remains challenging, with traditional methods, such as microinjection, often also resulting in cellular damage. Here, we show that optical trapping is a promising solution for microlaser manipulation and therefore for their controlled and non-invasive delivery to target cells. By integrating optical trapping with microlaser-based refractive index sensing, we study the dynamics of microlaser-uptake by cells. We also find that in some cases the peaks in the emission spectra of our microlasers broaden, split, and shift, and we assign this to local inhomogeneities in refractive index surrounding the microlaser. This shows how optical trapping can further expand the unique toolkit offered by biointegrated whispering gallery mode microlasers.</description>

      <title>Exact computation of Transfer Entropy with Path Weight Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Information processing in networks entails a dynamical transfer of information between stochastic variables. Transfer entropy is widely used for quantification of the directional transfer of information between input and output trajectories. However, currently there is no exact technique to quantify transfer entropy given the dynamical model of a general network. Here we introduce an exact computational algorithm, Transfer Entropy-Path Weight Sampling (TE-PWS), to quantify transfer entropy and its variants in an arbitrary network in the presence of multiple hidden variables, nonlinearity, transient conditions, and feedback. TE-PWS extends a recently introduced algorithm Path Weight Sampling (PWS) and uses techniques from the statistical physics of polymers and trajectory sampling. We apply TE-PWS to linear and nonlinear systems to reveal how transfer entropy can overcome naive applications of data processing inequalities in presence of feedback.</description>

      <title>On the design space between molecular mechanics and machine learning force fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A force field as accurate as quantum mechanics (QM) and as fast as molecular mechanics (MM), with which one can simulate a biomolecular system efficiently enough and meaningfully enough to get quantitative insights, is among the most ardent dreams of biophysicists -- a dream, nevertheless, not to be fulfilled any time soon. Machine learning force fields (MLFFs) represent a meaningful endeavor towards this direction, where differentiable neural functions are parametrized to fit ab initio energies, and furthermore forces through automatic differentiation. We argue that, as of now, the utility of the MLFF models is no longer bottlenecked by accuracy but primarily by their speed (as well as stability and generalizability), as many recent variants, on limited chemical spaces, have long surpassed the chemical accuracy of $1$ kcal/mol -- the empirical threshold beyond which realistic chemical predictions are possible -- though still magnitudes slower than MM. Hoping to kindle explorations and designs of faster, albeit perhaps slightly less accurate MLFFs, in this review, we focus our attention on the design space (the speed-accuracy tradeoff) between MM and ML force fields. After a brief review of the building blocks of force fields of either kind, we discuss the desired properties and challenges now faced by the force field development community, survey the efforts to make MM force fields more accurate and ML force fields faster, envision what the next generation of MLFF might look like.</description>

      <title>A minimal model of smoothly dividing disk-shaped cells</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Replication through cell division is one of the most fundamental processes of life and a major driver of dynamics in systems ranging from bacterial colonies to embryogenesis, tissues and tumors. While regulation often plays a role in shaping self-organization, mounting evidence suggests that many biologically relevant behaviors exploit principles based on a limited number of physical ingredients, and particle-based models have become a popular platform to reconstitute and investigate these emergent dynamics. However, incorporating division into such models often leads to aberrant mechanical fluctuations that hamper physically meaningful analysis. Here, we present a minimal model focusing on mechanical consistency during division. Cells are comprised of two nodes, overlapping disks which separate from each other during cell division, resulting in transient dumbbell shapes. Internal degrees of freedom, cell-cell interactions and equations of motion are designed to ensure force continuity at all times, including through division, both for the dividing cell itself as well as interaction partners, while retaining the freedom to define arbitrary anisotropic mobilities. As a benchmark, we also translate an established model of proliferating spherocylinders with similar dynamics into our theoretical framework. Numerical simulations of both models demonstrate force continuity of the new disk cell model and quantify our improvements. We also investigate some basic collective behaviors related to alignment and orientational order and find consistency both between the models and with the literature. A reference implementation of the model is freely available as a package in the Julia programming language based on $\textit{InPartS.jl}$. Our model is ideally suited for the investigation of mechanical observables such as velocities and stresses, and is easily extensible with additional features.</description>

Abstract: From cytoskeletal networks to tissues, many biological systems behave as active materials. Their composition and stress-generation is affected by chemical reaction networks. In such systems, the coupling between mechanics and chemistry enables self-organization, for example, into waves. Recently, contractile mechanochemical systems were shown to be able to spontaneously develop localized spatial patterns. Here, we show that these localized patterns can present intrinsic spatiotemporal dynamics, including oscillations and chaotic dynamics. We discuss their physical origin and bifurcation structure.</description>

      <title>Neuroevolution of Decentralized Decision-Making in N-Bead Swimmers Leads to Scalable and Robust Collective Locomotion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09438v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many microorganisms swim by performing larger non-reciprocal shape deformations that are initiated locally by molecular motors. However, it remains unclear how decentralized shape control determines the movement of the entire organism. Here, we investigate how efficient locomotion emerges from coordinated yet simple and decentralized decision-making of the body parts using neuroevolution techniques. Our approach allows us to investigate optimal locomotion policies for increasingly large microswimmer bodies, with emerging long-wavelength body shape deformations corresponding to surprisingly efficient swimming gaits. The obtained decentralized policies are robust and tolerant concerning morphological changes or defects and can be applied to artificial microswimmers for cargo transport or drug delivery applications without further optimization "out of the box". Our work is of relevance to understanding and developing robust navigation strategies of biological and artificial microswimmers and, in a broader context, for understanding emergent levels of individuality and the role of collective intelligence in Artificial Life.</description>

      <title>Honeybee-like collective decision making in a kilobot swarm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.15592v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Drawing inspiration from honeybee swarms' nest-site selection process, we assess the ability of a kilobot robot swarm to replicate this captivating example of collective decision-making. Honeybees locate the optimal site for their new nest by aggregating information about potential locations and exchanging it through their waggle-dance. The complexity and elegance of solving this problem relies on two key abilities of scout honeybees: self-discovery and imitation, symbolizing independence and interdependence, respectively. We employ a mathematical model to represent this nest-site selection problem and program our kilobots to follow its rules. Our experiments demonstrate that the kilobot swarm can collectively reach consensus decisions in a decentralized manner, akin to honeybees. However, the strength of this consensus depends not only on the interplay between independence and interdependence but also on critical factors such as swarm density and the motion of kilobots. These factors enable the formation of a percolated communication network, through which each robot can receive information beyond its immediate vicinity. By shedding light on this crucial layer of complexity --the crowding and mobility conditions during the decision-making--, we emphasize the significance of factors typically overlooked but essential to living systems and life itself.</description>

      <title>Controlling noise with self-organized resetting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09307v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Biological systems often consist of a small number of constituents and are therefore inherently noisy. To function effectively, these systems must employ mechanisms to constrain the accumulation of noise. Such mechanisms have been extensively studied and comprise the constraint by external forces, nonlinear interactions, or the resetting of the system to a predefined state. Here, we propose a fourth paradigm for noise constraint: self-organized resetting, where the resetting rate and position emerge from self-organization through time-discrete interactions. We study general properties of self-organized resetting systems using the paradigmatic example of cooperative resetting, where random pairs of Brownian particles are reset to their respective average. We demonstrate that such systems undergo a delocalization phase transition, separating regimes of constrained and unconstrained noise accumulation. Additionally, we show that systems with self-organized resetting can adapt to external forces and optimize search behavior for reaching target values. Self-organized resetting has various applications in nature and technology, which we demonstrate in the context of sexual interactions in fungi and spatial dispersion in shared mobility services. This work opens routes into the application of self-organized resetting across various systems in biology and technology.</description>

      <title>Theory of Wetting Dynamics with Surface Binding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10405v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Biomolecules, such as proteins and RNAs, can phase separate in the cytoplasm of cells to form biomolecular condensates. Such condensates are liquid-like droplets that can wet biological surfaces such as membranes. Many molecules that participate in phase separation can also reversibly bind to membrane surfaces. When a droplet wets a surface, molecules can diffuse inside and outside of the droplet or in the bound state on the surface. How the interplay between surface binding, diffusion in surface and bulk affects the wetting kinetics is not well understood. Here, we derive the governing equations using non-equilibrium thermodynamics by relating the thermodynamic fluxes and forces at the surface coupled to the bulk. We study the spreading dynamics in the presence of surface binding and find that binding speeds up wetting by nucleating a droplet inside the surface. Our results suggest that the wetting dynamics of droplets can be regulated by two-dimensional surface droplets in the surface-bound layer through changing the binding affinity to the surfaces. These findings are relevant both to engineering life-like systems with condensates and vesicles, and biomolecular condensates in living cells.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14403v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lipid membranes have complex compositions and modeling the thermodynamic properties of multi-component lipid systems remains a remote goal. In this work we attempt to describe the thermodynamics of binary lipid mixtures by mapping coarse-grained molecular dynamics systems to two-dimensional simple fluid mixtures. By computing and analysing the density fluctuations of this model lipid bilayer we determine the numerical value of the quadratic coupling term appearing in a model of regular solutions for the DPPC-DLiPC pair of lipids at three different compositions. Our methodology is general and discussed in detail.</description>
