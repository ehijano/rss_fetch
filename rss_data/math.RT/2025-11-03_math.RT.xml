      <title>Shifted double Poisson structures and noncommutative Poisson extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a theory of noncommutative Poisson extensions. For an augmented dg algebra \(A\), we show that any shifted double Poisson bracket on \(A\) induces a graded Lie algebra structure on the reduced cyclic homology. Under the Kontsevich--Rosenberg principle, we further prove that the noncommutative Poisson extension is compatible with noncommutative Hamiltonian reduction. Moreover, we show that shifted double Poisson structures are independent of the choice of cofibrant resolutions and that they induce shifted Poisson structures on the derived moduli stack of representations.</description>

      <title>Invariants in the cohomology of the complement of quaternionic reflection arrangements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal A$ be a hyperplane arrangement in a vector space $V$ and $G \leq GL(V)$ a group fixing $\mathcal A$. In case when $G$ is a complex reflection group and $\mathcal A=\mathcal A(G)$ is its reflection arrangement in $V$, Douglass, Pfeiffer, and R\"ohrle studied the invariants of the $Q G$-module $H^*(M(\mathcal A);Q)$, the rational, singular cohomology of the complement space $M(\mathcal A)$ in $V$. In this paper we generalize the work in Douglass, Pfeiffer, and R\"ohrle to the case of quaternionic reflection groups. We obtain a straightforward generalization of the Hilbert--Poincar\'e series of the ring of invariants in the cohomology from the complex case when the quaternionic reflection group is complex-reducible according to Cohen's classification. Surprisingly, only one additional family of new types of Poincar\'e polynomials occurs in the quaternionic setting which is not realised in the complex case, namely those of a particular class of imprimitive irreducible quaternionic reflection groups. Finally, we discuss bases of the space of $G$-invariants in $H^*(M(\mathcal A);Q)$.</description>

      <title>Local noncommutative De Leeuw Theorems beyond reductive Lie groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma$ be a discrete subgroup of a unimodular locally compact group $G$. In Math. Ann. 388, 4251-4305 (2024), it was shown that the $L_p$ norm of a Fourier multiplier $m$ on $\Gamma$ can be bounded locally by its $L_p$-norm on $G$, modulo a constant $c(A)$ which depends on the support $A$ of $m$. In the context where $G$ is a connected Lie group with Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$, we develop tools to find explicit bounds on $c(A)$. We show that the problem reduces to:
  1) The adjoint representation of the semisimple quotient $\mathfrak{s} = \mathfrak{g}/\mathfrak{r}$ of $\mathfrak{g}$ by the radical $\mathfrak{r}$ of $\mathfrak{g}$ (which was handled in the paper mentioned above).
  2) The action of $\mathfrak{s}$ on a set of real irreducible representations that arise from quotients of the commutator series of $\mathfrak{r}$.
  In particular, we show that $c(G) = 1$ for unimodular connected solvable Lie groups.</description>

      <title>Twin groups representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15005v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct two representations of the twin group $T_n, n\geq 2$, namely $\eta_1: T_n \rightarrow \text{Aut}(\mathbb{F}_n)$ and $\eta_2: T_n \rightarrow \text{GL}_n(\mathbb{Z}[t^{\pm 1}])$, where $\mathbb{F}_n$ is a free group with $n$ generators and $t$ is indeterminate. We then analyze some characteristics of these two representations, such as irreducibility and faithfulness. Moreover, we prove that both representations can be extended to the virtual twin group $VT_n$ in the $2$-local extension way, for $n\geq 2$, and we find their $2$-local extensions. On the other hand, we obtain a different result for the welded twin group $WT_n$. More deeply, we show that $\eta_1$ cannot be extended to $WT_n$ in the $2$-local extension way, for $n\geq 3$, while $\eta_2$ can be extended to $WT_n$ in the $2$-local extension way, for $n\geq 2$, and we find its $2$-local extensions.</description>

      <title>On the boundary Carrollian conformal algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21603v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We initiate the mathematical study of the boundary Carrollian conformal algebra (BCCA), an infinite-dimensional Lie algebra recently discovered in the context of Carrollian physics. The BCCA is an intriguing object from both physical and mathematical perspectives, since it is a filtered but not graded Lie algebra. In this paper, we first construct some modules for the BCCA and one of its subalgebras, which we call $\mathcal{O}$, by restriction of well-known modules of the BMS$_3$ and Witt algebras respectively. Along the way, we prove the irreducibility criteria for the so-called ``induced modules'' of the BMS$_3$ algebra (which we prefer to call massive modules to avoid ambiguity) and show that this is the same criteria for the irreducibility of the Verma modules of the BMS$_3$ algebra. Interestingly, the modules generated by the action of the BCCA on the generating vector of the massive modules are also irreducible under the same criteria. When this criteria holds, every massive module decomposes into a direct sum of two BCCA-submodules, each of which we conjecture to be irreducible. Meanwhile, restricting Verma modules to the BCCA and $\mathcal{O}$ leads to free or ``almost free'' modules, which are not particularly interesting from a representation-theoretic viewpoint. This motivates the construction of BCCA modules intrinsically. To do this, we go through some structure theory on the BCCA to define a new basis and a decreasing filtration on the algebra, using which we construct Whittaker modules over the BCCA and the subalgebra $\mathcal{O}$ and prove criteria for their irreducibility.</description>

      <title>Birational geometry of quiver varieties and other GIT quotients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.09623v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that all projective crepant resolutions of Nakajima quiver varieties satisfying natural conditions are also Nakajima quiver varieties. More generally, we classify the small birational models of many Geometric Invariant Theory (GIT) quotients by introducing a sufficient condition for the GIT quotient of an affine variety $V$ by the action of a reductive group $G$ to be a relative Mori Dream Space. Two surprising examples illustrate that our new condition is optimal. When the condition holds, we show that the linearisation map identifies a region of the GIT fan with the Mori chamber decomposition of the relative movable cone of $V /\!/_{\theta} G$. If $V/\!/_{\theta} G$ is a crepant resolution of $Y\!\!:= V/\!/_{0} G$, then every projective crepant resolution of $Y$ is obtained by varying $\theta$. Under suitable conditions, we show that this is the case for quiver varieties and hypertoric varieties. Similarly, for any finite subgroup $\Gamma\subset \mathrm{SL}(3,\mathbb{C})$ whose nontrivial conjugacy classes are all junior, we obtain a simple geometric proof of the fact that every projective crepant resolution of $\mathbb{C}^3/\Gamma$ is a fine moduli space of $\theta$-stable $\Gamma$-constellations.</description>

      <title>Deformations and Simultaneous Resolution of Determinantal Surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.02982v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper uses reconstruction algebras to construct simultaneous resolution of determinantal surfaces. The main new difference to the classical case is that, in addition to the quiver of the reconstruction algebra, certain noncommutative relations, namely those of the canonical algebra of Ringel, are required. All the relations of the reconstruction algebra except the canonical relation are then deformed, and these deformed relations together with variation of the GIT quotient achieve the simultaneous resolution.</description>

      <title>Quantum $K$-theoretic divisor axiom for flag manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16150v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove an identity for (torus-equivariant) 3-point, genus 0, $K$-theoretic Gromov-Witten invariants of flag manifolds $G/P$, which can be thought of as a replacement for the ``divisor axiom'' in their (torus-equivariant) quantum $K$-theory. This identity enables us to compute these invariants when two insertions are Schubert classes and the other a Schubert divisor class. Our type-independent proof utilizes the Chevalley formula for the (torus-equivariant) quantum $K$-theory ring of flag manifolds, which computes multiplications by Schubert divisor classes in terms of the quantum Bruhat graph.</description>

      <title>Any-Dimensional Polynomial Optimization via de Finetti Theorems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15632v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Polynomial optimization problems often arise in sequences indexed by dimension, and it is of interest to compute bounds on the optimal values of all problems in the sequence. Examples include certifying inequalities between symmetric functions or graph homomorphism densities that hold over vectors and graphs of all sizes, and computing the value of mean-field games viewed as limits of games with a growing number of players. In this paper, we study such any-dimensional polynomial problems using the theory of representation stability, and we develop a systematic framework to produce hierarchies of bounds for their limiting optimal values in terms of finite-dimensional polynomial optimization problems. In this paper, we study such any-dimensional polynomial problems using the theory of representation stability, and we develop a systematic framework to produce sequences of improving bounds on their limiting optimal values. Our bounds are obtained by solving finite-dimensional polynomial optimization problems (or their relaxations). These bounds converge at explicit rates, and they follow as a consequence of new de Finetti-type theorems pertaining to sequences of random arrays projecting onto each other in different ways. The proofs of these theorems are based on applying results from probability to representations of certain categories. We apply our framework to produce new bounds on problems arising in a number of application domains such as mean-field games, extremal graph theory, and symmetric function theory, and we illustrate our methods via numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>An extension of Viennot's shadow to rook placements via orbit harmonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23735v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For fixed positive integers $n,m,r$, let $\mathrm{Mat}_{n \times m}(\mathbb{C})$ be the affine space of $n \times m$ complex matrices with coordinate ring $\mathbb{C}[\mathbf{x}_{n \times m}]$. We define a homogeneous ideal $I_{n,m,r}$, where the graded quotient $\mathbb{C}[\mathbf{x}_{n \times m}]/I_{n,m,r}$ is obtained from the orbit harmonics deformation of the matrix loci corresponding to all rook placements of size at least $r$. By extending rook placements to elements in $\mathfrak{S}_{n+m-r}$ and applying Viennot's shadow line avatar of the Schensted correspondence, we compute the standard monomial basis of the quotient $\mathbb{C}[\mathbf{x}_{n \times m}]/I_{n,m,r}$ with respect to diagonal monomial orders. We also determine the graded $\mathfrak{S}_n\times\mathfrak{S}_m$-module structure of $\mathbb{C}[\mathbf{x}_{n \times m}]/I_{n,m,r}$.</description>
