      <title>The Effects of Splayed Lipid Molecules on Lubrication by Lipid Bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The outstanding lubrication of articular cartilage in the major synovial joints such as hips and knees, essential for the joint well-being, has been attributed to boundary layers of lipids at the outer cartilage surfaces, which have very low friction mediated by the hydration lubrication mechanism at their highly hydrated exposed headgroups. However, the role of spontaneously present lipid splays, lipids with an acyl tail in each of the opposing bilayers, in modulating the frictional force between lipid bilayers has not, to date, been considered. In this study, we perform all-atom molecular dynamics simulations to quantitatively assess the significance of splayed molecules within the framework of lubricating lipid bilayers. We demonstrate that, although transient, splayed molecules significantly increase the inter-membrane friction until their retraction back into the lamellar phase, with this effect more steadily occurring at lower sliding velocities that are comparable to the physiological velocities of sliding articular cartilage.</description>

      <title>Straight to zigzag transition of foam pseudo Plateau borders on textured surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The structure of liquid foams follows simple geometric rules formulated by Plateau 150 years ago. By placing such foam on a microtextured hydrophilic surface, we show that the bubble footprint exhibits a morphological transition. This transition concerns the liquid channels, also called pseudo Plateau borders, which are straight between vertices on a smooth surface. We demonstrate experimentally that for a sufficiently large roughness size compared to the width of the liquid channels, the footprint adopts a zigzag shape. This transition is associated with the absence of a wetting film between the pillars caused by capillary suction of the foam, observed by confocal microscopy. We rationalize the number of zigzag segments by a geometric distribution describing the observations made with the footprint perimeter and the mesh size of the asperities.</description>

      <title>Dynamical structures in phase-separating non-reciprocal polar active mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-reciprocal systems exhibit diverse dynamical phases whose character depends on the type and degree of non-reciprocity. In this study, we theoretically investigate dynamical structures in a mixture of non-reciprocally aligning polar active particles with repulsion, focusing on the performance on (and connection between) different levels of description. Linear stability analyses of the associated continuum model predict a profound influence of non-reciprocity, leading to phase separation, (anti-)flocking and asymmetric clustering behavior. On the microscopic level, particle simulations confirm the emergence of these dynamical phases and allow for a more in-depth investigation of (microscopic) properties, including orientational correlations and susceptibilities. In particular, our findings demonstrate that certain dynamical properties, like a chase-and-run behavior in the asymmetrical clustering phase, are overlooked in mean-field continuum theory, making microscopic simulations an indispensable tool for studying the effects of non-reciprocal alignment couplings.</description>

      <title>Elastic ribbons in bubble columns: when elasticity, capillarity and gravity govern equilibrium configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Taking advantage of the competition between elasticity and capillarity has proven to be an efficient way to design structures by folding, bending, or assembling elastic objects in contact with liquid interfaces. Elastocapillary effects often occur at scales where gravity does not play an important role, such as in microfabrication processes. However, the influence of gravity can become significant at the desktop scale, which is relevant for numerous situations including model experiments used to provide a fundamental physics understanding, working at easily accessible scales. We focus here on the case of elastic ribbons placed in two-dimensional bubble columns: by introducing an elastic ribbon inside the central soap films of a staircase bubble structure in a square cross-section column, the deviation from Plateau's laws (capillarity-dominated case dictating the shape of usual foams) can be quantified as a function of the rigidity of the ribbon. For long ribbons, gravity cannot be neglected. We provide a detailed theoretical analysis of the ribbon profile, taking into account capillarity, elasticity and gravity. We compute the total energy of the system and perform energy minimization under constraints, using Lagrangian mechanics. The model is then validated via a comparison with experiments with three different ribbon thicknesses.</description>

      <title>Unvortex Lattice and Topological Defects in Rigidly Rotating Multicomponent Superfluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By examining the characteristics of a rotating ferromagnetic spinor condensate through the perspective of large spin, we uncover a novel kind of topological point defect in the magnetization texture. These defects are predicted not by the conventional homotopy group analysis but by the Riemann-Hurwitz formula. The spin texture in the system is described by an equal-area mapping from the plane to the sphere of magnetization, forming a lattice of uniformly charged Skyrmions. This lattice carries doubly-quantized (winding number = 2) point defects arranged on the sphere in a tetrahedral configuration. The fluid is found to be rotating rigidly, except at the point defects where the vorticity vanishes. This vorticity structure contrasts with the well-known vortex lattice in scalar rotating superfluids, where vorticity concentrates exclusively within defect points, forming an unconventional "unvortex" lattice. Numerical results are presented, which are in agreement with the aforementioned predictions.</description>

      <title>Correlation decoupling of Casimir interaction in an electrolyte driven by external electric fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has been established for a long time that the long range van der Waals or thermal Casimir interaction between two semi-infinite dielectrics separated by a distance $H$ is screened by an intervening electrolyte. Here we show how this interaction is modified when an electric field of strength $E$ is applied parallel to the dielectric boundaries, leading to a non-equilibrium steady state with a current. The presence of the field induces a long range thermal repulsive interaction, scaling just like the thermal Casimir interaction between dielectrics without the intervening electrolyte, {\em i.e.} as $1/H^3$. At small $E$ the effect is of order $E^2$ while at large fields it saturates to an $E$ independent value. We explain the results in terms of a decoupling mechanism between the charge density fluctuations of cations and anions at large applied fields.</description>

      <title>Effects of prestress in the coating of an elastic disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An elastic disk is coated with an elastic rod, uniformly prestressed with a tensile or compressive axial force. The prestress state is assumed to be induced by three different models of external radial load or by 'shrink-fit' forcing the coating onto the disk. The prestressed coating/disk system, when loaded with an additional and arbitrary incremental external load, experiences incremental displacement, strain, and stress, which are solved via complex potentials. The analysis incorporates models for both perfect and imperfect bonding at the coating/disk interface. The derived solution highlights the significant influence not only of the prestress but also of the method employed to generate it. These two factors lead, in different ways, to a loss or an increase in incremental stiffness for compressive or tensile prestress. The first bifurcation load of the structure (which differs for different prestress generations) is determined in a perturbative way. The results emphasize the importance of modelling the load and may find applications in flexible electronics and robot arms subject to pressure or uniformly-distributed radial forces.</description>

      <title>Turbulent cascade arrests and the formation of intermediate-scale condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Energy cascades lie at the heart of the dynamics of turbulent flows. In a recent study of turbulence in fluids with odd-viscosity [de Wit \textit{et al.}, Nature \textbf{627}, 515 (2024)], the two-dimensionalization of the flow at small scales leads to the arrest of the energy cascade and selection of an intermediate scale, between the forcing and the viscous scales. To investigate the generality of this phenomenon, we study a shell model that is carefully constructed to have three-dimensional turbulent dynamics at small wavenumbers and two-dimensional turbulent dynamics at large wavenumbers. The large scale separation that we can achieve in our shell model allows us to examine clearly the interplay between these dynamics, which leads to an arrest of the energy cascade at a transitional wavenumber and an associated accumulation of energy at the same scale. Such pile-up of energy around the transitional wavenumber is reminiscent of the formation of condensates in two-dimensional turbulence, \textit{but, in contrast, it occurs at intermediate wavenumbers instead of the smallest wavenumber</description>

      <title>Size selection of crack front defects: Multiple fracture-plane interactions and intrinsic lengthscales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06289v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Material failure is mediated by the propagation of cracks, which in realistic 3D materials typically involve multiple coexisting fracture planes. Multiple fracture-plane interactions create poorly understood out-of-plane crack structures, such as step defects on tensile fracture surfaces. Steps form once a slowly moving, distorted crack front segments into disconnected overlapping fracture planes separated by a stabilizing distance $h_{\rm max}$. Our experiments on numerous brittle hydrogels reveal that $h_{\rm max}$ varies linearly with both a nonlinear elastic length $\Gamma(v)/\mu$ and a dissipation length $\xi$. Here, $\Gamma(v)$ is the measured crack velocity $v$-dependent fracture energy and $\mu$ is the shear modulus. These intrinsic lengthscales point the way to a fundamental understanding of multiple-crack interactions in 3D that lead to the formation of stable out-of-plane fracture structures.</description>

      <title>Critical Casimir effect in a disordered $O(2)$-symmetric model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01588v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Critical Casimir effect appears when critical fluctuations of an order parameter interact with classical boundaries. We investigate this effect in the setting of a Landau-Ginzburg model with continuous symmetry in the presence of quenched disorder. The quenched free energy is written as an asymptotic series of moments of the models partition function. Our main result is that, in the presence of a strong disorder, Goldstone modes of the system contribute either with an attractive or with a repulsive force. This result was obtained using the distributional zeta-function method without relying on any particular ansatz in the functional space of the moments of the partition function.</description>

      <title>Bacterial cell death: Atomistic simulations reveal pore formation as a mode of action of structurally nano engineered star peptide polymers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02501v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multidrug resistance (MDR) to conventional antibiotics is one of the most urgent global health threats, necessitating the development of effective and biocompatible antimicrobial agents that are less inclined to provoke resistance. Structurally Nanoengineered Antimicrobial Peptide Polymers (SNAPPs) are a novel and promising class of such alternatives. These star-shaped polymers are made of a dendritic core with multiple arms made of co-peptides with varying amino acid sequences. Through a comprehensive set of in vivo experiments, we (Nature Microbiology, 1, 16162, 2016) showed that SNAPPs with arms made of random blocks of lysine (K) and valine (V) residues exhibit sub-micron M efficacy against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria tested. Cryo-TEM images suggested pore formation by SNAPP with random block co-peptide arms as one of their mode of actions. However, the molecular mechanisms responsible for this mode of action of SNAPP were not fully understood. To address this gap, we employed atomistic molecular dynamics simulation technique to investigate the influence of three different sequences of amino acids, namely 1) alternating block KKV 2) random block and 3) di-block motifs on secondary structure of their arms and SNAPP's overall configuration as well as their interactions with lipid bilayer. We, for the first time identified a step-by-step mechanism through which alternating block and random SNAPPs interact with lipid bilayer and leads to pore formation, hence cell death. These insights provide a strong foundation for further optimization of the chemical structure of SNAPPs for maximum performance against MDR bacteria, therefore offering a promising avenue for addressing antibiotic resistance and development of effective antibacterial agents.</description>
