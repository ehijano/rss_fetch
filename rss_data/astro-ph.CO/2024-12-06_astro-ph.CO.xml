      <title>Tracing cosmic gas in filaments and halos: Low-redshift insights from the kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we leverage CMB data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) and LSS data from the imaging survey conducted by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) to study the distribution of gas around galaxy groups at low redshift, $z \approx 0.3$, via the kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) effect. In particular, we perform velocity-weighted stacking on the photometric Bright Galaxy Sample (BGS) to isolate the monopole and quadrupole of the kSZ signal, orienting the stacked images along 2D filaments identified using the Hessian of the projected gravitational potential. We find a 7.2$\sigma$ detection in the monopole of the signal (i.e., the gas density profile) and a 4$\sigma$ detection in the quadrupole ($m = 2$), constituting the first measurement of the alignment between gas distribution and the cosmic web through the kSZ effect. As it is a linear probe of the local gas density, the kSZ has heightened sensitivity to the warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM), which is believed to house the majority of the ``missing baryons.'' Mapping out the gas density at low redshifts, as enabled by our measurements, is crucial for weak lensing surveys, for which the impact of baryons on small scales is a major impediment. We compare the anisotropic signal against two hydrodynamical simulations, TNG300-1 and Illustris, which have very different baryonic feedback prescriptions. We find that the anisotropic signal measured in the data is comparable but slightly larger and more extended compared with the simulations. This suggests that there is excess accretion and feedback taking place through the filaments, hinting at the possible presence of spin-filament alignment of the BGS objects.</description>

      <title>Exploring velocity dispersion anisotropy in a dark matter dominated ultra-diffuse galaxy with modified gravity models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The kinematics of the ultra-diffuse galaxy (UDG) NGC1052-DF44 is primarily influenced by the presence of dark matter (DM). In this paper, we conduct a contrasting kinematic study of DF44 within the alternative modified gravity framework. In comparison to NFW DM, we test three alternative gravity models viz Milgromian dynamics (MOND), characterized by a known acceleration scale, a generic $f(R)$ model, assuming an expansion of the Ricci scalar, and a quantum gravity-inspired Renormalization Group correction to General Relativity (RGGR), which involves the running of the gravitational coupling parameter $G$ with the Universe's energy scale. For each gravity model, we evaluate the velocity dispersion (VD) of the galaxy beyond the conventional radial isotropic assumption and extend to two anisotropy scenarios, i.e., constant and Osipkov-Merritt. Our results show that all three gravity models can provide consistent fits to the observed VD of DF44; however, only MOND and RGGR remain competitive with NFW DM. Interestingly, the constant anisotropy scenario in all the models is also found to be competitive with the complete isotropic assumption.</description>

      <title>Improving Optical Photo-z Estimates Using Submillimeter Photometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Estimating the redshifts of distant galaxies is critical for determining their intrinsic properties, as well as for using them as cosmological probes. Measuring redshifts spectroscopically is accurate, but expensive in terms of telescope time, hence it has become common to measure `photometric' redshifts, which are fits to photometry taken in a number of filters using templates of galaxy spectral energy distributions (SEDs). However, most photometric methods rely on optical and near-infrared (NIR) photometry, neglecting longer wavelength data in the far-infrared (FIR) and millimeter. Since the ultimate goal of future surveys is to obtain redshift estimates for all galaxies, it is important to improve photometric redshift algorithms for cases where optical/NIR fits fail to produce reliable results. For specific subsets of galaxies, in particular dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs), it can be particularly hard to obtain good optical photometry and thus reliable photometric redshift estimates, while these same galaxies are often bright at longer wavelengths. Here we describe a new method for independently incorporating FIR-to-millimeter photometry to the outputs of standard optical/NIR SED-fitting codes to help improve redshift estimation, in particular of DSFGs. We test our method with the H-ATLAS catalog, which contains FIR photometry from Herschel-SPIRE cross-matched to optical and NIR observations, and show that our approach reduces the number of catastrophic outliers by a factor of three compared to standard optical and NIR SED-fitting routines alone.</description>

      <title>Measuring our peculiar velocity from spectroscopic redshift surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our peculiar velocity imprints a dipole on galaxy density maps derived from redshift surveys. The dipole gives rise to an oscillatory signal in the multipole moments of the observed power spectrum which we indicate as the finger-of-the-observer (FOTO) effect. Using a suite of large mock catalogues mimicking ongoing and future $\textrm{H}\alpha$- and $\textrm{H}\scriptstyle\mathrm{I}$-selected surveys, we demonstrate that the oscillatory features can be measured with a signal-to-noise ratio of up to 7 (depending on the sky area coverage and provided that observational systematics are kept under control on large scales). We also show that the FOTO effect cannot be erased by correcting the individual galaxy redshifts. On the contrary, by leveraging the power of the redshift corrections, we propose a novel method to determine both the magnitude and the direction of our peculiar velocity. After applying this technique to our mock catalogues, we conclude that it can be used to either test the kinematic interpretation of the temperature dipole in the cosmic microwave background or to extract cosmological information such as the matter density parameter and the equation of state of dark energy.</description>

      <title>Restoring Missing Modes of 21cm Intensity Mapping with Deep Learning: Impact on BAO Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 21cm intensity mapping of the large-scale structure (LSS), regions in Fourier space could be compromised by foreground contamination. In interferometric observations, this contamination, known as the foreground wedge, is exacerbated by the chromatic response of antennas, leading to substantial data loss. Meanwhile, the baryonic acoustic oscillation (BAO) reconstruction, which operates in configuration space to "linearize" the BAO signature, offers improved constraints on the sound horizon scale. However, missing modes within these contaminated regions can negatively impact the BAO reconstruction algorithm. To address this challenge, we employ the deep learning model U-Net to recover the lost modes before applying the BAO reconstruction algorithm. Despite hardware limitations, such as GPU memory, our results demonstrate that the AI-restored 21cm temperature map achieves a high correlation with the original signal, with a correlation ratio of approximately $0.9$ at $k \sim 1 h/Mpc$. Furthermore, subsequent BAO reconstruction indicates that the AI restoration has minimal impact on the performance of the `linearized' BAO signal, proving the effectiveness of the machine learning approach to mitigate the impact of foreground contamination. Interestingly, we demonstrate that the AI model trained on coarser fields can be effectively applied to finer fields, achieving even higher correlation. This success is likely attributable to the scale-invariance properties of non-linear mode coupling in large-scale structure and the hierarchical structure of the U-Net architecture.</description>

      <title>Towards a multi-tracer neutrino mass measurement with line-intensity mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately determining neutrino masses is a main objective of contemporary cosmology. Since massive neutrinos affect structure formation and evolution, probes of large scale structure are sensitive to the sum of their masses. In this work, we explore future constraints on $\sum m_\nu$ utilizing line-intensity mapping (LIM) as a promising emerging probe of the density of our Universe, focusing on the fine-structure [CII] line as an example, and compare these constraints with those derived from traditional galaxy surveys. Additionally, we perform a multi-tracer analysis using velocity tomography via the kinetic Sunyaev-Zeldovich and moving lens effects to reconstruct the three-dimensional velocity field. Our forecasts indicate that the next-generation AtLAST detector by itself can achieve $\sigma_{\Sigma m_\nu} \sim 50$ meV sensitivity. Velocity tomography will further improve these constraints by 4%. Incorporating forecasts for CMB-S4 and DESI-BAO in a comprehensive multi-tracer analysis, while setting a prior on the optical depth to reionization $\tau$ derived using 21-cm forecasted observations, to break degeneracies, we find that a $\gtrsim5\sigma$ detection of $\sum m_\nu\!\sim\! 60$ meV, under the normal hierarchy, is within reach with LIM. Even without a $\tau$ prior, our combined forecast reaches $\sigma_{\Sigma m_\nu} \!\sim\! 18$ meV.</description>

      <title>Polarization of the Cosmic Microwave Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the first detection by the DASI experiment in 2002, measurements of the polarization of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) have grown into an important role in testing our understanding of conditions in the early universe and cosmology. The field has seen rapid experimental progress, driven in large part by the desire to make increasingly precise measurements of CMB polarization. Precise measurements of the CMB polarization anisotropies contain as much information as the CMB temperature anisotropy, and promise to unlock new tests of physics and the standard cosmological model. In this chapter, we first discuss how polarization is produced through Thomson scattering, after which types of polarization patterns are connected to the cosmological sources. Finally, we briefly discuss the experimental hardware that enables these measurements.</description>

      <title>A $\Lambda$CDM Extension Explaining the Hubble Tension and the Spatial Curvature $\Omega_{k,0} = -0.012 \pm 0.010$ Measured by the Final PR4 of the Planck Mission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The measurements of the CMB have determined the cosmological parameters with high accuracy, and the observation of the flatness of space have contributed to the status of the concordance $\Lambda$CDM model. However, the cosmological constant $\Lambda$, necessary to close the model to critical density, remains an open conundrum. We explore the observed late-time accelerated expansion of the Universe, where we consider that the Friedmann equation describes the expansion history of FLRW universes in the local reference frame of freely falling comoving observers, which perceive flat, homogeneous and isotropic space in their local inertial system, where, as a consequence of the equivalence principle, special relativity applies. We use this fact to propose an extension to $\Lambda$CDM, incorporating the initial conditions of the background universe, comprising the initial energy densities as well as the initial post big bang expansion rate. The observed late-time accelerated expansion is then attributed to a kinematic effect akin to a dark energy component. Choosing the same $\Omega_{m,0} \simeq 0.3$ as $\Lambda$CDM, its equation of state $w_{de} \simeq -0.8$. Furthermore, we include the impact on the expansion history caused by the cosmic web of the late Universe, once voids dominate its volume, and find that the initially constant $w_{de}$ becomes time-dependent, evolving to a value of $w_{de} \simeq -0.9$ at the present. While this impact by voids is minor, it is sufficient to provide a solution to the Hubble tension problem. We use CLASS to calculate the expansion history and power spectra of our extension and compare our results to concordance $\Lambda$CDM and to observations. We find that our model agrees well with current data, in particular with the final data release PR4 of the Planck mission, where it explains the reported spatial curvature of $\Omega_{k,0} = - 0.012 \pm 0.010$.</description>

      <title>The Thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Effect from the Epoch of Reionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) effect arises from inverse Compton scattering of low energy photons onto thermal electrons, proportional to the integrated electron pressure, and is usually observed from galaxy clusters. However, we can expect that the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) also contributes to this signal, but that contribution has not been previously evaluated. In this work we analyse a suite of fully-coupled radiation-hydrodynamics simulations based on RAMSES-CUDATON to calculate and study the tSZ signal from the Reionization Epoch. We construct lightcones of the electron pressure in the intergalactic medium for $6&lt;z$ to calculate the resulting Compton y-parameters. We vary the box sizes, resolutions and star formation parameters to investigate how these factors affect the tSZ effect. We produce plots of maps and distributions of y, as well as angular temperature power spectra of the tSZ signal obtained from integrating the lightcones constructed for each simulation. We find that the tSZ signal from reionization is generally sub-dominant to the post-reionization one at larger scales ($\ell&lt; 10^4$), but can contribute non-trivially and potentially contaminate the measured signals. At scales probed by current experiments like SPT ($\ell\sim10^3-10^4$), we find that the tSZ signal power spectrum from reionization contributes at roughly a percent level compared to the current templates, with the quadratic Doppler effect contributing an additional $\sim10\%$ to the tSZ signal. At smaller scales the tSZ from reionization peaks and can potentially dominate the total signal and is thus a potentially much more important contribution to take into account in any future, more sensitive experiments.</description>

      <title>Baryon Acoustic Oscillations from galaxy surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conducted a review of the fundamental aspects of describing and detecting the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) feature in galaxy surveys, emphasizing the optimal tools for constraining this probe based on the type of observation. Additionally, we included new results with two spectroscopic datasets to determine the best-fit model for the power spectrum, $P(k)$. Using the framework described in a previous analysis, we applied this to a different sub-sample of the BOSS survey, specifically galaxies with redshifts $0.3&lt;z&lt;0.65$. We also examined the eBOSS dataset with redshifts $0.6&lt;z&lt;1.0$, adjusting the number of parameters in the traditional polynomial fit to account for the higher redshift range. Our results showed that the dilation scale parameter $\alpha$ derived from the BOSS dataset had smaller error bars compared to the eBOSS dataset, attributable to the larger number of luminous red galaxies (LRGs) in the BOSS sample. We also compared our findings with other surveys such as WiggleZ, DES Y6, and DESI III, noting that photometric surveys typically yield larger error bars due to their lower precision. The DESI III results were in good agreement with ours within $1\sigma$, with most bins close to unity. The variation of $\alpha$ with respect to the redshift is an unresolved issue in the field, appearing in both three-dimensional and angular tomographic analyses.</description>

      <title>Uniting the Observed Dynamical Dark Energy Preference with the Discrepancies in $\Omega_m$ and $H_0$ Across Cosmological Probes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent results from Type Ia Supernovae (SNe), baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), and the cosmic microwave background (CMB) indicate 1) potentially discrepant measurements of the matter density $\Omega_m$ and Hubble constant $ H_0 $ in a $\Lambda$CDM model when data are analyzed individually, and 2) hints of dynamical dark energy in a $w_0w_a$CDM model when data are combined in a joint analysis. We examine whether underlying dynamical dark energy cosmologies favored by real data would result in biases in $\Omega_m$ and $ H_0 $ for each probe when analyzed individually in a $\Lambda$CDM framework. We generate mock datasets in $w_0w_a$CDM cosmologies, fit the individual probes under the $\Lambda$CDM model, and find that expected biases in $\Omega_m$ are $\sim 0.03$. Notably, the $\Omega_m$ differences between probes are consistent with the values observed in the real datasets. We also observe that mock DESI BAO datasets generated in the $ w_0w_a $CDM cosmologies will lead to a biased measurement of $ H_0 $ higher by ($\sim1.2$km/s/Mpc) when fitted under $\Lambda$CDM, appearing to mildly improve the Hubble tension, but as the true underlying $H_0$ is lower, the tension is in fact worsened. We find that the $\Omega_m$ discrepancies, the high BAO $ H_0 $ relative to CMB, and the joint dynamical dark energy signal itself are all related effects that could be explained simultaneously with either new physics or new systematics. While we find it is possible to unite many of the discrepancies seen in recent analyses along a single axis, our results underscore the importance of understanding systematic differences in datasets, as they have unique impacts in different cosmological parameter spaces.</description>

      <title>Diagnosing Systematic Effects Using the Inferred Initial Power Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The next generation of galaxy surveys has the potential to substantially deepen our understanding of the Universe. This potential hinges on our ability to rigorously address systematic uncertainties. Until now, diagnosing systematic effects prior to inferring cosmological parameters has been out of reach in field-based implicit likelihood cosmological inference frameworks. As a solution, we aim to diagnose a variety of systematic effects in galaxy surveys prior to inferring cosmological parameters, using the inferred initial matter power spectrum. Our approach is built upon a two-step framework. First, we employ the Simulator Expansion for Likelihood-Free Inference (SELFI) algorithm to infer the initial matter power spectrum, which we utilise to thoroughly investigate the impact of systematic effects. This investigation relies on a single set of N-body simulations. Second, we obtain a posterior on cosmological parameters via implicit likelihood inference, recycling the simulations from the first step for data compression. For demonstration, we rely on a model of large-scale spectroscopic galaxy surveys that incorporates fully non-linear gravitational evolution and simulates multiple systematic effects encountered in real surveys. We provide a practical guide on how the SELFI posterior can be used to assess the impact of misspecified galaxy bias parameters, selection functions, survey masks, inaccurate redshifts, and approximate gravity models on the inferred initial matter power spectrum. We show that a subtly misspecified model can lead to a bias exceeding $2\sigma$ in the $(\Omega_\mathrm{m},\sigma_8)$ plane, which we are able to detect and avoid prior to inferring the cosmological parameters. This framework has the potential to significantly enhance the robustness of physical information extraction from full-forward models of large-scale galaxy surveys such as DESI, Euclid, and LSST.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Roman Space Telescope, equipped with a 2.4 meter primary mirror and optical--NIR wide-field camera, promises to revolutionize our understanding of dark energy, exoplanets, and infrared astrophysics. One of the Roman Core Community Surveys is the High Latitude Time Domain Survey (HLTDS), which will measure more than 10,000 SN Ia light curves but obtain a fraction of this number with spectra. The remaining SNe will have to be photometrically classified to achieve the full potential of the Roman HLTDS. To investigate transient yields and classifications, Rose et al. (in prep.) updated the Photometric LSST Astronomical Time-series Classification Challenge (PLAsTiCC) framework (originally developed for the Vera Rubin Observatory) for the Roman HLTDS. This study leverages this Roman Hourglass dataset to train and evaluate the ParSNIP (Parameterized Supernova Identification Pipeline) model. We employ this model to classify various transient types from photometric data, paying particular attention to the types most represented in the dataset: normal SNe Ia, 91bg-like SNe Ia, SNe Iax, and CC SNe. The ParSNIP model performance is assessed through confusion matrices and ROC curves across different redshift ranges. Our analysis reveals that while the model performs robustly at higher redshifts (with the AUC for classification varying between 0.9 and 0.95 in the range 0.5 &lt; z &lt; 2), its accuracy dips at the lowest redshifts of the survey, likely due to limited training data. These findings underscore the importance of ensuring adequate representation of classes in the training set. This work underscores the value of machine learning models for next-generation surveys, paving the way for future studies with the Roman Space Telescope for survey optimization, cosmological forecasts, and synergies with other surveys.</description>

      <title>Direct Deflection of Millicharged Radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Millicharged particles are generic in theories of dark sectors. A cosmic or local abundance of them may be produced by the early universe, stellar environments, or the decay or annihilation of dark matter/dark energy. Furthermore, if such particles are light, these production channels result in a background of millicharged radiation. We show that light-shining-through-wall experiments employing superconducting RF cavities can also be used as ``direct deflection" experiments to search for this relativistic background. The millicharged plasma is first subjected to an oscillating electromagnetic field of a driven cavity, which causes charge separation in the form of charge and current perturbations. In turn, these perturbations can propagate outwards and resonantly excite electromagnetic fields in a well-shielded cavity placed nearby, enabling detection. We estimate that future versions of the existing Dark SRF experiment can probe orders of magnitude of currently unexplored parameter space, including millicharges produced from the Sun, the cosmic neutrino background, or other mechanisms that generate a thermal abundance with energy density as small as $\sim 10^{-4}$ that of the cosmic microwave background.</description>

      <title>NuSTAR bounds on radiatively decaying particles from M82</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Axions and other putative feebly interacting particles (FIPs) with a mass of tens to several hundreds of keVs can be produced in stellar cores with a Lorentz boost factor $E_a/m_a\lesssim 10$. Thus, starburst galaxies such as M82 are efficient factories of slow axions. Their decay $a\rightarrow\gamma\gamma$ would produce a large flux of X-ray photons, peaking around $100$ keV and spread around the galaxy by an angle that can be relatively large. We use observations of the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR) mission to show that the absence of these features can constrain $30-500$ keV axion masses into uncharted regions for axion-photon coupling of $g_{a\gamma}\sim 10^{-10}-10^{-12}\,\rm GeV^{-1}$. Our argument can be applied to other heavy FIPs and astrophysical sources that are hot enough to produce them, yet cold enough to avoid large boost factors which slow down the decay.</description>

      <title>Evidence for environmental effects in the $z\,{=}\,4.3$ protocluster core SPT2349$-$56</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present ALMA observations of the [CI] 492 and 806$\,$GHz fine-structure lines in 25 dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) at $z\,{=}\,4.3$ in the core of the SPT2349$-$56 protocluster. The protocluster galaxies exhibit a median $L^\prime_{[\text{CI}](2-1)}/L^\prime_{[\text{CI}](1-0)}$ ratio of 0.94 with an interquartile range of 0.81-1.24. These ratios are markedly different to those observed in DSFGs in the field (across a comparable redshift and 850$\,\mu$m flux density range), where the median is 0.55 with an interquartile range of 0.50-0.76, and we show that this difference is driven by an excess of [CI](2-1) in the protocluster galaxies for a given 850$\,\mu$m flux density. We estimate gas excitation temperatures of $T_{\rm ex}\,{=}\,59.1^{+8.1}_{-6.8}\,$K for our protocluster sample and $T_{\rm ex}\,{=}\,33.9^{+2.4}_{-2.2}\,$K for the field sample. Our main interpretation of this result is that the protocluster galaxies have had their cold gas driven to their cores via close-by interactions within the dense environment, leading to an overall increase in the average gas density and excitation temperature, and an elevated [CI](2-1) luminosity-to-far-infrared luminosity ratio.</description>

      <title>Eogenesis via the High-scale Electroweak Symmetry Restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel electron-assisted Baryogenesis scenario that does not require explicit B-L violation, which is essential for the traditional Leptogenesis mechanism. This scenario is based on the assumption of high-scale electroweak symmetry restoration, which implies that the electron Yukawa interaction, crucial for the mechanism, does not reach thermal equilibrium before the electroweak sphaleron process is quenched in the early universe. Primordial charge asymmetries for chiral electrons, which can be generated through various mechanisms such as axion inflation, the evaporation of primordial black holes, or the CP-asymmetric decays of a heavy Higgs doublet, serve as the initial condition for the amplification of the baryon asymmetry through transport equations. Right-handed electron asymmetry is almost irrelevant to the baryon asymmetry due to high-scale electroweak symmetry restoration, leading to both a non-zero baryon asymmetry and the electron asymmetry. We dub this mechanism as the Eogenesis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interaction rates of neutrinos and antineutrinos within a QED plasma determine the dynamics of their decoupling in the early universe. We show how to define the relevant double-differential production, annihilation, and scattering rates at NLO. Integrating over these rates with specific weights, other quantities from the literature can be obtained, such as energy transfer rates, or a neutrino interaction rate. We show that NLO corrections to the energy transfer rates are as small as those that enter the previously determined neutrino interaction rate, and are therefore expected to have only a small influence on the neutrino decoupling parameter, $N_{\rm eff}\,$. We also provide a tabulation and fast interpolation routine for all double-differential rates, in order to allow for their use in non-approximate kinetic equations, which may further reduce the systematic uncertainties of the Standard Model prediction for $N_{\rm eff}\,$</description>

      <title>To bounce or not to bounce in generalized Proca theory and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is notoriously difficult to construct a stable non-singular bouncing cosmology that avoids all possible instabilities throughout the entire evolution of the universe. In this work, we explore whether a non-singular bounce driven by a specific class of modifications of General Relativity, the vector-tensor generalized Proca theories, can be constructed without encountering any pathologies in linear perturbation theory. We find that such models unavoidably lead to either an instability in the matter sector or strong coupling in the scalar one. As our analysis is performed in a gauge-independent way, this result can be cast in the form of a no-go theorem for non-singular bounces with generalized Proca. In contrast to the no-go theorem found for Horndeski theories, however, it cannot be evaded by considering beyond generalized Proca theory. At the core of our result lies the non-dynamical nature of the temporal component of the vector field, which renders it an ill-suited mediator for a bouncing solution.</description>

Abstract: Axions have long been considered plausible candidates for dark matter. The axion dark matter emitted from cosmic strings after the Peccei-Quinn (PQ) symmetry breaking in the early Universe was extensively simulated. In this work, we study dark matter and gravitational waves through the lattice simulation of the Axion-Higgs string. We gave the dark matter overproduction and the Big Bang nucleosynthesis bounds on the axion decay constant $f_a$ and the axion mass $m_a$ for axion-like particles, and found that the predicted gravitational wave spectra cannot be probed by the dataset of the current pulsar timing array experiments.</description>

      <title>The radio properties of the JWST-discovered AGN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the radio emission of spectroscopically confirmed, X-ray weak, Broad Line AGN (BLAGN, or type 1) selected with JWST in the GOODS-N field, one of the fields with the best combination of deep radio observations and statistics of JWST-selected BLAGN. We use deep radio data at different frequencies (144\,MHz, 1.5\,GHz, 3\,GHz, 5.5\,GHz, 10\,GHz), and we find that none of the 22 sources investigated is detected at any of the aforementioned frequencies. Similarly, the radio stacking analysis does not reveal any detection down to an rms of $\sim 0.2\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$, corresponding to a $3\sigma$ upper limit at rest frame 5 GHz of $L_{5GHz}=2\times10^{39}$ erg s$^{-1}$ at the mean redshift of the sample $z\sim 5.2$. We compared this and individual sources upper limits with expected radio luminosities estimated assuming different AGN scaling relations. For most of the sources the radio luminosity upper limits are still compatible with expectations for radio-quiet (RQ) AGN; nevertheless, the more stringent stacking upper limits and the fact that no detection is found would suggest that JWST-selected BLAGN are weaker than standard AGN even at radio frequencies. We discuss some scenarios that could explain the possible radio weakness, such as free-free absorption from a dense medium, or the lack of either magnetic field or a corona, possibly as a consequence of super-Eddington accretion. These scenarios would also explain the observed X-ray weakness. We also conclude that $\sim$1 dex more sensitive radio observations are needed to better constrain the level of radio emission (or lack thereof) for the bulk of these sources. The Square Kilometer Array Observatory (SKAO) will likely play a crucial role in assessing the properties of this AGN population.</description>

      <title>Time-Frequency Correlation of Repeating Fast Radio Bursts: Correlated Aftershocks Tend to Exhibit Downward Frequency Drifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The production mechanism of fast radio bursts (FRBs) remains elusive, and potential correlations between burst occurrence times and various burst properties may offer important clues. Among them, the spectral peak frequency is particularly important because it may encode direct information about the physical conditions and environment at the emission site. Analyzing over 4,000 bursts from the three most active sources -- FRB 20121102A, FRB 20201124A, and FRB 20220912A -- we measure the two-point correlation function $\xi(\Delta t, \Delta\nu_{\:\rm peak}\:)$ in the two-dimensional space of time separation $\Delta t$ and peak frequency shift $\Delta\nu_{\:\rm peak}\:$ between burst pairs. We find a universal trend of asymmetry about $\Delta\nu_{\:\rm peak}\:$ at high statistical significance; $\xi(\Delta\nu_{\:\rm peak}\:)$ decreases as $\Delta\nu_{\:\rm peak}\:$ increases from negative to positive values in the region of short time separation ($\Delta t &lt; 0.3$ s), where physically correlated aftershock events produce a strong time correlation signal. This indicates that aftershocks tend to exhibit systematically lower peak frequencies than mainshocks, with this tendency becoming stronger at shorter $\Delta t$. We argue that the "sad trombone effect" -- the downward frequency drift observed among sub-pulses within a single event -- is not confined within a single event but manifests as a statistical nature that extends continuously to independent yet physically correlated aftershocks with time separations up to $\Delta t \sim 0.3$ s. This discovery provides new insights into underlying physical processes of repeater FRBs.</description>

      <title>Influence of mergers on LyC escape of high redshift galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aims: We investigate the impact of galaxy mergers on the Lyman Continuum (LyC) radiation escape, fesc, from high-redshift galaxies. Methods: We post-process ~ 6e5 galaxies (redshift 5.2 &lt; z &lt; 10) extracted from the TNG50 cosmological simulation using a physically motivated analytic model for LyC escape. Results: Galaxies that have not experienced a merger for the last ~ 700 Myr have an average fesc ~ 3%, which increases to up to 14% immediately following a merger. The strongest effect can be observed in galaxies with stellar masses of ~ 1e7 Msun. We attribute the increase in the escape fraction to two main factors: (i) accretion of metal-poor gas onto the central region of a galaxy, which feeds star formation and LyC emission; and (ii) displacement of neutral gas relative to star-forming regions, which reduces the optical depth to LyC photons. We additionally examine how proximity to other galaxies influences LyC escape, finding that galaxies with more neighbors tend to have more frequent mergers, and thus a higher LyC leakage. However, galaxies in overdense regions tend to have a larger LyC escape fraction independently from mergers, because of their higher gas inflow, and consequent increase in the star formation rate. The increase in both mergers and gas inflow could contribute to low-mass galaxies ionizing proximity zones of high-z Ly-alpha leakers recently observed with JWST.</description>

      <title>Elevated UV luminosity density at Cosmic Dawn explained by non-evolving, weakly mass-dependent star formation efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02674v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have uncovered unexpectedly high cosmic star formation activity in the early Universe, mere hundreds of millions of years after the Big Bang. These observations are often understood to reflect an evolutionary shift in star formation efficiency (SFE) caused by changing galactic conditions during these early epochs. We present FIREbox-HR, a high-resolution, cosmological hydrodynamical simulation from the Feedback in Realistic Environments project, which offers insights into the SFE of galaxies during the first billion years of cosmic time. FIREbox-HR re-simulates the cosmic volume (L = 22.1 cMpc) of the original FIREbox run with eight times higher mass resolution (m_b ~ 7800 M_sun), but with identical physics, down to z ~ 6. FIREbox-HR predicts ultraviolet (UV) luminosity functions in good agreement with available observational data. The simulation also successfully reproduces the observed cosmic UV luminosity density at z ~ 6 - 14, demonstrating that relatively high star formation activity in the early Universe is a natural outcome of the baryonic processes encoded in the FIRE-2 model. According to FIREbox-HR, the SFE - halo mass relation for intermediate mass halos (M_halo ~ 10^9 - 10^11 M_sun) does not significantly evolve with redshift and is only weakly mass-dependent. These properties of the SFE - halo mass relation lead to a larger contribution from lower mass halos at higher z, driving the gradual evolution of the observed cosmic UV luminosity density. A theoretical model based on the SFE - halo mass relation inferred from FIREbox-HR allows us to explore implications for galaxy evolution. Future observations of UV faint galaxies at z &gt; 12 will provide an opportunity to further test these predictions and deepen our understanding of star formation during Cosmic Dawn.</description>

      <title>Emulation of $f(R)$ modified gravity from $\Lambda$CDM using conditional GANs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15934v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A major aim of cosmological surveys is to test deviations from the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, but the full scientific value of these surveys will only be realised through efficient simulation methods that keep up with the increasing volume and precision of observational data. $N$-body simulations of modified gravity (MG) theories are computationally expensive since highly non-linear equations must be solved. This represents a significant bottleneck in the path to reach the data volume and resolution attained by equivalent $\Lambda$CDM simulations. We develop a field-level neural network-based emulator that generates density and velocity divergence fields under the $f(R)$ gravity MG model from the corresponding $\Lambda$CDM simulated fields. Using attention mechanisms and a complementary frequency-based loss function, our model is able to learn this intricate mapping. We use the idea of latent space extrapolation to generalise our emulator to $f(R)$ models with differing field strengths. The predictions of our emulator agree with the $f(R)$ simulations to within 5% for matter density and to within 10% for velocity divergence power spectra up to $k \sim 2\,h$ $\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$. But for a few select cases, higher-order statistics are reproduced with $\lesssim$10% agreement. Latent extrapolation allows our emulator to generalise to different parameterisations of the $f(R)$ model without explicitly training on those variants. Given a $\Lambda$CDM simulation, the GPU-based emulator can reproduce the equivalent $f(R)$ realisation $\sim$600 times faster than full $N$-body simulations. This lays the foundations for a valuable tool for realistic yet rapid mock field generation and robust cosmological analyses.</description>

      <title>BLAST: Beyond Limber Angular power Spectra Toolkit. A fast and efficient algorithm for 3x2 pt analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03632v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The advent of next-generation photometric and spectroscopic surveys is approaching, bringing more data with tighter error bars. As a result, theoretical models will become more complex, incorporating additional parameters, which will increase the dimensionality of the parameter space and make posteriors more challenging to explore. Consequently, the need to improve and speed up our current analysis pipelines will grow. In this work, we focus on the 3x2pt statistics, a summary statistic that has become increasingly popular in recent years due to its great constraining power. These statistics involve calculating angular two-point correlation functions for the auto- and cross-correlations between galaxy clustering and weak lensing. The corresponding model is determined by integrating the product of the power spectrum and two highly-oscillating Bessel functions over three dimensions, which makes the evaluation particularly challenging. Typically, this difficulty is circumvented by employing the so-called Limber approximation, which is an important source of error. We present BLAST, an innovative and efficient algorithm for calculating angular power spectra without employing the Limber approximation or assuming a scale-dependent growth rate, based on the use of Chebyshev polynomials. The algorithm is compared with the publicly available beyond-Limber codes, whose performances were recently tested by the Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time Dark Energy Science Collaboration. At similar accuracy, BLAST is $\approx 10$-$15 \times$ faster than the winning method of the challenge, also showing excellent scaling with respect to various hyper-parameters. BLAST is publicly available on GitHub, and we release a repository where we explain how to use the code.</description>

      <title>The Massive and Distant Clusters of WISE Survey 2: Second Data Release</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15303v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the second data release of the Massive and Distant Clusters of WISE Survey 2 (MaDCoWS2). We expand from the equatorial first data release to most of the Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey area, covering a total area of 6498 deg^2. The catalog consists of 133,036 S/N $\geq5$ galaxy cluster candidates at $0.1\leq z \leq2$, including 6790 candidates at z &gt; 1.5. We train a convolutional neural network (CNN) to identify spurious detections, and include CNN-based cluster probabilities in the final catalog. We also compare the MaDCoWS2 sample with literature catalogs in the same area. The larger sample provides robust results that are consistent with our first data release. At S/N $\geq5$, we rediscover 59-91% of clusters in existing catalogs that lie in the unmasked area of MC2. The median positional offsets are under 250 kpc, and the standard deviation of the redshifts is 0.031(1+z). We fit a redshift-dependent power law to the relation between MaDCoWS2 S/N and observables from existing catalogs. Over the redshift ranges where the surveys overlap with MaDCoWS2, the lowest scatter is found between S/N and observables from optical/infrared surveys. We also assess the performance of our method using a mock light cone measuring purity and completeness as a function of cluster mass. The purity is above 90%, and we estimate the 50% completeness threshold at a virial mass of log(M/M$_\odot$)$\approx14.3$. The completeness estimate is uncertain due to the small number of massive halos in the light cone, but consistent with the recovery fraction found by comparing to other cluster catalogs.</description>

      <title>Estimating the Masses of Supercluster-Scale Filaments from Redshift Dispersions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19659v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a strategy for estimating the mass per unit length along supercluster-scale filaments that are oriented across the sky, based on mock redshift surveys of 264 filaments from the Millennium simulation. In our fiducial scenario, we place each simulated filament at a distance of 300 Mpc, perpendicular to the line of sight, and calculate the redshift dispersion using galaxies with magnitudes r&lt;19.5. Some regions are dynamically complicated in ways that interfere with finding a simple relationship between dispersion sigma and linear mass density mu. However, by examining individual overlapping segments along the filaments, we find a relationship that allows us to successfully predict log(mu) from log(sigma) with a scatter of about +/- 0.20 dex, for ~ 70% of the regions along filaments. This relationship is robust to changes in the distance to the filament if the physical segment length and the absolute magnitude for galaxy selection are held constant. The relationship between redshift dispersion and mass is similar to that obtained for a simple analytical model where filaments are dynamically relaxed, and we examine the possibility that the galaxies are indeed relaxed within the gravitational potential of the filament. We find that this is not the case; galaxy dynamics are strongly effected by infall to the filament and by orbits within groups and clusters</description>

      <title>Bridge the Cosmological Tensions with Thawing Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11743v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is found that a non-minimally coupled scalar tensor theory, Thawing Gravity (TG), can explain multiple tensions plaguing the standard cosmological model $\Lambda$CDM while fitting better to observations than the latter. Using the standard Bayes model comparison method, TG has moderate evidence over $\Lambda$CDM with a Bayes factor $\ln B=+1.5$ in the baseline analysis including CMB, BAO and SNIa. In the baseline+$H_0$ analysis which further takes into account the Cepheids calibration of the SNIa distance ladder from SH0ES, TG has very strong evidence over $\Lambda$CDM with $\ln B=+11.8$. In particular, TG yields $H_0=71.78\pm0.86 \ {\rm km/s/Mpc}$ and $S_8=0.793\pm0.012$, consistent with both the local $H_0$ measurement and the large scale structure surveys. TG predicts a prerecombination Newtonian constant $G_{\rm CMB}$ different from today's value $G_N$. A $\sim2\sigma$ hint for $G_{\rm CMB}/G_N&gt;1$ is recovered in the baseline analysis with CMB+BAO+SNIa, which becomes a $&gt;4\sigma$ detection when one further takes into account the local $H_0$ measurement. The obtained $G_{\rm CMB}/G_N$ is consistent with current BBN constraint and can be tested by future observations.</description>

      <title>It\^{o}, Stratonovich, and zoom-in schemes in stochastic inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12465v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The It\^{o} and Stratonovich approaches are two ways to integrate stochastic differential equations. Detailed knowledge of the origin of the stochastic noise is needed to determine which approach suits a particular problem. I discuss this topic pedagogically in stochastic inflation, where the noise arises from a changing comoving coarse-graining scale or, equivalently, from `zooming in' into inflating space. I introduce a zoom-in scheme where deterministic evolution alternates with instantaneous zoom-in steps. I show that this alternating zoom-in scheme is equivalent to the It\^{o} approach in the Markovian limit, while the Stratonovich approach doesn't have a similar interpretation. In the full non-Markovian setup, the difference vanishes. The framework of zoom-in schemes clarifies the relationship between computations in stochastic inflation, linear perturbation theory, and the classical $\Delta N$ formalism. It informs the numerical implementation of stochastic inflation and is a building block for a first-principles derivation of the stochastic equations.</description>

      <title>Observations of the galaxy cluster CL 0217+70 and its surrounding region at 1.4 GHz with the Sardinia Radio Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15543v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the results of observations performed with the Sardinia Radio Telescope (SRT) at 1.3-1.8 GHz of the galaxy cluster CL 0217+70 and a $3^\circ \times 3^\circ$ region around it. We combine the SRT data with archival Very Large Array (VLA) data to obtain images having the VLA angular resolution, but sensitive up to largest scales. The SRT+VLA combination allows us to derive a cluster radio halo flux density higher by $\sim14\%$ compared to the VLA-only data, although consistent within $1\sigma$. We derive a spectral index map between 140 MHz and 1.4 GHz, finding an extended region with spectral index $\alpha\sim0.6$ on the external part of the south-eastern candidate relic, questioning the real nature of this relic. Moreover, we detect an extended emission outside the cluster in the south-eastern area, having an angular extension of $\sim50$ arcmin on the longer side, which would correspond to $\sim10$ Mpc at the cluster distance; the emissivity that this region would have if located at the cluster distance is in line with the one estimated in candidate filaments of the cosmic web; however, the peculiar orientation of this region, not pointed towards the cluster, and the low Galactic latitude of this cluster suggest that its origin can be due to a foreground emission originating in our Galaxy.</description>

      <title>Measuring the Mean Free Path of HI Ionizing Photons at $3.2\leq z\leq4.6$ with DESI Y1 Quasars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15838v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The mean free path of ionizing photons for neutral hydrogen ($\lambda_\mathrm{mfp}^{912}$) is a crucial quantity in modelling the ionization state of the intergalactic medium (IGM) and the extragalactic ultraviolet background (EUVB), and is widely used in hydrodynamical simulations of galaxies and reionization. We construct the largest quasar spectrum dataset to date -- 12,595 $\mathrm{S/N}&gt;3$ spectra -- using the Y1 observation of Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) to make the most precise model-independent measurement of the mean free path at $3.2\leq z\leq 4.6$. By stacking the spectra in 17 redshift bins and modelling the Lyman continuum profile, we get a redshift evolution $\lambda_\mathrm{mfp}^{912}\propto(1+z)^{-4.27}$ at $2\leq z\leq 5$, which is much shallower than previous estimates. We then explore the sources of systematic bias, including the choice of intrinsic quasar continuum, the consideration of Lyman series opacity and Lyman limit opacity evolution and the definition of $\lambda_\mathrm{mfp}^{912}$. Combining our results with estimates of $\lambda_\mathrm{mfp}^{912}$ at higher redshifts, we conclude at high confidence that the evolution in $\lambda_\mathrm{mfp}^{912}$ steepens at $z \approx 5$. We interpret this inflection as the transition from the end of HI reionization to a fully ionized plasma which characterizes the intergalactic medium of the past $\sim10$ billion years.</description>

      <title>Linear response theory for light dark matter-electron scattering in materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06817v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We combine the non-relativistic effective theory of dark matter (DM) - electron interactions with linear response theory to obtain a formalism that fully accounts for screening and collective excitations in DM-induced electronic transition rate calculations for general DM-electron interactions. In the same way that the response of a dielectric material to an external electric field in electrodynamics is described by the dielectric function, so in our formalism the response of a detector material to a DM perturbation is described by a set of generalised susceptibilities which can be directly related to densities and currents arising from the non-relativistic expansion of the Dirac Hamiltonian. We apply our formalism to assess the sensitivity of non-spin-polarised detectors, and find that in-medium effects significantly affect the experimental sensitivity if DM couples to the detector's electron density, while being decoupled from other densities and currents. Our formalism can be straightforwardly extended to the case of spin-polarised materials.</description>

Abstract: Solid-state detectors with a low energy threshold have several applications, including searches of non-relativistic halo dark-matter particles with sub-GeV masses. When searching for relativistic, beyond-the-Standard-Model particles with enhanced cross sections for small energy transfers, a small detector with a low energy threshold may have better sensitivity than a larger detector with a higher energy threshold. In this paper, we calculate the low-energy ionization spectrum from high-velocity particles scattering in a dielectric material. We consider the full material response including the excitation of bulk plasmons. We generalize the energy-loss function to relativistic kinematics, and benchmark existing tools used for halo dark-matter scattering against electron energy-loss spectroscopy data. Compared to calculations commonly used in the literature, such as the Photo-Absorption-Ionization model or the free-electron model, including collective effects shifts the recoil ionization spectrum towards higher energies, typically peaking around 4--6 electron-hole pairs. We apply our results to the three benchmark examples: millicharged particles produced in a beam, neutrinos with a magnetic dipole moment produced in a reactor, and upscattered dark-matter particles. Our results show that the proper inclusion of collective effects typically enhances a detector's sensitivity to these particles, since detector backgrounds, such as dark counts, peak at lower energies.</description>

Abstract: The existence of a set of $10$ Intrinsic Conformal Symmetries, which acts on three-dimensional hypersurfaces (spacelike or timelike), leads to the existence of two distinct families of 5D geometries. These models represent the general solutions of the bulk field equations where their energy-momentum tensor, includes only two components: a negative cosmological constant and a parallel pressure $p_{\parallel}$ aligned with the extra spatial dimension. Significantly, these models offer a novel perspective for investigating the impacts of spatial inhomogeneity and anisotropy on the cosmological evolution of the Universe, particularly within the context of the braneworld scenarios. It is shown that one of these families reduces to a \emph{fully inhomogeneous, anisotropic and conformally flat brane model} with a \emph{perfect fluid equation of state} and corresponds to the Stephani Universe (i.e. a Stephani brane) which implies that our model can be matched smoothly with the standard FRW model. We provide the generalized Friedmann and Raychaudhuri equations and we present how the additional quantities could affect the cosmological evolution. In particular we show that the new constituents are the terms $p_{\parallel }$, $\sigma ^{2}$ and the four acceleration of the brane observers that could affect the observational measurement of the Hubble parameter depending on which term dominates therefore provide us a potential answer to the Hubble tension and cosmic acceleration problems due to local inhomogeneities and anisotropies.</description>

      <title>Bayesian evidence estimation from posterior samples with normalizing flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12294v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel method ($floZ$), based on normalizing flows, to estimate the Bayesian evidence (and its numerical uncertainty) from a pre-existing set of samples drawn from the unnormalized posterior distribution. We validate it on distributions whose evidence is known analytically, up to 15 parameter space dimensions, and compare with two state-of-the-art techniques for estimating the evidence: nested sampling (which computes the evidence as its main target) and a $k$-nearest-neighbors technique that produces evidence estimates from posterior samples. Provided representative samples from the target posterior are available, our method is more robust to posterior distributions with sharp features, especially in higher dimensions. For a simple multivariate Gaussian, we demonstrate its accuracy for up to 200 dimensions with $10^5$ posterior samples. $floZ$ has wide applicability, e.g., to estimate evidence from variational inference, Markov Chain Monte Carlo samples, or any other method that delivers samples and their likelihood from the unnormalized posterior density. As a physical application, we use $floZ$ to compute the Bayes factor for the presence of the first overtone in the ringdown signal of the gravitational wave data of GW150914, finding good agreement with nested sampling.</description>

      <title>Measuring gravitational wave memory with LISA</title>

Abstract: Gravitational wave (GW) astronomy has revolutionized our capacity to explore nature. The next generation of observatories, among which the space-borne detector Laser Interferometer Space Antenna LISA, is expected to yield orders of magnitude of signal-to-noise ratio improvement, and reach fainter and novel features of General Relativity. Among them, an exciting possibility is the detection of GW memory. Interpreted as a permanent deformation of the background spacetime after a GW perturbation has passed through the detector, GW memory offers a novel avenue to proof-test General Relativity, access the non-linear nature of gravity, and provide complementary information to better characterize the GW source. Previous studies have shown that GW memory detection from individual mergers of massive black hole binaries is expected with LISA. However, these works have not simulated the proper time domain response of the detector to the GW memory. This work is filling this gap and presents the detection prospects of LISA regarding GW memory and the expected signature of GW memory on the data-streams using the most up-to-date LISA consortium simulations of the response. We focus on the GW memory of massive black hole binary mergers and use state-of-the-art population models to assess the likelihood of detecting the GW memory within the LISA lifetime. We conclude that GW memory will be a key feature of several events detected by LISA, and will help to exploit the scientific potential of the mission fully.</description>

      <title>Unlocking Discovery Potential for Decaying Dark Matter and Faint X-ray Sources with XRISM</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18189v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Astrophysical emission lines arising from particle decays can offer unique insights into the nature of dark matter (DM). Using dedicated simulations with background and foreground modeling, we comprehensively demonstrate that the recently launched XRISM space telescope with powerful X-ray spectroscopy capabilities is particularly well-suited to probe decaying DM, such as sterile neutrinos and axion-like particles, in the mass range of few to tens of keV. We analyze and map XRISM's DM discovery potential parameter space by considering Milky Way Galactic DM halo, including establishing an optimal line-of-sight search, as well as dwarf galaxies where we identify Segue 1 as a remarkably promising target. We demonstrate that with only 100 ks exposure XRISM/Resolve instrument is capable of probing the underexplored DM parameter window around few keV and testing DM couplings with sensitivity that exceeds by two orders existing Segue 1 limits. Further, we demonstrate that XRISM/Xtend instrument sensitivity enables discovery of the nature of faint astrophysical X-ray sources, especially in Segue 1, which could shed light on star-formation history. We discuss implications for decaying DM searches with improved detector energy resolution in future experiments.</description>

      <title>Reverberation mapping of high-mass and high-redshift quasars using gravitational time delays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00073v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mass estimates of black holes (BHs) in the centers of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) often rely on the radius-luminosity relation. However, this relation, usually probed by reverberation mapping (RM), is poorly constrained in the high-luminosity and high-redshift ends due to the very long expected RM lag times. Multiply imaged AGN may offer a unique opportunity to explore the radius-luminosity relation at these ends. In addition to comprising several magnified images enabling a more efficient light-curve sampling, the time delay between multiple images of strongly lensed quasars can also aid in making such RM measurements feasible on reasonable timescales: If the strong-lensing time delay is, for example, of the order of the expected RM time lag, changes in the emission lines in the leading image can be observed around the same time as the changes in the continuum in the trailing image. In this work we probe the typical time-delay distribution in galaxy-cluster lenses and estimate the number of both high-mass ($\sim10^9-10^{10}$ M$_{\odot}$), and high-redshift ($z\gtrsim4-12$) quasars that are expected to be strongly lensed by clusters. We find that up to several dozen thousand M$_{BH}\sim10^{6}$-$10^{8}$ M$_{\odot}$ broad-line AGN at $z&gt;4$ should be multiply imaged by galaxy clusters and detectable with JWST, hundreds with Euclid and several thousands with the Roman Space Telescope, across the whole sky. These could supply an important calibration for the BH mass scaling in the early Universe.</description>

      <title>Exact Solution to Standard Model Hydrodynamic Cosmological Perturbation Theory and its Implications for Acoustic Oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11735v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an exact solution to standard model cosmological perturbation theory in a matter-dominated, adiabatic, hydrodynamic era. The solution is in the form of hypergeometric functions. While such functions can oscillate with the sound velocity, they can only do so at high frequency.</description>

      <title>A long freeze is hard to achieve in the presence of matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16344v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Certain holographic dark energy (HDE) models allow for the possibility of a ``long freeze,'' in which the scale factor evolves to a constant in the long-time limit. Here we extend previous calculations by adding a nonrelativistic matter component. The addition of a matter component tends to destroy the long freeze behavior, driving the universe to recollapse. Long freeze evolution is still possible, but only for a limited set of HDE models.</description>
