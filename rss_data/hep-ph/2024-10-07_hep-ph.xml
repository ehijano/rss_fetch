      <title>Neutrino mass and ultralight dark matter mass from the Higgs mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a model where the small neutrino masses are generated via the Higgs mechanism, mediated by an ultralight dark matter (ULDM) field with a mass $m\gtrsim 10^{-23} eV$ and a characteristic energy scale of $O(10) eV$. The resulting neutrino masses, as well as the mass and self-interaction strength of ULDM, are consistent with cosmological observations. The phase transition temperature for spontaneous symmetry breaking of ULDM occurs near the grand unification theory (GUT) scale. In this framework, neutrino masses can vary with spacetime, a feature that may be experimentally detectable by neutrino oscillation experiments. Additionally, we explore a scenario where the tiny ULDM mass is generated through radiative corrections via the Coleman-Weinberg mechanism, starting from a massless field theory. Our model addresses both the neutrino mass and ULDM mass puzzles through a unified mechanism, offering insights into possible extensions of the Standard Model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The FAIR Universe -- HiggsML Uncertainty Challenge focuses on measuring the physics properties of elementary particles with imperfect simulators due to differences in modelling systematic errors. Additionally, the challenge is leveraging a large-compute-scale AI platform for sharing datasets, training models, and hosting machine learning competitions. Our challenge brings together the physics and machine learning communities to advance our understanding and methodologies in handling systematic (epistemic) uncertainties within AI techniques.</description>

      <title>SIMP dark matter during reheating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strongly interacting massive particle (SIMP) has become one of the promising dark matter (DM) candidates due to its capability of addressing the small-scale anomaly, where the final DM abundance is set via the freeze-out of $3\rightarrow 2$ or $4\rightarrow 2$ annihilation process involving solely the dark sector particles. In this work, we explore the freeze-out of SIMP DM during the inflationary reheating epoch. During reheating, the radiation energy density evolves differently based on the shape of inflaton potential and spin of its decay products than the standard radiation-dominated picture; as a result, in this scenario, the freeze-out temperature varies distinctly with DM mass compared to the standard case. Large entropy injection due to inflaton decay demands a smaller cross-section to satisfy the observed relic than the standard radiation-dominated freeze-out case. The required cross-section, satisfying the relic density constraint and the maximum allowed thermally averaged cross-section by the unitarity of the $S$-matrix, set an upper limit on the DM mass. The upper bound on the mass of the dark matter for $3\rightarrow2$ ( $4\rightarrow2$ ) is $1$ GeV ($7$ MeV), assuming a radiation-dominated background. Interstingly, these limits get relaxed to $10^6$ ($10^4$) GeV for $3\rightarrow2$ ( $4\rightarrow2$ ) SIMP dark matter for quadratic inflaton potential. We find that a small amount of DM parameter space survives for reheating with quadratic inflaton potential after considering the lower bound of reheating temperature, put by the latest CMB observation depending on the inflationary models. In the case of the quartic inflaton potential, the allowed DM parameter space gets reduced compared to the quadratic case.</description>

      <title>Superconducting strings in the two-Higgs doublet model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present superconducting vortex solutions in the two-Higgs doublet model which has a gauged $U(1)$ Higgs-family symmetry. We write down an ansatz for the solution and study its basic properties, for the case of both global and gauged symmetries. We demonstrate its prima-facie stability using 3D numerical simulations of a global version of the theory, observing the flow of current along the string. We discuss how generic such a phenomena might be and the possible consequences if such a model is found in nature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate two-loop massive master integrals for $e^{+}e^{-}\rightarrow2\gamma$ in terms of generalized power series with respect to electron mass. The coefficients of this series are expressed via Goncharov's polylogarithms. Our approach exploits a number of modern multiloop methods: IBP reduction, differential equations for master integrals, Frobenius method, reduction to $\epsilon$-form, and DRA method.</description>

      <title>On the orthogonal matrix in the Casas-Ibarra parametrization for the Yukawa interactions of Majorana neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Casas-Ibarra (CI) parametrization of the Yukawa coupling matrix of Majorana neutrinos is generalized by considering the exact seesaw relation and including non-unitarity of the $3 \times 3$ Pontecorvo-Maki-Nakagawa-Sakata (PMNS) flavor mixing matrix. With the help of a full $6 \times 6$ Euler-like block description of the flavor structure for the seesaw mechanism, we find that the orthogonal matrix $\mathbb{O}$ in the CI parametrization can be expressed as $\mathbb{O}^{}_{ij} = \sqrt{M^{}_j/m^{}_i} \hspace{0.05cm} F^{}_{ij}$ with $m^{}_i$ and $M^{}_j$ being the masses of light and heavy Majorana neutrinos and $F^{}_{ij}$ consisting of the PMNS and active-sterile flavor mixing parameters (for $i, j = 1, 2, 3$). Assuming a specific pattern of $\mathbb{O}$ is therefore equivalent to imposing some special conditions on the seesaw parameter space.</description>

      <title>Searching for type I seesaw mechanism in a two Heavy Neutral Leptons scenario at FCC-ee</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the search for heavy neutral leptons (HNL) in the type I seesaw mechanism at the Future Circular Collider in its $e^+e^-$ stage (FCC-ee), considering an integrated luminosity of 204 ab$^{-1}$ collected at the Z pole. The study examines two generations of heavy neutral leptons produced in association with Standard Model (SM) neutrinos and decaying to a purely leptonic final state. This theoretical framework can explain neutrino oscillations and other open questions of the SM, providing a broader perspective on the relevance of this experimental search. The analysis is performed using a fast simulation of the IDEA detector concept to study potential HNL interactions at the FCC-ee. The sensitivity contours are obtained from a selection of kinematic variables aimed at improving the signal-to-background ratio for the prompt production case. In the case of long-lived HNLs, the background can be almost fully eliminated by exploiting their displaced decay vertices. The study shows that the FCC-ee has a significant sensitivity to observing these objects in a region of the phase space not accessible by other experiments.</description>

      <title>First results from a search for axionlike dark matter using octupole-deformed nuclei in a crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most of the matter in the universe is in the form of dark matter. However, dark matter has never been observed to interact with normal matter in laboratory experiments. ALPs -- ultralight axionlike particles -- are a class of dark matter models that are consistent with astrophysical constraints, and produce measurable signatures in the form of oscillating violations of discrete symmetries in nuclei. We report the first results from a search for oscillating parity-odd time-reversal-odd nuclear moments of $^{153}$Eu ions in a crystal, which leads to an experimental constraint on the ALP-gluon coupling strength across a wide band of ALP masses.</description>

      <title>Constraints on dark photon dark matter from Lyman-$\alpha$ forest simulations and an ultra-high signal-to-noise quasar spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ultralight dark photon is a well-motivated, hypothetical dark matter candidate. In a dilute plasma, they can resonantly convert into photons, and heat up the intergalactic medium between galaxies. In this work, we explore the dark photon dark matter parameter space by comparing synthetic Lyman-$\alpha$ forest data from cosmological hydrodynamical simulations to observational data from VLT/UVES of the quasar HE0940-1050 ($z_{\rm em}=3.09$). We use a novel flux normalization technique that targets under-dense gas, reshaping the flux probability distribution. Not only do we place robust constraints on the kinetic mixing parameter of dark photon dark matter, but notably our findings suggest that this model can still reconcile simulated and observed Doppler parameter distributions of $z\sim0$ Lyman-$\alpha$ lines, as seen by HST/COS. This work opens new pathways for the use of the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest to explore new physics, and can be extended to other scenarios such as primordial black hole evaporation, dark matter decay, and annihilation.</description>

      <title>Light Nuclei Femtoscopy and Baryon Interactions in 3 GeV Au+Au Collisions at RHIC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the measurements of proton-deuteron ($p$-$d$) and deuteron-deuteron ($d$-$d$) correlation functions in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}$ = 3 GeV using fixed-target mode with the STAR experiment at the Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider (RHIC). For the first time, the source size ($R_{G}$), scattering length ($f_{0}$), and effective range ($d_{0}$) are extracted from the measured correlation functions with a simultaneous fit. The spin-averaged $f_0$ for $p$-$d$ and $d$-$d$ interactions are determined to be -5.28 $\pm$ 0.11(stat.) $\pm$ 0.82(syst.) fm and -2.62 $\pm$ 0.02(stat.) $\pm$ 0.24(syst.) fm, respectively. The measured $p$-$d$ interaction is consistent with theoretical calculations and low-energy scattering experiment results, demonstrating the feasibility of extracting interaction parameters using the femtoscopy technique. The reasonable agreement between the experimental data and the calculations from the transport model indicates that deuteron production in these collisions is primarily governed by nucleon coalescence.</description>

      <title>Moments of Axial-Vector GPD from Lattice QCD: Quark Helicity, Orbital Angular Momentum, and Spin-Orbit Correlation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present a lattice QCD calculation of the Mellin moments of the twist-2 axial-vector generalized parton distribution (GPD), $\widetilde{H}(x,\xi,t)$, at zero skewness, $\xi$, with multiple values of the momentum transfer, $t$. Our analysis employs the short-distance factorization framework on ratio-scheme renormalized quasi-GPD matrix elements. The calculations are based on an $N_f=2+1+1$ twisted mass fermions ensemble with clover improvement, a lattice spacing of $a = 0.093$ fm, and a pion mass of $m_\pi = 260$ MeV. We consider both the iso-vector and iso-scalar cases, utilizing next-to-leading-order perturbative matching while ignoring the disconnected contributions and gluon mixing in the iso-scalar case. For the first time, we determine the Mellin moments of $\widetilde{H}$ up to the fifth order. From these moments, we discuss the quark helicity and orbital angular momentum contributions to the nucleon spin, as well as the spin-orbit correlations of the quarks. Additionally, we perform a Fourier transform over the momentum transfer, which allows us to explore the spin structure in the impact-parameter space.</description>

      <title>The Sommerfeld enhancement at NLO and the dark matter unitarity bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.01680v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We reexamine the consequences of perturbative unitarity on dark matter freeze-out when both Sommerfeld enhancement and bound state formation affect dark matter annihilations. At leading order (LO) the annihilation cross-section is infrared dominated and the connection between the unitarity bound and the upper bound on the dark matter mass depends only on how the different partial waves are populated. We compute how this picture is modified at next-to-leading order (NLO) with the goal of assigning a reliable theory uncertainty to the freeze-out predictions. We explicitly compute NLO corrections in a simple model with abelian gauge interactions and provide an estimate of the theoretical uncertainty for the thermal masses of heavy electroweak $n$-plets. Along the way, we clarify the regularization and matching procedure necessary to deal with singular potentials in quantum mechanics with a calculable, relativistic UV completion.</description>

      <title>Direct bounds on Left-Right gauge boson masses at LHC Run 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.06094v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While the third run of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is ongoing, the underlying theory that extends the Standard Model remains so far unknown. Left-Right Models (LRMs) introduce a new gauge sector, and can restore parity symmetry at high enough energies. If LRMs are indeed realized in nature, the mediators of the new weak force can be searched for in colliders via their direct production. We recast existing experimental bounds from LHC Run 2 on the heavy LRM gauge boson masses. As a novelty, we discuss the effect of the LRM scalar content on the total width of the new gauge bosons, obtaining model-independent bounds within the specific realizations of the LRM scalar sectors analysed here. These bounds avoid the need to detail the spectrum of the scalar sector, and apply in the general case where no discrete symmetry is enforced. Moreover, we emphasize the effect of the structure of the quark right-handed mixing matrix on the charged LRM gauge boson production at LHC. We find that $W_R$ and $Z_R$ masses are constrained to lie above $2$ TeV and $4$ TeV, respectively.</description>

      <title>Sub-GeV millicharge dark matter from the $U(1)_X$ hidden sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03837v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We conduct a comprehensive study on the sub-GeV millicharge dark matter produced through the freeze-in mechanism. We discuss in general the mixing mechanism, encompassing both kinetic mixing and mass mixing, between the $U(1)_X$ hidden sector and the standard model, which can generate millicharge carried by the dark fermions from the hidden sector. We discuss in depth how such millicharge is generated, and clarify several misunderstandings regarding this subject in the literature. Without employing an effective field theory approach, where the photon field directly mixed with the additional $U(1)$, we analyze a general renormalizable model and investigate the complete evolution of the hidden sector particles. Due to the substantial self-interactions among hidden sector particles, the evolution of the hidden sector temperature plays a crucial role, which is addressed concurrently with the number densities of hidden sector particles by solving a set of coupled Boltzmann equations. We thoroughly examine eight benchmark models from six distinct cases. Some of our key findings from the analysis of these benchmark models may be generalizable and applicable to broader freeze-in scenarios. We also explore the possibility that the $\mathcal{O}$(keV) $U(1)_X$ dark photon is a viable dark matter candidate, even though it can contribute at most $\sim 5\%$ to the total observed dark matter relic density.</description>

      <title>Combined Explanation of LHC Multi-Lepton, Di-Photon and Top-Quark Excesses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17314v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The LHC analyses of processes containing two or more leptons and missing energy, possibly in association with b-jets, show strong tensions with the Standard Model predictions and are known as multi-lepton anomalies. In particular, top-quark differential distributions point towards the associated production of new Higgs bosons decaying into bottom quarks and W bosons ($&gt;5\sigma$) with masses consistent with the di-photon excesses at 95GeV and 152GeV ($3.8\sigma$ and $4.9\sigma$, respectively). Furthermore, CMS found indications for resonant top-quark pair production at 400GeV ($3.5\sigma$) and both ATLAS and CMS reported elevated four-top and ttW cross-sections. In this article, we propose a combined explanation of these excesses by supplementing the SM Higgs with a second scalar doublet, a real scalar singlet ($S$) and a Higgs triplet with $Y=0$ ($\Delta$); the $\Delta$2HDMS. We fix the masses of the neutral triplet-like and the singlet-like scalars by the di-photon excesses, i.e. $m_{\Delta^0}=152$GeV and $m_S=95$GeV, respectively. Here, H, the CP-even component of the second doublet, is produced via gluon fusion from a top-loop and decays dominantly to $S+\Delta^0$ whose subsequent decays to WW and bb explain the differential top-quark distributions for $\sigma(pp\to H\to S\Delta^0)\approx6$pb. Fixing the top-Yukawa accordingly, the CP-odd Higgs boson A turns out to have the right production cross-section to account for the resonant top-pair excess at 400GeV, while the top-associated production of H and A results in new physics pollution of Standard Model ttW and four-top cross sections, as preferred by the data. Furthermore, a positive shift in the W mass is naturally induced by the vacuum expectation value of the triplet and we show that the most relevant signal strengths of the 152GeV boson are compatible with the process $pp\to H\to \Delta^0S$ if S is allowed to decay invisibly.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08668v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present BHAC-QGP, a new numerical code to simulate the evolution of matter created in heavy-ion collisions in the presence of electromagnetic fields. It is derived from the Black Hole Accretion Code (BHAC), which has been designed to model astrophysical processes in a general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamical description. As the original Black Hole Accretion Code, BHAC-QGP benefits from the use of Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR), which allows us to dynamically adjust the resolution where necessary, and makes use of time-dependent Milne coordinates and the ultrarelativistic equation of state, $P = e/3$. We demonstrate that BHAC-QGP accurately passes a number of systematic and rigorous tests.</description>

      <title>Study of electron-positron annihilation into $K\bar{K}\pi$ within resonance chiral theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14294v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, a coherent study of the $e^+e^-$ annihilation into $K^+K^-\pi^0$, $K^0_SK^0_L\pi^0$ and $K^0_SK^\pm\pi^\mp$ is carried out within the framework of resonance chiral theory. The amplitudes are fixed by fitting to the experimental cross-section and invariant mass spectrum. With these amplitudes, one can calculate the hadronic vacuum polarization form factors of these processes. The leading order contributions of $\sigma(e^+e^- \to K\bar{K}\pi)$ to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon, $(g-2)_\mu$, is obtained as $a_\mu^{\rm HVP,LO}(e^+e^- \to K\bar{K}\pi)=(3.079\pm0.088)\times10^{-10}$ up to $E_{\rm cm}=2.3$ GeV.</description>

      <title>Natural Metric-Affine Inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18004v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider here natural inflation in the low energy (two-derivative) metric-affine theory containing only the minimal degrees of freedom in the inflationary sector, i.e. the massless graviton and the pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson (PNGB). This theory contains the Ricci-like and parity-odd Holst invariants together with non-minimal couplings between the PNGB and the above-mentioned invariants. The Palatini and Einstein-Cartan realizations of natural inflation are particular cases of our construction. Explicit models of this type featuring non-minimal couplings are shown to emerge from the microscopic dynamics of a QCD-like theory with an either sub-Planckian or trans-Planckian confining scale and that is renormalizable on Minkowski spacetime. Moreover, for these models, we find regions of the parameter space where the inflationary predictions agree with the most recent observations at the $2\sigma$ level. We find that in order to enter the $1\sigma$ region it is necessary (and sufficient) to have a finite value of the Barbero-Immirzi parameter and a sizable non-minimal coupling between the inflaton and the Holst invariant (with sign opposite to the Barbero-Immirzi parameter). Indeed, in this case the potential of the canonically normalized inflaton develops a plateau as shown analytically.</description>

Abstract: We study the rare semileptonic decays of $B_c$ mesons within the effective field theoretical framework of covariant confined quark model. The transition form factors corresponding to $B_c^+ \to D^{(*)+}$ and $B_c^+ \to D_s^{(*)+}$ are computed in the entire $q^2$ range. Using form factors, we compute the branching fractions and compare them with the available theoretical results. We also compute various physical observables such as forward-backward asymmetry, longitudinal and transverse polarizations as well as clean angular observables.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00961v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There is strong evidence for the existence of dark matter in a number of current experiments. We study dark matter using the $U(1)_X$SSM obtained from the $U(1)_X$ extension of the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM). In the $U(1)_X$SSM, we use the right-handed neutrino as a dark matter candidate, whose lightest mass eigenstate has cold dark matter features. In this paper, the relic density of right-handed neutrino as dark matter is investigated. For dark matter scattering, both spin-independent and spin-dependent cross sections are studied. In the final numerical results obtained, some parameter spaces can satisfy the constraints of the relic density and dark matter direct detection experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09994v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The neutrino experiments utilize heavy nuclear targets to achieve high statistics neutrino-nucleus interaction event rate, which leads to systematic uncertainties in the oscillation parameters due to the nuclear effects and uncertainties in the cross-section. Understanding the interaction of neutrinos with the nucleus becomes crucial in determining the oscillation parameters with high precision. We investigate the uncertainty in quasi-elastic interaction due to nuclear effects by selecting exactly 1 proton, 0 pions, and any number of neutrons in the final state in DUNE and MicroBooNE detectors, and the effects on the neutrino oscillation in the DUNE detector. The calorimetric method with this selection can be used for accurate neutrino energy reconstruction in the quasi-elastic channel where the nuclear effects are inevitable.</description>

Abstract: The identification of a hadron in the final state of hadron-collider events that feature a leptonically decaying vector boson can provide essential information on the parton content of the colliding protons. Moreover, the study of hadrons inside jets can provide deeper insights into the fragmentation dynamics. We provide theoretical predictions for specific observables involving either the production of a $Z$ boson in association with light charged hadrons inside a jet or the production of a $W$ boson together with a charmed hadron. We present results for various fragmentation functions and compare our predictions with measurements by LHCb and ATLAS at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV. Our predictions are obtained using the antenna subtraction formalism which has been extended to cope with infrared singularities associated to the fragmentation processes in a hadron-collider environment at NLO accuracy.</description>

      <title>Diphoton Signals of Muon-philic Scalars at DarkQuest</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17651v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the unique capability of the DarkQuest proton beam-dump experiment at Fermilab to discover new light resonances decaying into photons. As an example model, we focus on muon-philic scalar particles that decay to photons. This is one of the few minimal models that can address the $(g-2)_\mu$ anomaly at low mass. These scalars can be copiously produced by meson decays and muon bremsstrahlung. We point out that thanks to DarkQuest's compact geometry, muons can propagate through the dump and efficiently produce dark scalars near the end of the dump. This mechanism enables DarkQuest to be sensitive to both long-lived and prompt scalars. At the same time, di-photon signatures are generically not background free, and we discuss in detail the different sources of background and strategies to mitigate them. We find that the backgrounds can be sufficiently reduced for DarkQuest to test currently-viable $(g-2)_\mu$ parameter space.</description>

Abstract: The modifications imprinted on jets due to their interaction with Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP) are assessed by comparing samples of jets produced in nucleus-nucleus collisions and proton-proton collisions. The standard procedure ignores the effect of bin migration by comparing specific observables for jet populations at the same reconstructed jet transverse momentum ($p_T$). Since jet $p_T$ is itself modified by interaction with QGP, all such comparisons confound QGP induced modifications with changes that are simply a consequence of comparing jets that started out differently. The quantile matching procedure introduced by Brewer et al. directly estimates average fractional jet energy loss ($Q_{AA}$) and can thus mitigate this $p_T$ migration effect. In this work, we validate the procedure in more realistic scenarios that include medium response. We study the evolution of $Q_{AA}$ with jet radius, its sensitivity to minimum particle $p_T$ and medium response as implemented in two different models for jet evolution in heavy-ion collisions. Further, we use this procedure to establish that the difference between inclusive jet and $\gamma+$jet nuclear modification factors ($R_{AA}$) is dominated by differences in the spectral shape, leaving the colour charge of the jet initiating parton with a lesser role to play. Additionally, we compare $Q_{AA}$ to an experimentally proposed proxy for fractional jet energy loss, $S_{loss}$, showing that both quantities are similar, although the former provides a more clear physical interpretation. Finally, we show the size of the $p_T$ migration correction for four different substructure observables and how to reliably use the quantile procedure experimentally to improve existing measurements.</description>

Abstract: We have carried out a study of the $\gamma ~ p \rightarrow p K^{+} K^{*-} (K^{*-} \rightarrow K^{-} \pi^{0}) $, $ \gamma ~p \rightarrow p K^{+} K^{*-} ( K^{*-} \rightarrow \bar{K}^{0} \pi^{-} )$ and $ \gamma ~p \rightarrow K^{+} K^{-}p$ reactions, producing the $K^+ \Lambda(1800)$ final state, from the perspective that the $\Lambda(1800)$ resonance is dynamically generated from the interaction of $\bar{K}^* N$ with its coupled vector-baryon channels, in complete analogy to the $\Lambda(1405)$ generated from the interaction of $\bar{K} N$ and its coupled pseudoscalar-baryon channels. The two reactions are complementary and their mass distributions are tied to the particular nature of this resonance in that framework. We provide much information on the shapes and strength of the invariant mass distributions of these reactions, and the energy dependence of the cross sections, that when contrasted with future experiments should shed valuable light on the nature of this resonance and its analogy to the $\Lambda(1405)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00489v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The mass shift a spin-1 particle moving in the nuclear medium will depend on its polarization direction. To study polarization-independent mass shifts in the medium, we explore methods to isolate each polarization direction of spin-1 mesons through the angular-dependent two-body decay modes. Specifically, we study $\phi\to K^{+}K^{-}$, $\rho\to\pi\pi$, $K^{*}\to K\pi$, $\phi\to e^{+}e^{-}$ and $K_{1}\to\rho K(K^{*}\pi)$ decays. While each polarization mode can be isolated through angular dependencies, accomplishing the decomposition for the $K_1$ meson further requires measuring the polarization of the $\rho(K^*)$ meson. Concerning $K^{*}$ and $K_1$ mesons, since both particles have vacuum widths smaller than 100 MeV, they are ideal candidates for experimentally measuring chiral partners. The simultaneous observation of mass shifts of these chiral partners would provide valuable insights into the contribution of chiral symmetry breaking to the generation of hadron masses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.00241v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the late time behavior of the scalar part of the volume modulus and the dilaton in stringy quintessence model, focusing on their contributions to the Hubble slow-roll parameter $\epsilon$ which directly measures the deviation of the spacetime geometry from de Sitter space. When only one of the moduli is allowed to move, $\epsilon$ converges to the stable fixed point at late time. The fixed point value is larger than $1$, thus the slow-roll cannot be realized. Moreover, if the decay rate of the quintessence potential is larger than some critical value, the positivity of the potential imposes that the stable fixed point value is just given by $3$, independent of the details of the moduli dynamics. Otherwise, the fixed point value coincides with the potential slow-roll parameter. When both the volume modulus and the dilaton roll down the potential simultaneously, we can find the relation between the contributions of two moduli to $\epsilon$ satisfied at the fixed point. In this case, the fixed point value is not in general the simple sum of fixed point values in the single field case and cannot be larger than $3$.</description>

      <title>Nonmonotonic specific entropy on the transition line near the QCD critical point</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09519v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effect of the quantum chromodynamics (QCD) critical point on the isentropic trajectories in the QCD phase diagram. We point out that the universality of the critical equation of state and the third law of thermodynamics require the specific entropy (per baryon) along the coexistence (first-order transition) line to be nonmonotonic at least on one side of that line. Specifically, a maximum must occur. We show how the location of the maximum relative to the QCD critical point depends on the parameters of the critical equation of state commonly used in the literature. We then examine how the isentropic trajectories followed by adiabatically expanding heavy-ion collision fireballs behave near the critical point. We find that a crucial role is played by the sign of the isochoric temperature derivative of pressure at the critical point; this sign determines on which side of the coexistence curve the specific entropy must be nonmonotonic (i.e., has a maximum). We classify different scenarios of the adiabatic expansion that arise depending on the value of the discriminant parameter and the proximity of the trajectory to the critical point.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from first-order phase transitions in LISA: reconstruction pipeline and physics interpretation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03723v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a tool for the analysis of stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds from cosmological first-order phase transitions with LISA: we initiate a template databank for these signals, prototype their searches, and forecast their reconstruction. The templates encompass the gravitational wave signals sourced by bubble collisions, sound waves and turbulence. Accounting for Galactic and extra-Galactic foregrounds, we forecast the region of the parameter space that LISA will reconstruct with better than $\sim 10\,\%$ accuracy, if certain experimental and theoretical uncertainties are solved by the time LISA flies. We illustrate the accuracy with which LISA can reconstruct the parameters on a few benchmark signals, both in terms of the template parameters and the phase transition ones. To show the impact of the forecasts on physics beyond the Standard Model, we map the reconstructed benchmark measurements into the parameter spaces of the singlet extension of the Standard Model and of the classically conformal invariant $U(1)_{B-L}$ model.</description>

      <title>Distributions and Collision Rates of ALP Stars in the Milky Way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07908v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We apply current analytical knowledge on the characteristic mass and linear evolution of miniclusters down to redshift $z=0$ to the hypothetical minicluster distribution of the Milky Way. Using the mass-radius relation and a core-halo relation for stable soliton solutions composed of axion-like particles (ALPs), we connect the galactic minicluster mass distribution to that of their ALP star cores. We consider different temperature evolutions of the ALP field with masses in the range $10^{-12}\,\mathrm{eV} \leq m_a \leq 10^{-3}\,$eV and infer the abundance and properties of QCD axion- and ALP stars in our galaxy. We re-evaluate detection prospects for collisions of neutron stars with both ALP stars and miniclusters as well as relativistic ALP bursts, so-called Bosenovae. Our analysis shows that the collision rates between miniclusters and neutron stars can become as large as $\sim 10^5\,$yr$^{-1}$ galaxy$^{-1}$, but that the fraction of encounters that can lead to resonance between ALP mass and magnetosphere plasma frequency is generally well below $\sim 1\,$yr$^{-1}$ galaxy$^{-1}$, depending on the ALP model. We confirm previous results that merger rates of ALP stars are extremely small $&lt; 10^{-12}\,$yr$^{-1}$ galaxy$^{-1}$, while their host miniclusters can merge much more frequently, up to $\sim 10^3\,$yr$^{-1}$ galaxy$^{-1}$ for the QCD axion. We find that Bosenovae and parametric resonance are much more likely to lead to observable signatures than neutron star encounters. We also suggest that a combination of accretion and parametric resonance can lead to observable radio lines for a wide range of ALP masses $m_a$ and photon-couplings $g_{a\gamma\gamma}$.</description>

      <title>Using non-DESI data to confirm and strengthen the DESI 2024 spatially-flat $w_0w_a$CDM cosmological parameterization result</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00502v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use a combination of Planck cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy data and non-CMB data that include Pantheon+ type Ia supernovae (SNIa), Hubble parameter [$H(z)$], growth factor ($f\sigma_8$) measurements, and a collection of baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data, but not recent DESI 2024 BAO measurements, to confirm the DESI 2024 (DESI+CMB+PantheonPlus) data compilation support for dynamical dark energy with an evolving equation of state parameter $w(z) = w_0 + w_a z/(1+z)$. From our joint compilation of CMB and non-CMB data, in a spatially-flat cosmological model, we obtain $w_0 = -0.850 \pm 0.059$ and $w_a = -0.59^{+0.26}_{-0.22}$ and find that this dynamical dark energy is favored over a cosmological constant by $\sim 2\sigma$. Our data constraints on the flat $w_0w_a$CDM parameterization are slightly more restrictive than the DESI 2024 constraints, with the DESI 2024 and our values of $w_0$ and $w_a$ differing by $-0.27\sigma$ and $0.44\sigma$, respectively. Our data compilation slightly more strongly favors the flat $w_0w_a$CDM model over the flat $\Lambda$CDM model than does the DESI 2024 data compilation. We note that our CMB and non-CMB data $w_0w_a$CDM parameterization cosmological constraints are discrepant at 2.7$\sigma$, a little larger than the 1.9$\sigma$ discrepancy between DESI DR1 BAO and CMB data flat $\Lambda$CDM model cosmological constraints. We also show that if we remove the Pantheon+ SNIa contribution from the non-CMB data, for the $w_0w_a$CDM parameterization we still find tension between P18 and non-CMB data (2.5$\sigma$) and P18+lensing and non-CMB data (2.4$\sigma$). Even after the exclusion of Pantheon+ SNIa data the $\Lambda$CDM model is still disfavoured at $\sim 2\sigma$ c.l.</description>

      <title>Constraints on conformal ultralight dark matter couplings from the European Pulsar Timing Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01633v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Millisecond pulsars are extremely precise celestial clocks: as they rotate, the beamed radio waves emitted along the axis of their magnetic field can be detected with radio telescopes, which allows for tracking subtle changes in the pulsars' rotation periods. A possible effect on the period of a pulsar is given by a potential coupling to dark matter, in cases where it is modeled with an "ultralight" scalar field. In this paper, we consider a universal conformal coupling of the dark matter scalar to gravity, which in turn mediates an effective coupling between pulsars and dark matter. If the dark matter scalar field is changing in time, as expected in the Milky Way, this effective coupling produces a periodic modulation of the pulsar rotational frequency. By studying the time series of observed radio pulses collected by the European Pulsar Timing Array experiment, we present constraints on the coupling of dark matter, improving on existing bounds. These bounds can also be regarded as constraints on the parameters of scalar-tensor theories of the Fierz-Jordan-Brans-Dicke and Damour-Esposito-Far\`{e}se types in the presence of a (light) mass potential term.</description>

      <title>Quantum Statistical Effects on Warm Dark Matter and the Mass Constraint from the Cosmic Structure at Small Scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02159v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The suppression of the small-scale matter power spectrum is a distinct feature of Warm Dark Matter (WDM), which permits a constraint on the WDM mass from galaxy surveys. In the thermal relic WDM scenario, quantum statistical effects are not manifest. In a unified framework, we investigate the quantum statistical effects for a fermion case with a degenerate pressure and a boson case with a Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC). Compared to the thermal relic case, the degenerate fermion case only slightly lowers the mass bound, while the boson case with a high initial BEC fraction ($\gtrsim90\%$) significantly lowers it. On the other hand, the BEC fraction drops during the relativistic-to-nonrelativistic transition and completely disappears if the initial fraction is below $\sim64$\%. Given the rising interest in resolving the late-time galaxy-scale problems with boson condensation, a question is posed on how a high initial BEC fraction can be dynamically created so that a condensed DM component remains today.</description>

      <title>Energy dependence of the knee in the cosmic ray spectrum across the Milky Way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11911v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The all-particle spectrum of cosmic rays measured at Earth has a knee-like feature around 4 PeV. A priori, it is not clear if this is a local feature specific to the Solar neighbourhood in the Milky Way, or if it is a generic property of the Galactic cosmic-ray spectrum. We argue that combining gamma-ray and cosmic-ray data of LHAASO indicates that the knee is a local feature. In order to demonstrate this, we derive a model for the local cosmic-ray spectrum and composition, consistent with the recent LHAASO measurements of the all-particle spectrum and the mean logarithmic mass in the knee region. We calculate the spectrum of diffuse gamma-ray emission based on this model and find that the expected spectral shape of the diffuse gamma-ray flux disagrees with the LHAASO measurements of the diffuse gamma-ray emission in the 10-100 TeV energy range in the inner and outer Galaxy. We determine the break energy in the CR spectrum expected from these gamma-ray data and find it an energy ten times lower than obtained from local measurements.</description>

      <title>Curvature perturbations from kinetic preheating after $\alpha$-attractor inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14881v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Preheating at the end of inflation is a violent nonlinear process that efficiently transfers the energy of the inflaton to a second field, the preheat field. When the preheat field is light during inflation and its background value modulates the preheating process, the superhorizon isocurvature perturbations of the preheat field may be converted to curvature perturbations that leave an imprint on the cosmic microwave background and the large-scale structure of the universe. We use high-precision lattice simulations to study kinetic preheating after $\alpha$-attractor inflation, a case where the effective mass of the preheat field is naturally suppressed during inflation. By comparing the expansion e-folds between different Hubble patches, we find that the conversion from isocurvature perturbations to curvature perturbations is very inefficient and can hardly be detected by cosmological observations.</description>
