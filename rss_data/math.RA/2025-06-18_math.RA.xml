      <title>Associative Pentagon Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A set-theoretic solution to the Pentagon Equation can be described as a \emph{pentagon} algebra $(S, \cdot, \ast)$ such that $(S, \cdot)$ is a semigroup and the operations $\cdot$ and $\ast$ are related by two additional equations. This paper aims to investigate associative pentagon algebras in which $(S, \ast)$ is also a semigroup. We introduce and describe two families of associative pentagon algebras which are strongly determined by the properties of the semigroup $(S,\ast)$. We present a complete characterization of such algebras using semigroup equations. We also provide constructions of such associative pentagon algebras and give several classes of examples.</description>

      <title>A ringed-space-like structure on coalgebras for noncommutative algebraic geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by the perspective of Reyes' noncomutative spectral theory, we attempt to develop noncommutative algebraic geometry by introducing ringed coalgebras, which can be thought of as a noncommutative generalization of schemes over a field $k$. These objects arise from fully residually finite-dimensional(RFD) algebras introduced by Reyes and from schemes locally of finite type over $k$. The construction uses the Heyneman-Sweedler finite dual coalgebra and the Takeuchi underlying coalgebra. When $k$ is algebraically closed, the formation of ringed coalgebras gives a fully faithful functor out of the category of fully RFD algebras, as well as a fully faithful functor out of the category of schemes locally of finite type. The restrictions of these two functors to the category of (commutative) finitely generated algebras are isomorphic. Finally, we introduce modules over ringed coalgebras and show that the category of finitely generated modules on a fully RFD algebra and that of coherent sheaves on a scheme locally of finite type can, if $k$ is algebraically closed, be fully faithfully embedded into the category of modules over the corresponding ringed coalgebras.</description>

      <title>Linear Geometry and Algebra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Linear Geometry studies geometric properties which can be expressed via the notion of a line. All information about lines is encoded in a ternary relation called a line relation. A set endowed with a line relation is called a liner. So, Linear Geometry studies liners. Imposing some additional axioms on a liner, we obtain some special classes of liners: regular, projective, affine, proaffine, etc. Linear Geometry includes Affine and Projective Geometries and is a part of Incidence Geometry. The aim of this book is to present a self-contained logical development of Linear Geometry, starting with some intuitive acceptable geometric axioms and ending with algebraic structures that necessarily arise from studying the structure of geometric objects that satisfy those simple and intuitive geometric axioms. We shall meet many quite exotic algebraic structures that arise this way: magmas, loops, ternary-ring, quasi-fields, alternative rings, procorps, profields, etc. We strongly prefer (synthetic) geometric proofs and use tools of analytic geometry only when no purely geometric proof is available. Liner Geometry has been developed by many great mathematicians since times of Antiquity (Thales, Euclides, Proclus, Pappus), through Renaissance (Descartes, Desargues), Early Modernity (Playfair, Gauss, Lobachevski, Bolyai, Poncelet, Steiner, M\"obius), Late Modernity Times (Steinitz, Klein, Hilbert, Moufang, Hessenberg, Jordan, Beltrami, Fano, Gallucci, Veblen, Wedderburn, Lenz, Barlotti) till our contempories (Hartshorne, Hall, Buekenhout, Gleason, Kantor, Doyen, Hubault, Dembowski, Klingenberg, Grundh\"ofer).</description>

      <title>Rota-Baxter operators on compact simple Lie groups and algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A Rota-Baxter operator on a Lie group $ G $ is a smooth map $ B : G \to G $ such that $ B(g)B(h) = B(gB(g)hB(g)^{-1}) $ for all $ g, h \in G $. This concept was introduced in 2021 by Guo, Lang and Sheng as a Lie group analogue of Rota-Baxter operators of weight 1 on Lie algebras. We show that the only Rota-Baxter operators on compact simple Lie groups are the trivial map and the inverse map. A similar description for Rota-Baxter operators of weight 1 on compact simple Lie algebras is provided.</description>

      <title>Hermitian Cubic norm structures and groups of relative rank one</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hermitian cubic norm structures were recently introduced in order to study the class of skew-dimension one structurable algebras (which are typically only defined over fields of characteristic different from $2$ and $3$) over arbitrary rings and fields. Here, we generalize the quartic norm for these algebras and show that elements for which the quartic norm is invertible are conjugate invertible. This leads to the notion of a division hermitian cubic norm structure, defined as one in which the quartic norm is anisotropic. We classify such structures in terms of the Tits index of an associated (rank one) adjoint simple linear algebraic group and show that any adjoint linear algebraic group with such a Tits index defines a corresponding hermitian cubic norm structure.</description>

      <title>Formal sine functions in harmonic algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13525v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce formal sine functions whose coefficients are elements of a generalized harmonic algebra and investigate their properties corresponding to the classical addition formula and Pythagorean theorem. By taking their image under a linear map with some conditions, they coincide with the classical sine function. Moreover, we show that one such linear map is obtained from iterated integrals.</description>

      <title>On Singer's conjecture for the fourth algebraic transfer in certain generic degrees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10232v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $A$ be the Steenrod algebra over the finite field $k := \mathbb Z_2$ and $G(q)$ be the general linear group of rank $q$ over $k.$ A well-known open problem in algebraic topology is the explicit determination of the cohomology groups of the Steenrod algebra, ${\rm Ext}^{q, *}_A(k, k),$ for all homological degrees $q \geq 0.$ The Singer algebraic transfer of rank $q,$ formulated by William Singer in 1989, serves as a valuable method for the description of such Ext groups. This transfer maps from the coinvariants of a certain representation of $G(q)$ to ${\rm Ext}^{q, *}_A(k, k).$ Singer predicted that the algebraic transfer is always injective, but this has gone unanswered for all $q\geq 4.$ This paper establishes Singer's conjecture for rank four in the generic degrees $n = 2^{s+t+1} +2^{s+1} - 3$ whenever $t\neq 3$ and $s\geq 1,$ and $n = 2^{s+t} + 2^{s} - 2$ whenever $t\neq 2,\, 3,\, 4$ and $s\geq 1.$ In conjunction with our previous results, this completes the proof of the Singer conjecture for rank four.</description>
