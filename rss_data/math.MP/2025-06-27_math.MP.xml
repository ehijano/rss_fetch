      <title>Kac-Rice inspired approach to non-Hermitian random matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We suggest a method of analyzing the joint probability density (JPD) ${\cal P}_N(z,{\bf v})$ of an eigenvalue $z$ and the associated right eigenvector ${\bf v}$ (normalized with ${\bf v}^*{\bf v}=1$) of non-Hermitian random matrices of a given size $N\times N$. The method, which represents an alternative to Girko Hermitization approach, is essentially based on the Kac-Rice counting formula applied to the associated characteristic polynomial combined with a certain integral identity for the Dirac delta function of such a polynomial. To illustrate utility of the general method we apply it to consider two particular cases: (i) one-parameter family of matrices interpolating between complex Ginibre and real Ginibre ensembles and (ii) a complex Ginibre matrix additively perturbed by a fixed matrix. In particular, in the former case we discuss the formation of an excess of eigenvalues in the vicinity of the real axis on approaching the real Ginibre limit, which eventually gives rise to the existence of a new scaling regime of "weak non-reality" as $N\to \infty$. In the second case we provide new insights into eigenvalue and eigenvector distribution for a general rank one perturbation of complex Ginibre matrices of finite size $N$, and in the structure of an outlier as $N\gg 1$. Finally we discuss a possible generalization of the proposed method which is expected to be suitable for analysis of JPD involving both left- and right eigenvectors.</description>

      <title>Disentangling tensor product structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a contribution to the field of quantum mereology, we study how a change of tensor productstructure in a finite-dimensional Hilbert space affects its entanglement properties. In particular, we askwhether, given a time-evolving state, there exists a tensor product structure in which no entanglementis generated. We give a concrete, constructive example of disentangling tensor product structure in thecase of a C-NOT gate evolution between two qbits, before showing that this cannot be achieved for mosttime-evolving quantum states.</description>

      <title>Asymmetry of curl eigenfields solving Woltjer's variational problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct families of rotationally symmetric toroidal domains in $\mathbb R^3$ for which the eigenfields associated to the first (positive) Amp\`erian curl eigenvalue are symmetric, and others for which no first eigenfield is symmetric. This implies, in particular, that minimizers of the celebrated Woltjer's variational principle do not need to inherit the rotational symmetry of the domain. This disproves the folk wisdom that the eigenfields corresponding to the lowest curl eigenvalue must be symmetric if the domain is.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian formulation of the quasineutral Vlasov-Poisson system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Slow manifold reduction and the theory of Poisson-Dirac submanifolds are used to deduce a Hamiltonian formulation for a quasineutral limit of the planar, collisionless, magnetized Vlasov-Poisson system. Motion on the slow manifold models plasma dynamics free of fast Langmuir oscillations. Preservation of quasineutrality requires the bulk plasma flow is incompressible. The electric field is determined by counterbalancing plasma stresses that would otherwise produce compression. The Hamiltonian structure for the quasineutral model synthesizes well-known Poisson brackets for incompressible fluids and collisionless kinetic equations.</description>

      <title>The Born-Oppenheimer approximation for a 1D 2+1 particle system with zero-range interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the self-adjoint Hamiltonian that models the quantum dynamics of a 1D three-body system consisting of a light particle interacting with two heavy ones through a zero-range force. For an attractive interaction we determine the behavior of the eigenvalues below the essential spectrum in the regime $\varepsilon\ll 1$, where $\varepsilon$ is proportional to the square root of the mass ratio. We show that the $n$-th eigenvalue behaves as $$E_{n}(\varepsilon)=-\alpha^{2}+|\sigma_{n}|\,\alpha^{2}\varepsilon^{2/3}+O(\varepsilon)\,, $$ where $\alpha$ is a negative constant that explicitly relates to the physical parameters and $\sigma_{n}$ is either the $n$-th extremum or the $n$-th zero of the Airy function Ai, depending on the kind (respectively, bosons or fermions) of the two heavy particles. Additionally, we prove that the essential spectrum coincides with the half-line $\left[-\frac{\alpha^2}{4+\varepsilon^{2}}\,,+\infty\right)$.</description>

      <title>Spectral Geometry with Exceptional Symmetry and Charged Higgs Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We lay the foundations for a general approach to nonassociative spectral geometry as an extension of Connes' noncommutative geometry by explaining how to construct finite-dimensional, discrete spectral geometries with exceptional symmetry, and gauge covariant Dirac operators. We showcase an explicit construction of a geometry corresponding to the internal space of a $G_2\times G_2$ gauge theory with charged scalar content and scalar representations restricted by novel conditions arising from the associative properties of the coordinate algebra. Our construction motivates a new definition of bimodules over nonassociative algebras and a novel form of bimodule over semi-simple octonion algebras.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Analysis of Boundary Layer Solutions to Poisson-Boltzmann Type Equations in General Bounded Smooth Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the boundary layer solution to singular perturbation problems involving Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) type equations with a small parameter $\epsilon$ in general bounded smooth domains (including multiply connected domains) under the Robin boundary condition. The PB type equations include the classical PB, modified PB and charge-conserving PB (CCPB) equations, which are mathematical models for the electric potential and ion distributions. The CCPB equations present particular analytical challenges due to their nonlocal nonlinearity introduced through integral terms enforcing charge conservation. Using the principal coordinate system, exponential-type estimates and the moving plane agruments, we rigorously prove asymptotic expansions of boundary layer solutions throughout the whole domain. The solution domain is partitioned into three characteristic regions based on the distance from the boundary: Region I, where the distance from the boundary is at most $T\sqrt\epsilon$, Region II, where the distance ranges between $T\sqrt\epsilon$ and $\epsilon^\beta$, and Region III, where the distance is at least $\epsilon^\beta$, for given parameters $T&gt;0$ and $0&lt;\beta&lt;1/2$. In Region I, we derive second-order asymptotic formulas explicitly incorporating the effects of boundary mean curvature, while exponential decay estimates are established for Regions II and III. Furthermore, we obtain asymptotic expansions for key physical quantities, including the electric potential, electric field, total ionic charge density and total ionic charge, revealing how domain geometry regulates electrostatic interactions.</description>

      <title>On the geometry of a 4-dimensional extension of a $q$-Painlev\'e I equation with symmetry type $A_1^{(1)}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a geometric study of a four-dimensional integrable discrete dynamical system which extends the autonomous form of a $q$-Painlev\'e I equation with symmetry of type $A_1^{(1)}$. By resolution of singularities it is lifted to a pseudo-automorphism of a rational variety obtained from $({\mathbb P}^1)^{\times 4}$ by blowing up along 28 subvarieties and we use this to establish its integrability in terms of conserved quantities and degree growth. We embed this rational variety into a family which admits an action of the extended affine Weyl group $\widetilde{W}(A_1^{(1)})\times \widetilde{W}(A_1^{(1)})$ by pseudo-isomorphisms. We use this to construct two 4-dimensional analogues of $q$-Painlev\'e equations, one of which is a deautonomisation of the original autonomous integrable map.</description>

      <title>Borel-Pad\'e exponential asymptotics for the discrete nonlinear Schr\"odinger model with next-to-nearest neighbour interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the present work we study discrete nonlinear Schr{\"o}dinger models combining nearest (NN) and next-nearest (NNN) neighbor interactions, motivated by experiments in waveguide arrays. While we consider the more experimentally accessible case of positive ratio $\mu$ of NNN to NN interactions, we focus on the intriguing case of competing such interactions $(\mu&lt;0)$, where stationary states can exist only for $-1/4 &lt; \mu &lt; 0$. We analyze the key eigenvalues for the stability of the pulse-like stationary (ground) states, and find that such modes depend exponentially on the coupling parameter $\eps$, with suitable polynomial prefactors and corrections that we analyze in detail. Very good agreement of the resulting predictions is found with systematic numerical computations of the associated eigenvalues. This analysis uses Borel-Pad\'{e} exponential asymptotics to determine Stokes multipliers in the solution; these multipliers cannot be obtained using standard matched asymptotic expansion approaches as they are hidden beyond all asymptotic orders, even near singular points. By using Borel-Pad\'{e} methods near the singularity, we construct a general asymptotic template for studying parametric problems which require the calculation of subdominant Stokes multipliers.</description>

      <title>Ghost-Free Quantisation of Higher Time-Derivative Theories via Non-Unitary Similarity Transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the long-standing ``ghost problem" in higher time-derivative theories (HTDTs), where quantisation typically yields sectors with either unbounded spectra or non-normalisable eigenstates; both rendering the theory unphysical. We propose a novel method that preserves the bounded nature of the spectrum in one particular sector while restoring normalisability by employing a non-unitary similarity transformation. Inspired by techniques from pseudo/quasi-Hermitian PT-symmetric quantum mechanics, we construct a non-unitary map between two Hermitian Hamiltonians, converting ghostly sectors into physically viable ones. We demonstrate the feasibility of this approach using a concrete HTDT model, related to the Pais-Uhlenbeck oscillator, and show that the transformed system admits normalisable eigenstates and a spectrum bounded from below. This framework offers a consistent re-interpretation of HTDTs and extends the toolbox for constructing ghost-free quantum models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we introduce a field theory capable of describing the critical properties of nonideal systems undergoing continuous phase transitions beyond the leading order radiative corrections or in the number of loops (effective field theories limited only to leading order were recently defined in literature). These systems present defects, inhomogeneities and impurities as opposed to ideal ones which are perfect, homogeneous and pure. We compute the values of the critical exponents of the theory beyond leading order and compare with their corresponding experimental measured results. The results show some interplay between nonideal effects and fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Eisenhart-Duval lift, Nonlocal Conservation laws and Painlev\'{e} Analysis in Scalar field Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the existence of nonlocal conservation laws for the gravitational field equations of scalar field cosmology in an FLRW background with a dust fluid source. We perform such analysis by using a novel approach for the Eisenhart-Duval lift. It follows that the scalar field potential $V\left( \phi \right) =\alpha \left( e^{\lambda \phi }+\beta \right) $ admits nontrivial conservation laws. Furthermore, we employ the Painlev\'{e} analysis to examine the integrability of the field equations. For the quintessence model, we establish that the cosmological field equations possess the Painlev\'{e} property and are integrable for $\lambda ^{2}&gt;6$. In contrast, for the phantom scalar field, the cosmological field equations exhibit the Painlev\'{e} property for any value of the parameter $% \lambda $. We present analytic solutions expressed in terms of Right Laurent expansions for various values of the parameter $\lambda $. Finally, we discuss the qualitative evolution of the effective equation of state parameter for these analytic solutions.</description>

      <title>The Markov property for $\varphi^4_3$ on the cylinder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the $\varphi^4_3$ model satisfies a version of Segal's axioms in the special case of three-dimensional tori and cylinders. As a consequence, we give the first proof that this model satisfies a Markov property and we characterize its boundary law up to absolutely continuous perturbations. In addition, we use Segal's axioms to give an alternative construction of the $\varphi^4_3$ Hamiltonian on two-dimensional tori as compared with Glimm (Comm. Math. Phys., 1968). We exploit this probabilistic approach to prove novel fundamental spectral properties of the Hamiltonian, such as discrete spectrum and a Perron-Froebenius type result on its ground state. The key technical contributions of this article are the development of tools to analyze $\varphi^4_3$ models with rough boundary conditions. We heavily use the variational approach to $\varphi^4_3$ models introduced in Barashkov and Gubinelli (Duke, 2020) that is based on the Bou\'e-Dupuis formula and dual to Polchinski's continuous renormalization group.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The occurrence of Landau levels in quantum mechanics is well known when a charged particle is subjected to a uniform magnetic field. Considering the recent interest in the electronic properties of graphene which admits a dispersion relation which is linear in the momentum near the Dirac points, we revisit the problem of Landau levels in the spirit of the Dirac Hamiltonian and ask if there are certain non-uniform magnetic fields which also lead to a spectrum consisting of the Landau levels. The answer, as we show, is in the affirmative. In particular, by considering isospectral deformations of the uniform magnetic field, we present explicit expressions for non-uniform magnetic fields that are strictly isospectral to their uniform counterpart, thus supporting the Landau levels.</description>

Abstract: We prove fundamental properties of empirical measures induced by measurements performed on quantum $N$-body systems. More precisely, we consider measurements performed on the ground state of an interacting, trapped Bose gase in the Gross--Pitaevskii regime, known to exhibit Bose--Einstein condensation. For the corresponding empirical measure, we prove a weak law of large numbers with limit induced by the condensate wave function and characterize the fluctuations around through an appropriate central limit theorem.</description>

Abstract: The goal of this paper is to settle the study of non-commutative optimal transport problems with convex regularization, in their static and finite-dimensional formulations. We consider both the balanced and unbalanced problem and show in both cases a duality result, characterizations of minimizers (for the primal) and maximizers (for the dual). An important tool we define is a non-commutative version of the classical $(c,\psi)$-transforms associated with a general convex regularization, which we employ to prove the convergence of Sinkhorn iterations in the balanced case. Finally, we show the convergence of the unbalanced transport problems towards the balanced one, as well as the convergence of transforms, as the marginal penalization parameters go to $+\infty$.</description>

      <title>The emptiness formation probability, and representations for nonlocal correlation functions, of the 20-vertex model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05309v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the emptiness formation probability, along with various representations for nonlocal correlation functions, of the 20-vertex model. In doing so, we leverage previous arguments for representations of nonlocal correlation functions for the 6-vertex model, under domain-wall boundary conditions, due to Colomo, Di Giulio, and Pronko, in addition to the inhomogeneous, and homogeneous, determinantal representations for the 20-vertex partition function due to Di Francesco, also under domain-wall boundary conditions. By taking a product of row configuration probabilities, we obtain a desired contour integral representation for nonlocal correlations from a determinantal representation. Finally, a counterpart of the emptiness formation probability is introduced for the 20-vertex model.</description>

      <title>Poisson structure of the 4-vertex model, and the higher-spin XXX chain, and Yang-Baxter algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15188v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We implement the quantum inverse scattering method for the 4-vertex model. In comparison to previous works of the author which examined the 6-vertex, and 20-vertex, models, the 4-vertex model exhibits different characteristics, ranging from L-operators expressed in terms of projectors and Pauli matrices to algebraic and combinatorial properties, including Poisson structure and boxed plane partitions. With far fewer computations with an L-operator provided for the 4-vertex model by Bogoliubov in 2007, in comparison to those for L-operators of the 6, and 20, vertex models, from lower order expansions of the transfer matrix we derive a system of relations from the structure of operators that can be leveraged for studying characteristics of the higher-spin XXX chain in the weak finite volume limit. In comparison to quantum inverse scattering methods for the 6, and 20, vertex models which can be used to further study integrability, and exact solvability, an adaptation of such an approach for the 4-vertex model can be used to approximate, asymptotically in the weak finite volume limit, sixteen brackets which generate the Poisson structure. From explicit relations for operators of the 4-vertex transfer matrix, we conclude by discussing corresponding aspects of the Yang-Baxter algebra, which is closely related to the operators obtained from products of L-operators for approximating the transfer, and quantum monodromy, matrices. The structure of computations from L-operators of the 4-vertex model directly transfers to L-operators of the higher-spin XXX chain, revealing a similar structure of another Yang-Baxter algebra of interest.</description>

      <title>Intertwining vectors, and Boltzmann weight matrices, of a Solid-on-Solid model from the 20-vertex model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04515v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We initiate a new study on the correspondence between the 20-vertex model and a SOS (Solid-on-Solid) model. In comparison to two previous works of the author in 2024 which characterized properties of the transfer, and quantum monodromy, matrices of the 20-vertex model from the perspective of the quantum inverse scattering method, in addition to the structure of nonlocal correlations, the forthcoming approach is an adaptation of a study on the rational 7-vertex model. For the rational 7-vertex model, Antoenneko and Valinevich demonstrated that the intertwining vectors can be used to transform the R-matrix of a vertex model into the Boltzman weight matrix of an SOS model. To further develop perspectives on classes of higher dimensional SOS models, by leveraging previous computations with L-operators due to the author, and by also manipulating q-exponentials, and other related factors from a factorization of the universal R-matrix due to Boos et al, analogs of intertwining vectors for the 20- vertex model can be obtained. In comparison to the system of equations that have been obtained for the rational 7-vertex model, the system that one obtains for the 20-vertex model consists of 9 equations for each entry of the R-matrix. Furthermore, from the fact that the 20-vertex model contains more possible configurations in the sample space than the rational 7-vertex model does, the Boltzman weight matrix of the corresponding SOS model asymptotically depends upon several contributions, a few of which include tensor products of basis elements, and spectral parameters over the triangular lattice.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2009.05279v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe the asymptotic behaviour of the quantum propagator generated by a Berezin-Toeplitz operator with real-valued principal symbol. We also give precise asymptotics for smoothed spectral projectors associated with the operator in the autonomous case; this leads us to introducting quantum states associated with immersed Lagrangian submanifolds. These descriptions involve geometric quantities of two origins, coming from lifts of the Hamiltonian flow to the prequantum bundle and the canonical bundle respectively. The latter are the main contribution of this article and are connected to the Maslov indices appearing in trace formulas, as will be explained in a forthcoming paper.</description>

Abstract: We extend previous results due to Ding and Zhuang in order to prove that a phase transition occurs for the long range Ising model in lower dimensions. By making use of a recent argument due to Affonso, Bissacot and Maia from 2022 which establishes that a phase transition occurs for the long range, random-field Ising model, from a suggestion of the authors we demonstrate that a phase transition also occurs for the long range Ising model, from a set of appropriately defined contours for the long range system, and a Peierls' argument.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19157v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Exploiting the explicit bijection between the density of singular values and the density of eigenvalues for bi-unitarily invariant complex random matrix ensembles of finite matrix size, we aim at finding the induced probability measure on $j$ eigenvalues and $k$ singular values that we coin $j,k$-point correlation measure. We find an expression for the $1,k$-point correlation measure which simplifies drastically when assuming that the singular values follow a polynomial ensemble, yielding a closed formula in terms of the kernel corresponding to the determinantal point process of the singular value statistics. These expressions simplify even further when the singular values are drawn from a P\'{o}lya ensemble and extend known results between the eigenvalue and singular value statistics of the corresponding bi-unitarily invariant ensemble.</description>

Abstract: We consider the second class particle in half-line open TASEP under two different initial conditions with shock discontinuities. The exact formulas for the distribution of the second class particle can be derived by using the color-position symmetry theorem of colored half-space TASEP. We study the asymptotic distribution of second class particles under the constant scaling and KPZ-type scaling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12529v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore and extend the application of homological algebra to describe quantum entanglement, initiated in arXiv:1901.02011, focusing on the Hodge-theoretic structure of entanglement cohomology in finite-dimensional quantum systems. We construct analogues of the Hodge star operator, inner product, codifferential, and Laplacian for entanglement $k$-forms. We also prove that such $k$-forms obey versions of the Hodge isomorphism theorem and Hodge decomposition, and that they exhibit Hodge duality. As a corollary, we conclude that the dimensions of the $k$-th and $(n-k)$-th cohomologies coincide for entanglement in $n$-partite pure states, which explains a symmetry property ("Poincare duality") of the associated Poincare polynomials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17094v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We adapt the Worldline Formalism to obtain resummed expressions for the effective action and the heat kernel of a quantum scalar field coupled to a Yukawa background. The resummation includes all the invariants built from powers, first derivatives and second derivatives of the latter. Using such results, we compute the instability of the vacuum computing the vacuum persistence amplitude and the corresponding Schwinger pair production probability. We show that the inclusion of an additional, rapidly varying background can greatly enhance the production of pairs.</description>

Abstract: A formula for the full nonperturbative topological string free energy was recently proposed by Hattab and Palti \cite{HP24a}. In this work, we extend their result to the refined topological string theory. We demonstrate that the proposed formula for the full nonperturbative refined topological string free energy correctly reproduces the trans-series structure of the refined topological string and captures the Stokes automorphisms associated with its resurgent properties.</description>

      <title>2-Adic quantum mechanics, continuous-time quantum walks, and the space discreteness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16416v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that a large class of 2-adic Schr\"odinger equations is the scaling limit of certain continuous-time quantum Markov chains (CTQMCs). Practically, a discretization of such an equation gives a CTQMC. As a practical result, we construct new types of continuous time quantum walks (CTQWs) on graphs using two symmetric matrices. One matrix describes the transport between nodes in one direction, while the second describes the transport between nodes in the opposite direction. This construction includes, as a particular case, the CTQWs constructed using adjacency matrices. The final goal of this work is to contribute to the understanding of the foundations of quantum mechanics (QM) and the role of the hypothesis of the discreteness of space. The connection between 2-adic QM and CTQWs shows that 2-adic QM has a physical meaning. 2-Adic QM is a nonlocal theory because the Hamiltonians used are nonlocal operators, and consequently, spooky actions at a distance are allowed. However, this theory is not a mathematical toy. The experimental confirmation of the violation of Bell's inequality implies that this theory allows realism. We pointed out several new research problems connected with the foundations of quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Quantum Measurement Without Collapse or Many Worlds: The Branched Hilbert Subspace Interpretation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14791v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose the Branched Hilbert Subspace Interpretation (BHSI) as an alternative perspective on quantum measurement. BHSI describes measurement as a unitary branching of the local Hilbert space into decoherent, independent, and unitarily evolving subspaces, while updating observer states (through their equipment) by causally engaging and disengaging operators. Unlike the Copenhagen Interpretation (CI), BHSI avoids wave function collapse while maintaining the Born rule through the branch weights associated with the initial system state. Unlike the Many-Worlds Interpretation (MWI), BHSI sidesteps parallel worlds by entangling branches with the local environment within a single world. We compare BHSI features with those of CI, MWI, and Bohmian Mechanics (BM). We investigate its implications for the double-slit experiment, Bell tests, Wigner and his friend, black hole radiation, and the delayed-choice quantum eraser. We examine quantum teleportation, demonstrating that locally controlled decoherence and recoherence processes (CDRP) can be observed. Specifically, we suggest experiments using modern Stern-Gerlach interferometers (SGI) to visualize the CDRP, measure branch weights that encode the Born rule, and predict the electromagnetic (EM) phase shift resulting from the independent unitary evolution of decoherent branches. BHSI thus provides a minimalist alternative to interpretations based on collapse or many-worlds.</description>

      <title>Long-time asymptotics of the defocusing mKdV equation with step initial data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01570v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work investigates the long-time asymptotics of solution to defocusing modified Korteweg-de Vries equation with a class of step initial data. A rigorous asymptotic analysis is conducted on the associated Riemann-Hilbert problem by applying Deift-Zhou nonlinear steepest descent method. In this process, the construction of odd-symmetry g-function is generalized and the method of genus reduction on the Riemann-theta function is proposed via conformal transformation and symmetries. It is revealed that for sufficiently large time, the solution manifests a tripartite spatiotemporal structure, i.e., in the left plane-wave region, the solution decays to a modulated plane wave with oscillatory correction; in the central dispersive shock wave region, the solution is governed by a modulated elliptic periodic wave; in the right plane wave region, the solution converges exponentially to a constant. The results from the long-time asymptotic analysis have been shown to match remarkably well with that obtained by direct numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>On the geometry of synthetic null hypersurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04934v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a synthetic framework for the geometric and analytic study of null (lightlike) hypersurfaces in non-smooth spacetimes. Drawing from optimal transport and recent advances in Lorentzian geometry and causality theory, we define a \emph{synthetic null hypersurface} as a triple $(H, G, \mathfrak{m})$: $H$ is a closed achronal set in a topological causal space, $G$ is a gauge function encoding affine parametrizations along null generators, and $\mathfrak{m}$ is a Radon measure serving as a synthetic analog of the rigged measure. This generalizes classical differential geometric structures to potentially singular spacetimes.
  A central object is the \emph{synthetic null energy condition} ($\mathsf{NC}^e(N)$), defined via the concavity of an entropy power functional along optimal transport, with parametrization given by the gauge $G$. This condition is invariant under changes of gauge and measure within natural equivalence classes. It agrees with the classical Null Energy Condition in the smooth setting and it applies to low-regularity spacetimes. A key property of ($\mathsf{NC}^e(N)$) is the stability under convergence of synthetic null hypersurfaces, inspired by measured Gromov--Hausdorff convergence.
  As a first application, we obtain a synthetic version of Hawking's area theorem. Moreover, we extend the celebrated Penrose's singularity theorem to continuous spacetimes and prove the existence of trapped regions in the general setting of topological causal spaces satisfying the synthetic ($\mathsf{NC}^e(N)$).</description>

Abstract: We initiate the theory of real noncommutative (nc) convex sets, the real case of the recent and profound complex theory developed by Davidson and Kennedy. The present paper focuses on the real case of the topics from the first several sections of their profound memoir. Later results will be discussed in a future paper. We develop some of the infrastructure of real nc convexity, giving many foundational structural results for real operator systems and their associated nc convex sets, and elucidate how the complexification interacts with the basic convexity theory constructions. Several new features appear in the real case, including the novel notion of the complexification of a nc convex set.</description>
