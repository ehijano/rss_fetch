      <title>A positional $\mathbf{\Pi}^0_3$-complete objective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study zero-sum turn-based games on graphs. In this note, we show the existence of a game objective that is $\mathbf{\Pi}^0_3$-complete for the Borel hierarchy and that is positional, i.e., for which positional strategies suffice for the first player to win over arenas of arbitrary cardinality. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first known such objective; all previously known positional objectives are in $\mathbf{\Sigma}^0_3$. The objective in question is a qualitative variant of the well-studied total-payoff objective, where the goal is to maximise the sum of weights.</description>

      <title>Learning junta distributions and quantum junta states, and QAC$^0$ circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we consider the problems of learning junta distributions, their quantum counter-part, quantum junta states, and QAC$^0$ circuits, which we show to be juntas.
  $\mathbf{Junta\ distributions.\ }$A probability distribution $p:\{-1,1\}^n\to \mathbb [0,1]$ is a $k$-junta if it only depends on $k$ variables. We show that they can be learned with to error $\varepsilon$ in total variation distance from $O(2^k\log(n)/\varepsilon^2)$ samples, which quadratically improves the upper bound of Aliakbarpour et al. (COLT'16) and matches their lower bound in every parameter.
  $\mathbf{Junta\ states.\ }$We initiate the study of $n$-qubit states that are $k$-juntas, those that are the tensor product of a $k$-qubit state and an $(n-k)$-qubit maximally mixed state. We show that these states can be learned with error $\varepsilon$ in trace distance with $O(12^{k}\log(n)/\varepsilon^2)$ single copies. We also prove a lower bound of $\Omega((4^k+\log (n))/\varepsilon^2)$ copies. Along the way, we give a new proof of the optimal performance of Classical Shadows based on Pauli analysis.
  $\mathbf{QAC^0\ circuits.\ }$Nadimpalli et al. (STOC'24) recently showed that the Pauli spectrum of QAC$^0$ circuits (with not too many auxiliary qubits) is concentrated on low-degree. We remark that they showed something stronger, namely that the Choi states of those circuits are close to be juntas. As a consequence, we show that $n$-qubit QAC$^0$ circuits with size $s$, depth $d$ and $a$ auxiliary qubits can be learned from $2^{O(\log(s^22^a)^d)}\log (n)$ copies of the Choi state, improving the $n^{O(\log(s^22^a)^d)}$ by Nadimpalli et al. In addition, we use this remark to improve on the lower bounds against QAC$^0$ circuits to compute the address function.</description>

      <title>Integer Polynomial Factorization by Recombination of Real Factors: Re-evaluating an Old Technique in Modern Era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polynomial factorization over $ZZ$ is of great historical and practical importance. Currently, the standard technique is to factor the polynomial over finite fields first and then to lift to integers. Factorization over finite fields can be done in polynomial time using Berlekamp or Cantor-Zassenhaus algorithms. Lifting from the finite field to $ZZ$ requires a combinatorial algorithm. The van Hoeij algorithm casts the combinatorial problem as a knapsack-equivalent problem, which is then solved using lattice-reduction (the LLL algorithm) in polynomial time, which is implemented in many computer algebra systems (CAS).
  In this paper, we revisit the old idea of starting with factorization over $RR$ instead of a finite field, followed by recombination of the resulting linear and quadratic factors. We transform the problem into an integer subset sum problem, which is then solved using the Horowizt-Sinha algorithm. This algorithm can factor a random integer polynomial of degree $d$ in a time complexity of $O(2^(d slash 4))$.
  While the resulting algorithm is exponential, consistent with the integer subset sum problem being in NP, it has a few advantages. First, it is simple and easy to implement. Second, it is almost embarrassingly parallelizable. We demonstrate this by implementing the algorithm in a Graphic Processing Unit (GPU). The resulting code can factor a degree 100 polynomial is a few tenths of a second, comparable to some standard CAS. This shows that it is possible to use current hardware, especially massively parallel systems like GPU, to the benefit of symbolic algebra.</description>

      <title>Separations in query complexity for total search problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the query complexity analogue of the class TFNP of total search problems. We give a way to convert partial functions to total search problems under certain settings; we also give a way to convert search problems back into partial functions.
  As an application, we give new separations for degree-like measures. We give an exponential separation between quantum query complexity and approximate degree for a total search problem. We also give an exponential separation between approximate degree and the positive quantum adversary for a total search problem.
  We then strengthen the former separation to upper bound a larger measure: the two-sided approximate non-negative degree, also called the conical junta degree. This measure is often larger than quantum query complexity and even a separation from randomized query complexity was not known. We extend our results to communication complexity, and obtain an exponential separation between quantum information complexity and the relaxed partition bound for a total search problem. Even a weaker separation between randomized communication complexity and the relaxed partition bound was not known for total search problems (or even for partial functions).
  Most of our separations for total search problems can be converted to separations for partial functions. Using this, we reprove the recent exponential separation between quantum query complexity and approximate degree for a partial function by Ambainis and Belovs (2023), among other new results.</description>

      <title>A simplified proof of the CSP Dichotomy Conjecture and XY-symmetric operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01080v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a new theory of strong subalgebras and linear congruences that are defined globally. Using this theory we provide a new proof of the correctness of Zhuk's algorithm for all tractable CSPs on a finite domain, and therefore a new simplified proof of the CSP Dichotomy Conjecture. Additionally, using the new theory we prove that composing a weak near-unanimity operation of an odd arity $n$ we can derive an $n$-ary operation that is symmetric on all two-element sets. Thus, CSP over a constraint language $\Gamma$ on a finite domain is tractable if and only if there exist infinitely many polymorphisms of $\Gamma$ that are symmetric on all two-element sets.</description>

      <title>$\Pi_{2}^{P}$ vs PSpace Dichotomy for the Quantified Constraint Satisfaction Problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03844v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Quantified Constraint Satisfaction Problem is the problem of evaluating a sentence with both quantifiers, over relations from some constraint language, with conjunction as the only connective. We show that for any constraint language on a finite domain the Quantified Constraint Satisfaction Problem is either in $\Pi_{2}^{P}$, or PSpace-complete. Additionally, we build a constraint language on a 6-element domain such that the Quantified Constraint Satisfaction Problem over this language is $\Pi_{2}^{P}$-complete.</description>

      <title>Semi-Classical Subspaces, The No Synchronization Law, and More</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18201v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper looks at the intersection of algorithmic information theory and physics, namely quantum mechanics, thermodynamics, and black holes. We discuss theorems which characterize the barrier between the quantum world and the classical realm. The notion of a ``semi-classical subspace'' is introduced. Partial signals and partial information cloning can be obtained on quantum states in semi-classical subspaces. The No Synchronization Law is detailed, which says separate and isolated physical systems evolving over time cannot have algorithmic thermodynamic entropies that are in synch. We look at future work involving the Kolmogorov complexity of black holes.</description>

      <title>A parametric version of the Hilbert Nullstellensatz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13027v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hilbert's Nullstellensatz is a fundamental result in algebraic geometry that gives a necessary and sufficient condition for a finite collection of multivariate polynomials to have a common zero in an algebraically closed field. Associated with this result, there is the computational problem HN of determining whether a system of polynomials with coefficients in the field of rational numbers has a common zero over the field of algebraic numbers.
  In an influential paper, Koiran showed that HN can be determined in the polynomial hierarchy assuming the Generalised Riemann Hypothesis (GRH). More precisely, he showed that HN lies in the complexity class AM under GRH. In a later work he generalised this result by showing that the problem DIM, which asks to determine the dimension of the set of solutions of a given polynomial system, also lies in AM subject to GRH.
  In this paper we study the solvability of polynomial equations over arbitrary algebraically closed fields of characteristic zero. Up to isomorphism, every such field is the algebraic closure of a field of rational functions. We thus formulate a parametric version of HN, called HNP, in which the input is a system of polynomials with coefficients in a function field $\mathbb{Q}(\mathbf{x})$ and the task is to determine whether the polynomials have a common zero in the algebraic closure $\overline{\mathbb{Q}(\mathbf{x})}$.
  We observe that Koiran's proof that DIM lies in AM can be interpreted as a randomised polynomial-time reduction of DIM to HNP, followed by an argument that HNP lies in AM. Our main contribution is a self-contained proof that HNP lies in AM that follows the same basic idea as Koiran's argument -- namely random instantiation of the parameters -- but whose justification is purely algebraic, relying on a parametric version of Hilbert's Nullstellensatz, and avoiding recourse to semi-algebraic geometry.</description>

      <title>A Computational Separation Between Quantum No-cloning and No-telegraphing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.01858v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two of the fundamental no-go theorems of quantum information are the no-cloning theorem (that it is impossible to make copies of general quantum states) and the no-teleportation theorem (the prohibition on telegraphing, or sending quantum states over classical channels without pre-shared entanglement). They are known to be equivalent, in the sense that a collection of quantum states is telegraphable if and only if it is clonable.
  Our main result suggests that this is not the case when computational efficiency is considered. We give a collection of quantum states and quantum oracles relative to which these states are efficiently clonable but not efficiently telegraphable. Given that the opposite scenario is impossible (states that can be telegraphed can always trivially be cloned), this gives the most complete quantum oracle separation possible between these two important no-go properties.
  We additionally study the complexity class clonableQMA, a subset of QMA whose witnesses are efficiently clonable. As a consequence of our main result, we give a quantum oracle separation between clonableQMA and the class QCMA, whose witnesses are restricted to classical strings. We also propose a candidate oracle-free promise problem separating these classes. We finally demonstrate an application of clonable-but-not-telegraphable states to cryptography, by showing how such states can be used to protect against key exfiltration.</description>

      <title>Hardness results for decoding the surface code with Pauli noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.10331v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Real quantum computers will be subject to complicated, qubit-dependent noise, instead of simple noise such as depolarizing noise with the same strength for all qubits. We can do quantum error correction more effectively if our decoding algorithms take into account this prior information about the specific noise present. This motivates us to consider the complexity of surface code decoding where the input to the decoding problem is not only the syndrome-measurement results, but also a noise model in the form of probabilities of single-qubit Pauli errors for every qubit.
  In this setting, we show that quantum maximum likelihood decoding (QMLD) and degenerate quantum maximum likelihood decoding (DQMLD) for the surface code are NP-hard and #P-hard, respectively. We reduce directly from SAT for QMLD, and from #SAT for DQMLD, by showing how to transform a boolean formula into a qubit-dependent Pauli noise model and set of syndromes that encode the satisfiability properties of the formula. We also give hardness of approximation results for QMLD and DQMLD. These are worst-case hardness results that do not contradict the empirical fact that many efficient surface code decoders are correct in the average case (i.e., for most sets of syndromes and for most reasonable noise models). These hardness results are nicely analogous with the known hardness results for QMLD and DQMLD for arbitrary stabilizer codes with independent $X$ and $Z$ noise.</description>

Abstract: We consider the classical problems of interpolating a polynomial given a black box for evaluation, and of multiplying two polynomials, in the setting where the bit-lengths of the coefficients may vary widely, so-called unbalanced polynomials. Writing s for the total bit-length and D for the degree, our new algorithms have expected running time $\tilde{O}(s \log D)$, whereas previous methods for (resp.) dense or sparse arithmetic have at least $\tilde{O}(sD)$ or $\tilde{O}(s^2)$ bit complexity.</description>

      <title>More Asymmetry Yields Faster Matrix Multiplication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16349v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new improvement on the laser method for designing fast matrix multiplication algorithms. The new method further develops the recent advances by [Duan, Wu, Zhou FOCS 2023] and [Vassilevska Williams, Xu, Xu, Zhou SODA 2024]. Surprisingly the new improvement is achieved by incorporating more asymmetry in the analysis, circumventing a fundamental tool of prior work that requires two of the three dimensions to be treated identically. The method yields a new bound on the square matrix multiplication exponent $$\omega&lt;2.371339,$$ improved from the previous bound of $\omega&lt;2.371552$. We also improve the bounds of the exponents for multiplying rectangular matrices of various shapes.</description>
