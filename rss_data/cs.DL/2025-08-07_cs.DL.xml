      <title>MegaWika 2: A More Comprehensive Multilingual Collection of Articles and their Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce MegaWika 2, a large, multilingual dataset of Wikipedia articles with their citations and scraped web sources; articles are represented in a rich data structure, and scraped source texts are stored inline with precise character offsets of their citations in the article text. MegaWika 2 is a major upgrade from the original MegaWika, spanning six times as many articles and twice as many fully scraped citations. Both MegaWika and MegaWika 2 support report generation research ; whereas MegaWika also focused on supporting question answering and retrieval applications, MegaWika 2 is designed to support fact checking and analyses across time and language.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Scientific Discovery with Multi-Document Summarization of Impact-Ranked Papers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing volume of scientific literature makes it challenging for scientists to move from a list of papers to a synthesized understanding of a topic. Because of the constant influx of new papers on a daily basis, even if a scientist identifies a promising set of papers, they still face the tedious task of individually reading through dozens of titles and abstracts to make sense of occasionally conflicting findings. To address this critical bottleneck in the research workflow, we introduce a summarization feature to BIP! Finder, a scholarly search engine that ranks literature based on distinct impact aspects like popularity and influence. Our approach enables users to generate two types of summaries from top-ranked search results: a concise summary for an instantaneous at-a-glance comprehension and a more comprehensive literature review-style summary for greater, better-organized comprehension. This ability dynamically leverages BIP! Finder's already existing impact-based ranking and filtering features to generate context-sensitive, synthesized narratives that can significantly accelerate literature discovery and comprehension.</description>

      <title>Identity Theft in AI Conference Peer Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss newly uncovered cases of identity theft in the scientific peer-review process within artificial intelligence (AI) research, with broader implications for other academic procedures. We detail how dishonest researchers exploit the peer-review system by creating fraudulent reviewer profiles to manipulate paper evaluations, leveraging weaknesses in reviewer recruitment workflows and identity verification processes. The findings highlight the critical need for stronger safeguards against identity theft in peer review and academia at large, and to this end, we also propose mitigating strategies.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid AI Methodology for Generating Ontologies of Research Topics from Scientific Paper Corpora</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Taxonomies and ontologies of research topics (e.g., MeSH, UMLS, CSO, NLM) play a central role in providing the primary framework through which intelligent systems can explore and interpret the literature. However, these resources have traditionally been manually curated, a process that is time-consuming, prone to obsolescence, and limited in granularity. This paper presents Sci-OG, a semi-auto\-mated methodology for generating research topic ontologies, employing a multi-step approach: 1) Topic Discovery, extracting potential topics from research papers; 2) Relationship Classification, determining semantic relationships between topic pairs; and 3) Ontology Construction, refining and organizing topics into a structured ontology. The relationship classification component, which constitutes the core of the system, integrates an encoder-based language model with features describing topic occurrence in the scientific literature. We evaluate this approach against a range of alternative solutions using a dataset of 21,649 manually annotated semantic triples. Our method achieves the highest F1 score (0.951), surpassing various competing approaches, including a fine-tuned SciBERT model and several LLM baselines, such as the fine-tuned GPT4-mini. Our work is corroborated by a use case which illustrates the practical application of our system to extend the CSO ontology in the area of cybersecurity. The presented solution is designed to improve the accessibility, organization, and analysis of scientific knowledge, thereby supporting advancements in AI-enabled literature management and research exploration.</description>

      <title>A Reproducible, Scalable Pipeline for Synthesizing Autoregressive Model Literature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The accelerating pace of research on autoregressive generative models has produced thousands of papers, making manual literature surveys and reproduction studies increasingly impractical. We present a fully open-source, reproducible pipeline that automatically retrieves candidate documents from public repositories, filters them for relevance, extracts metadata, hyper-parameters and reported results, clusters topics, produces retrieval-augmented summaries and generates containerised scripts for re-running selected experiments. Quantitative evaluation on 50 manually-annotated papers shows F1 scores above 0.85 for relevance classification, hyper-parameter extraction and citation identification. Experiments on corpora of up to 1000 papers demonstrate near-linear scalability with eight CPU workers. Three case studies -- AWD-LSTM on WikiText-2, Transformer-XL on WikiText-103 and an autoregressive music model on the Lakh MIDI dataset -- confirm that the extracted settings support faithful reproduction, achieving test perplexities within 1--3% of the original reports.</description>

      <title>Rxiv-Maker: an automated template engine for streamlined scientific publications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00836v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Preprint servers accelerate research dissemination, but authors still face complex manuscript preparation without professional typesetting support. Rxiv-Maker enables researchers to create documents using a framework that converts Markdown into publication-standard PDFs. It automatically translates the markdown text into LaTeX, so researchers don't have to write any LaTeX code themselves. This tool transforms simple documents into dynamic, version-controlled files that work well with modern team collaboration and ongoing updates. Rxiv-Maker executes Python and R scripts for on-the-fly figure generation, ensuring visualisations stay current with data and analyses. Automated build environments, Docker support, and built-in citation and cross-reference management ensure reliable, reproducible builds across systems, while the conversion process handles mathematical equations and formatting. Rxiv-Maker simplifies professional typesetting, promoting clear and open scientific publishing. This manuscript, created with Rxiv-Maker, serves itself as a template for future users.</description>
