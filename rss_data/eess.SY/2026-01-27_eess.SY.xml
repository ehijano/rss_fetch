      <title>Set-Based Reachability for Low-Thrust Spacecraft in Two-Body and Cislunar Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the application of zonotope-based reachability analysis to low-thrust spacecraft in both two-body and cislunar environments. Reachable sets are generated under two-body and circular restricted three-body (CR3BP) dynamics using set-based methods that approximate nonlinear systems via Taylor expansions. A state-dependent coefficient (SDC) parameterization is also explored to represent nonlinear dynamics in a pseudo-linear form, enabling efficient matrix based propagation of reachable sets. Applications include Earth-Mars transfer and cislunar scenarios such as L1 and L2 Halo orbits and Near Rectilinear Halo Orbits (NRHOs). The resulting reachable sets are used for safe trajectory generation and tracking, with comparisons drawn between model predictive control (MPC) and LQR-based station-keeping. The proposed approach provides a scalable framework for analyzing spacecraft behavior under complex dynamics and control constraints.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Mars Rover Module for Soil Sampling and Life Component Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The search for extraterrestrial life has long been a primary focus of scientific exploration, driven by rapid advancements in technology and our understanding of the universe. The discovery of water on Mars has sparked significant interest, raising the question of whether life could exist on the planet. This study proposes a novel approach to simulate and illustrate the detection of life using a proof-of-life module integrated into a Mars rover. The module is an autonomous system capable of traveling to designated regions, excavating soil, collecting samples, and performing biochemical testing onboard the rover itself. The project is inherently multidisciplinary, integrating mechanical systems such as a drill mechanism and a vacuum system, alongside biochemical analysis for soil testing. The module is capable of successfully detecting the presence or absence of living components of life from the collected soil particles. This proof-of-life module serves as a proof-of-concept for autonomous life detection in extraterrestrial environments and lays the foundation for future exploration missions.</description>

      <title>Robust and learning-augmented algorithms for degradation-aware battery optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the problem of maximizing revenue from a grid-scale battery energy storage system, accounting for uncertain future electricity prices and the effect of degradation on battery lifetime. We formulate this task as an online resource allocation problem. We propose an algorithm, based on online mirror descent, that is no-regret in the stochastic i.i.d. setting and attains finite asymptotic competitive ratio in the adversarial setting (robustness). When untrusted advice about the opportunity cost of degradation is available, we propose a learning-augmented algorithm that performs well when the advice is accurate (consistency) while still retaining robustness properties when the advice is poor.</description>

      <title>AstroTimer: Rethinking Non-Access Stratum Timers in LEO Constellations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) constellations expand 5G coverage to remote regions but differ fundamentally from terrestrial networks due to rapidly changing topologies, fluctuating delays, and constrained onboard resources. Existing 3GPP Non-Access Stratum (NAS) timers, inherited from terrestrial and geostationary (GEO) or medium Earth orbit (MEO) systems, fail to accommodate these dynamics, leading to signaling storms and inefficiency. This paper introduces AstroTimer, a lightweight, adaptive framework for sizing NAS timers based on LEO-specific parameters such as link variability, processing delays, and network-function placement. AstroTimer derives a closed-form timer model with low computational cost and optimizes both watchdog and backoff timers for the 5G registration procedure. Simulation results demonstrate that AstroTimer significantly reduces registration time, retry frequency, and user equipment (UE) energy consumption compared to 3GPP defaults, while preventing signaling overloads. The proposed approach provides an operator-ready foundation for reliable, efficient, and scalable non-terrestrial 5G/6G deployments.</description>

      <title>Polynomial Chaos-based Input Shaper Design under Time-Varying Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The work presented here investigates the application of polynomial chaos expansion toward input shaper design in order to maintain robustness in dynamical systems subject to uncertainty. Furthermore, this work intends to specifically address time-varying uncertainty by employing intrusive polynomial chaos expansion. The methodology presented is validated through numerical simulation of intrusive polynomial chaos expansion formulation applied to spring mass system experiencing time-varying uncertainty in the spring stiffness. The system also evaluates non-robust and robust input shapers through the framework in order to identify designs that minimize residual energy. Results indicate that vibration mitigation is achieved at a similar accuracy, yet at higher efficiency compared to a Monte Carlo framework.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Input Shaper Design for Unknown Second-Order Systems with Real-Time Parameter Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a feedforward input-shaping framework with online parameter estimation for unknown second-order systems. The proposed approach eliminates the need for prior knowledge of system parameters when designing input shaping for precise switching times by incorporating online estimation for a black-box system. The adaptive input shaping scheme accounts for the system's periodic switching behavior and enables reference shaping even when initial switching instants are missed. The proposed framework is evaluated in simulation and is intended for vibration suppression in motion control applications such as gantry cranes and 3D printer headers.</description>

      <title>A new approach for combined model class selection and parameters learning for auto-regressive neural models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces a novel approach for the joint selection of model structure and parameter learning for nonlinear dynamical systems identification. Focusing on a specific Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) family, i.e., Nonlinear Auto-Regressive with eXogenous inputs Echo State Networks (NARXESNs), the method allows to simultaneously select the optimal model class and learn model parameters from data through a new set-membership (SM) based procedure. The results show the effectiveness of the approach in identifying parsimonious yet accurate models suitable for control applications. Moreover, the proposed framework enables a robust training strategy that explicitly accounts for bounded measurement noise and enhances model robustness by allowing data-consistent evaluation of simulation performance during parameter learning, a process generally NP-hard for models with autoregressive components.</description>

      <title>Robust Output Regulation of Uncertain Linear Time-Varying Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robust output regulation for linear time-varying systems has remained an open problem for decades. To address this, we propose intrinsic system immersion by reformulating the regulator equation in a more insightful form, indicating that finding an internal model is equivalent to reproducing the output trajectory of a forced system by constructing an unforced system. This perspective reveals the influence of parametric uncertainties, demonstrating that an infinite-dimensional controller is generally unavoidable for robustness against plant uncertainty. Consequently, a general robust design is proposed without explicitly solving the regulator equation. It ensures robustness against uncertainties in the exosystem interaction, and achieves approximate output regulation when an infinite-dimensional controller is necessary for regulation. Additionally, we study the regulator equation in a coordinate-free framework, extend the time-varying non-resonance condition, and provide a method to minimize the dimension of an internal model. Overall, these results provide a general systematic framework for constructing robust internal model-based controllers, and simplify the control implementation process.</description>

      <title>Battery-Free and Gateway-Free Cellular IoT Water Leak Detection System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a battery-free and gateway-free water leak detection system capable of direct communication over LTE-M (Cat-M1). The system operates solely on energy harvested through a hydroelectric mechanism driven by an electrochemical sensor, thereby removing the need for conventional batteries. To address the stringent startup and operational power demands of LTE-M transceivers, the architecture incorporates a compartmentalized sensing module and a dedicated power management subsystem, comprising a boost converter, supercapacitor based energy storage, and a hysteresis controlled load isolation circuit. This design enables autonomous, direct to cloud data transmission without reliance on local networking infrastructure. Experimental results demonstrate consistent LTE-M beacon transmissions triggered by water induced energy generation, underscoring the system's potential for sustainable, maintenance free, and globally scalable IoT leak detection applications in smart infrastructure.</description>

      <title>Battery-less Long-Range LTE-M Water Leak Detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a self powered water leak sensor that eliminates both batteries and local gateways. The design integrates a dual compartment electrochemical harvester, a low input boost converter with supercapacitor storage, and a comparator gated LTE-M radio built on the Nordic Thingy:91 platform. Laboratory tests confirm that the system can be awakened from a dormant state in the presence of water, harvest sufficient energy, and issue repeated cloud beacons using the water exposure as the power source. Beyond conventional LTE-M deployments, the system's compatibility with 3GPP standard cellular protocols paves the way for future connectivity via non terrestrial 5G networks, enabling coverage in infrastructure scarce regions.</description>

      <title>Composite Adaptive Control Barrier Functions for Safety-Critical Systems with Parametric Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Control barrier functions guarantee safety but typically require accurate system models. Parametric uncertainty invalidates these guarantees. Existing robust methods maintain safety via worst-case bounds, limiting performance, while modular learning schemes decouple estimation from safety, permitting state violations during training. This paper presents the composite adaptive control barrier function (CaCBF) algorithm for nonlinear control-affine systems subject to linear parametric uncertainty. We derive adaptation laws from a composite energy function comprising a logarithmic safety barrier, a control Lyapunov function, and a parameter error term. We prove that CaCBF guarantees the forward invariance of the safe set and the uniform boundedness of the closed-loop system. This safety guarantee holds without requiring parameter convergence. Simulations of adaptive cruise control, an omnidirectional robot, and a planar drone demonstrate the efficacy of the CaCBF algorithm.</description>

      <title>Space-Air-Ground-Integrated Networks: The BER vs. Residual Delay and Doppler Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Perfect Doppler compensation and synchronization is nontrivial due to multi-path Doppler effects and Einstein's theory of relativity in the space-air-ground-integrated networks (SAGINs). Hence, by considering the residual Doppler and the synchronization delay, this paper investigates the bit-error-rate (BER) performance attained under time-varying correlated Shadowed-Rician SAGIN channels. First, a practical SAGIN model is harnessed, encompassing correlated Shadowed-Rician channels, the Snell's law-based path loss, atmospheric absorption, the line-of-sight Doppler compensation, elliptical satellite orbits, and Einstein's theory of relativity. Then, a specific correlation coefficient between the pilot and data symbols is derived in the context of correlated Shadowed-Rician Channels. By exploiting this correlation coefficient, the channel distribution is mimicked by a bi-variate Gamma distribution. Then, a closed-form BER formula is derived under employing least-square channel estimation and equalization for 16-QAM. Our analytical results indicate for a 300-km-altitude LEO that 1) the period of realistic elliptical orbits is around 0.8 seconds longer than that of the idealized circular orbits; and 2) the relativistic delay is lower than 1 $\mu s$ over a full LEO pass (from rise to set). Our numerical results for the L bands quantify the effects of: 1) the residual Doppler; 2) atmospheric shadowing; 3) synchronization errors; and 4) pilot overhead.</description>

      <title>Photovoltaic energy sharing: Implementation and tests on a real collective self-consumption system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research study analyses different types of photovoltaic (PV) energy sharing in a collective self-consumption (CSC) real-case in the Izarbel technological park in France. The analysis is carried out above all from the point of view of the self-consumption rate (SCR) and the savings. After explaining the emergence of the self-consumption concept for the integration of renewable energies, the study case is described. The PV energy is produced in ESTIA1 building and consumed in ESTIA1, 2 and 4 buildings. The main IoT components used to implement the CSC are smart meters and the Tecsol TICs; devices based on the LoRa protocol to retrieve production and consumption data. Then, the characteristics of PV energy sharing in France are explained, in particular the three possible types of energy sharing/allocation (static, dynamic by default and customised dynamic) and the structure of the electricity bill. Finally, the three types of sharing are compared in four scenarios (without and with a data centre, for low and high solar radiation). The results show that the dynamic allocations lead to increases of the SCR and that the customised dynamic sharing increases savings.</description>

      <title>Data-driven nonparametric Li-ion battery ageing model aiming at learning from real operation data -- Part A: Storage operation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional Li-ion battery ageing models, such as electrochemical, semi-empirical and empirical models, require a significant amount of time and experimental resources to provide accurate predictions under realistic operating conditions. At the same time, there is significant interest from industry in the introduction of new data collection telemetry technology. This implies the forthcoming availability of a significant amount of real-world battery operation data. In this context, the development of ageing models able to learn from in-field battery operation data is an interesting solution to mitigate the need for exhaustive laboratory testing. In a series of two papers, a data-driven ageing model is developed for Li-ion batteries under the Gaussian Process framework. A special emphasis is placed on illustrating the ability of the Gaussian Process model to learn from new data observations, providing more accurate and confident predictions, and extending the operating window of the model. This first paper focusses on the systematic modelling and experimental verification of cell degradation through calendar ageing. A specific covariance function is composed, tailored for use in a battery ageing application. Over an extensive dataset involving 32 cells tested during more than three years, different training possibilities are contemplated in order to quantify the minimal number of laboratory tests required for the design of an accurate ageing model. A model trained with only 18 tested cells achieves an overall mean-absolute-error of 0.53% in the capacity curves prediction, after being validated under a broad window of both dynamic and static temperature and SOC storage conditions.</description>

      <title>Data-driven nonparametric Li-ion battery ageing model aiming at learning from real operation data -- Part B: Cycling operation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional Li-ion battery ageing models, such as electrochemical, semi-empirical and empirical models, require a significant amount of time and experimental resources to provide accurate predictions under realistic operating conditions. At the same time, there is significant interest from industry in the introduction of new data collection telemetry technology. This implies the forthcoming availability of a significant amount of real-world battery operation data. In this context, the development of ageing models able to learn from in-field battery operation data is an interesting solution to mitigate the need for exhaustive laboratory testing. In a series of two papers, a data-driven ageing model is developed for Li-ion batteries under the Gaussian Process framework. A special emphasis is placed on illustrating the ability of the Gaussian Process model to learn from new data observations, providing more accurate and confident predictions, and extending the operating window of the model. The first paper of the series focussed on the systematic modelling and experimental verification of cell degradation through calendar ageing. Conversantly, this second paper addresses the same research challenge when the cell is electrically cycled. A specific covariance function is composed, tailored for use in a battery ageing application. Over an extensive dataset involving 124 cells tested during more than three years, different training possibilities are contemplated in order to quantify the minimal number of laboratory tests required for the design of an accurate ageing model. A model trained with only 26 tested cells achieves an overall mean-absolute-error of 1.04% in the capacity curve prediction, after being validated under a broad window of both dynamic and static cycling temperatures, Depth-of-Discharge, middle-SOC, charging and discharging C-rates.</description>

      <title>Validation of a Software-Defined 100-Gb/s RDMA Streaming Architecture for Ultrafast Optoacoustic and Ultrasound Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optoacoustic (OA) imaging has emerged as a powerful investigation tool, with demonstrated applicability in oncology, neuroscience, and cardiovascular biology. However, its clinical translation is limited with the existing OA systems, which often rely on bulky and expensive acquisition hardware mainly optimized for pulse-echo ultrasound (US) imaging. Despite the fact that OA imaging has different requirements for receive bandwidths and timing synchronization with external laser sources, there is a strong need for unified OA-US imaging platforms, as pulse-echo US remains the standard tool for visualizing soft tissues. To address these challenges, we propose a new data acquisition architecture for ultrafast OA and US imaging that fully covers the requirements for large channel counts, wide bandwidth, and software-defined operation. LtL combines state-of-the-art wideband analog front-ends, a Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC integrating FPGA fabric with an Application Processing Unit, and a 100 GbE Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) backend enabling raw-data streaming at up to 95.6 Gb/s. The architecture avoids local buffers followed by burst transfers, which commonly constrain sustainable frame rate and recording intervals, thus achieving true continuous and sustained streaming of raw data. We validate the core elements of the LtL architecture using a 16-channel demonstration system built from commercial evaluation boards. We further verify the signal chain for up to 256-channel scalability, confirming the wide bandwidth capabilities to support state-of-the-art data transmission speeds.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning with Distributed MPC for Fuel-Efficient Platoon Control with Discrete Gear Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cooperative control of groups of autonomous vehicles (AVs), i.e., platoons, is a promising direction to improving the efficiency of autonomous transportation systems. In this context, distributed co-optimization of both vehicle speed and gear position can offer benefits for fuel-efficient driving. To this end, model predictive control (MPC) is a popular approach, optimizing the speed and gear-shift schedule while explicitly considering the vehicles' dynamics over a prediction window. However, optimization over both the vehicles' continuous dynamics and discrete gear positions is computationally intensive, and may require overly long sample times or high-end hardware for real-time implementation. This work proposes a reinforcement learning (RL)-based distributed MPC approach to address this issue. For each vehicle in the platoon, a policy is trained to select and fix the gear positions across the prediction window of a local MPC controller, leaving a significantly simpler continuous optimization problem to be solved as part of a distributed MPC scheme. In order to reduce the computational cost of training and facilitate the scalability of the proposed approach to large platoons, the policies are parameterized such that the emergent multi-agent RL problem can be decoupled into single-agent learning tasks. In addition, a recurrent neural-network (RNN) architecture is proposed for the gear selection policy, such that the learning is scalable even as the number of possible gear-shift schedules grows exponentially with the MPC prediction horizon. In highway-driving simulations, the proposed approach is shown to have a significantly lower computation burden and a comparable performance in terms of fuel-efficient platoon control, with respect to pure MPC-based co-optimization.</description>

      <title>Convex Chance-Constrained Stochastic Control under Uncertain Specifications with Application to Learning-Based Hybrid Powertrain Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a strictly convex chance-constrained stochastic control framework that accounts for uncertainty in control specifications such as reference trajectories and operational constraints. By jointly optimizing control inputs and risk allocation under general (possibly non-Gaussian) uncertainties, the proposed method guarantees probabilistic constraint satisfaction while ensuring strict convexity, leading to uniqueness and continuity of the optimal solution. The formulation is further extended to nonlinear model-based control using exactly linearizable models identified through machine learning. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through model predictive control applied to a hybrid powertrain system.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Prediction of Lower Limb Joint Kinematics, Kinetics, and Ground Reaction Force using Wearable Sensors and Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Walking is a key movement of interest in biomechanics, yet gold-standard data collection methods are time- and cost-expensive. This paper presents a real-time, multimodal, high sample rate lower-limb motion capture framework, based on wireless wearable sensors and machine learning algorithms. Random Forests are used to estimate joint angles from IMU data, and ground reaction force (GRF) is predicted from instrumented insoles, while joint moments are predicted from angles and GRF using deep learning based on the ResNet-16 architecture. All three models achieve good accuracy compared to literature, and the predictions are logged at 1 kHz with a minimal delay of 23 ms for 20s worth of input data. The present work fully relies on wearable sensors, covers all five major lower limb joints, and provides multimodal comprehensive estimations of GRF, joint angles, and moments with minimal delay suitable for biofeedback applications.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of integrated sensing and communications (ISAC), this paper presents an experimental investigation of the relationship between monostatic sensing and naturally bistatic communication channels in an indoor millimeter-wave environment. We characterize the propagation channel in the joint delay--angle domain, extract dominant multipath components (MPCs) and associate them with physical scatterers in the environment, and demonstrate how communication MPCs can be explicitly recovered from sensing channels. Finally, the radar cross-sections (RCSs) of two key scatterers, namely the wall and metal plate, are obtained based on calibrated channel power and reconstructed propagation distances.</description>

Abstract: Drones are becoming more and more popular nowadays. They are small in size, low in cost, and reliable in operation. They contain a variety of sensors and can perform a variety of flight tasks, reaching places that are difficult or inaccessible for humans. Earthquakes damage a lot of infrastructure, making it impossible for rescuers to reach some areas. But drones can help. Many amateur and professional photographers like to use drones for aerial photography. Drones play a non-negligible role in agriculture and transportation too. Drones can be used to spray pesticides, and they can also transport supplies. A quadcopter is a four-rotor drone and has been studied in this paper. In this paper, random noise is added to the quadcopter system and its effects on the drone system are studied. An extended Kalman filter has been used to estimate the state based on noisy observations from the sensor. Based on a SDE system, a linear quadratic Gaussian controller has been implemented. The expectation maximization algorithm has been applied for parameter estimation of the quadcopter. The results of offline parameter estimation and online parameter estimation are presented. The results show that the online parameter estimation has a slightly larger range of convergence values than the offline parameter estimation.</description>

      <title>Data-Efficient Physics-Informed Learning to Model Synchro-Waveform Dynamics of Grid-Integrated Inverter-Based Resources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inverter-based resources (IBRs) exhibit fast transient dynamics during network disturbances, which often cannot be properly captured by phasor and SCADA measurements. This shortcoming has recently been addressed with the advent of waveform measurement units (WMUs), which provide high-resolution, time-synchronized raw voltage and current waveform samples from multiple locations in the power system. However, transient model learning based on synchro-waveform measurements remains constrained by the scarcity of network disturbances and the complexity of the underlying nonlinear dynamics of IBRs. We propose to address these problems by developing a data-efficient physics-informed machine learning (PIML) framework for synchro-waveform analytics that estimates the IBR terminal current response from only a few network disturbance signatures. Here, the physics of the electrical circuits are used to compensate for limited data availability by constraining the learning process through known circuit relationships. Two cases are considered, with known and unknown circuit parameters. In the latter case, the framework jointly learns the transient dynamics of the IBRs and the parameters of the electrical circuit. Case studies using WMU disturbance data across multiple sampling rates shows consistently lower current estimation error with substantially fewer training events than a purely data-driven baseline.</description>

      <title>GenAI-Net: A Generative AI Framework for Automated Biomolecular Network Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biomolecular networks underpin emerging technologies in synthetic biology-from robust biomanufacturing and metabolic engineering to smart therapeutics and cell-based diagnostics-and also provide a mechanistic language for understanding complex dynamics in natural and ecological systems. Yet designing chemical reaction networks (CRNs) that implement a desired dynamical function remains largely manual: while a proposed network can be checked by simulation, the reverse problem of discovering a network from a behavioral specification is difficult, requiring substantial human insight to navigate a vast space of topologies and kinetic parameters with nonlinear and possibly stochastic dynamics. Here we introduce GenAI-Net, a generative AI framework that automates CRN design by coupling an agent that proposes reactions to simulation-based evaluation defined by a user-specified objective. GenAI-Net efficiently produces novel, topologically diverse solutions across multiple design tasks, including dose responses, complex logic gates, classifiers, oscillators, and robust perfect adaptation in deterministic and stochastic settings (including noise reduction). By turning specifications into families of circuit candidates and reusable motifs, GenAI-Net provides a general route to programmable biomolecular circuit design and accelerates the translation from desired function to implementable mechanisms.</description>

Abstract: To support aging-in-place, adult children often provide care to their aging parents from a distance. These informal caregivers desire plug-and-play remote care solutions for privacy-preserving continuous monitoring that enabling real-time activity monitoring and intuitive, actionable information. This short paper presents insights from three iterations of deployment experience for remote monitoring system and the iterative improvement in hardware, modeling, and user interface guided by the Geriatric 4Ms framework (matters most, mentation, mobility, and medication). An LLM-assisted solution is developed to balance user experience (privacy-preserving, plug-and-play) and system performance.</description>

      <title>Higher-Order Gravitational Models: A Tutorial on Spherical Harmonics and the Newtonian Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate modeling of gravitational interactions is fundamental to the analysis, prediction, and control of space systems. While the Newtonian point-mass approximation suffices for many preliminary studies, real celestial bodies exhibit deviations from spherical symmetry, including oblateness, localized mass concentrations, and higher-order shape irregularities. These features can significantly perturb spacecraft trajectories, especially in low-altitude or long-duration missions, leading to cumulative orbit prediction errors and increased control demands. This article presents a tutorial introduction to spherical harmonic gravity models, outlining their theoretical foundations and underlying assumptions. Higher-order gravitational fields are derived as solutions to the Laplace equation, providing a systematic framework to capture the effects of non-uniform mass distributions. The impact of these higher-order terms on orbital dynamics is illustrated through examples involving Low Earth Orbit satellites and spacecraft near irregularly shaped asteroids, highlighting the practical significance of moving beyond the point-mass approximation.</description>

      <title>A Capsule-Sized Multi-Wavelength Wireless Optical System for Edge-AI-Based Classification of Gastrointestinal Bleeding Flow Rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Post-endoscopic gastrointestinal (GI) rebleeding frequently occurs within the first 72 hours after therapeutic hemostasis and remains a major cause of early morbidity and mortality. Existing non-invasive monitoring approaches primarily provide binary blood detection and lack quantitative assessment of bleeding severity or flow dynamic, limiting their ability to support timely clinical decision-making during this high-risk period. In this work, we developed a capsule-sized, multi-wavelength optical sensing wireless platform for order-of-magnitude-level classification of GI bleeding flow rate, leveraging transmission spectroscopy and low-power edge artificial intelligence. The system performs time-resolved, multi-spectral measurements and employs a lightweight two-dimensional convolutional neural network for on-device flow-rate classification, with physics-based validation confirming consistency with wavelength-dependent hemoglobin absorption behavior. In controlled in vitro experiments under simulated gastric conditions, the proposed approach achieved an overall classification accuracy of 98.75% across multiple bleeding flow-rate levels while robustly distinguishing diverse non-blood gastrointestinal interference. By performing embedded inference directly on the capsule electronics, the system reduced overall energy consumption by approximately 88% compared with continuous wireless transmission of raw data, making prolonged, battery-powered operation feasible. Extending capsule-based diagnostics beyond binary blood detection toward continuous, site-specific assessment of bleeding severity, this platform has the potential to support earlier identification of clinically significant rebleeding and inform timely re-intervention during post-endoscopic surveillance.</description>

      <title>Delay-Compensated Stiffness Estimation for Robot-Mediated Dyadic Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robot-mediated human-human (dyadic) interactions enable therapists to provide physical therapy remotely, yet an accurate perception of patient stiffness remains challenging due to network-induced haptic delays. Conventional stiffness estimation methods, which neglect delay, suffer from temporal misalignment between force and position signals, leading to significant estimation errors as delays increase. To address this, we propose a robust, delay-compensated stiffness estimation framework by deriving an algebraic estimator based on quasi-static equilibrium that explicitly accounts for temporally aligning the expert's input with the novice's response. A Normalised Weighted Least Squares (NWLS) implementation is then introduced to robustly filter dynamic bias resulting from the algebraic derivation. Experiments using commercial rehabilitation robots (H-MAN) as the platform demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms the standard estimator, maintaining consistent tracking accuracy under multiple introduced delays. These findings offer a promising solution for achieving high-fidelity haptic perception in remote dyadic interaction, potentially facilitating reliable stiffness assessment in therapeutic settings across networks.</description>

      <title>Interpreting Moment Matrix Blocks Spectra using Mutual Shadow Area</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The mutual shadow area of pairs of surface regions is used for guiding the study of the spectral components and rank of their wave interaction, as captured by the corresponding moment matrix blocks. It is demonstrated that the mutual shadow area provides an asymptotically accurate predictor of the location of the singular value curve knee. This predicted knee index is shown to partition the interacting parts of the range and domain of blocks into two subspaces that can be associated with different wave phenomena: an "aperture" subspace of dimension that scales with the subdomains area (or length in 2-D) and a remainder "diffraction" subspace of dimension that scales much slower with the electrical length, depending on the geometric configuration. For interactions between open surface domains typical for the common hierarchical partitioning in most fast solvers, the latter can be attributed to the domain edges visible by its interacting counterpart. For interactions in 3-D with a small aspect angles between the source and observers, the diffraction subspace dimension is dominant in determining the rank until fairly large electrical lengths are reached. This explains the delayed asymptotic scaling of ranks and impressive fast solver performance observed in recent literature for seemingly arbitrary scatterers with no special geometric characteristics. In the extreme cases of "endfire" reduced dimensionality interactions, where the shadow area vanishes, the diffraction governs also the asymptotic rank, which translates to superior asymptotic solver performance.</description>

      <title>On maximum hands-off restricted hybrid control for discrete-time switched linear systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper deals with design of maximum hands-off hybrid control sequences for discrete-time switched linear systems. It is a sparsest combination of a discrete control sequence (i.e. the switching sequence) and a continuous control sequence, both satisfying pre-specified restrictions on the admissible actions, that steers a given initial state of the switched system to the origin of the state-space in a pre-specified duration of time. Given the subsystems dynamics, the sets of admissible continuous and discrete control, the initial state and the time horizon, we present a new algorithm that, under certain conditions on the subsystems dynamics and the admissible control, designs maximum hands-off hybrid control sequences for the resulting switched system. The key apparatuses for our analysis are graph theory and linear algebra. Numerical examples are presented to demonstrate our results.</description>

      <title>A Cherry-Picking Approach to Large Load Shaping for More Effective Carbon Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Shaping multi-megawatt loads, such as data centers, impacts generator dispatch on the electric grid, which in turn affects system CO2 emissions and energy cost. Substantiating the effectiveness of prevalent load shaping strategies, such as those based on grid-level average carbon intensity, locational marginal price, or marginal emissions, is challenging due to the lack of detailed counterfactual data required for accurate attribution. This study uses a series of calibrated granular ERCOT day-ahead direct current optimal power flow (DC-OPF) simulations for counterfactual analysis of a broad set of load shaping strategies on grid CO2 emissions and cost of electricity. In terms of annual grid level CO2 emissions reductions, LMP-based shaping outperforms other common strategies, but can be significantly improved upon. Examining the performance of practicable strategies under different grid conditions motivates a more effective load shaping approach: one that "cherry-picks" a daily strategy based on observable grid signals and historical data. The cherry-picking approach to power load shaping is applicable to any large flexible consumer on the electricity grid, such as data centers, distributed energy resources and Virtual Power Plants (VPPs).</description>

      <title>Success Conditioning as Policy Improvement: The Optimization Problem Solved by Imitating Success</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A widely used technique for improving policies is success conditioning, in which one collects trajectories, identifies those that achieve a desired outcome, and updates the policy to imitate the actions taken along successful trajectories. This principle appears under many names -- rejection sampling with SFT, goal-conditioned RL, Decision Transformers -- yet what optimization problem it solves, if any, has remained unclear. We prove that success conditioning exactly solves a trust-region optimization problem, maximizing policy improvement subject to a $\chi^2$ divergence constraint whose radius is determined automatically by the data. This yields an identity: relative policy improvement, the magnitude of policy change, and a quantity we call action-influence -- measuring how random variation in action choices affects success rates -- are exactly equal at every state. Success conditioning thus emerges as a conservative improvement operator. Exact success conditioning cannot degrade performance or induce dangerous distribution shift, but when it fails, it does so observably, by hardly changing the policy at all. We apply our theory to the common practice of return thresholding, showing this can amplify improvement, but at the cost of potential misalignment with the true objective.</description>

      <title>A Generative AI-Driven Reliability Layer for Action-Oriented Disaster Resilience</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As climate-related hazards intensify, conventional early warning systems (EWS) disseminate alerts rapidly but often fail to trigger timely protective actions, leading to preventable losses and inequities. We introduce Climate RADAR (Risk-Aware, Dynamic, and Action Recommendation system), a generative AI-based reliability layer that reframes disaster communication from alerts delivered to actions executed. It integrates meteorological, hydrological, vulnerability, and social data into a composite risk index and employs guardrail-embedded large language models (LLMs) to deliver personalized recommendations across citizen, volunteer, and municipal interfaces. Evaluation through simulations, user studies, and a municipal pilot shows improved outcomes, including higher protective action execution, reduced response latency, and increased usability and trust. By combining predictive analytics, behavioral science, and responsible AI, Climate RADAR advances people-centered, transparent, and equitable early warning systems, offering practical pathways toward compliance-ready disaster resilience infrastructures.</description>

      <title>Synchronization and Localization in Ad-Hoc ICAS Networks Using a Two-Stage Kuramoto Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To enable Integrated Communications and Sensing (ICAS) in a peer-to-peer vehicular network, precise synchronization in frequency and phase among the communicating entities is required. In addition, self-driving cars need accurate position estimates of the surrounding vehicles. In this work, we propose a joint, distributed synchronization and localization scheme for a network of communicating entities. Our proposed scheme is mostly signal-agnostic and therefore can be applied to a wide range of possible ICAS signals. We also mitigate the effect of finite sampling frequencies, which otherwise would degrade the synchronization and localization performance severely.</description>

      <title>ART for Diffusion Sampling: A Reinforcement Learning Approach to Timestep Schedule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider time discretization for score-based diffusion models to generate samples from a learned reverse-time dynamic on a finite grid. Uniform and hand-crafted grids can be suboptimal given a budget on the number of time steps. We introduce Adaptive Reparameterized Time (ART) that controls the clock speed of a reparameterized time variable, leading to a time change and uneven timesteps along the sampling trajectory while preserving the terminal time. The objective is to minimize the aggregate error arising from the discretized Euler scheme. We derive a randomized control companion, ART-RL, and formulate time change as a continuous-time reinforcement learning (RL) problem with Gaussian policies. We then prove that solving ART-RL recovers the optimal ART schedule, which in turn enables practical actor--critic updates to learn the latter in a data-driven way. Empirically, based on the official EDM pipeline, ART-RL improves Fr\'echet Inception Distance on CIFAR-10 over a wide range of budgets and transfers to AFHQv2, FFHQ, and ImageNet without the need of retraining.</description>

      <title>AI-Driven Fuzzing for Vulnerability Assessment of 5G Traffic Steering Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traffic Steering (TS) dynamically allocates user traffic across cells to enhance Quality of Experience (QoE), load balance, and spectrum efficiency in 5G networks. However, TS algorithms remain vulnerable to adversarial conditions such as interference spikes, handover storms, and localized outages. To address this, an AI-driven fuzz testing framework based on the Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) is proposed to systematically expose hidden vulnerabilities. Using NVIDIA Sionna, five TS algorithms are evaluated across six scenarios. Results show that AI-driven fuzzing detects 34.3% more total vulnerabilities and 5.8% more critical failures than traditional testing, achieving superior diversity and edge-case discovery. The observed variance in critical failure detection underscores the stochastic nature of rare vulnerabilities. These findings demonstrate that AI-driven fuzzing offers an effective and scalable validation approach for improving TS algorithm robustness and ensuring resilient 6G-ready networks.</description>

      <title>Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning for Efficient Tactical Decision Making for Trucks in Highway Traffic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Balancing safety, efficiency, and operational costs in highway driving poses a challenging decision-making problem for heavy-duty vehicles. A central difficulty is that conventional scalar reward formulations, obtained by aggregating these competing objectives, often obscure the structure of their trade-offs. We present a Proximal Policy Optimization based multi-objective reinforcement learning framework that learns a continuous set of policies explicitly representing these trade-offs and evaluates it on a scalable simulation platform for tactical decision making in trucks. The proposed approach learns a continuous set of Pareto-optimal policies that capture the trade-offs among three conflicting objectives: safety, quantified in terms of collisions and successful completion; energy efficiency and time efficiency, quantified using energy cost and driver cost, respectively. The resulting Pareto frontier is smooth and interpretable, enabling flexibility in choosing driving behavior along different conflicting objectives. This framework allows seamless transitions between different driving policies without retraining, yielding a robust and adaptive decision-making strategy for autonomous trucking applications.</description>

      <title>Feasibility Study of Curvature Effect in Flexible Antenna Arrays for 2-Dimensional Beam Alignment of 6G Wireless Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09590v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article investigates the influential role of flexible antenna array curvature on the performance of 6G communication systems with carrier frequencies above 100 GHz. It is demonstrated that the curvature of flexible antenna arrays can be leveraged for 2-dimensional beam alignment in phased arrays with relatively small insertion loss. The effect of antenna array bending on the radiation properties such as gain and antenna impedance are analytically studied and simulated for a 4x4 microstrip patch antenna array operating between 97.5-102.5 GHz. Moreover, the deployment of this flexible antenna array in conjunction with state-of-the-art flexible board packaging techniques is examined for 6G wireless transceivers based on 65nm CMOS technology and simulated for three variants of quadrature amplitude modulation (4QAM, 16 QAM, and 64 QAM). The communication performance in terms of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and bit error rate (BER) is evaluated using analytical derivations and simulation results which exhibit a relatively close match.</description>

      <title>System-Level Analysis of Module Uncertainty Quantification in the Autonomy Pipeline</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12019v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern autonomous systems with machine learning components often use uncertainty quantification to help produce assurances about system operation. However, there is a lack of consensus in the community on what uncertainty is and how to perform uncertainty quantification. In this work, we propose that uncertainty measures should be understood within the context of overall system design and operation. To this end, we present two novel analysis techniques. First, we produce a probabilistic specification on a module's uncertainty measure given a system specification. Second, we propose a method to measure a system's input-output robustness in order to compare system designs and quantify the impact of making a system uncertainty-aware. In addition to this theoretical work, we present the application of these analyses on two real-world autonomous systems: an autonomous driving system and an aircraft runway incursion detection system. We show that our analyses can determine desired relationships between module uncertainty and error, provide visualizations of how well an uncertainty measure is being used by a system, produce principled comparisons between different uncertainty measures and decision-making algorithm designs, and provide insights into system vulnerabilities and tradeoffs.</description>

      <title>Cooperative Optimal Output Tracking for Discrete-Time Multiagent Systems: Stabilizing Policy Iteration Frameworks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06510v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes two cooperative optimal output tracking (COOT) algorithms based on policy iteration (PI) for discrete-time multi-agent systems with unknown model parameters. First, we establish a stabilizing PI framework that can start from any initial control policy, relaxing the dependence of traditional PI on the initial stabilizing control policy. Then, another efficient and equivalent Q-learning framework is developed, which is shown to require only less system data to get the same results as the stabilizing PI. In the two frameworks, the stabilizing control policy is obtained by gradually iterating the stabilizing virtual system to the actual feedback closed-loop system. Two explicit schemes for adjusting the iteration step-size/coefficient are designed and their stability is analyzed. Finally, the COOT is realized by a distributed feedforward-feedback controller with learned optimal gains. The proposed algorithms are validated by simulation.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Load Estimation for Load-lifting Exoskeletons Using Insole Pressure Sensors and Machine Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07527v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To enhance lifting-load estimation accuracy in industrial upper-limb assistive exoskeletons, this study proposes a machine learning-based approach using insole pressure sensors. Unlike traditional methods that rely on electromyography (EMG), force sensors, or posture data, insole pressure sensors provide a non-invasive, posture-independent, and stable solution suitable for long-term use. Lifting load data ranging from 2 to 10 kg (0.5 kg intervals) were collected from five subjects. Two data representations were investigated: channel-based vectors and map-based images. For the channel-based approach, conventional regression models (SVR, MLP, and Elastic Net) were trained on pooled data from all subjects to assess inter-subject generalization, specifically testing the ability to infer load levels unseen during training. In parallel, a preliminary feasibility study was conducted for the map-based deep learning model (MobileNetV2) using inner-subject data. Results indicate that the channel-based SVR achieved the most balanced accuracy and generalization performance, with a mean absolute error of 0.547 kg. These findings demonstrate the feasibility and advantages of using insole pressure data for variable load estimation, supporting control strategies in industrial exoskeleton applications.</description>

      <title>Backpressure-based Mean-field Type Game for Scheduling in Multi-Hop Wireless Sensor Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03059v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a Mean-Field Type Game (MFTG) framework for effective scheduling in multi-hop wireless sensor networks (WSNs) using backpressure as a performance criterion. Traditional backpressure algorithms leverage queue differentials to regulate data flow and maintain network stability. In this work, we extend the backpressure framework by incorporating a mean-field term into the cost functional, capturing the global behavior of the system alongside local dynamics. The resulting model utilizes the strengths of non-cooperative mean-field type games, enabling nodes to make decentralized decisions based on both individual queue states and system mean-field effects while accounting for stochastic network interactions. By leveraging the interplay between backpressure dynamics and mean-field coupling, the approach balances local optimization with global efficiency. Numerical simulations demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method in handling congestion and scheduling in large-scale WSNs.</description>

      <title>Consumer-based Carbon Costs: Integrating Consumer Carbon Preferences in Electricity Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01076v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An increasing share of consumers care about the carbon footprint of their electricity. This paper analyzes a method to integrate consumer carbon preferences in the electricity market-clearing by introducing consumer-based carbon costs and a carbon allocation mechanism. Specifically, consumers submit not only bids for power but also assign a cost to the carbon emissions incurred by their electricity use. The carbon allocation mechanism then assigns emissions from generation to consumers to minimize overall carbon costs. Our analysis starts from a previously proposed centralized market clearing formulation that maximizes social welfare under consideration of generation costs, consumer utility, and consumer carbon costs. We then derive an equivalent equilibrium formulation that incorporates a carbon allocation problem and gives rise to a set of carbon-adjusted electricity prices for both consumers and generators. We prove that the carbon-adjusted prices are higher for low-emitting generators and consumers with high carbon costs. Further, we prove that this new paradigm satisfies the same desirable market properties as standard electricity markets based on locational marginal prices, namely revenue adequacy and individual rationality, and demonstrate that a carbon tax on generators is equivalent to imposing a uniform carbon cost on consumers. Using a simplified three-bus system and the RTS-GMLC system, we illustrate that consumer-based carbon costs contribute to greener electricity market clearing both through generation redispatch and demand reductions.</description>

Abstract: Residential buildings are increasingly integrating large devices that run natively on direct current (DC), such as solar photovoltaics, electric vehicles, stationary batteries, and DC motors that drive heat pumps and other major appliances. Today, these natively-DC devices typically connect within buildings through alternating current (AC) distribution systems, entailing significant energy losses due to conversions between AC and DC. This paper investigates the alternative of connecting DC devices through DC distribution. Specifically, this paper shows through laboratory and field experiments that an off-the-shelf residential heat pump designed for conventional AC systems can be powered directly on DC with few hardware modifications and little change in performance. Supporting simulations of a DC nanogrid including {historical heat pump and rest-of-house load measurements,} a solar photovoltaic array, and a stationary battery suggest that connecting these devices through DC distribution could decrease annual electricity bills by 12.5% with an after-market AC-to-DC heat pump retrofit and by 16.7% with a heat pump designed to run on DC.</description>

      <title>Cyberattack Detection in Virtualized Microgrids Using LightGBM and Knowledge-Distilled Classifiers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.03495v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern microgrids depend on distributed sensing and communication interfaces, making them increasingly vulnerable to cyber physical disturbances that threaten operational continuity and equipment safety. In this work, a complete virtual microgrid was designed and implemented in MATLAB/Simulink, integrating heterogeneous renewable sources and secondary controller layers. A structured cyberattack framework was developed using MGLib to inject adversarial signals directly into the secondary control pathways. Multiple attack classes were emulated, including ramp, sinusoidal, additive, coordinated stealth, and denial of service behaviors. The virtual environment was used to generate labeled datasets under both normal and attack conditions. The datasets trained Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) models to perform two functions: detecting the presence of an intrusion (binary) and distinguishing among attack types (multiclass). The multiclass model attained 99.72% accuracy and a 99.62% F1 score, while the binary model attained 94.8% accuracy and a 94.3% F1 score. A knowledge-distillation step reduced the size of the multiclass model, allowing faster predictions with only a small drop in performance. Real-time tests showed a processing delay of about 54 to 67 ms per 1000 samples, demonstrating suitability for CPU-based edge deployment in microgrid controllers. The results confirm that lightweight machine learning based intrusion detection methods can provide fast, accurate, and efficient cyberattack detection without relying on complex deep learning models. Key contributions include: (1) development of a complete MATLAB-based virtual microgrid, (2) structured attack injection at the control layer, (3) creation of multiclass labeled datasets, and (4) design of low-cost AI models suitable for practical microgrid cybersecurity.</description>

      <title>Electrical Design of a Clean Offshore Heat and Power (CleanOFF) Hub</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.15040v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents an innovative offshore solution where oil &amp; gas platform clusters are powered by a wind farm and a hydrogen hub. The results show a feasible off-grid design as an alternative to conventional electrification solutions. To address the challenges of design and operation of such a system, a power system model of the equipment and control was developed in a power system simulator called Process Power Simulator (PPSim). Power fluctuations in the wind farm are modelled using a state-of-the-art method encompassing turbulence and wakes. Various operation scenarios were used to evaluate the system design and find the right equipment size. An expensive component to over dimension is the battery energy storage system (BESS). The BESS power rating and energy capacity were found by running a combination of scenarios with extreme and natural wind variations, and contingencies. The control strategy and ramp rates of electrolyzers have significant impact on both system performance and design. A ramp rate in the order of seconds as opposed to minutes will decrease the required BESS size by 60-70%. Choosing synchronized control of the electrolyzers can further reduce the BESS size by 15-20%. The simulations also revealed challenges to achieve self-sufficiency of hydrogen and potential design improvements are suggested.</description>

      <title>Sequential Operating Simulation of Solid State Transformer-Driven Next-Generation 800 VDC Data Center</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.16502v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Artificial-intelligence (AI) workloads are driving rapid growth in data-center electricity use and rack power density, increasing demand for power-delivery systems that are efficient and robust to fast load transients. Conventional uninterruptible power supply (UPS) based AC distribution chains involve multiple conversion stages and line-frequency transformers, which compound losses and are less compatible with dynamic AI power profiles. Although solid-state transformers (SSTs) and 800 VDC distribution architecture are widely discussed, implementable topology/control details, and long-horizon validation with realistic operating profiles remain limited. This paper develops an SST-driven 800 VDC architecture that converts 10 kV MVAC to an 800V LVDC bus using a three-phase H-bridge AC/DC stage cascaded with a dual-active-bridge (DAB) DC/DC stage. A coordinated closed-loop control scheme, combining rectifier voltage/current regulation and DAB phase-shift control, is designed to maintain DC-bus voltage stability. The proposed system is implemented on the real-time digital simulation (RTDS) platform and evaluated via sequential simulations using real-world day- and month-scale operating profiles of data centers, benchmarked against a UPS supply chain. Numerical studies demonstrate tight 800 VDC regulation, reduced input-side energy consumption compared with the UPS baseline, and satisfactory power-quality performance. A capacitance sensitivity test quantifies tradeoffs between DC-bus ripple and low-frequency input-power oscillations, yielding a practical capacitance range for design. Overall, the work provides a reproducible evaluation workflow and actionable guidance for next-generation AI data centers.</description>

      <title>Goal-oriented Semantic Communication for Robot Arm Reconstruction in Digital Twin: Feature and Temporal Selections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08835v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As one of the most promising technologies in industry, the Digital Twin (DT) facilitates real-time monitoring and predictive analysis for real-world systems by precisely reconstructing virtual replicas of physical entities. However, this reconstruction faces unprecedented challenges due to the everincreasing communication overhead, especially for digital robot arm reconstruction. To this end, we propose a novel goal-oriented semantic communication (GSC) framework to extract the GSC information for the robot arm reconstruction task in the DT, with the aim of minimising the communication load under the strict and relaxed reconstruction error constraints. Unlike the traditional reconstruction framework that periodically transmits a reconstruction message for real-time DT reconstruction, our framework implements a feature selection (FS) algorithm to extract the semantic information from the reconstruction message, and a deep reinforcement learning-based temporal selection algorithm to selectively transmit the semantic information over time. We validate our proposed GSC framework through both Pybullet simulations and lab experiments based on the Franka Research 3 robot arm. For a range of distinct robotic tasks, simulation results show that our framework can reduce the communication load by at least 59.5% under strict reconstruction error constraints and 80% under relaxed reconstruction error constraints, compared with traditional communication framework. Also, experimental results confirm the effectiveness of our framework, where the communication load is reduced by 53% in strict constraint case and 74% in relaxed constraint case.

      <title>Data-Driven Distributed Optimization via Aggregative Tracking and Deep-Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04668v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel distributed data-driven optimization scheme. In detail, we focus on the so-called aggregative framework, a scenario in which a set of agents aim to cooperatively minimize the sum of local costs, each depending on both local decision variables and an aggregation of all of them. We consider a data-driven setup where each objective function is unknown and can be sampled at a single point per iteration (thanks to, e.g., feedback from users or sensors). We address this scenario through a distributed algorithm combining three components: (i) a learning part leveraging neural networks to learn the local costs descent direction, (ii) an optimization routine steering the estimates according to the learned direction to minimize the global cost, and (iii) a tracking mechanism locally reconstructing the unavailable global quantities. Using tools from system theory, i.e., timescale separation and averaging theory, we formally prove that in strongly convex setups, the distributed scheme linearly converges to a neighborhood of the optimum, whose radius depends on the accuracy of the neural networks. Finally, numerical simulations validate the theoretical results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19412v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, a constrained parameter update law is derived in the context of adaptive control. The parameter update law is based on constrained optimization technique where a Lagrangian is formulated to incorporate the constraints on the parameters using inverse Barrier function. The constrained parameter update law is used to develop a adaptive tracking controller and the overall stability of the adaptive controller along with the constrained parameter update law is shown using Lyapunov analysis and development in stability of constrained primal-dual dynamics. The performance of the constrained parameter update law is tested in simulation for keeping the parameters within constraints and convergence to true parameters.</description>

      <title>Derandomizing Simultaneous Confidence Regions for Band-Limited Functions by Improved Norm Bounds and Majority-Voting Schemes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17764v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Band-limited functions are fundamental objects that are widely used in systems theory and signal processing. In this paper we refine a recent nonparametric, nonasymptotic method for constructing simultaneous confidence regions for band-limited functions from noisy input-output measurements, by working in a Paley-Wiener reproducing kernel Hilbert space. Kernel norm bounds are tightened using a uniformly-randomized Hoeffding's inequality for small samples and an empirical Bernstein bound for larger ones. We derive an approximate threshold, based on the sample size and how informative the inputs are, that governs which bound to deploy. Finally, we apply majority voting to aggregate confidence sets from random subsamples, boosting both stability and region size. We prove that even per-input aggregated intervals retain their simultaneous coverage guarantee. These refinements are also validated through numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Vision-Proprioception Fusion with Mamba2 in End-to-End Reinforcement Learning for Motion Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07593v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: End-to-end reinforcement learning (RL) for motion control trains policies directly from sensor inputs to motor commands, enabling unified controllers for different robots and tasks. However, most existing methods are either blind (proprioception-only) or rely on fusion backbones with unfavorable compute-memory trade-offs. Recurrent controllers struggle with long-horizon credit assignment, and Transformer-based fusion incurs quadratic cost in token length, limiting temporal and spatial context. We present a vision-driven cross-modal RL framework built on SSD-Mamba2, a selective state-space backbone that applies state-space duality (SSD) to enable both recurrent and convolutional scanning with hardware-aware streaming and near-linear scaling. Proprioceptive states and exteroceptive observations (e.g., depth tokens) are encoded into compact tokens and fused by stacked SSD-Mamba2 layers. The selective state-space updates retain long-range dependencies with markedly lower latency and memory use than quadratic self-attention, enabling longer look-ahead, higher token resolution, and stable training under limited compute. Policies are trained end-to-end under curricula that randomize terrain and appearance and progressively increase scene complexity. A compact, state-centric reward balances task progress, energy efficiency, and safety. Across diverse motion-control scenarios, our approach consistently surpasses strong state-of-the-art baselines in return, safety (collisions and falls), and sample efficiency, while converging faster at the same compute budget. These results suggest that SSD-Mamba2 provides a practical fusion backbone for resource-constrained robotic and autonomous systems in engineering informatics applications.</description>

      <title>Stabilizing Policy Gradient Methods via Reward Profiling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.16629v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Policy gradient methods, which have been extensively studied in the last decade, offer an effective and efficient framework for reinforcement learning problems. However, their performances can often be unsatisfactory, suffering from unreliable reward improvements and slow convergence, due to high variance in gradient estimations. In this paper, we propose a universal reward profiling framework that can be seamlessly integrated with any policy gradient algorithm, where we selectively update the policy based on high-confidence performance estimations. We theoretically justify that our technique will not slow down the convergence of the baseline policy gradient methods, but with high probability, will result in stable and monotonic improvements of their performance. Empirically, on eight continuous-control benchmarks (Box2D and MuJoCo/PyBullet), our profiling yields up to 1.5x faster convergence to near-optimal returns, up to 1.75x reduction in return variance on some setups. Our profiling approach offers a general, theoretically grounded path to more reliable and efficient policy learning in complex environments.</description>

      <title>Random Access for LEO Satellite Communication Systems via Deep Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07053v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Integrating contention-based random access procedures into low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite communication (SatCom) systems poses new challenges, including long propagation delays, large Doppler shifts, and a large number of simultaneous access attempts. These factors degrade the efficiency and responsiveness of conventional random access schemes, particularly in scenarios such as satellite-based internet of things and direct-to-device services. In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based random access framework designed for LEO SatCom systems. The framework incorporates an early preamble collision classifier that uses multi-antenna correlation features and a lightweight 1D convolutional neural network to estimate the number of collided users at the earliest stage. Based on this estimate, we introduce an opportunistic transmission scheme that balances access probability and resource efficiency to improve success rates and reduce delay. Simulation results under 3GPP-compliant LEO settings confirm that the proposed framework achieves higher access success probability, lower delay, better physical uplink shared channel utilization, and reduced computational complexity compared to existing schemes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.20791v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the framework of a real Hilbert space we consider the problem of approaching solutions to a class of hierarchical variational inequality problems, subsuming several other problem classes including certain mathematical programs under equilibrium constraints, constrained min-max problems, hierarchical game problems, optimal control under VI constraints, and simple bilevel optimization problems. For this general problem formulation, we establish rates of convergence in terms of suitably constructed gap functions, measuring feasibility gaps and optimality gaps. We present worst-case iteration complexity results on both levels of the variational problem, as well as weak convergence under a geometric weak sharpness condition on the lower level solution set. Our results match and improve the state of the art in terms of their iteration complexity and the generality of the problem formulation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.16078v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the core advantages of SE2(3) Lie group framework for navigation modeling lies in the autonomy of error propagation. In the previous paper, the theoretical analysis of autonomy property of navigation model in inertial, earth and world frames was given. A construction method for SE2(3) group navigation model is proposed to improve the non-inertial navigation model toward full autonomy. This paper serves as a counterpart to previous paper and conducts the real-world strapdown inertial navigation system (SINS)/odometer(ODO) experiments as well as Monte-Carlo simulations to demonstrate the performance of improved SE2(3) group based high-precision navigation models.</description>
