      <title>Reconstructing redshift distributions with photometric galaxy clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accurate determination of the true redshift distributions in tomographic bins is critical for cosmological constraints from photometric surveys. The proposed redshift self-calibration method, which utilizes the photometric galaxy clustering alone, is highly convenient and avoids the challenges from incomplete or unrepresentative spectroscopic samples in external calibration. However, the imperfection of the theoretical approximation on broad bins as well as the flaw of the previous algorithm risk the accuracy and application of the method. In this paper, we propose the improved self-calibration algorithm that incorporates novel update rules, which effectively accounts for heteroskedastic weights and noisy data with negative values. The improved algorithm greatly expands the application range of self-calibration method and accurately reconstructs the redshift distributions for various mock data. Using the luminous red galaxy (LRG) sample of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) survey, we find that the reconstructed results are comparable to the state-of-the-art external calibration. This suggests the exciting prospect of using photometric galaxy clustering to reconstruct redshift distributions in the cosmological analysis of survey data.</description>

      <title>First Constraints on a Pixelated Universe in Light of DESI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pixelated dark energy is a string theory scenario with a quantum mechanically stable cosmological constant. The number of pixels that make up the universe slowly increases, manifesting as a time-dependent source of dark energy. DESI has recently reported evidence for dynamical dark energy that fits within this framework. In light of this, we perform the first cosmological analysis of the pixelated model. We find that the simplest model where the pixel growth rate is constant is unable to accommodate the data, providing a comparable fit to $\Lambda$CDM; but that models where the pixel growth rate is increasing and of order the Hubble constant today are compatible. Our analysis helps to clarify the features of UV constructions of dark energy necessary to accommodate the data.</description>

      <title>Large-scale geometry and topology of gas fields: the effects of AGN and stellar feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar and AGN feedback primarily affect the formation and evolution of galaxies and the circumgalactic medium, leaving some imprint on larger scales. Based on the SIMBA hydrodynamical simulation suite, and using the full set of Minkowski functionals (MFs), this study systematically analyses the time evolution of the global geometry and topology of the gas temperature, pressure, density (total, HI and H$_2$), and metallicity fields between redshift $z=5$ and $z=0$. MFs show that small-scale astrophysical processes are persistent and manifest on larger, up to tens of Mpc scales, highlighting the specific morphological signatures of the relevant feedback mechanisms on such scales in the last $\sim12$~Gyr. In qualitative terms, one can establish a ranking that varies according to the field considered: stellar feedback mostly determines the morphology of the pressure and density fields, AGN jets are the first cause for the morphology of the temperature and metallicity fields, while X-ray heating and AGN winds play the second most important role in shaping the geometry and topology of all the gaseous fields but metallicity. Hence the cosmic evolution of the geometry and topology of fields characterising the thermodynamical and chemical properties of the cosmic web provides complementary larger-scale constraints to galaxy formation models.</description>

      <title>Observational constraints on thawing quintessence scalar field model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thawing quintessence scalar field models with the various potential forms to explain the late-time cosmic acceleration are compared to the {\Lambda}CDM model in detail by analyzing cosmological parameters with a set of observational data including H(z), BAO, CMB, SNIa, BBN, and f(z){\sigma}8 at the background and the perturbation levels. At low redshifts for the thawing quintessence scalar field models, the growth rate of the cosmic structure is significant. By utilizing a standard Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) procedure based on the recent expansion and the growth observational data with the statistical values of the Akaike and the Bayesian information criteria, we discuss the consistency of the thawing quintessence scalar field models with the set of different potentials with the observational data. The main consequence of this work is that despite the various considered potential forms that are very popular in the literature, we should be looking for consistent potential forms with observational data.

      <title>Towards Precision Photometric Type Ia Supernova Cosmology with Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The revolutionary discovery of dark energy and accelerating cosmic expansion was made with just 42 type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) in 1999. Since then, large synoptic surveys, e.g., Dark Energy Survey (DES), have observed thousands more SNe Ia and the upcoming Rubin Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) and Roman Space Telescope promise to deliver millions in the next decade. This unprecedented data volume can be used to test concordance cosmology. However, extracting a pure SN Ia sample with accurate redshifts for such a large dataset will be a challenge. Spectroscopic classification will not be possible for the vast majority of discovered objects, and only 25% will have spectroscopic redshifts. This thesis presents a series of observational and methodological studies designed to address the questions associated with this new era of photometric SN Ia cosmology. First, we present a machine learning (ML) method for SN photometric classification, SCONE. Photometric classification enables SNe with no spectroscopic information to be categorized, a critical step for cosmological analysis. SCONE achieves 99+% accuracy distinguishing simulated SNe Ia from non-Ia SNe, and is a part of DES, LSST, and Roman analysis pipelines. We also show that SCONE can classify 6 SN types with 75% accuracy on the night of initial discovery, comparable to results in the literature for full-phase SNe. Next, we study current methods for estimating SN Ia redshifts and propose an ML alternative that uses SN photometry alone to extract redshift information. Photo-zSNthesis is a host galaxy-independent redshift estimator accurate to within 2% across the redshift range of LSST, a first in the literature. Finally, we focus on ML robustness and demonstrate a general method for improving robustness that achieves new state-of-the-art results on astronomical object classification, wildlife identification, and tumor detection.</description>

      <title>On the capability of high redshift kSZ measurement with galaxy surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The kSZ effect has been detected at z&lt;1 using various techniques and data sets. The ongoing and upcoming spectroscopic galaxy surveys such as DESI and PFS will push the detection beyond z = 1, and therefore map the baryon distribution at high redshifts. Such detection can be achieved by both the kSZ stacking and tomography methods. While the two methods are theoretically equivalent, they differ significantly in the probed physics and scales, and required data sets. Taking the combination of PFS and ACT as an example, we build mocks of kSZ and galaxies, quantify the kSZ detection S/N, and compare between the two methods. We segment the PFS galaxies into three redshift bins: 0.6 &lt; z &lt; 1.0, 1.0 &lt; z &lt; 1.6, and 1.6 &lt; z &lt; 2.4. For tomography method, our analysis reveals that the two higher redshift bins exhibit higher S/N, with values of 32 and 28, respectively, compared to the first redshift bin (S/N = 8). This is attributed to not only the increasing of electron density with redshifts, but also the larger survey volume and the reduced non-linearity, facilitating velocity reconstruction at higher redshifts. Therefore, the capability of the PFS survey to measure high redshift kSZ effect stands as a substantial advantage over other spectroscopic surveys at lower redshift. The S/N of kSZ stacking largely depends on the number of clusters/groups available from another photometric survey. But in general, its S/N is lower than that of kSZ tomography. Incorporating next-generation CMB surveys like CMB-S4, characterized by significantly reduced instrument noise and improved angular resolution, is expected to enhance tomographic detection by a factor of ten and stacking detection by five. This future high S/N detection holds the promise of not only providing precise constraints on the overall baryon abundance but also initiating a new insight into baryon distribution.</description>

      <title>Mitigation of DESI fiber assignment incompleteness effect on two-point clustering with small angular scale truncated estimators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a method to mitigate the effects of fiber assignment incompleteness in two-point power spectrum and correlation function measurements from galaxy spectroscopic surveys, by truncating small angular scales from estimators. We derive the corresponding modified correlation function and power spectrum windows to account for the small angular scale truncation in the theory prediction. We validate this approach on simulations reproducing the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Data Release 1 (DR1) with and without fiber assignment. We show that we recover unbiased cosmological constraints using small angular scale truncated estimators from simulations with fiber assignment incompleteness, with respect to standard estimators from complete simulations. Additionally, we present an approach to remove the sensitivity of the fits to high $k$ modes in the theoretical power spectrum, by applying a transformation to the data vector and window matrix. We find that our method efficiently mitigates the effect of fiber assignment incompleteness in two-point correlation function and power spectrum measurements, at low computational cost and with little statistical loss.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Forecasts from the Baryon Acoustic Oscillations in 21cm Intensity Mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) feature in the angular power spectrum (APS) of the 21cm line of neutral hydrogen (HI) to constrain cosmological parameters. As the BAO shift parameter can only constrain the product of the Hubble constant and the sound horizon $H_0r_s$, we combine our Fisher matrices with cosmic microwave background (CMB) Fisher matrices from the covariance of $Planck$ telescope to break this degeneracy. In particular, we find that the best constraints we can get with this method are on the Hubble parameter $h$, and the dark energy parameters $w_0$ and $w_a$. Assuming a noise level as for the BINGO telescope, we find $\sigma_h = 0.0055\;(0.8\%)$ in the $\Lambda$CDM model. For the $w$CDM model, we find $\sigma_h = 0.020\;(2.9\%)$ and $\sigma_{w_0} = 0.075\;(7.5\%)$. In the CPL parameterization, we find $\sigma_h = 0.029\;(4.4\%)$, $\sigma_{w_0} = 0.40\;(40\%)$, and $\sigma_{w_a} = 1.7$. Although these constraints improve those from $Planck$ alone, we observe the BINGO data will be more significant for the $w$CDM model. We also observe the constraints from the BAO only is not as strong as using the whole 21cm angular power spectrum, but it is less susceptible to systematic effects.</description>

      <title>Recovering a phase transition signal in simulated LISA data with a modulated galactic foreground</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic backgrounds of gravitational waves from primordial first-order phase transitions are a key probe of physics beyond the Standard Model. They represent one of the best prospects for observing or constraining new physics with the LISA gravitational wave observatory. However, the large foreground population of galactic binaries in the same frequency range represents a challenge, and will hinder the recovery of a stochastic background. To test the recoverability of a stochastic gravitational wave background, we use the LISA Simulation Suite to generate data incorporating both a stochastic background and an annually modulated foreground modelling the galactic binary population, and the Bayesian analysis code Cobaya to attempt to recover the model parameters. By applying the Deviance Information Criterion to compare models with and without a stochastic background we place bounds on the detectability of gravitational waves from first-order phase transitions. By further comparing models with and without the annual modulation, we show that exploiting the modulation improves the goodness-of-fit and gives a modest improvement to the bounds on detectable models.</description>

      <title>Measuring the circular polarization of gravitational waves with pulsar timing arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The circular polarization of the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) is a key observable for characterising the origin of the signal detected by Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) collaborations. Both the astrophysical and the cosmological SGWB can have a sizeable amount of circular polarization, due to Poisson fluctuations in the source properties for the former, and to parity violating processes in the early universe for the latter. Its measurement is challenging since PTA are blind to the circular polarization monopole, forcing us to turn to anisotropies for detection. We study the sensitivity of current and future PTA datasets to circular polarization anisotropies, focusing on realistic modelling of intrinsic and kinematic anisotropies for astrophysical and cosmological scenarios respectively. Our results indicate that the expected level of circular polarization for the astrophysical SGWB should be within the reach of near future datasets, while for cosmological SGWB circular polarization is a viable target for more advanced SKA-type experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: First-order primordial curvature perturbations are known to induce gravitational waves at the second-order, which can in turn probe the small-scale curvature perturbations near the end of the inflation. In this work, we extend the previous analysis in the Gaussian case into the non-Gaussian case, with particular efforts to obtain some thumb rules of sandwiching the associated peaks in gravitational waves induced from multiple peaks of non-Gaussian curvature perturbations.</description>

      <title>The Dark Energy Survey Supernova Program: Light curves and 5-Year data release</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present $griz$ photometric light curves for the full 5 years of the Dark Energy Survey Supernova program (DES-SN), obtained with both forced Point Spread Function (PSF) photometry on Difference Images (DIFFIMG) performed during survey operations, and Scene Modelling Photometry (SMP) on search images processed after the survey. This release contains $31,636$ DIFFIMG and $19,706$ high-quality SMP light curves, the latter of which contains $1635$ photometrically-classified supernovae that pass cosmology quality cuts. This sample spans the largest redshift ($z$) range ever covered by a single SN survey ($0.1&lt;z&lt;1.13$) and is the largest single sample from a single instrument of SNe ever used for cosmological constraints. We describe in detail the improvements made to obtain the final DES-SN photometry and provide a comparison to what was used in the DES-SN3YR spectroscopically-confirmed SN Ia sample. We also include a comparative analysis of the performance of the SMP photometry with respect to the real-time DIFFIMG forced photometry and find that SMP photometry is more precise, more accurate, and less sensitive to the host-galaxy surface brightness anomaly. The public release of the light curves and ancillary data can be found at https://github.com/des-science/DES-SN5YR. Finally, we discuss implications for future transient surveys, such as the forthcoming Vera Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST).</description>

      <title>The Dark Energy Survey : Detection of weak lensing magnification of supernovae and constraints on dark matter haloes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The residuals of the distance moduli of Type Ia supernovae (SN Ia) relative to a Hubble diagram fit contain information about the inhomogeneity of the universe, due to weak lensing magnification by foreground matter. By correlating the residuals of the Dark Energy Survey Year 5 SN Ia sample (DES-SN5YR) with extra-galactic foregrounds from the DES Y3 Gold catalog, we detect the presence of lensing at $6.0 \sigma$ significance. This is the first detection with a significance level above $5\sigma$. Constraints on the effective mass-to-light ratios and radial profiles of dark-matter haloes surrounding individual galaxies are also obtained. We show that the scatter of SNe Ia around the Hubble diagram is reduced by modifying the standardisation of the distance moduli to include an easily calculable de-lensing (i.e., environmental) term. We use the de-lensed distance moduli to recompute cosmological parameters derived from SN Ia, finding in Flat $w$CDM a difference of $\Delta \Omega_{\rm M} = +0.036$ and $\Delta w = -0.056$ compared to the unmodified distance moduli, a change of $\sim 0.3\sigma$. We argue that our modelling of SN Ia lensing will lower systematics on future surveys with higher statistical power. We use the observed dispersion of lensing in DES-SN5YR to constrain $\sigma_8$, but caution that the fit is sensitive to uncertainties at small scales. Nevertheless, our detection of SN Ia lensing opens a new pathway to study matter inhomogeneity that complements galaxy-galaxy lensing surveys and has unrelated systematics.</description>

      <title>The Dark Energy Survey Supernova Program: Investigating Beyond-$\Lambda$CDM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report constraints on a variety of non-standard cosmological models using the full 5-year photometrically-classified type Ia supernova sample from the Dark Energy Survey (DES-SN5YR). Both Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Suspiciousness calculations find no strong evidence for or against any of the non-standard models we explore. When combined with external probes, the AIC and Suspiciousness agree that 11 of the 15 models are moderately preferred over Flat-$\Lambda$CDM suggesting additional flexibility in our cosmological models may be required beyond the cosmological constant. We also provide a detailed discussion of all cosmological assumptions that appear in the DES supernova cosmology analyses, evaluate their impact, and provide guidance on using the DES Hubble diagram to test non-standard models. An approximate cosmological model, used to perform bias corrections to the data holds the biggest potential for harbouring cosmological assumptions. We show that even if the approximate cosmological model is constructed with a matter density shifted by $\Delta\Omega_m\sim0.2$ from the true matter density of a simulated data set the bias that arises is sub-dominant to statistical uncertainties. Nevertheless, we present and validate a methodology to reduce this bias.</description>

      <title>The Dark Energy Survey Supernova Program: An updated measurement of the Hubble constant using the Inverse Distance Ladder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We measure the current expansion rate of the Universe, Hubble's constant $H_0$, by calibrating the absolute magnitudes of supernovae to distances measured by Baryon Acoustic Oscillations. This `inverse distance ladder' technique provides an alternative to calibrating supernovae using nearby absolute distance measurements, replacing the calibration with a high-redshift anchor. We use the recent release of 1829 supernovae from the Dark Energy Survey spanning $0.01\lt z \lt1.13$ anchored to the recent Baryon Acoustic Oscillation measurements from DESI spanning $0.30 \lt z_{\mathrm{eff}} \lt 2.33$. To trace cosmology to $z=0$, we use the third-, fourth- and fifth-order cosmographic models, which, by design, are agnostic about the energy content and expansion history of the universe. With the inclusion of the higher-redshift DESI-BAO data, the third-order model is a poor fit to both data sets, with the fourth-order model being preferred by the Akaike Information Criterion. Using the fourth-order cosmographic model, we find $H_0=67.19^{+0.66}_{-0.64}\mathrm{~km} \mathrm{~s}^{-1} \mathrm{~Mpc}^{-1}$, in agreement with the value found by Planck without the need to assume Flat-$\Lambda$CDM. However the best-fitting expansion history differs from that of Planck, providing continued motivation to investigate these tensions.</description>

      <title>The Dark Energy Survey Supernova Program: Slow supernovae show cosmological time dilation out to $z \sim 1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a precise measurement of cosmological time dilation using the light curves of 1504 type Ia supernovae from the Dark Energy Survey spanning a redshift range $0.1\lesssim z\lesssim 1.2$. We find that the width of supernova light curves is proportional to $(1+z)$, as expected for time dilation due to the expansion of the Universe. Assuming type Ia supernovae light curves are emitted with a consistent duration $\Delta t_{\rm em}$, and parameterising the observed duration as $\Delta t_{\rm obs}=\Delta t_{\rm em}(1+z)^b$, we fit for the form of time dilation using two methods. Firstly, we find that a power of $b \approx 1$ minimises the flux scatter in stacked subsamples of light curves across different redshifts. Secondly, we fit each target supernova to a stacked light curve (stacking all supernovae with observed bandpasses matching that of the target light curve) and find $b=1.003\pm0.005$ (stat) $\pm\,0.010$ (sys). Thanks to the large number of supernovae and large redshift-range of the sample, this analysis gives the most precise measurement of cosmological time dilation to date, ruling out any non-time-dilating cosmological models at very high significance.</description>

      <title>Modelling the impact of host galaxy dust on type Ia supernova distance measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) are a critical tool in measuring the accelerating expansion of the universe. Recent efforts to improve these standard candles have focused on incorporating the effects of dust on distance measurements with SNe Ia. In this paper, we use the state-of-the-art Dark Energy Survey 5 year sample to evaluate two different families of dust models: empirical extinction models derived from SNe Ia data, and physical attenuation models from the spectra of galaxies. Among the SNe Ia-derived models, we find that a logistic function of the total-to-selective extinction RV best recreates the correlations between supernova distance measurements and host galaxy properties, though an additional 0.02 magnitudes of grey scatter are needed to fully explain the scatter in SNIa brightness in all cases. These empirically-derived extinction distributions are highly incompatible with the physical attenuation models from galactic spectral measurements. From these results, we conclude that SNe Ia must either preferentially select extreme ends of galactic dust distributions, or that the characterisation of dust along the SNe Ia line-of-sight is incompatible with that of galactic dust distributions.</description>

      <title>Cosmological parameters from the joint analysis of Density Split and Second Order Statistics: an Emulator based on the Halo Occupation Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we develop a simulation-based model to predict the density split (DSS) and second-order shear and clustering statistics. A simulation-based model has the potential to model highly non-linear scales where current DSS models fail. To build this model, we use the \texttt{AbacusSummit} N-body simulation suite from which we measure all necessary statistics and train an emulator based on \texttt{CosmoPower}. In that context, we discuss possible improvements for future emulators to make the measurement less noisy and biased, resulting in more accurate and precise model predictions.
  Regarding the emulator's accuracy, we find that the most important aspect is the average of the summary statistics over multiple-shot noise realizations of the foreground galaxies. However, these results probably depend on the chosen number density of the foreground galaxies. Regarding the parameter forecast based on preliminary LOWZxUNIONS data, we find that DSS has more constraining power to derive cosmological parameters and that the joint analysis with second-order statistics is particularly useful for extracting parameters of the galaxy-halo connection.</description>

      <title>Third-order intrinsic alignment of SDSS BOSS LOWZ galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmic shear is a powerful probe of cosmology, but it is affected by the intrinsic alignment (IA) of galaxy shapes with the large-scale structure. Upcoming surveys like Euclid and Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) require an accurate understanding of IA, particularly for higher-order cosmic shear statistics that are vital for extracting the most cosmological information. In this paper, we report the first detection of third-order IA correlations using the LOWZ galaxy sample from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS). We compare our measurements with predictions from the MICE cosmological simulation and an analytical NLA-inspired model informed by second-order correlations. We also explore the dependence of the third-order correlation on the galaxies' luminosity. We find that the amplitude $A_\mathrm{IA}$ of the IA signal is non-zero at the $4.7\sigma$ ($7.6\sigma$) level for scales between $6 h^{-1} \mathrm{Mpc}$ ($1 h^{-1} \mathrm{Mpc}$) and $20 h^{-1} \mathrm{Mpc}$. For scales above $6 h^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}$ the inferred AIA agrees both with the prediction from the simulation and estimates from second-order statistics within $1\sigma$ but deviations arise at smaller scales. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of measuring third-order IA correlations and using them for constraining IA models. The agreement between second- and third-order IA constraints also opens the opportunity for a consistent joint analysis and IA self-calibration, promising tighter parameter constraints for upcoming cosmological surveys.</description>

      <title>Eccentricity effects on the SMBH GW background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study how eccentricity affects the gravitational wave (GW) spectrum from supermassive black hole (SMBH) binaries. We develop a fast and accurate semi-analytic method for computing the GW spectra, the distribution for the spectral fluctuations and the correlations between different frequencies. As GW emission circularizes binaries, the suppression of the signal strength due to eccentricity will be relevant for signals from wider binaries emitting at lower frequencies. Such a feature is present in the signal observed at pulsar timing arrays. We find that, when orbital decay of the SMBH binaries is driven by GWs only, the shape of the observed signal prefers highly eccentric binaries $\langle e \rangle_{2\,{\rm nHz}} = 0.83^{+0.04}_{-0.05}$. However, when environmental effects are included, the initial eccentricity can be significantly lowered yet the scenario with purely circular binaries is mildly disfavored.</description>

      <title>The MUSE eXtremely Deep Field: Detections of circumgalactic SiII* emission at z&gt;~2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The circumgalactic medium (CGM) serves as a baryon reservoir that connects galaxies to the intergalactic medium and fuels star formation. The spatial distribution of the metal-enriched cool CGM has not yet been directly revealed at cosmic noon (z~2-4), as bright emission lines at these redshifts are not covered by optical integral field units. To remedy this situation, we aim for the first-ever detections and exploration of extended SiII* emission (low-ionization state, LIS), referred to as ``SiII* halos'', at redshifts ranging from z=2 to 4 as a means to trace the metal-enriched cool CGM. We use a sample of 39 galaxies with systemic redshifts of z=2.1-3.9 measured with the [CIII] doublet in the MUSE Hubble Ultra Deep Field catalog, which contains integration times spanning from ~30 to 140 hours. We search for extended SiII*1265, 1309, 1533 emission (fluorescent lines) around individual galaxies. We also stack a subsample of 14 UV-bright galaxies. We report five individual detections of SiII*1533 halos. We also confirm the presence of SiII*1533 halos in stacks for the subsample containing UV-bright sources. The other lines do not show secure detections of extended emission in either individual or stacking analyses. These detections may imply that the presence of metal-enriched CGM is a common characteristic for UV-bright galaxies. To investigate whether the origin of SiII* is continuum pumping as suggested in previous studies, we check the consistency of the equivalent width (EW) of SiII* emission and the EW of SiII absorption for the individual halo object with the most reliable detection. We confirm the equivalence, suggesting that photon conservation works for this object and pointing toward continuum pumping as the source of SiII*. We also investigate SiII* lines in a RAMSES-RT zoom-in simulation including continuum pumping and find ubiquitous presence of extended halos.</description>

      <title>Testing quantum gravity effects with global lepton number symmetry and dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the possibility of testing quantum gravity (QG) effects with a type-I seesaw origin of light neutrino mass embedded in a global $U(1)_L$ symmetric framework which also includes dark matter (DM). The spontaneous breaking of $U(1)_L$ symmetry generates the seesaw scale as well as DM mass dynamically. The (pseudo) Nambu-Goldstone boson, known as majoron, acquires non-zero mass due to soft symmetry breaking terms of quadratic type in the scalar potential, which eventually breaks $U(1)_L$ to its $Z_2$ subgroup. The spontaneous symmetry breaking, which effectively breaks $Z_2$, leads to the formation of domain walls (DW), posing a threat to successful cosmology, if allowed to dominate. As gravity does not respect any global symmetries, we consider higher dimensional operators suppressed by the scale of QG namely, $\Lambda_{\rm QG}$ which introduces the required bias leading to DW annihilation and emission of stochastic gravitational waves (GW) observable at near future experiments. The same operators also lead to decay of DM bringing interesting indirect detection aspects. While DM is produced non-thermally via scalar portal interactions, light majoron can give rise to additional $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ within reach of future cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiments.</description>

      <title>(In)stability of the black hole greybody factors and ringdowns against a small-bump correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, it has been proposed that the black hole greybody factors can be important to model ringdown spectral amplitudes. We study the stability of greybody factors against a small-bump correction in the perturbation equation. We find (I) that the greybody factor is stable in the frequency region relevant to ringdown and (II) that it is destabilized at higher frequencies, especially for a sharper bump correction. This behavior is similar to the case of higher overtones, which is also very sensitive to a small correction. We clarify this (in)stability with the WKB analysis. As the greybody factor is stable at the frequency region relevant to the main part of ringdown, we conclude that the greybody factor is suitable to model ringdown amplitude. In order to investigate a bump correction in a self-consistent manner, we consider the small-bump correction that can be realized in the general framework of effective field theory of black hole perturbations.</description>

      <title>Effect of Accretion on the evolution of Primordial Black Holes in the context of Modified Gravity Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigates the effect of accretion of cosmic fluid on the evolution of Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) within the framework of Modified gravity theories. We consider a general form of the Hubble parameter, reflecting a general class of modified gravity theories and bouncing models. We then study the effect of such modified dynamics on PBH in the presence of Hawking radiation and accretion of surrounding materials. We investigate how the evolution of PBHs is influenced by accretion across different cosmological eras, considering the radiation, matter, and dark energy-dominated phases like phantom and quintessence for linear equation of state. We further incorporated Non-linear Equations of State such as Chaplygin Gas, Modified Chaplygin gas, Van der Waals model, Polytropic Fluid model. The study systematically analyzes the mass variation of PBHs in the presence of such different cosmological environments. The results will contribute to the understanding of PBH formation and evolution in modified theory of gravity, and their possibility of being detected with future experiments.</description>

      <title>Assessment of Gradient-Based Samplers in Standard Cosmological Likelihoods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We assess the usefulness of gradient-based samplers, such as the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS), by comparison with traditional Metropolis-Hastings algorithms, in tomographic $3 \times 2$ point analyses. Specifically, we use the DES Year 1 data and a simulated future LSST-like survey as representative examples of these studies, containing a significant number of nuisance parameters (20 and 32, respectively) that affect the performance of rejection-based samplers. To do so, we implement a differentiable forward model using JAX-COSMO (Campagne et al. 2023), and we use it to derive parameter constraints from both datasets using the NUTS algorithm as implemented in {\S}4, and the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm as implemented in Cobaya (Lewis 2013). When quantified in terms of the number of effective number of samples taken per likelihood evaluation, we find a relative efficiency gain of $\mathcal{O}(10)$ in favour of NUTS. However, this efficiency is reduced to a factor $\sim 2$ when quantified in terms of computational time, since we find the cost of the gradient computation (needed by NUTS) relative to the likelihood to be $\sim 4.5$ times larger for both experiments. We validate these results making use of analytical multi-variate distributions (a multivariate Gaussian and a Rosenbrock distribution) with increasing dimensionality. Based on these results, we conclude that gradient-based samplers such as NUTS can be leveraged to sample high dimensional parameter spaces in Cosmology, although the efficiency improvement is relatively mild for moderate $(\mathcal{O}(50))$ dimension numbers, typical of tomographic large-scale structure analyses.</description>

      <title>Emergent Universe from an Unstable de Sitter Phase</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the Emergent scenario, the Universe should evolve from a non-singular state replacing the typical singularity of General Relativity, for any initial condition. For the scalar field model in [1] we show that only a subset of initial conditions leads to emergence, either from a static state (an Einstein model), or from a de Sitter state.
  Assuming a scenario based on CDM interacting with a Dark Energy fluid, we show that in general flat and open models expand from a non-singular unstable de Sitter state at high energies; for closed models this state is a transition phase with a bounce. A subset of these models are qualitatively in agreement with the observable Universe, accelerating at high energies, going through a matter-dominated decelerated era, then accelerating toward a de Sitter phase.</description>

      <title>Unified view of scalar and vector dark matter solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The existence of solitons -- stable, long-lived, and localized field configurations -- is a generic prediction for ultralight dark matter. These solitons, known by various names such as boson stars, axion stars, oscillons, and Q-balls depending on the context, are typically treated as distinct entities in the literature. This study aims to provide a unified perspective on these solitonic objects for real or complex, scalar or vector dark matter, considering self-interactions and nonminimal gravitational interactions. We demonstrate that these solitons share universal nonrelativistic properties, such as conserved charges, mass-radius relations, stability and profiles. Without accounting for alternative interactions or relativistic effects, distinguishing between real and complex scalar dark matter is challenging. However, self-interactions differentiate real and complex vector dark matter due to their different dependencies on the macroscopic spin density of dark matter waves. Furthermore, gradient-dependent nonminimal gravitational interactions impose an upper bound on soliton amplitudes, influencing their mass distribution and phenomenology in the present-day universe.</description>

      <title>The formation and survival of cold gas in a magnetized cool-core galaxy cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05044v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Filaments of cold gas ($T\leq 10^{4}$ K) are found in the inner regions of many cool-core clusters. These structures are thought to play a major role in the regulation of feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN). We study the morphology of the filaments, their formation, and their impact on the propagation of the outflowing AGN jets. We present a set of GPU-accelerated 3D (magneto)hydrodynamical simulations of an idealized Perseus-like cluster using the performance portable code AthenaPK. We include radiative cooling, and a self-regulated AGN feedback model that redistributes accreted material through kinetic, thermal and magnetic feedback. We confirm that magnetic fields play an important role in both the formation and evolution of the cold material. These suppress the formation of massive cold disks and favor magnetically supported filaments over clumpy structures. Achieving resolutions of $25-50$ pc, we find that filaments are not monolithic as they contain numerous and complex magnetically--supported substructures. We find that the mass distribution of these clumps follows a power law for all investigated filaments, consistent with previous cloud-crushing simulations of individual clumps. Studying the evolution of individual filaments, we find that their formation pathways can be diverse. We find examples of filaments forming through a combination of cold gas uplifting and condensation, as well as systems of purely infalling clumps condensing out of the intracluster medium. The density contrast between the cold gas and the outflowing hot material leads to recurring deflections of the jets, favoring inflation of bubbles.</description>

      <title>Discovery of An Apparent Red, High-Velocity Type Ia Supernova at z = 2.9 with JWST</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05089v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the JWST discovery of SN 2023adsy, a transient object located in a host galaxy JADES-GS$+53.13485$$-$$27.82088$ with a host spectroscopic redshift of $2.903\pm0.007$. The transient was identified in deep James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)/NIRCam imaging from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) program. Photometric and spectroscopic followup with NIRCam and NIRSpec, respectively, confirm the redshift and yield UV-NIR light-curve, NIR color, and spectroscopic information all consistent with a Type Ia classification. Despite its classification as a likely SN Ia, SN 2023adsy is both fairly red (E(B-V)$\sim0.9$) despite a host galaxy with low-extinction and has a high Ca II velocity ($19,000\pm2,000$km/s) compared to the general population of SNe Ia. While these characteristics are consistent with some Ca-rich SNe Ia, particularly SN 2016hnk, SN 2023adsy is intrinsically brighter than the low-z Ca-rich population. Although such an object is too red for any low-z cosmological sample, we apply a fiducial standardization approach to SN 2023adsy and find that the SN 2023adsy luminosity distance measurement is in excellent agreement ($\lesssim1\sigma$) with $\Lambda$CDM. Therefore unlike low-z Ca-rich SNe Ia, SN 2023adsy is standardizable and gives no indication that SN Ia standardized luminosities change significantly with redshift. A larger sample of distant SNe Ia is required to determine if SN Ia population characteristics at high-z truly diverge from their low-z counterparts, and to confirm that standardized luminosities nevertheless remain constant with redshift.</description>

Abstract: New approaches are presented for the formation and evolution of nonlinear structures in different eras and suggest a heavy dark matter scenario with a critical particle mass of $10^{12}$GeV. Particles of this mass can have a free streaming mass equal to the particle mass and form the smallest structures among particles of any mass. In the bottom-up approach, via direct collisions, particles of this mass can form the smallest haloes (two particles) as early as $10^{-6}$s in the radiation era with a density ratio of $32\pi^2$ from the spherical collapse model. The halo mass increases to $10^8M_{\odot}$ at the matter-radiation equality, and to $10^{13}M_{\odot}$ at $z=0$. Halo growth eventually slows down due to the self-limiting effects of dark energy. In the top-down approach, the mass and energy cascades are identified that facilitate the hierarchical structure formation. A scale-independent rate of energy cascade $\varepsilon_u=10^{-7}m^2/s^3$ can be identified. The energy cascade leads to universal scalings on scales $r$, i.e. a two-thirds law for kinetic energy ($v_r^2\propto \varepsilon_u^{2/3}r^{2/3}$) and a four-thirds law for halo density ($\rho_r\propto\varepsilon_u^{2/3}G^{-1}r^{-4/3}$). By extending these scalings down to the smallest structure scale, we can estimate the particle mass $m_X=(\varepsilon_u\hbar^5G^{-4})^{1/9}=10^{12}$GeV, size $l_X=(\varepsilon_u^{-1}\hbar G)^{1/3}=10^{-13}$m, and a characteristic time $\tau_X=c^2/\varepsilon_u=10^{16}$yrs. Here $\hbar$ is the Planck constant, G is the gravitational constant, and c is the speed of light. The binding energy $E_X=(\varepsilon_u^5\hbar^7G^{-2})^{1/9}=10^{-9}$eV suggests a dark radiation field. The axion-like dark radiation should be produced at time $t_X=(\varepsilon_u^{-5}\hbar^2G^2)^{1/9}=10^{-6}$s with a mass of $10^{-9}$eV or a GUT scale decay constant $10^{16}$GeV and an energy density 1% of CMB photons.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty-aware and Data-efficient Cosmological Emulation using Gaussian Processes and PCA</title>

Abstract: Bayesian parameter inference is one of the key elements for model selection in cosmological research. However, the available inference tools require a large number of calls to simulation codes which can lead to high and sometimes even infeasible computational costs. In this work we propose a new way of emulating simulation codes for Bayesian parameter inference. In particular, this novel approach emphasizes the uncertainty-awareness of the emulator, which allows to state the emulation accuracy and ensures reliable performance. With a focus on data efficiency, we implement an active learning algorithm based on a combination of Gaussian Processes and Principal Component Analysis. We find that for an MCMC analysis of Planck and BAO data on the $\Lambda$CDM model (6 model and 21 nuisance parameters) we can reduce the number of simulation calls by a factor of $\sim$500 and save about $96\%$ of the computational costs.</description>

      <title>Impact of Property Covariance on Cluster Weak lensing Scaling Relations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.18266v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an investigation into a hitherto unexplored systematic that affects the accuracy of galaxy cluster mass estimates with weak gravitational lensing. Specifically, we study the covariance between the weak lensing signal, $\Delta\Sigma$, and the "true" cluster galaxy number count, $N_{\rm gal}$, as measured within a spherical volume that is void of projection effects. By quantifying the impact of this covariance on mass calibration, this work reveals a significant source of systematic uncertainty. Using the MDPL2 simulation with galaxies traced by the SAGE semi-analytic model, we measure the intrinsic property covariance between these observables within the 3D vicinity of the cluster, spanning a range of dynamical mass and redshift values relevant for optical cluster surveys. Our results reveal a negative covariance at small radial scales ($R \lesssim R_{\rm 200c}$) and a null covariance at large scales ($R \gtrsim R_{\rm 200c}$) across most mass and redshift bins. We also find that this covariance results in a $2-3\%$ bias in the halo mass estimates in most bins. Furthermore, by modeling $N_{\rm gal}$ and $\Delta\Sigma$ as multi-(log)-linear equations of secondary halo properties, we provide a quantitative explanation for the physical origin of the negative covariance at small scales. Specifically, we demonstrate that the $N_{\rm gal}$-$\Delta\Sigma$ covariance can be explained by the secondary properties of halos that probe their formation history. We attribute the difference between our results and the positive bias seen in other works with (mock)-cluster finders to projection effects. These findings highlight the importance of accounting for the covariance between observables in cluster mass estimation, which is crucial for obtaining accurate constraints on cosmological parameters.</description>

      <title>Faster Bayesian inference with neural network bundles and new results for $f(R)$ models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.15955v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the last few years, there has been significant progress in the development of machine learning methods tailored to astrophysics and cosmology. We have recently applied one of these, namely, the neural network bundle method, to the cosmological scenario. Moreover, we showed that in some cases the computational times of the Bayesian inference process can be reduced. In this paper, we present an improvement to the neural network bundle method that results in a significant reduction of the computational times of the statistical analysis. The novel aspect consists of the use of the neural network bundle method to calculate the luminosity distance of type Ia supernovae, which is usually computed through an integral with numerical methods. In this work, we have applied this improvement to the Hu-Sawicki and Starobinsky $f(R)$ models. We also performed a statistical analysis with data from type Ia supernovae of the Pantheon+ compilation and cosmic chronometers. Another original aspect of this work is the different treatment we provide for the absolute magnitude of type Ia supernovae during the inference process, which results in different estimates of the distortion parameter than the ones obtained in the literature. We show that the statistical analyses carried out with our new method require lower computational times than the ones performed with both the numerical and the neural network method from our previous work. This reduction in time is more significant in the case of a difficult computational problem such as the ones addressed in this work.</description>

      <title>The Dark Energy Survey: Cosmology Results With ~1500 New High-redshift Type Ia Supernovae Using The Full 5-year Dataset</title>

Abstract: We present cosmological constraints from the sample of Type Ia supernovae (SN Ia) discovered during the full five years of the Dark Energy Survey (DES) Supernova Program. In contrast to most previous cosmological samples, in which SN are classified based on their spectra, we classify the DES SNe using a machine learning algorithm applied to their light curves in four photometric bands. Spectroscopic redshifts are acquired from a dedicated follow-up survey of the host galaxies. After accounting for the likelihood of each SN being a SN Ia, we find 1635 DES SNe in the redshift range $0.10&lt;z&lt;1.13$ that pass quality selection criteria sufficient to constrain cosmological parameters. This quintuples the number of high-quality $z&gt;0.5$ SNe compared to the previous leading compilation of Pantheon+, and results in the tightest cosmological constraints achieved by any SN data set to date. To derive cosmological constraints we combine the DES supernova data with a high-quality external low-redshift sample consisting of 194 SNe Ia spanning $0.025&lt;z&lt;0.10$. Using SN data alone and including systematic uncertainties we find $\Omega_{\rm M}=0.352\pm 0.017$ in flat $\Lambda$CDM. Supernova data alone now require acceleration ($q_0&lt;0$ in $\Lambda$CDM) with over $5\sigma$ confidence. We find $(\Omega_{\rm M},w)=(0.264^{+0.074}_{-0.096},-0.80^{+0.14}_{-0.16})$ in flat $w$CDM. For flat $w_0w_a$CDM, we find $(\Omega_{\rm M},w_0,w_a)=(0.495^{+0.033}_{-0.043},-0.36^{+0.36}_{-0.30},-8.8^{+3.7}_{-4.5})$. Including Planck CMB data, SDSS BAO data, and DES $3\times2$-point data gives $(\Omega_{\rm M},w)=(0.321\pm0.007,-0.941\pm0.026)$. In all cases dark energy is consistent with a cosmological constant to within $\sim2\sigma$. In our analysis, systematic errors on cosmological parameters are subdominant compared to statistical errors; paving the way for future photometrically classified supernova analyses.</description>

      <title>A comparison of effective field theory models of redshift space galaxy power spectra for DESI 2024 and future surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07272v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In preparation for the next generation of galaxy redshift surveys, and in particular the year-one data release from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), we investigate the consistency of a variety of effective field theory models that describe the galaxy-galaxy power spectra in redshift space into the quasi-linear regime using 1-loop perturbation theory. These models are employed in the pipelines \texttt{velocileptors}, \texttt{PyBird}, and \texttt{Folps$\nu$}. While these models have been validated independently, a detailed comparison with consistent choices has not been attempted. After briefly discussing the theoretical differences between the models we describe how to provide a more apples-to-apples comparison between them. We present the results of fitting mock spectra from the \texttt{AbacusSummit} suite of N-body simulations provided in three redshift bins to mimic the types of dark time tracers targeted by the DESI survey. We show that the theories behave similarly and give consistent constraints in both the forward-modeling and ShapeFit compressed fitting approaches. We additionally generate (noiseless) synthetic data from each pipeline to be fit by the others, varying the scale cuts in order to show that the models agree within the range of scales for which we expect 1-loop perturbation theory to be applicable. This work lays the foundation of Full-Shape analysis with DESI Y1 galaxy samples where in the tests we performed, we found no systematic error associated with the modeling of the galaxy redshift space power spectrum for this volume.</description>

      <title>Cosmological constraints on mass-varying dark matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08476v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Light mass warm dark matter is an interesting and viable alternative to the cold dark matter paradigm. An intriguing variation of this scenario is the mass-varying dark matter model where the dark matter mass varies with time during its cosmic history. This is realized in multiple particle physics models. In this work, we study the cosmological constraints on such a model where the dark matter mass transitions from zero to a finite value in the early Universe. In this model, the matter power spectrum exhibits power suppression below a scale that depends on the epoch of transition, and the angular power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background show a distinctive phase shift. We use the latest cosmic microwave background and the weak lensing data to place lower limit on the transition redshift and ease the $S_8$ tension, unlike the warm dark matter model. This analysis also facilitates a marginal detection of the dark matter (DM) mass. Our findings reveal that while Planck data alone reduces the $S_8$ tension to approximately $2\sigma$, it does not sufficiently constrain the DM mass. However, when combined with the $S_8$ measurement from KIDS1000+BOSS+2dfLenS, the tension significantly decreases to roughly $1.3\sigma$, and we observe the detection of a DM mass at $41.7^{+7.81}_{-27.5}\,\mathrm{eV}$. Further analysis incorporating a combined data set from ACT and weak lensing results in an even more pronounced reduction in the tension to approximately $0.4\sigma$, alongside a higher detected mass of $51.2^{+16}_{-33.5}\,\mathrm{eV}$. We also find a better fit to the combined data compared to the $\Lambda$CDM model.</description>

      <title>Escape Velocity Mass of Abell S1063</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01330v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We measure the radius-velocity phase-space edge profile for Abell S1063 using galaxy redshifts from arXiv:1409.3507 and arXiv:2109.03305. Combined with a cosmological model and after accounting for interlopers and sampling effects, we infer the escape velocity profile. Using the Poisson equation, we then directly constrain the gravitational potential profile and find excellent agreement between three different density models. For the NFW profile, we find log$_{10}$(M$_{200},{\rm crit}$)= $15.40^{+0.06}_{-0.12}$M$_{\odot}$, consistent to within $1\sigma$ of six recently published lensing masses. We argue that this consistency is due to the fact that the escape technique shares no common systematics with lensing other than radial binning. These masses are 2-4$\sigma$ lower than estimates using X-ray data, in addition to earlier velocity dispersion estimates. We measure the 1D velocity dispersion within r$_{200}$ to be $\sigma_{v} = 1477^{+87}_{-99}$ km/s, which combined with our escape velocity mass, brings the dispersion for AS1063 in-line with hydrodynamic cosmological simulations for the first time.</description>

      <title>Revisiting quantum black holes from effective loop quantum gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.10166v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We systematically study a family of loop quantizations for the classical Kruskal spacetimes using the effective description motivated from loop quantum gravity for four generic parameters, $c_o, m, \delta_b$, and $\delta_c$, where the latter two denote the polymerization parameters that capture the underlying quantum geometry. We focus on the family where polymerization parameters are constant on dynamical trajectories and of which the Ashtekar-Olmedo-Singh (AOS) and Corichi-Singh (CS) models appear as special cases. We study general features of singularity resolution in all these models due to quantum gravity effects and analytically extend the solutions across the white hole (WH) and black hole (BH) horizons to the exterior. We find that the leading term in the asymptotic expansion of the Kretschmann scalar is $r^{-4}$. However, for AOS and CS models, black holes with masses greater than solar mass, the dominant term behaves as $r^{-6}$ for the size of the observable Universe and our analysis can be used to phenomenologically constrain the choice of parameters for other models. In addition, one can uniquely fix the parameter $c_o$ by requiring that the Hawking temperature at the BH horizon to the leading order be consistent with its classical value for a macroscopic BH. Assuming that the BH and WH masses are of the same order, we are able to identify a family of choices of $\delta_b$ and $\delta_c$ which share all the desired properties of the AOS model.</description>

      <title>Troubles mounting for multipolar dark matter</title>

Abstract: In this paper, we revisit the experimental constraints on the multipolar dark matter that has derivative coupling to the visible sector mediated by the Standard Model photon. The momentum dependent interaction enables them to be captured efficiently within massive celestial bodies boosted by their steep gravitational potential. This phenomena makes compact celestial bodies as an efficient target to probe such type of dark matter candidates. We demonstrate that a synergy of the updated direct detection results from DarkSide-50 and LUX-ZEPLIN together with IceCube bounds on high energy solar neutrinos from dark matter capture disfavour the viable parameter space of the dipolar dark matter scenario. Whereas, for the anapole dark matter scenario, a narrow window survives that lies within the reach of prospective heating signals due to the capture of dark matter at cold neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Supramassive dark objects with neutron star origin</title>

Abstract: Till today, the nature of Dark Matter (DM) remains elusive despite all our efforts. This missing matter of the universe has not been observed by the already operating DM direct-detection experiments, but we can infer its gravitational effects. Galaxies and clusters of galaxies are most likely to contain DM trapped to their gravitational field. This leads us to the natural assumption that compact objects might contain DM too. Among the compact objects exist in galaxies, neutron stars are considered as natural laboratories, where theories can be tested, and observational data can be received. Thus, many models of DM have proposed it's presence in those stars. In particular, in the present study we focus on two types of dark matter particles, namely fermions and bosons with a mass range of [0.01-1.5] GeV and self-interaction strength in the range [10$^{-4}$-10$^{-1}$] MeV$^{-1}$. By employing the two-fluid model, we discovered a stable area in the M-R diagram of a celestial formation consisting of neutron star matter and DM that is substantial in size. This formation spans hundreds of kilometers in diameter and possesses a mass equivalent to 100 or more times the Solar mass. To elucidate, this entity resembles an enormous celestial body of DM, with a neutron star at its core. This implies that a supramassive stellar compact entity can exist without encountering any issues of stability and without undergoing a collapse into a black hole. In any case, the present theoretical prediction can, if combined with corresponding observations, shed light on the existence of DM and even more on its basic properties.</description>

      <title>The FLAMINGO Project: Galaxy clusters in comparison to X-ray observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08277v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Galaxy clusters are important probes for both cosmology and galaxy formation physics. We test the cosmological, hydrodynamical FLAMINGO simulations by comparing to observations of the gaseous properties of clusters measured from X-ray observations. FLAMINGO contains unprecedented numbers of massive galaxy groups ($&gt;10^6$) and clusters ($&gt;10^5$) and includes variations in both cosmology and galaxy formation physics. We predict the evolution of cluster scaling relations as well as radial profiles of the temperature, density, pressure, entropy, and metallicity for different masses and redshifts. We show that the differences between volume-, and X-ray-weighting of particles in the simulations, and between cool-core non cool-core samples, are similar in size as the differences between simulations for which the stellar and AGN feedback has been calibrated to produce significantly different gas fractions. Compared to thermally-driven AGN feedback, kinetic jet feedback calibrated to produce the same gas fraction at $R_{\rm 500c}$ yields a hotter core with higher entropies and lower densities, which translates into a smaller fraction of cool-core clusters. Stronger feedback, calibrated to produce lower gas fractions and hence lower gas densities, results in higher temperatures, entropies, and metallicities, but lower pressures. The scaling relations and thermodynamic profiles show almost no evolution with respect to self-similar expectations, except for the metallicity decreasing with redshift. We find that the temperature, density, pressure, and entropy profiles of clusters in the fiducial FLAMINGO simulation are in excellent agreement with observations, while the metallicities in the core are too high.</description>

      <title>Measuring kinematic anisotropies with pulsar timing arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17312v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) collaborations show strong evidence for a stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) with the characteristic Hellings-Downs inter-pulsar correlations. The signal may stem from supermassive black hole binary mergers, or early universe phenomena. The former is expected to be strongly anisotropic while primordial backgrounds are likely to be predominantly isotropic with small fluctuations. In case the observed SGWB is of cosmological origin, our relative motion with respect to the SGWB rest frame is a guaranteed source of anisotropy, leading to $\textit{O}(10^{-3})$ energy density fluctuations of the SGWB. For such cosmological SGWB, kinematic anisotropies are likely to be larger than the intrinsic anisotropies, akin to the cosmic microwave background (CMB) dipole anisotropy. We assess the sensitivity of current PTA data to the kinematic dipole anisotropy, and we also forecast at what extent the magnitude and direction of the kinematic dipole can be measured in the future with an SKA-like experiment. We also discuss how the spectral shape of the SGWB and the location of the pulsars to monitor affect the prospects of detecting the kinematic dipole with PTA. In the future, a detection of this anisotropy may even help resolve the discrepancy in the magnitude of the kinematic dipole as measured by CMB and large-scale structure observations.</description>

      <title>$floZ$: Improved Bayesian evidence estimation from posterior samples with normalizing flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12294v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce $floZ$, an improved method based on normalizing flows, for estimating the Bayesian evidence (and its numerical uncertainty) from a set of samples drawn from the unnormalized posterior distribution. We validate it on distributions whose evidence is known analytically, up to 15 parameter space dimensions, and compare with two state-of-the-art techniques for estimating the evidence: nested sampling (which computes the evidence as its main target) and a $k$-nearest-neighbors technique that produces evidence estimates from posterior samples. Provided representative samples from the target posterior are available, our method is more robust to posterior distributions with sharp features, especially in higher dimensions. For a simple multivariate Gaussian, we demonstrate its accuracy for up to 200 dimensions with $10^5$ posterior samples. $floZ$ has wide applicability, e.g., to estimate the evidence from variational inference, Markov Chain Monte Carlo samples, or any other method that delivers samples from the unnormalized posterior density, such as simulation-based inference. We apply $floZ$ to compute the Bayes factor for the presence of the first overtone in the ringdown signal of the gravitational wave data of GW150914, finding good agreement with nested sampling.</description>

      <title>Fermi-Dirac Integrals in Degenerate Regimes: A Novel Asymptotic Expansion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05287v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We characterize in a novel manner the physical properties of the low temperature Fermi gas in the degenerate domain as a function of temperature and chemical potential. For the first time we obtain low temperature $T$ results in the domain where several fermions are found within a de Broglie spatial cell. In this regime, the usual high degeneracy Sommerfeld expansion fails. The other known semi-classical Boltzmann domain applies when fewer than one particle is found in the de Broglie cell. We also improve on the understanding of the Sommerfeld expansion in the regime where the chemical potential is close to the mass and also in the high temperature regime. In these calculcations we use a novel characterization of the Fermi distribution allowing the separation of the finite and zero temperature phenomena. The relative errors of the three approximate methods (Boltzmann limit, Sommerfeld expansion, and the new domain of several particles in the de Broglie cell) are quantified.</description>
