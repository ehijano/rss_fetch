      <title>Accelerating Giant Impact Simulations with Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Constraining planet formation models based on the observed exoplanet population requires generating large samples of synthetic planetary systems, which can be computationally prohibitive. A significant bottleneck is simulating the giant impact phase, during which planetary embryos evolve gravitationally and combine to form planets, which may themselves experience later collisions. To accelerate giant impact simulations, we present a machine learning (ML) approach to predicting collisional outcomes in multiplanet systems. Trained on more than 500,000 $N$-body simulations of three-planet systems, we develop an ML model that can accurately predict which two planets will experience a collision, along with the state of the post-collision planets, from a short integration of the system's initial conditions. Our model greatly improves on non-ML baselines that rely on metrics from dynamics theory, which struggle to accurately predict which pair of planets will experience a collision. By combining with a model for predicting long-term stability, we create an efficient ML-based giant impact emulator, which can predict the outcomes of giant impact simulations with a speedup of up to four orders of magnitude. We expect our model to enable analyses that would not otherwise be computationally feasible. As such, we release our full training code, along with an easy-to-use API for our collision outcome model and giant impact emulator.</description>

      <title>Comparing NASA Discovery and New Frontiers Class Mission Concepts for the Io Volcano Observer (IVO)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Jupiter's moon Io is a highly compelling target for future exploration that offers critical insight into tidal dissipation processes and the geology of high heat flux worlds, including primitive planetary bodies, such as the early Earth, that are shaped by enhanced rates of volcanism. Io is also important for understanding the development of volcanogenic atmospheres and mass-exchange within the Jupiter System. However, fundamental questions remain about the state of Io's interior, surface, and atmosphere, as well as its role in the evolution of the Galilean satellites. The Io Volcano Observer (IVO) would address these questions by achieving the following three key goals: (A) Determine how and where tidal heat is generated inside Io; (B) Understand how tidal heat is transported to the surface of Io; and (C) Understand how Io is evolving. IVO was selected for Phase A study through the NASA Discovery program in 2020 and, in anticipation of a New Frontiers 5 opportunity, an enhanced IVO-NF mission concept was advanced that would increase the Baseline mission from 10 flybys to 20, with an improved radiation design; employ a Ka-band communications to double IVO's total data downlink; add a wide angle camera for color and stereo mapping; add a dust mass spectrometer; and lower the altitude of later flybys to enable new science. This study compares and contrasts the mission architecture, instrument suite, and science objectives for Discovery (IVO) and New Frontiers (IVO-NF) missions to Io, and advocates for continued prioritization of Io as an exploration target for New Frontiers.</description>

      <title>Semi-empirical Estimates of the Cosmic Planet Formation Rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We devise and exploit a data-driven, semi-empirical framework of galaxy formation and evolution, coupling it to recipes for planet formation from stellar and planetary science, to compute the cosmic planet formation rate, and the properties of the planets' preferred host stellar and galactic environments. We also discuss how the rates and formation sites of planets are affected when considering their habitability, and when including possible threatening sources related to star formation and nuclear activity. Overall, we conservatively estimate a cumulative number of some $10^{20}$ Earth-like planets and around $10^{18}$ habitable Earths in our past lightcone. Finally, we find that a few $10^{17}$ are older than our own Earth, an occurrence which places a loose lower limit a few $10^{-18}$ to the odds for a habitable world to ever hosting a civilization in the observable Universe.</description>

      <title>YOUNG Star detrending for Transiting Exoplanet Recovery (YOUNGSTER) -- I. A search for young exoplanets in Sectors 1-5 of the TESS Full-Frame-Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.01721</link>

Abstract: Young (&lt;1Gyr) exoplanets represent a critically important area of exoplanet research, as they offer the opportunity to learn about the formation and early dynamic history of exoplanetary systems. However, finding young exoplanets is significantly complicated by the fast rotation and complex activity of their young host stars, which are often not well handled by state-of-the-art automatic pipelines. This work presents an alternative LOWESS-based pipeline focused specifically on detrending young stellar light-curves from the 30min-cadence Full Frame Images (FFIs) produced by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite ($TESS$), and includes improvements such as automatic peak-cutting of stellar variability and interpolation over masked transits to improve periodogram visibility and returned transit shapes. This work presents the details of the developed pipeline, along with initial results from its application to young stars within stellar associations in sectors 1-5 of the $TESS$ data. While no new exoplanet candidate signals were found in this work, interesting results included the recovery of all known 2min TOIs around young stars in sectors 1-5 from 30min data alone, the recovery of the young exoplanet DS Tuc Ab, a number of young eclipsing binaries and a wide array of interesting rotation. A sensitivity analysis was also undertaken for each star, showing how recovery of injected planets varied with both depth and period for each individual target. Challenges for future searches for young exoplanets are discussed, the largest being stellar rotation with periods less than 1 day and a lack of a large sample of confirmed young stars.</description>

      <title>TRACE: a Time-Reversible Algorithm for Close Encounters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03800v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present TRACE, an almost time-reversible hybrid integrator for the planetary N-body problem. Like hybrid symplectic integrators, TRACE can resolve close encounters between particles while retaining many of the accuracy and speed advantages of a fixed timestep symplectic method such the Wisdom--Holman map. TRACE switches methods time-reversibly during close encounters following the prescription of Hernandez &amp; Dehnen. In this paper we describe the derivation and implementation of TRACE and study its performance for a variety of astrophysical systems. In all our test cases TRACE is at least as accurate and fast as the hybrid symplectic integrator MERCURIUS. In many cases TRACE's performance is vastly superior to that of MERCURIUS. In test cases with planet-planet close encounters, TRACE is as accurate as MECURIUS with a 12x speedup. If close encounters with the central star are considered, TRACE achieves good error performance while MERCURIUS fails to give qualitatively correct results. In ensemble tests of violent scattering systems, TRACE matches the high-accuracy IAS15 while providing a 15x speed-up. In large N systems simulating lunar accretion, TRACE qualitatively gives the same results as IAS15 but at a 41x speedup. We also discuss some cases such as von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai cycles where hybrid integrators perform poorly and provide some guidance on which integrator to use for which system. TRACE is freely available within the REBOUND package.</description>

      <title>A Testbed for Tidal Migration: the 3D Architecture of an Eccentric Hot Jupiter HD 118203 b Accompanied by a Possibly Aligned Outer Giant Planet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21377v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Characterizing outer companions to hot Jupiters plays a crucial role in deciphering their origins. We present the discovery of a long-period giant planet, HD 118203 c ($m_{c}=11.79^{+0.69}_{-0.63}\ \mathrm{M_{J}}$, $a_{c}=6.23^{+0.16}_{-0.15}$ AU) exterior to a close-in eccentric hot Jupiter HD 118203 b ($P_{b}=6.135\ \mathrm{days}$, $m_{b}=2.14\pm{0.12}\ \mathrm{M_{J}}$, $r_{b}=1.14\pm{0.029}\ \mathrm{R_{J}}$, $e_{b}=0.31\pm{0.007}$) based on twenty-year radial velocities. Using Rossiter-McLaughlin (RM) observations from the Keck Planet Finder (KPF), we measured a low sky-projected spin-orbit angle $\lambda_{b}=-11^{\circ}.7^{+7.6}_{-10.0}$ for HD 118203 b and detected stellar oscillations in the host star, confirming its evolved status. Combining the RM observation with the stellar inclination measurement, we constrained the true spin-orbit angle of HD 118203 b as $\Psi_{b}&lt;33^{\circ}.5\ (2\sigma)$, indicating the orbit normal of the hot Jupiter nearly aligned with the stellar spin axis. Furthermore, by combining radial velocities and Hipparcos-Gaia astrometric acceleration, we constrained the line-of-sight mutual inclination between the hot Jupiter and the outer planet to be $9^{\circ}.8^{+16.2}_{-9.3}$ at $2\sigma$ level. HD 118203 is one of first hot Jupiter systems where both the true spin-orbit angle of the hot Jupiter and the mutual inclination between inner and outer planets have been determined. Our results are consistent with a system-wide alignment, with low mutual inclinations between the outer giant planet, the inner hot Jupiter, and the host star. This alignment, along with the moderate eccentricity of HD 118203 c, implies that the system may have undergone coplanar high-eccentricity tidal migration. Under this framework, our dynamical analysis suggests an initial semi-major axis of 0.3 to 3.2 AU for the proto-hot Jupiter.</description>

      <title>TESS discovery of two super-Earths orbiting the M-dwarf stars TOI-6002 and TOI-5713 near the radius valley</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00709v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the validation of two TESS super-Earth candidates transiting the mid-M dwarfs TOI-6002 and TOI-5713 every 10.90 and 10.44 days, respectively. The first star (TOI-6002) is located $32.038\pm0.019$ pc away, with a radius of $0.2409^{+0.0066}_{-0.0065} R_\odot$, a mass of $0.2105^{+0.0049}_{-0.0048} M_\odot$ and an effective temperature of $3229^{+77}_{-57}$ K. The second star (TOI-5713) is located $40.946\pm0.032$ pc away, with a radius of $0.2985^{+0.0073}_{-0.0072} R_\odot$, a mass of $0.2653\pm0.0061 M_\odot$ and an effective temperature of $3225^{+41}_{-40}$ K. We validated the planets using TESS data, ground-based multi-wavelength photometry from many ground-based facilities, as well as high-resolution AO observations from Keck/NIRC2. TOI-6002 b has a radius of $1.65^{+0.22}_{-0.19} R_\oplus$ and receives $1.77^{+0.16}_{-0.11} S_\oplus$. TOI-5713 b has a radius of $1.77_{-0.11}^{+0.13} R_\oplus$ and receives $2.42\pm{0.11} S_\oplus$. Both planets are located near the radius valley and near the inner edge of the habitable zone of their host stars, which makes them intriguing targets for future studies to understand the formation and evolution of small planets around M-dwarf stars.</description>
