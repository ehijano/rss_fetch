      <title>Single-shot latched readout of a quantum dot qubit using barrier gate pulsing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Latching techniques are widely used to enhance readout of qubits. These methods require precise tuning of multiple tunnel rates, which can be challenging to achieve under realistic experimental conditions, such as when a qubit is coupled to a single reservoir. Here, we present a method for single-shot measurement of a quantum dot qubit with a single reservoir using a latched-readout scheme. Our approach involves pulsing a barrier gate to dynamically control qubit-to-reservoir tunnel rates, a method that is readily applicable to the latched readout of various spin-based qubits. We use this method to enable qubit state latching and to reduce the qubit reset time in measurements of coherent Larmor oscillations of a Si/SiGe quantum dot hybrid qubit.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast symmetry control in photoexcited quantum dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symmetry control is essential for realizing unconventional properties, such as ferroelectricity, nonlinear optical responses, and complex topological order, thus it holds promise for the design of emerging quantum and photonic systems. Nevertheless, fast and reversible control of symmetry in materials remains a challenge, especially for nanoscale systems. Here, we unveil reversible symmetry changes in colloidal lead chalcogenide quantum dots on picosecond timescales. Using a combination of ultrafast electron diffraction and total X-ray scattering, in conjunction with atomic-scale structural modeling and first-principles calculations, we reveal that symmetry-broken lead sulfide quantum dots restore to a centrosymmetric phase upon photoexcitation. The symmetry restoration is driven by photoexcited electronic carriers, which suppress lead off-centering for about 100 ps. Furthermore, the change in symmetry is closely correlated with the electronic properties as shown by transient optical measurements. Overall, this study elucidates reversible symmetry changes in colloidal quantum dots, and more broadly defines a new methodology to optically control symmetry in nanoscale systems on ultrafast timescales.</description>

      <title>Theory of tensorial magnetic inertia in terahertz spin dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic inertia has emerged as a possible way to manipulate ferromagnetic spins at a higher frequency e.g., THz. Theoretical treatments so far have considered the magnetic inertia as a scalar quantity. Here, we explore the magnetic inertial dynamics with a magnetic inertia tensor as macroscopic derivations predicted it to be a tensor. First, the inertia tensor has been decomposed into three terms: (a) scalar and isotropic inertia, (b) anisotropic and symmetric inertia tensor, (c) chiral and antisymmetric tensor. Further, we employ linear response theory to the inertial Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation with the inertia tensor and calculate the effect of chiral and anisotropic inertia on ferromagnets, antiferromagnets, and ferrimagnets. It is established that the precession and nutation resonance frequencies decrease with scalar magnetic inertia. Our results suggest that the nutation resonance frequencies further reduce due to inertia tensor. However, the effective damping of the nutation resonance increases with the chiral and antisymmetric part of the inertia tensor. We show that the precession resonances remain unaffected, while the nutation resonances are modified with the chiral magnetic inertia.</description>

      <title>Non-Reciprocal Transport of Thermally-Generated Magnons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate the non-reciprocity of electrically and thermally-generated incoherent magnon transport using the magnetization direction of a Py wire placed on top of an ultrathin YIG film. We show that the transport properties of thermally-generated magnons under a Py wire depends on the relative orientation between the temperature gradient and the Py-magnetization direction. The symmetries of this non-reciprocal magnon transport match with those predicted by the remote dipolar interaction between YIG and Py magnons, controlled by the chirality of the YIG magnon dipolar stray fields. We also show that the directional magnon generation by the spin Seebeck effect from the Py wire displays the symmetries expected from the chiral spin Seebeck effect.</description>

      <title>Understanding Field-Free Single-Shot Laser-Induced Reversal of Exchange Bias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exchange bias is applied ubiquitously throughout the spintronics industry for its ability to provide a reference direction robust to external magnetic field disturbances. For some applications, reorienting the exchange-biased reference axis may add to or enhance functionality of devices. Conventional methods for achieving this reorientation require assisting magnetic fields with long setting times and are thus limited in terms of speed and versatility. In this study, we show that by integrating functionalized materials (Co/Gd multilayers) into an existing thin film stack (Pt/Co/IrMn), perpendicular exchange bias can be reoriented $180^\circ$ by exciting it with a single femtosecond laser pulse, without an external field and on an ultrafast timescale. We found this effect to be repeatable arbitrarily many times, with only the first laser pulse incurring a loss of the initial exchange bias magnitude, yet preserving the unidirectionality required for referencing. By combining an experimental mapping of three key parameters (stack, laser and magnetic field properties) with microscopic models we were able to unravel the processes and features of the exchange bias reversal by considering the relevance of Curie, N\'eel and blocking temperatures. The outcomes of this study provide guiding principles towards designing fully optically reprogrammable magnetic sensing devices.</description>

      <title>Correlation functions of the Kitaev model with a spatially modulated phase in the superconducting order parameter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Kitaev model with a spatially modulated phase in the superconducting order parameter exhibits two types of topological transitions, namely a band topology transition between trivial and topological gapped phases, and a Fermi surface Lifshitz transition from a gapped to a gapless superconducting state. We investigate the correlation functions of the model for arbitrary values of superconducting coupling $\Delta_0$, chemical potential $\mu$, and phase modulation wavevector $Q$, characterizing the current flowing through the system. In the cases $\mu=0$ or $Q=\pm \pi/2$ correlations are proven to exhibit an even/odd effect as a function of the distance $l$ between two lattice sites, as they are non-vanishing or strictly vanishing depending on the parity of $l$. We identify a clear difference between the two types of transitions through the $Q$-dependence of the short distance correlation functions. In particular, they exhibit pronounced cusps with discontinuous derivatives across the Lifshitz transition. We also determine the long distance behavior of correlations, finding various types of exponential decays in the gapped phase, and an algebraic decay characterized by two different spatial periods in the gapless phase. Furthermore, we establish a connection between the gapless superconducting phase of the Kitaev model and the chiral phase of spin models with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction.</description>

      <title>Electronic band evolution between Lieb and kagome nanoribbons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the electronic properties of nanoribbons made out of monolayer Lieb, transition, and kagome lattices using the tight-binding model with a generic Hamiltonian. It allows us to map the evolutionary stages of the interconvertibility process between Lieb and kagome nanoribbons by means of only one control parameter. Results for the energy spectra, the density of states, and spatial probability density distributions are discussed for nanoribbons with three types of edges: straight, bearded, and asymmetric. We explore for different nanoribbon terminations: (i) the semiconductor-metallic transition due to the interconvertibility of the Lieb and kagome lattices, (ii) the effect of both nanoribbon width and inclusion of the next-nearest-neighbor hopping term on the degeneracy of the quasi-flat states, (iii) the behavior of the energy gap versus the nanoribbon width, (iv) the existence and evolution of edge states, and (v) the nodal spatial distributions of the total probability densities of the non-dispersive states.</description>

      <title>Adiabatic and diabatic responses in a Duffing resonator driven by two detuned tones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The combination of a strong pump and a weak probe has been widely applied to investigate both optical and nanomechanical devices. Such pump-probe measurements allows for the exploration of nonlinear dynamics, driven by the large pump tone, by measuring the system response to a probe tone. In contrast, here we report on the dynamics of a mechanical Duffing resonator driven with a combination of two large tones at different frequencies. Our results indicate the presence of various distinct regimes with very different dynamics. We systematically investigate the impact of the relative strength and detuning between the two drives on the dynamical response. This provides an illustrative example of dynamical phase transitions in out-of-equilibrium systems.</description>

      <title>Possibilities for enhanced electron-phonon interactions and high-$T_c$ superconductivity in engineered bimetallic nano-structured superlattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore theoretically the properties of engineered bimetallic nano-structured superlattices where an array of nano-clusters of a simple (single band) metal are embedded periodically inside another simple metal with a different work function. The exploration is done using a simplified tight-binding model with Coulomb interactions included, as well as density functional theory. Taking arrays of "Ag" clusters of fixed sizes and configurations (when unrelaxed) embedded periodically in an "Au" matrix as an example, we show that a significant enhancement of electron-phonon interactions ensues, implying possibilities for high-$T_c$ superconductivity. The enhancement stems from a strong coupling, via Coulomb interactions, between the dipolar charge distribution that forms at the Au-Ag interfaces and the breathing and other modes of vibration of the light Ag atoms caged inside the heavier Au matrix. The interface dipoles form because of the interplay between the mismatch of the local potential seen by the conduction electrons localised in Wannier orbitals at the Ag and Au sites (the Ag sites being slightly repulsive relative to the Au sites) and the (long-range) Coulomb repulsion between electrons occupying these Wannier orbitals. We also discuss the DC transport in such systems.</description>

      <title>Topological inverse Anderson insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A different type of topological phase dubbed topological inverse Anderson insulators is proposed, which is characterized by the disorder-induced extended bulk states from the flat-band localization and topological edge states. Based on the topological invariant, the behaviors of the localization length of the zero-energy modes, and quantum transport, we identify its existence in several all-band-flat models with the disordered potentials or hopping including the $\pi$-flux Creutz ladder, the fully dimerized Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chain, and $\pi$-flux diamond chain. Unlike the topological Anderson insulator, where disorder induces localization and exponential suppression of transport, the disorder-assisted quantum ballistic coherent transport can appear in the topological inverse Anderson insulator. In addition, our proposal and results could be realized by the current experimental techniques.</description>

      <title>Electric field induced second-order anomalous Hall transport in unconventional Rashba system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear responses in transport experiments may unveil information and generate new phenomena in materials that are not accessible at linear order due to symmetry constraints. While the linear anomalous Hall response strictly requires the absence of time-reversal symmetry, the second-order, thus nonlinear, Hall response needs broken inversion symmetry. Recently, much effort has been made to obtain a second-order Hall voltage in response to a longitudinal ac driving current, both to obtain information about band geometric quantities and for its useful technological applications, including rectification and frequency doubling. Typically, additional material engineering is required in noncentrosymmetric systems to obtain second-order responses since it obeys a stringent crystallographic symmetry constraint. To circumvent this, an alternative route is to apply a dc electric field. In this Letter, we uncover an electric field induced second-order anomalous Hall effect in an inversion-broken system possessing unconventional Rashba bands. We establish that the quantum metric, a geometrical feature of electronic wave functions providing information on non-trivial structure of Bloch bands, is responsible for providing the nonlinear Hall response.</description>

      <title>Artificially intelligent Maxwell's demon for optimal control of open quantum systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Feedback control of open quantum systems is of fundamental importance for practical applications in various contexts, ranging from quantum computation to quantum error correction and quantum metrology. Its use in the context of thermodynamics further enables the study of the interplay between information and energy. However, deriving optimal feedback control strategies is highly challenging, as it involves the optimal control of open quantum systems, the stochastic nature of quantum measurement, and the inclusion of policies that maximize a long-term time- and trajectory-averaged goal. In this work, we employ a reinforcement learning approach to automate and capture the role of a quantum Maxwell's demon: the agent takes the literal role of discovering optimal feedback control strategies in qubit-based systems that maximize a trade-off between measurement-powered cooling and measurement efficiency. Considering weak or projective quantum measurements, we explore different regimes based on the ordering between the thermalization, the measurement, and the unitary feedback timescales, finding different and highly non-intuitive, yet interpretable, strategies. In the thermalization-dominated regime, we find strategies with elaborate finite-time thermalization protocols conditioned on measurement outcomes. In the measurement-dominated regime, we find that optimal strategies involve adaptively measuring different qubit observables reflecting the acquired information, and repeating multiple weak measurements until the quantum state is "sufficiently pure", leading to random walks in state space. Finally, we study the case when all timescales are comparable, finding new feedback control strategies that considerably outperform more intuitive ones. We discuss a two-qubit example where we explore the role of entanglement and conclude discussing the scaling of our results to quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Biaxial strain tuning of excitons in monolayer MoSe$_2$ by high-temperature physical vapor deposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present strain tuning of excitonic emission in monolayer MoSe$_2$ by using a high-temperature physical vapor deposition (PVD). The use of two amorphous substrates, Si$_{3}$N$_{4}$ and SiO$_{2}$, provides two setpoints to induce distinct amounts of \textit{biaxial} tensile strain determined by a thermal expansion mismatch between the monolayer and the substrate. The tuning rate of the $A$-exciton transition energy is found to be 103 meV/\% by photoluminescence (PL), which represents the highest value realized by biaxial strain in transition metal dichalcogenides. The biaxial nature of the tensile strain is confirmed by polarization-resolved second harmonic generation, which reveals unperturbed in-plane three-fold symmetry of the monolayer. Furthermore, a softening of $A_\mathrm{1g}$ out-of-plane lattice vibration is identified in the Raman spectroscopy, which is known to be insignificant for uniaxial strain. Concomitantly, PL mapping of our PVD monolayers demonstrates (i) larger strain occurs in the interior of the mono-domain islands compared to the edges and (ii) the absence of island-size dependence in the magnitude of induced strain. Our results demonstrate an effective path towards strain engineering of excitons by using growth substrates, which holds great promise as a building block for future optoelectronic applications.</description>

      <title>Identifying the phases of Kane-Mele Hubbard Hamiltonian in momentum space: A many-body configuration interaction study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the magnetic and conduction properties of Kane-Mele Hubbard model in quasi one-dimensional honeycomb ribbon systems at half-filling by varying the strength of both spin-orbit interaction and on-site Coulomb correlation term. We use the numerical many-body configuration interaction (CI) method to investigate the dispersions of charge and spin gaps along with the momentum resolved spin-density profile over the full Brillouin zone. While the spin sector retains its topological nature at all values of spin-orbit coupling and Hubbard term, we report a new signature of the topological phase transition in the charge sector. This phase transition from a topological band insulating phase to a antiferromagnetically ordered Mott insulating phase is characterized by a shift of the many-body charge gap minima from Brillouin zone boundary to Dirac point. Our results provide a better understanding of the shifting of the gap-closing point in the momentum space which was reported in an earlier mean-field study of the same model and suggests an alternative numerical route to detect topological phase transition in strongly-correlated systems in terms of their momentum space behaviors.</description>

      <title>A quasi-ohmic back contact achieved by inserting single-crystal graphene in flexible Kesterite solar cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15684</link>

Abstract: Flexible photovoltaics with a lightweight and adaptable nature that allows for deployment on curved surfaces and in building facades have always been a goal vigorously pursued by researchers in thin-film solar cell technology. The recent strides made in improving the sunlight-to-electricity conversion efficiency of kesterite Cu$_{2}$ZnSn(S, Se)$_{4}$ (CZTSSe) suggest it to be a perfect candidate. However, making use of rare Mo foil in CZTSSe solar cells causes severe problems in thermal expansion matching, uneven grain growth, and severe problems at the back contact of the devices. Herein, a strategy utilizing single-crystal graphene to modify the back interface of flexible CZTSSe solar cells is proposed. It will be shown that the insertion of graphene at the Mo foil/CZTSSe interface provides strong physical support for the subsequent deposition of the CZTSSe absorber layer, improving the adhesion between the absorber layer and the Mo foil substrate. Additionally, the graphene passivates the rough sites on the surface of the Mo foil, enhancing the chemical homogeneity of the substrate, and resulting in a more crystalline and homogeneous CZTSSe absorber layer on the Mo foil substrate. The detrimental reaction between Mo and CZTSSe has also been eliminated. Through an analysis of the electrical properties, it is found that the introduction of graphene at the back interface promotes the formation of a quasi-ohmic contact at the back contact, decreasing the back contact barrier of the solar cell, and leading to efficient collection of charges at the back interface. This investigation demonstrates that solution-based CZTSSe photovoltaic devices could form the basis of cheap and flexible solar cells.</description>

Abstract: Colloidal matter undergoing Brownian motion serves as a model system to study various physical phenomena. Understanding the effect of external perturbation on the assembly and dynamics of Brownian colloids has emerged as a relevant research issue in soft matter and biological physics. Optical perturbation in the form of photonic forces and torques has added impetus to this exploration. In recent years, optothermal effects arising due to optical excitation of mesoscale matter have expanded the toolbox of light-colloidal matter interactions. In this perspective, we present an experimental viewpoint on some of the developments related to the assembly and dynamics of Brownian colloids driven by the optothermal field. Furthermore, we discuss some interesting prospects on driven colloidal matter that can have implications on soft matter physics and soft photonics.</description>

      <title>Classifying topological floppy modes in the continuum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In floppy mechanical lattices, robust edge states and bulk Weyl modes are manifestations of underlying topological invariants. To explore the universality of these phenomena independent of microscopic detail, we formulate topological mechanics in the continuum. By augmenting standard linear elasticity with additional fields of soft modes, we define a continuum version of Maxwell counting, which balances degrees of freedom and mechanical constraints. With one additional field, these augmented elasticity theories can break spatial inversion symmetry and harbor topological edge states. We also show that two additional fields are necessary to harbor Weyl points in two dimensions, and define continuum invariants to classify these states. In addition to constructing the general form of topological elasticity based on symmetries, we derive the coefficients based on the systematic homogenization of microscopic lattices. By solving the resulting partial differential equations, we efficiently predict coarse-grained deformations due to topological floppy modes without the need for a detailed lattice-based simulation. Our discovery formulates novel design principles and efficient computational tools for topological states of matter, and points to their experimental implementation in mechanical metamaterials.</description>

      <title>Magnetism in the Dilute Electron Gas of Rhombohedral Multilayer Graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15884v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lightly-doped rhombohedral multilayer graphene has recently emerged as one of the most promising material platforms for exploring electronic phases driven by strong Coulomb interactions and non-trivial band topology. This review highlights recent advancements in experimental techniques that deepen our understanding of the electronic properties of these systems, especially through the application of weak-field magnetic oscillations for studying phase transitions and Fermiology. Theoretically, we advocate modeling these systems using an electron gas framework, influenced primarily by two major energy scales: the long-range Coulomb potential and band energy. The interplay between these energies drives transitions between paramagnetic and ferromagnetic states, while smaller energy scales like spin-orbit coupling and sublattice-valley-dependent interactions at the atomic lattice scale shape the (magnetic anisotropic energy) differences between distinct symmetry-broken states. We provide first-principles estimates of lattice-scale coupling constants for Bernal bilayer graphene under strong displacement field, identifying the on-site inter-valley scattering repulsion, with a strength of $g_{\perp \perp}=269\text{meV nm}^2$ as the most significant short-range interaction. The mean-field phase diagram is analyzed and compared with experimental phase diagrams. New results on spin and valley paramagnons are presented, highlighting enhanced paramagnetic susceptibility at finite wavevectors and predicting valley and spin density-wave instabilities. The interplay between superconductivity and magnetism, particularly under the influence of spin-orbit coupling, is critically assessed. The review concludes with a summary of key findings and potential directions for future research.</description>

      <title>Stability and localization of nanoscale skyrmions and bimerons in an all-magnetic van der Waals heterostructure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic solitons such as skyrmions and bimerons show great promise for both fundamental research and spintronic applications. Stabilizing and controlling topological spin textures in atomically thin van der Waals (vdW) materials has gained tremendous attention due to high tunability, enhanced functionality, and miniaturization. Using rigorous first-principles calculations and atomistic spin simulations, we predict the existence of multiple magnetic solitons in an all-magnetic vdW heterostructure Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$/Cr$_2$Ge$_2$Te$_6$ (FGT/CGT). N\'eel-type skyrmions are formed at both sides of FGT/CGT with opposite chirality. Skyrmions at the FGT layer and bimerons at the CGT layer persist in the heterostructure at zero field, while the latter undergoes bimeron-skyrmion transformation if a field is applied. We further demonstrate that, although skyrmions and bimerons are topologically equivalent, they exhibit very different localization behavior. Skyrmions are isotropically localized, while bimerons exhibit anisotropic nonlocality, leading to finite-size effects. We analyze how this affects the stability of bimerons in confined materials. Our work represents an important step forward in the fundamental properties of topological spin textures and paves the way toward skyrmionic devices based on atomically thin vdW heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Modelling of planar germanium hole qubits in electric and magnetic fields</title>

Abstract: Hole-based spin qubits in strained planar germanium quantum wells have received considerable attention due to their favourable properties and remarkable experimental progress. The sizeable spin-orbit interaction in this structure allows for efficient qubit operations with electric fields. However, it also couples the qubit to electrical noise. In this work, we perform simulations of a heterostructure hosting these hole spin qubits. We solve the effective mass equations for a realistic heterostructure, provide a set of analytical basis wave functions, and compute the effective g-factor of the heavy-hole ground-state. Our investigations reveal a strong impact of highly excited light-hole states located outside the quantum well on the g-factor. We find that sweet spots, points of operations that are least susceptible to charge noise, for out-of-plane magnetic fields are shifted to impractically large electric fields. However, for magnetic fields close to in-plane alignment, partial sweet spots at low electric fields are recovered. Furthermore, sweet spots with respect to multiple fluctuating charge traps can be found under certain circumstances for different magnetic field alignments. This work will be helpful in understanding and improving coherence of germanium hole spin qubits.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic skyrmion mass induced by surrounding conduction electrons: A Schwinger-Keldysh field theory approach</title>

Abstract: The current-driven motion of magnetic skyrmions, as topologically protected winding vector fields of local magnetization, has attracted considerable attention due to both fundamental interest in the dynamics of topological solitons, and potential spintronic applications. While widely-used Thiele equation with zero skyrmion mass captures its rigid motion under the assumption of preserved skyrmion shape, experiments on realistic skyrmions find deviation due to inertial mass with numerous attempts to account for it by invoking internal skyrmion dynamics, geometry of the nanowire, and interaction with magnons or phonons. However, experimentally observed skyrmion mass is often much larger than predicted by these theories. In this Letter, we employ Schwinger-Keldysh field-theoretical approach to study conduction electrons interacting with localized magnetic moments comprising a skyrmion to obtain a stochastic differential equation of its motion. By analyzing its time-retarded damping kernel, we extract an anisotropic mass governed by conduction electrons and demonstrate its substantial effect on the current-driven skyrmion motion, even in the absence of any skyrmion deformation.</description>

      <title>Photo-induced Non-collinear Interlayer RKKY Coupling in Bulk Rashba Semiconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.06861v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interplay between light-matter, spin-orbit, and magnetic interactions allows the investigation of light-induced magnetic phenomena that are otherwise absent without irradiation. We present our analysis of light-driving effects on the interlayer exchange coupling mediated by a bulk Rashba semiconductor in a magnetic multilayer. The collinear magnetic exchange coupling mediated by the photon-dressed spin-orbit coupled electrons of BiTeI develops light-induced oscillation periods and displays new decay powers laws, both of which are enhanced with an increasing light-matter coupling. For magnetic layers with non-collinear magnetization, we find a non-collinear magnetic exchange coupling uniquely generated by light-driving of the multilayer. As the non-collinear magnetic exchange coupling mediated by the photon-dressed electrons of BiTeI is unique to the irradiated system and it is enhanced with increasing light-matter coupling, this effect offers a promising platform of investigation of light-driving effects on magnetic phenomena in spin-orbit coupled systems. In this platform, light properties, such as its intensity, can serve as external knobs for inducing non-collinear couplings of the interlayer exchange and for modulating the collinear couplings. Both of these effects signify the photo-generated modification in the spin textures of spin-orbit coupled electrons in BiTeI.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05614v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by experimental reports on chirality induced spin selectivity, we investigate a minimal model that allows us to calculate the charge and spin conductances through helical molecules analytically. The spin-orbit interaction is assumed to be non-vanishing on the molecule and negligible in the reservoirs (leads). The band-structure of the molecule features four helical modes with spin-momentum locking that are analogous of edge-currents in the quantum spin Hall effect. While charge is conserved and therefore the charge current is independent of where it is measured, - reservoirs or molecule, - our detailed calculations reveal that the spin currents in the left and right lead are equal in magnitudes but with opposite signs (in linear response).
  We predict that transport currents flowing through helical molecules are accompanied by a spin accumulation in the contact region with the same magnetization direction for source and drain. Further, we predict that the spin-conductance can be extracted directly from measuring the (quasi-static) spin accumulation - rather than the spin current itself, which is very challenging to obtain experimentally.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06097v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Effective control of interlayer interactions is a key element in modifying the properties of van der Waals heterostructures and the next step toward their practical applications. Focusing on the phosphorene-WSe$_2$ heterostructure, we demonstrate, using first-principles calculations, proximity-induced amplification of the spin-orbit coupling in phosphorene by applying vertical pressure. We simulate external pressure by changing the interlayer distance between bilayer constituents and show that it is possible to tune the spin-orbit field of phosphorene holes in a controllable way. By fitting effective electronic states of the proposed Hamiltonian to the first principles data, we reveal that the spin-orbit coupling in phosphorene hole bands is enhanced more than two times for experimentally accessible pressures up to 17 kbar. Correspondingly, we find that the pressure-enhanced spin-orbit coupling boosts the Dyakonov-Perel spin relaxation mechanism, reducing the spin lifetime of phosphorene holes by factor 4. We further explore the role of the lateral shift on the spin-orbit field and reveal that the spin-orbit strength of phosphorene holes can be sizably modulated when strong pressure is applied. We also found that the thermopower is governed mainly by the phosphorene and pressure reduces the overall thermoelectric efficiency of the heterostructure.</description>

Abstract: Understanding the thermodynamics of driven quantum systems strongly coupled to thermal baths is a central focus of quantum thermodynamics and mesoscopic physics. A variety of different methodological approaches exist in the literature, all with their own advantages and disadvantages. The mesoscopic leads approach was recently generalised to steady state thermal machines and has the ability to replicate Landauer B\"uttiker theory in the non-interacting limit. In this approach a set of discretised lead modes, each locally damped, provide a markovian embedding for the baths. In this work we further generalise this approach to incorporate an arbitrary time dependence in the system Hamiltonian. Following a careful discussion of the calculation of thermodynamic quantities we illustrate the power of our approach by studying several driven mesoscopic examples coupled to finite temperature fermionic baths, replicating known results in various limits. In the case of a driven non interacting quantum dot we show how fast driving can be used to induce heat rectification.</description>

Abstract: The diversity and heterogeneity of biomarkers has made the development of general methods for single-step quantification of analytes difficult. For individual biomarkers, electrochemical methods that detect a conformational change in an affinity binder upon analyte binding have shown promise. However, because the conformational change must operate within a nanometer-scale working distance, an entirely new sensor, with a unique conformational change, must be developed for each analyte. Here, we demonstrate a modular electrochemical biosensor, built from DNA origami, which is easily adapted to diverse molecules by merely replacing its analyte binding domains. Instead of relying on a unique nanometer-scale movement of a single redox reporter, all sensor variants rely on the same 100-nanometer scale conformational change, which brings dozens of reporters close enough to a gold electrode surface that a signal can be measured via square wave voltammetry, a standard electrochemical technique. To validate our sensor's mechanism, we used single-stranded DNA as an analyte, and optimized the number of redox reporters and various linker lengths. Adaptation of the sensor to streptavidin and PDGF-BB analytes was achieved by simply adding biotin or anti-PDGF aptamers to appropriate DNA linkers. Geometrically-optimized streptavidin sensors exhibited signal gain and limit of detection markedly better than comparable reagentless electrochemical sensors. After use, the same sensors could be regenerated under mild conditions: performance was largely maintained over four cycles of DNA strand displacement and rehybridization. By leveraging the modularity of DNA nanostructures, our work provides a straightforward route to the single-step quantification of arbitrary nucleic acids and proteins.</description>

      <title>Entropy production in the mesoscopic-leads formulation of quantum thermodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.12513v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the entropy production of systems strongly coupled to thermal baths is a core problem of both quantum thermodynamics and mesoscopic physics. While there exist many techniques to accurately study entropy production in such systems, they typically require a microscopic description of the baths, which can become numerically intractable to study for large systems. Alternatively an open-systems approach can be employed with all the nuances associated with various levels of approximation. Recently, the mesoscopic leads approach has emerged as a powerful method for studying such quantum systems strongly coupled to multiple thermal baths. In this method, a set of discretised lead modes, each locally damped, provide a Markovian embedding. Here we show that this method proves extremely useful to describe entropy production of a strongly coupled open quantum system. We show numerically, for both non-interacting and interacting setups, that a system coupled to a single bath exhibits a thermal fixed point at the level of the embedding. This allows us to use various results from the thermodynamics of quantum dynamical semi-groups to infer the non-equilibrium thermodynamics of the strongly coupled, non-Markovian central systems. In particular, we show that the entropy production in the transient regime recovers the well established microscopic definitions of entropy production with a correction that can be computed explicitly for both the single- and multiple-lead cases.</description>

Abstract: Chiral engineering of TeraHertz (THz) light fields and the use of the handedness of light in THz light-matter interactions promise many novel opportunities for advanced sensing and control of matter in this frequency range. Unlike previously explored methods, this is achieved here by leveraging the chiral properties of highly confined THz surface plasmon modes. More specifically, we design ultrasmall surface plasmonic-based THz cavities and THz metasurfaces that display significant and adjustable chiral behavior under modest magnetic fields (B&lt;500mT). For such a prototypical example of non-hermitian and dispersive photonic system, we demonstrate the capacity to magnetic field-tune both the poles and zeros of cavity resonances, the two fundamental parameters governing their resonance properties. Alongside the observed handedness-dependent cavity frequencies, this highlights the remarkable ability to engineer chiral and tunable radiative couplings for THz resonators and metasurfaces. The extensive tunability offered by the surface plasmonic approach paves the way for the development of agile and multifunctional THz metasurfaces as well as the realization of ultrastrong chiral light-matter interactions at low energy in matter with potential far-reaching applications for the design of material properties.</description>

      <title>Kagome bands and magnetism in MoTe$_{2-x}$ kagome monolayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14285v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kagome lattices facilitate various quantum phases, yet in bulk materials, their kagome flat-bands often interact with bulk bands, suppressing kagome electronic characteristics for hosting these phases. Here, we use density-functional-theory calculations to predict the geometric and electronic structures, as well as the topological and magnetic properties, of a series of MoTe$_{2-x}$ kagome monolayers formed by mirror-twin-boundary (MTB) loops. We analyze ten MTB-loop configurations of varying sizes and arrangements to assess their impact on various properties. Within the intrinsic bandgap of MoTe$_{2}$, we identify two sets of kagome bands, primarily originating from in-plane and out-of-plane Mo d-orbitals at MTB-loop edges and -vertices, respectively. Three configurations exhibit superior stability, while three others show comparable stability. Among these, four display bandgaps and potentially non-zero Z$_{2}$ topological invariants, suggesting possible topological phases, while the remaining two are metallic and feature Stoner magnetization. These findings guide the design of kagome-based two-dimensional materials with tunable electronic, topological, and magnetic properties.</description>
