      <title>Using Data Science in High School Astronomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Astronomy datasets can be challenging to use for high school astronomy classes. Data science education pedagogy can be leveraged to create astronomy activities in which students interrogate data, create visuals, and use statistical thinking to construct astronomy knowledge. This session describes how the NASA/IPAC Infrared Science Archive (IRSA) can provide a web-based interface for students to use basic data science techniques in astronomy to build data literacy while learning astronomical concepts. The activities shared will be available for anyone but were designed to be used in astro 101 classes in high school or early college.</description>

      <title>Differences in the attitudes and beliefs about science of students in the physics-mathematics and life sciences areas and their impact on teaching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.11680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.11680v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For this study, we compared the attitudes and beliefs about science of physical science (physics and mathematics) and life science (biochemistry and biology) students at the beginning of their university degrees using the CLASS (Colorado Learning Attitudes about Science Survey) tool. It is worth noting that both groups of students received similar physics courses during their high-school education. Through a detailed analysis of the different categories of the test, we examined the differences in performance in each of the areas that make up the questionnaire. Among other aspects, we found that a considerable percentage of life science students (higher than that of physical science students) adopted a novice type of behavior in problem solving. Finally, we discussed the possible causes of the differences found and their implications for teaching.</description>
