      <title>Unveiling the nature of cathodoluminescence from photon statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cathodoluminescence (CL), the emission of light induced by accelerated free electrons, has been extensively utilized in various applications, such as displays, streak cameras, and high-spatial-resolution analysis of optical material, surpassing the diffraction limit of light. Despite its long history, the photon statistics of CL have only recently been examined, revealing unexpectedly large bunching of photons. Here we find that this peculiar photon bunching contains information of intervening excitation processes before the photon emission, which can be extracted from the photon statistics within each excitation event by a single free electron. Using this approach, we experimentally unveiled the statistical differences of coherent CL involving a single electromagnetic interaction process and incoherent CL involving multiple excitation processes. The developed formulation is universally applicable for particle generation processes in general to investigate the nature of cascade reactions.</description>

      <title>Causal Hierarchy in the Financial Market Network -- Uncovered by the Helmholtz-Hodge-Kodaira Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Granger causality can uncover the cause and effect relationships in financial networks. However, such networks can be convoluted and difficult to interpret, but the Helmholtz-Hodge-Kodaira decomposition can split them into a rotational and gradient component which reveals the hierarchy of Granger causality flow. Using Kenneth French's business sector return time series, it is revealed that during the Covid crisis, precious metals and pharmaceutical products are causal drivers of the financial network. Moreover, the estimated Granger causality network shows a high connectivity during crisis which means that the research presented here can be especially useful to better understand crises in the market by revealing the dominant drivers of the crisis dynamics.</description>

      <title>Structural Descriptors and Information Extraction from X-ray Emission Spectra: Aqueous Sulfuric Acid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08355v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning can reveal new insights into X-ray spectroscopy of liquids when the local atomistic environment is presented to the model in a suitable way. Many unique structural descriptor families have been developed for this purpose. We benchmark the performance of six different descriptor families using a computational data set of 24200 sulfur K$\beta$ X-ray emission spectra of aqueous sulfuric acid simulated at six different concentrations. We train a feed-forward neural network to predict the spectra from the corresponding descriptor vectors and find that the local many-body tensor representation, smooth overlap of atomic positions and atom-centered symmetry functions excel in this comparison. We found a similar hierarchy when applying the emulator-based component analysis to identify and separate the spectrally relevant structural characteristics from the irrelevant ones. In this case, the spectra were dominantly dependent on the concentration of the system, whereas adding the second most significant degree of freedom in the decomposition allowed for distinction of the protonation state of the acid molecule.</description>

      <title>Encoder-Decoder Neural Networks in Interpretation of X-ray Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14044v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Encoder--decoder neural networks (EDNN) condense information most relevant to the output of the feedforward network to activation values at a bottleneck layer. We study the use of this architecture in emulation and interpretation of simulated X-ray spectroscopic data with the aim to identify key structural characteristics for the spectra, previously studied using emulator-based component analysis (ECA). We find an EDNN to outperform ECA in covered target variable variance, but also discover complications in interpreting the latent variables in physical terms. As a compromise of the benefits of these two approaches, we develop a network where the linear projection of ECA is used, thus maintaining the beneficial characteristics of vector expansion from the latent variables for their interpretation. These results underline the necessity of information recovery after its condensation and identification of decisive structural degrees of freedom for the output spectra for a justified interpretation.</description>
