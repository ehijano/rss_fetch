      <title>Knowledge representation and scalable abstract reasoning for simulated democracy in Unity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel form of scalable knowledge representation about agents in a simulated democracy, e-polis, where real users respond to social challenges associated with democratic institutions, structured as Smart Spatial Types, a new type of Smart Building that changes architectural form according to the philosophical doctrine of a visitor. At the end of the game players vote on the Smart City that results from their collective choices. Our approach uses deductive systems in an unusual way: by integrating a model of democracy with a model of a Smart City we are able to prove quality aspects of the simulated democracy in different urban and social settings, while adding ease and flexibility to the development. Second, we can infer and reason with abstract knowledge, which is a limitation of the Unity platform; third, our system enables real-time decision-making and adaptation of the game flow based on the player's abstract state, paving the road to explainability. Scalability is achieved by maintaining a dual-layer knowledge representation mechanism for reasoning about the simulated democracy that functions in a similar way to a two-level cache. The lower layer knows about the current state of the game by continually processing a high rate of events produced by the in-built physics engine of the Unity platform, e.g., it knows of the position of a player in space, in terms of his coordinates x,y,z as well as their choices for each challenge. The higher layer knows of easily-retrievable, user-defined abstract knowledge about current and historical states, e.g., it knows of the political doctrine of a Smart Spatial Type, a player's philosophical doctrine, and the collective philosophical doctrine of a community players with respect to current social issues.</description>

      <title>The Multi-Trip Time-Dependent Mix Vehicle Routing Problem for Hybrid Autonomous Shared Delivery Location and Traditional Door-to-Door Delivery Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rising labor costs and increasing logistical demands pose significant challenges to modern delivery systems. Automated Electric Vehicles (AEVs) could reduce reliance on delivery personnel and increase route flexibility, but their adoption is limited due to varying customer acceptance and integration complexities. Shared Distribution Locations (SDLs) offer an alternative to door-to-door (D2D) delivery by providing a wider delivery window and serving multiple community customers, thereby improving last-mile logistics through reduced delivery time, lower costs, and higher customer satisfaction.This paper introduces the Multi-Trip Time-Dependent Hybrid Vehicle Routing Problem (MTTD-MVRP), a challenging variant of the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) that combines Autonomous Electric Vehicles (AEVs) with conventional vehicles. The problem's complexity arises from factors such as time-dependent travel speeds, strict time windows, battery limitations, and driver labor constraints, while integrating both SDLs and D2D deliveries. To solve the MTTD-MVRP efficiently, we develop a tailored meta-heuristic based on Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search (ALNS) augmented with column generation (CG). This approach intensively explores the solution space using problem-specific operators and adaptively refines solutions, balancing high-quality outcomes with computational effort. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method delivers near-optimal solutions for large-scale instances within practical time limits.From a managerial perspective, our findings highlight the importance of integrating autonomous and human-driven vehicles in last-mile logistics. Decision-makers can leverage SDLs to reduce operational costs and carbon footprints while still accommodating customers who require or prefer D2D services.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Earth Science Discovery via Multi-Agent LLM Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This Perspective explores the transformative potential of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) in the geosciences. Users of geoscientific data repositories face challenges due to the complexity and diversity of data formats, inconsistent metadata practices, and a considerable number of unprocessed datasets. MAS possesses transformative potential for improving scientists' interaction with geoscientific data by enabling intelligent data processing, natural language interfaces, and collaborative problem-solving capabilities. We illustrate this approach with "PANGAEA GPT", a specialized MAS pipeline integrated with the diverse PANGAEA database for Earth and Environmental Science, demonstrating how MAS-driven workflows can effectively manage complex datasets and accelerate scientific discovery. We discuss how MAS can address current data challenges in geosciences, highlight advancements in other scientific fields, and propose future directions for integrating MAS into geoscientific data processing pipelines. In this Perspective, we show how MAS can fundamentally improve data accessibility, promote cross-disciplinary collaboration, and accelerate geoscientific discoveries.</description>

      <title>Vairiational Stochastic Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Control as Inference (CAI) framework has successfully transformed single-agent reinforcement learning (RL) by reframing control tasks as probabilistic inference problems. However, the extension of CAI to multi-agent, general-sum stochastic games (SGs) remains underexplored, particularly in decentralized settings where agents operate independently without centralized coordination. In this paper, we propose a novel variational inference framework tailored to decentralized multi-agent systems. Our framework addresses the challenges posed by non-stationarity and unaligned agent objectives, proving that the resulting policies form an $\epsilon$-Nash equilibrium. Additionally, we demonstrate theoretical convergence guarantees for the proposed decentralized algorithms. Leveraging this framework, we instantiate multiple algorithms to solve for Nash equilibrium, mean-field Nash equilibrium, and correlated equilibrium, with rigorous theoretical convergence analysis.</description>

      <title>Artificial Utopia: Simulation and Intelligent Agents for a Democratised Future</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prevailing top-down systems in politics and economics struggle to keep pace with the pressing challenges of the 21st century, such as climate change, social inequality and conflict. Bottom-up democratisation and participatory approaches in politics and economics are increasingly seen as promising alternatives to confront and overcome these issues, often with utopian overtones, as proponents believe they may dramatically reshape political, social and ecological futures for the better and in contrast to contemporary authoritarian tendencies across various countries. Institutional specifics and the associated collective human behavior or culture remains little understood and debated, however. In this article, I propose a novel research agenda focusing on utopian democratisation efforts with formal and computational methods as well as with artificial intelligence - I call this agenda Artificial Utopia. Artificial Utopias provide safe testing grounds for new political ideas and economic policies in-silico with reduced risk of negative consequences as compared to testing ideas in real-world contexts. An increasing number of advanced simulation and intelligence methods, that aim at representing human cognition and collective decision-making in more realistic ways, could benefit this process. This includes agent-based modelling, reinforcement learning, large language models and more. I clarify what some of these simulation approaches can contribute to the study of Artificial Utopias with the help of two institutional examples: the citizen assembly and the democratic firm.</description>

      <title>Multi-agent Auto-Bidding with Latent Graph Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a diffusion-based auto-bidding framework that leverages graph representations to model large-scale auction environments. In such settings, agents must dynamically optimize bidding strategies under constraints defined by key performance indicator (KPI) metrics, all while operating in competitive environments characterized by uncertain, sparse, and stochastic variables. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel approach combining learnable graph-based embeddings with a planning-based latent diffusion model (LDM). By capturing patterns and nuances underlying the interdependence of impression opportunities and the multi-agent dynamics of the auction environment, the graph representation enable expressive computations regarding auto-bidding outcomes. With reward alignment techniques, the LDM's posterior is fine-tuned to generate auto-bidding trajectories that maximize KPI metrics while satisfying constraint thresholds. Empirical evaluations on both real-world and synthetic auction environments demonstrate significant improvements in auto-bidding performance across multiple common KPI metrics, as well as accuracy in forecasting auction outcomes.</description>

      <title>Momentum-based Distributed Resource Scheduling Optimization Subject to Sector-Bound Nonlinearity and Latency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes an accelerated consensus-based distributed iterative algorithm for resource allocation and scheduling. The proposed gradient-tracking algorithm introduces an auxiliary variable to add momentum towards the optimal state. We prove that this solution is all-time feasible, implying that the coupling constraint always holds along the algorithm iterative procedure; therefore, the algorithm can be terminated at any time. This is in contrast to the ADMM-based solutions that meet constraint feasibility asymptotically. Further, we show that the proposed algorithm can handle possible link nonlinearity due to logarithmically-quantized data transmission (or any sign-preserving odd sector-bound nonlinear mapping). We prove convergence over uniformly-connected dynamic networks (i.e., a hybrid setup) that may occur in mobile and time-varying multi-agent networks. Further, the latency issue over the network is addressed by proposing delay-tolerant solutions. To our best knowledge, accelerated momentum-based convergence, nonlinear linking, all-time feasibility, uniform network connectivity, and handling (possible) time delays are not altogether addressed in the literature. These contributions make our solution practical in many real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Optimal Output Feedback Learning Control for Discrete-Time Linear Quadratic Regulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the linear quadratic regulation (LQR) problem of unknown discrete-time systems via dynamic output feedback learning control. In contrast to the state feedback, the optimality of the dynamic output feedback control for solving the LQR problem requires an implicit condition on the convergence of the state observer. Moreover, due to unknown system matrices and the existence of observer error, it is difficult to analyze the convergence and stability of most existing output feedback learning-based control methods. To tackle these issues, we propose a generalized dynamic output feedback learning control approach with guaranteed convergence, stability, and optimality performance for solving the LQR problem of unknown discrete-time linear systems. In particular, a dynamic output feedback controller is designed to be equivalent to a state feedback controller. This equivalence relationship is an inherent property without requiring convergence of the estimated state by the state observer, which plays a key role in establishing the off-policy learning control approaches. By value iteration and policy iteration schemes, the adaptive dynamic programming based learning control approaches are developed to estimate the optimal feedback control gain. In addition, a model-free stability criterion is provided by finding a nonsingular parameterization matrix, which contributes to establishing a switched iteration scheme. Furthermore, the convergence, stability, and optimality analyses of the proposed output feedback learning control approaches are given. Finally, the theoretical results are validated by two numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Higher-Order Belief in Incomplete Information MAIDs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-agent influence diagrams (MAIDs) are probabilistic graphical models which represent strategic interactions between agents. MAIDs are equivalent to extensive form games (EFGs) but have a more compact and informative structure. However, MAIDs cannot, in general, represent settings of incomplete information -- wherein agents have different beliefs about the game being played, and different beliefs about each-other's beliefs. In this paper, we introduce incomplete information MAIDs (II-MAIDs). We define both infinite and finite-depth II-MAIDs and prove an equivalence relation to EFGs with incomplete information and no common prior over types. We prove that II-MAIDs inherit classical equilibria concepts via this equivalence, but note that these solution concepts are often unrealistic in the setting with no common prior because they violate common knowledge of rationality. We define a more realistic solution concept based on recursive best-response. Throughout, we describe an example with a hypothetical AI agent undergoing evaluation to illustrate the applicability of II-MAIDs.</description>

      <title>Vision-Based Cooperative MAV-Capturing-MAV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: MAV-capturing-MAV (MCM) is one of the few effective methods for physically countering misused or malicious MAVs.This paper presents a vision-based cooperative MCM system, where multiple pursuer MAVs equipped with onboard vision systems detect, localize, and pursue a target MAV. To enhance robustness, a distributed state estimation and control framework enables the pursuer MAVs to autonomously coordinate their actions. Pursuer trajectories are optimized using Model Predictive Control (MPC) and executed via a low-level SO(3) controller, ensuring smooth and stable pursuit. Once the capture conditions are satisfied, the pursuer MAVs automatically deploy a flying net to intercept the target. These capture conditions are determined based on the predicted motion of the net. To enable real-time decision-making, we propose a lightweight computational method to approximate the net motion, avoiding the prohibitive cost of solving the full net dynamics. The effectiveness of the proposed system is validated through simulations and real-world experiments. In real-world tests, our approach successfully captures a moving target traveling at 4 meters per second with an acceleration of 1 meter per square second, achieving a success rate of 64.7 percent.</description>

      <title>Beyond Black-Box Benchmarking: Observability, Analytics, and Optimization of Agentic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rise of agentic AI systems, where agents collaborate to perform diverse tasks, poses new challenges with observing, analyzing and optimizing their behavior. Traditional evaluation and benchmarking approaches struggle to handle the non-deterministic, context-sensitive, and dynamic nature of these systems. This paper explores key challenges and opportunities in analyzing and optimizing agentic systems across development, testing, and maintenance. We explore critical issues such as natural language variability and unpredictable execution flows, which hinder predictability and control, demanding adaptive strategies to manage input variability and evolving behaviors. Through our user study, we supported these hypotheses. In particular, we showed a 79% agreement that non deterministic flow of agentic systems acts as a major challenge. Finally, we validated our statements empirically advocating the need for moving beyond classical benchmarking. To bridge these gaps, we introduce taxonomies to present expected analytics outcomes and the ways to collect them by extending standard observability frameworks. Building on these foundations, we introduce and demonstrate novel approach for benchmarking of agent evaluation systems. Unlike traditional "black box" performance evaluation approaches, our benchmark is built from agent runtime logs as input, and analytics outcome including discovered flows and issues. By addressing key limitations in existing methodologies, we aim to set the stage for more advanced and holistic evaluation strategies, which could foster the development of adaptive, interpretable, and robust agentic AI systems.</description>

      <title>Fully-Decentralized MADDPG with Networked Agents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we devise three actor-critic algorithms with decentralized training for multi-agent reinforcement learning in cooperative, adversarial, and mixed settings with continuous action spaces. To this goal, we adapt the MADDPG algorithm by applying a networked communication approach between agents. We introduce surrogate policies in order to decentralize the training while allowing for local communication during training. The decentralized algorithms achieve comparable results to the original MADDPG in empirical tests, while reducing computational cost. This is more pronounced with larger numbers of agents.</description>

      <title>AutoMisty: A Multi-Agent LLM Framework for Automated Code Generation in the Misty Social Robot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The social robot's open API allows users to customize open-domain interactions. However, it remains inaccessible to those without programming experience. In this work, we introduce AutoMisty, the first multi-agent collaboration framework powered by large language models (LLMs), to enable the seamless generation of executable Misty robot code from natural language instructions. AutoMisty incorporates four specialized agent modules to manage task decomposition, assignment, problem-solving, and result synthesis. Each agent incorporates a two-layer optimization mechanism, with self-reflection for iterative refinement and human-in-the-loop for better alignment with user preferences. AutoMisty ensures a transparent reasoning process, allowing users to iteratively refine tasks through natural language feedback for precise execution. To evaluate AutoMisty's effectiveness, we designed a benchmark task set spanning four levels of complexity and conducted experiments in a real Misty robot environment. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that AutoMisty not only consistently generates high-quality code but also enables precise code control, significantly outperforming direct reasoning with ChatGPT-4o and ChatGPT-o1. All code, optimized APIs, and experimental videos will be publicly released through the webpage: https://wangxiaoshawn.github.io/AutoMisty.html</description>

      <title>Can Proof Assistants Verify Multi-Agent Systems?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the Soda language for verifying multi-agent systems. Soda is a high-level functional and object-oriented language that supports the compilation of its code not only to Scala, a strongly statically typed high-level programming language, but also to Lean, a proof assistant and programming language. Given these capabilities, Soda can implement multi-agent systems, or parts thereof, that can then be integrated into a mainstream software ecosystem on the one hand and formally verified with state-of-the-art tools on the other hand. We provide a brief and informal introduction to Soda and the aforementioned interoperability capabilities, as well as a simple demonstration of how interaction protocols can be designed and verified with Soda. In the course of the demonstration, we highlight challenges with respect to real-world applicability.</description>

      <title>Human Machine Co-Adaptation Model and Its Convergence Analysis</title>

Abstract: The key to robot-assisted rehabilitation lies in the design of the human-machine interface, which must accommodate the needs of both patients and machines. Current interface designs primarily focus on machine control algorithms, often requiring patients to spend considerable time adapting. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach based on the Cooperative Adaptive Markov Decision Process (CAMDPs) model to address the fundamental aspects of the interactive learning process, offering theoretical insights and practical guidance. We establish sufficient conditions for the convergence of CAMDPs and ensure the uniqueness of Nash equilibrium points. Leveraging these conditions, we guarantee the system's convergence to a unique Nash equilibrium point. Furthermore, we explore scenarios with multiple Nash equilibrium points, devising strategies to adjust both Value Evaluation and Policy Improvement algorithms to enhance the likelihood of converging to the global minimal Nash equilibrium point. Through numerical experiments, we illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed conditions and algorithms, demonstrating their applicability and robustness in practical settings. The proposed conditions for convergence and the identification of a unique optimal Nash equilibrium contribute to the development of more effective adaptive systems for human users in robot-assisted rehabilitation.</description>

      <title>Exclusion Zones of Instant Runoff Voting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16719v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent research on instant runoff voting (IRV) shows that it exhibits a striking combinatorial property in one-dimensional preference spaces: there is an "exclusion zone" around the median voter such that if a candidate from the exclusion zone is on the ballot, then the winner must come from the exclusion zone. Thus, in one dimension, IRV cannot elect an extreme candidate as long as a sufficiently moderate candidate is running. In this work, we examine the mathematical structure of exclusion zones as a broad phenomenon in more general preference spaces. We prove that with voters uniformly distributed over any $d$-dimensional hyperrectangle (for $d &gt; 1$), IRV has no nontrivial exclusion zone. However, we also show that IRV exclusion zones are not solely a one-dimensional phenomenon. For irregular higher-dimensional preference spaces with fewer symmetries than hyperrectangles, IRV can exhibit nontrivial exclusion zones. As a further exploration, we study IRV exclusion zones in graph voting, where nodes represent voters who prefer candidates closer to them in the graph. Here, we show that IRV exclusion zones present a surprising computational challenge: even checking whether a given set of positions is an IRV exclusion zone is NP-hard. We develop an efficient randomized approximation algorithm for checking and finding exclusion zones. We also report on computational experiments with exclusion zones in two directions: (i) applying our approximation algorithm to a collection of real-world school friendship networks, we find that about 60% of these networks have probable nontrivial IRV exclusion zones; and (ii) performing an exhaustive computer search of small graphs and trees, we also find nontrivial IRV exclusion zones in most graphs. While our focus is on IRV, the properties of exclusion zones we establish provide a novel method for analyzing voting systems in metric spaces more generally.</description>

      <title>CleanAgent: Automating Data Standardization with LLM-based Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08291v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data standardization is a crucial part of the data science life cycle. While tools like Pandas offer robust functionalities, their complexity and the manual effort required for customizing code to diverse column types pose significant challenges. Although large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT have shown promise in automating this process through natural language understanding and code generation, it still demands expert-level programming knowledge and continuous interaction for prompt refinement. To solve these challenges, our key idea is to propose a Python library with declarative, unified APIs for standardizing different column types, simplifying the LLM's code generation with concise API calls. We first propose Dataprep.Clean, a component of the Dataprep Python Library, significantly reduces the coding complexity by enabling the standardization of specific column types with a single line of code. Then, we introduce the CleanAgent framework integrating Dataprep.Clean and LLM-based agents to automate the data standardization process. With CleanAgent, data scientists only need to provide their requirements once, allowing for a hands-free process. To demonstrate the practical utility of CleanAgent, we developed a user-friendly web application, allowing attendees to interact with it using real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>BioDiscoveryAgent: An AI Agent for Designing Genetic Perturbation Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17631v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Agents based on large language models have shown great potential in accelerating scientific discovery by leveraging their rich background knowledge and reasoning capabilities. In this paper, we introduce BioDiscoveryAgent, an agent that designs new experiments, reasons about their outcomes, and efficiently navigates the hypothesis space to reach desired solutions. We demonstrate our agent on the problem of designing genetic perturbation experiments, where the aim is to find a small subset out of many possible genes that, when perturbed, result in a specific phenotype (e.g., cell growth). Utilizing its biological knowledge, BioDiscoveryAgent can uniquely design new experiments without the need to train a machine learning model or explicitly design an acquisition function as in Bayesian optimization. Moreover, BioDiscoveryAgent, using Claude 3.5 Sonnet, achieves an average of 21% improvement in predicting relevant genetic perturbations across six datasets, and a 46% improvement in the harder task of non-essential gene perturbation, compared to existing Bayesian optimization baselines specifically trained for this task. Our evaluation includes one dataset that is unpublished, ensuring it is not part of the language model's training data. Additionally, BioDiscoveryAgent predicts gene combinations to perturb more than twice as accurately as a random baseline, a task so far not explored in the context of closed-loop experiment design. The agent also has access to tools for searching the biomedical literature, executing code to analyze biological datasets, and prompting another agent to critically evaluate its predictions. Overall, BioDiscoveryAgent is interpretable at every stage, representing an accessible new paradigm in the computational design of biological experiments with the potential to augment scientists' efficacy.</description>

      <title>Hypergraph-based Coordinated Task Allocation and Socially-aware Navigation for Multi-Robot Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11561v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A team of multiple robots seamlessly and safely working in human-filled public environments requires adaptive task allocation and socially-aware navigation that account for dynamic human behavior. Current approaches struggle with highly dynamic pedestrian movement and the need for flexible task allocation. We propose Hyper-SAMARL, a hypergraph-based system for multi-robot task allocation and socially-aware navigation, leveraging multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). Hyper-SAMARL models the environmental dynamics between robots, humans, and points of interest (POIs) using a hypergraph, enabling adaptive task assignment and socially-compliant navigation through a hypergraph diffusion mechanism. Our framework, trained with MARL, effectively captures interactions between robots and humans, adapting tasks based on real-time changes in human activity. Experimental results demonstrate that Hyper-SAMARL outperforms baseline models in terms of social navigation, task completion efficiency, and adaptability in various simulated scenarios.</description>

      <title>Learning Multi-Agent Loco-Manipulation for Long-Horizon Quadrupedal Pushing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07104v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, quadrupedal locomotion has achieved significant success, but their manipulation capabilities, particularly in handling large objects, remain limited, restricting their usefulness in demanding real-world applications such as search and rescue, construction, industrial automation, and room organization. This paper tackles the task of obstacle-aware, long-horizon pushing by multiple quadrupedal robots. We propose a hierarchical multi-agent reinforcement learning framework with three levels of control. The high-level controller integrates an RRT planner and a centralized adaptive policy to generate subgoals, while the mid-level controller uses a decentralized goal-conditioned policy to guide the robots toward these sub-goals. A pre-trained low-level locomotion policy executes the movement commands. We evaluate our method against several baselines in simulation, demonstrating significant improvements over baseline approaches, with 36.0% higher success rates and 24.5% reduction in completion time than the best baseline. Our framework successfully enables long-horizon, obstacle-aware manipulation tasks like Push-Cuboid and Push-T on Go1 robots in the real world.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Dual Process Theory in Language Agent Framework for Real-time Simultaneous Human-AI Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11882v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Agents built on large language models (LLMs) have excelled in turn-by-turn human-AI collaboration but struggle with simultaneous tasks requiring real-time interaction. Latency issues and the challenge of inferring variable human strategies hinder their ability to make autonomous decisions without explicit instructions. Through experiments with current independent System 1 and System 2 methods, we validate the necessity of using Dual Process Theory (DPT) in real-time tasks. We propose DPT-Agent, a novel language agent framework that integrates System 1 and System 2 for efficient real-time simultaneous human-AI collaboration. DPT-Agent's System 1 uses a Finite-state Machine (FSM) and code-as-policy for fast, intuitive, and controllable decision-making. DPT-Agent's System 2 integrates Theory of Mind (ToM) and asynchronous reflection to infer human intentions and perform reasoning-based autonomous decisions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DPT-Agent through further experiments with rule-based agents and human collaborators, showing significant improvements over mainstream LLM-based frameworks. DPT-Agent can effectively help LLMs convert correct slow thinking and reasoning into executable actions, thereby improving performance. To the best of our knowledge, DPT-Agent is the first language agent framework that achieves successful real-time simultaneous human-AI collaboration autonomously. Code of DPT-Agent can be found in https://github.com/sjtu-marl/DPT-Agent.</description>

      <title>Applicability of the Minimal Dominating Set for Influence Maximisation in Multilayer Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15236v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The minimal dominating set (MDS) is a well-established concept in network controllability and has been successfully applied in various domains, including sensor placement, network resilience, and epidemic containment. In this study, we adapt the local-improvement MDS routine and explore its potential for enhancing seed selection for influence maximisation in multilayer networks (MLN). We employ the Linear Threshold Model (LTM), which offers an intuitive representation of influence spread or opinion dynamics by accounting for peer influence accumulation. To ensure interpretability, we utilise rank-refining seed selection methods, with the results further filtered with MDS. Our findings reveal that incorporating MDS into the seed selection process improves spread only within a specific range of situations. Notably, the improvement is observed for larger seed set budgets, lower activation thresholds, and when an "AND" strategy is used to aggregate influence across network layers. This scenario reflects situations where an individual does not require the majority of their acquaintances to hold a target opinion, but must be influenced across all social circles.</description>

      <title>Small-Scale Testbeds for Connected and Automated Vehicles and Robot Swarms: Challenges and a Roadmap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05656v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article proposes a roadmap to address the current challenges in small-scale testbeds for Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) and robot swarms. The roadmap is a joint effort of participants in the workshop "1st Workshop on Small-Scale Testbeds for Connected and Automated Vehicles and Robot Swarms," held on June 2 at the IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV) 2024 in Jeju, South Korea. The roadmap contains three parts: 1) enhancing accessibility and diversity, especially for underrepresented communities, 2) sharing best practices for the development and maintenance of testbeds, and 3) connecting testbeds through an abstraction layer to support collaboration. The workshop features eight invited speakers, four contributed papers [1]-[4], and a presentation of a survey paper on testbeds [5]. The survey paper provides an online comparative table of more than 25 testbeds, available at https://bassamlab.github.io/testbeds-survey. The workshop's own website is available at https://cpm-remote.lrt.unibw-muenchen.de/iv24-workshop.</description>
