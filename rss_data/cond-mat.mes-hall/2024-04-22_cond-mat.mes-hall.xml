      <title>Band theory for heterostructures with interface superlattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by recent experiments demonstrating the creation of atomically sharp interfaces between hexagonal sapphire and cubic SrTiO$_3$ with finite twist, we here develop and study a general electronic band theory for this novel class of moir\'e heterostructures. We take into account the three-dimensional nature of the two crystals, allow for arbitrary combinations of Bravais lattices, finite twist angles, and different locations in momentum space of the low-energy electronic bands of the constituent materials. We analyze the general condition for a well-defined crystalline limit in the interface electron system and classify the associated "crystalline reference points". We discuss this in detail for the example of the two-dimensional lattice planes being square and triangular lattices on the two sides of the interface; we reveal non-trivial reference points at finite twist angle and lattice mismatch and the possibility of band structures of mixed dimensionality, where quasi-one- and two-dimensional pockets coexist. Explicit computations for different bulk Bloch Hamiltonians yield a collection of interesting features, such as isolated bands localized at interfaces of non-topological insulators, Dirac cones, van Hove singularities, a non-trivial evolution of the band structures with Zeeman-field, and topological interface bands. Our work illustrates the potential of these heterostructures and is anticipated to provide the foundation for moir\'e interface design and for the analysis of correlated physics in these systems.</description>

      <title>Fermionic Quantum Simulation on Andreev Bound State Superlattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Arrays of superconducting qubits and cavities offer a promising route for realizing highly controllable artificial materials. However, many analog simulations of superconducting circuit hardware have focused on bosonic systems. Fermionic simulations, on the other hand, have largely relied on digital approaches that require non-local qubit couplings, which could limit their scalability. Here, we propose and study an alternative approach for analog fermionic quantum simulation based on arrays of coherently coupled mesoscopic Josephson junctions. These Josephson junction arrays implement an effective superlattice of Andreev bound state "atoms" that can trap individual fermionic quasiparticles and, due to their wavefunction overlap, mediate quasiparticle hoppings. By developing a Wannier function approach, we show that these Andreev bound state arrays form an all-superconducting and circuit QED-compatible platform for emulating lattice models of fermionic quasiparticles that are phase- and gate-programmable. Interestingly, we also find that the junction lattices can undergo a topological transition and host fermionic boundary modes that can be probed by conductance measurements. We hope our results will inspire the realization of artificial and possibly topological materials on Andreev bound state quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Molecular heat transport across a time-periodic temperature gradient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The time-periodic modulation of a temperature gradient can alter the heat transport properties of a physical system. Oscillating thermal gradients give rise to behaviors such as modified thermal conductivity and controllable time-delayed energy storage that are not present in a system with static temperatures. Here, we examine how the heat transport properties of a molecular lattice model are affected by an oscillating temperature gradient. We use analytical analysis and molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the vibrational heat flow in a molecular lattice system consisting of a chain of particles connected to two heat baths at different temperatures, where the temperature difference between baths is oscillating in time. We derive expressions for heat currents in this system using a stochastic energetics framework and a nonequilibrium Green's function approach that is modified to treat the nonstationary average energy fluxes. We find that emergent energy storage, energy release, and thermal conductance mechanisms induced by the temperature oscillations can be controlled by varying the frequency, waveform, and amplitude of the oscillating gradient. The developed theoretical approach provides a general framework to describe how vibrational heat transmission through a molecular lattice is affected by temperature gradient oscillations.</description>

      <title>First-principles study on tunnel magnetoresistance effect with Cr-doped RuO$_{2}$ electrode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the functionality of the $\mathrm{Cr}$-doped $\mathrm{RuO_{2}}$ as an electrode of the magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ), motivated by the recent experiment showing that $\mathrm{Cr}$-doping into the rutile-type $\mathrm{RuO_{2}}$ will be an effective tool to control its antiferromagnetic order and the resultant magnetotransport phenomena easily. We perform first-principles calculation of the tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR) effect in the MTJ based on the $\mathrm{Cr}$-doped $\mathrm{RuO_{2}}$ electrodes. We find that a finite TMR effect appears in the MTJ originating from the momentum-dependent spin splitting in the electrodes, which suggests that $\mathrm{RuO_{2}}$ with Cr-doping will work as the electrode of the MTJ. We also show that this TMR effect can be qualitatively captured using the local density of states inside the tunnel barrier.</description>

      <title>Exciton-polariton ring Josephson junction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The macroscopic coherence of quantum fluids enables for the observation of interference effects in their wavefunctions and leads to practical applications based on Josephson tunnelling such as superconductor quantum interference devices. The Josephson effect manifests in both fermionic and bosonic systems and it has been extensively studied in superfluid helium and atomic Bose-Einstein condensates. Exciton-polaritons can facilitate the transition to integrated semiconductor platforms, but realizing weak links in ring geometries has proven to be challenging. Here we realize a Josephson junction in a polariton ring condensate and, leveraging the optical control of the barrier, we impose a net circulation around the ring. Our experiments reveal two distinct regimes of the polariton weak link: a hydrodynamic regime with a linear relation between the phase jump at the barrier and the average current around the ring, and a Josephson regime characterised by a sinusoidal behaviour for which the mass transport through the barrier drops to zero. Our theory in terms of the 'tilted washboard' potential explains the appearance of these regimes from energy considerations using experimental values. These findings show that weak links in ring condensates can be investigated using all-optical configurations and hold potential for exploration even at room temperature.</description>

      <title>Observation of Floquet states in graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in the field of condensed-matter physics have unlocked the potential to realize and control emergent material phases that do not exist in thermal equilibrium. One of the most promising concepts in this regard is Floquet engineering, the coherent dressing of matter via time-periodic perturbations. However, the broad applicability of Floquet engineering to quantum materials is still unclear. For the paradigmatic case of monolayer graphene, the theoretically predicted Floquet-induced effects, despite a seminal report of the light-induced anomalous Hall effect, have been put into question. Here, we overcome this problem by using electronic structure measurements to provide direct experimental evidence of Floquet engineering in graphene. We report light-matter-dressed Dirac bands by measuring the contribution of Floquet sidebands, Volkov sidebands, and their quantum path interference to graphene's photoemission spectral function. Our results finally demonstrate that Floquet engineering in graphene is possible, paving the way for the experimental realization of the many theoretical proposals on Floquet-engineered band structures and topological phases.</description>

      <title>Hall mass and transverse Noether spin currents in noncollinear antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Noncollinear antiferromagnets (AFMs) in the family of Mn$_3X$ ($X$=Ir, Sn, Ge, Pt, etc.) have recently attracted attention in the emerging field of antiferromagnetic spintronics because of their various interesting transport, magnetic, and optical properties. Due to the noncollinear magnetic order, the localized electron spins on different magnetic sublattices are not conserved even when spin-orbit coupling is neglected, making it difficult to understand the transport of spin angular momentum. Here we study the conserved Noether current associated with spin-rotation symmetry of the local spins in noncollinear AFMs. We found that a Hall component of the d.c. spin current can be created by a longitudinal driving force associated with a propagating spin wave, and is proportional to a response coefficient that we denote as the Hall (inverse) mass. Such a Hall spin current can be generated by spin pumping in a ferromagnet (FM)-noncollinear AFM bilayer structure as we demonstrated numerically. Finally we showed that the Hall mass is an isotropic quantity, similar to the isotropic spin Hall conductivity, and should generally exist in noncollinear AFMs and their polycrystals. Our results shed light on the potential of noncollinear AFMs in manipulating the polarization and flow of spin currents in general spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Spin-Wave Self-Imaging: Experimental and Numerical Demonstration of Caustic and Talbot-like Diffraction Patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extending the scope of the self-imaging phenomenon, traditionally associated with linear optics, to the domain of magnonics, this study presents the experimental demonstration and numerical analysis of spin-wave (SW) self-imaging in an in-plane magnetized yttrium iron garnet film. We explore this phenomenon using a setup in which a plane SW passes through a diffraction grating, and the resulting interference pattern is detected using Brillouin light scattering. We have varied the frequencies of the source dynamic magnetic field to discern the influence of the anisotropic dispersion relation and the caustic effect on the analyzed phenomenon. We found that at low frequencies and diffraction fields, the caustics determine the interference pattern. However, at large distances from the grating, when the waves of high diffraction order and number of slits contribute to the interference pattern, the self-imaging phenomenon and Talbot-like patterns are formed. This methodological approach not only sheds light on the behavior of SW interference under different conditions but also enhances our understanding of the SW self-imaging process in both isotropic and anisotropic media.</description>

      <title>Fast current-induced skyrmion motion in synthetic antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic skyrmions are topological magnetic textures that hold great promise as nanoscale bits of information in memory and logic devices. Although room-temperature ferromagnetic skyrmions and their current-induced manipulation have been demonstrated, their velocity has been limited to about 100 meters per second. In addition, their dynamics are perturbed by the skyrmion Hall effect, a motion transverse to the current direction caused by the skyrmion topological charge. Here, we show that skyrmions in compensated synthetic antiferromagnets can be moved by current along the current direction at velocities of up to 900 meters per second. This can be explained by the cancellation of the net topological charge leading to a vanishing skyrmion Hall effect. Our results open an important path toward the realization of logic and memory devices based on the fast manipulation of skyrmions in tracks.</description>

      <title>Tuning exciton emission via ferroelectric polarization at a heterogeneous interface between a monolayer transition metal dichalcogenide and a perovskite oxide membrane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate the integration of a thin BaTiO$_3$ (BTO) membrane with monolayer MoSe$_2$ in a dual gate device that enables in-situ manipulation of the BTO ferroelectric polarization with a voltage pulse. While two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) offer remarkable adaptability, their hybrid integration with other families of functional materials beyond the realm of 2D materials has been challenging. Released functional oxide membranes offer a solution for 2D/3D integration via stacking. 2D TMD excitons can serve as a local probe of the ferroelectric polarization in BTO at a heterogeneous interface. Using photoluminescence (PL) of MoSe$_2$ excitons to optically readout the doping level, we find that the relative population of charge carriers in MoSe$_2$ depends sensitively on the ferroelectric polarization. This finding points to a promising avenue for future-generations versatile sensing devices with high sensitivity, fast read-out, and diverse applicability for advanced signal processing.</description>

      <title>Supercurrent rectification with time-reversal symmetry broken multiband superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider nonreciprocal supercurrent effects in Josephson junctions based on multiband superconductors with a pairing structure that can break time-reversal symmetry. We demonstrate that a nonreciprocal supercurrent can be generally achieved by the cooperation of interband superconducting phase mismatch and interband scattering as well as by multiband phase frustration. The effect of interband impurity scattering indicates that the amplitude and sign of the nonreciprocal supercurrent are sensitive to the interband phase relation. For the case of a three-band superconductor, due to phase frustration, we show that the profile of the supercurrent rectification is marked by a hexagonal pattern of nodal lines with vanishing amplitude. Remarkably, around the nodal lines, the supercurrent rectification amplitude exhibits three-fold structures with an alternating sign. We show that the hexagonal pattern and the three-fold structure in the interband phase space turn out to be dependent on the tunneling amplitude of each band. These findings provide hallmarks of the supercurrent rectification which can be potentially employed to unveil the occurrence of spin-singlet multiband superconductivity with time-reversal symmetry breaking.</description>

      <title>Bloch equations in Terahertz magnetic-resonance ellipsometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A generalized approach derived from Blochs equation of motion of nuclear magnetic moments is presented to model the frequency, magnetic field, spin density, and temperature dependencies in the electromagnetic permeability tensor for materials with magnetic resonances. The resulting tensor model predicts characteristic polarization signatures which can be observed, for example, in fully polarization-resolved Mueller matrix element spectra measured across magnetic resonances as a function of frequency, magnetic field, magnetic moment density, and temperature. When augmented with thermodynamic considerations and suitable Hamiltonian description of the magnetic eigenvalue spectrum, important parameters such as zero-frequency magnetization, spectral amplitude distribution, relaxation time constants, and geometrical orientation parameters of the magnetic moment density can be obtained from comparing the generalized model approach to experimental data. We demonstrate our approach by comparing model calculations with full Mueller matrix element spectra measured at oblique angle of incidence in the terahertz spectral range, across electron spin resonance quintuplet transitions observed in wurtzite-structure GaN doped with iron. Measurements were performed by ellipsometry, using a superconducting cryostat magnet at magnetic fields of 7.23 T and at temperatures of 20 K and 30 K. We detail the occurrence of linear and circular birefringence and dichroism associated with each of the zero-field split spin transitions in the S = 5/2 defect system. We derive the spectral dependence of the magnetic susceptibility function and obtain the temperature and magnetic field dependence of the spin Hamiltonian. Our model correctly predicts the complexity of the polarization signatures observed in the 15 independent elements of the normalized Mueller matrix for both positive and negative magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Circular Photocurrents in Centrosymmetric Semiconductors with Hidden Spin Polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Centrosymmetric materials with site inversion asymmetries possess hidden spin polarization, which remains challenging to be converted into spin currents because the global inversion symmetry is still conserved. This study demonstrates the spin-polarized DC circular photocurrents (CPC) in centrosymmetric transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) at normal incidence without applying electric bias. The global inversion symmetry is broken by using a spatially-varying circularly polarized light beam, which could generate spin gradient owing to the hidden spin polarization. The dependences of CPC on electrode configuration, illumination position, and beam spot size indicate an emergence of circulating electric current under spatially inhomogeneous light, which is associated with the spin-to-charge conversion through the inverse spin Hall effect (ISHE). The CPC is subsequently utilized to probe the spin polarization and ISHE under different excitation wavelengths and temperatures. The results of this study demonstrate the feasibility of using centrosymmetric materials with hidden spin polarization and spin-orbit coupling (SOC) for spintronic device applications.</description>

      <title>Modelling the magnetic properties of 1D arrays of FePc molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the magnetic properties of Fe Phthalocyanines (FePc) that are experimentally arranged in quasi one-dimensional chains when they are grown in thin films or powders. By means of DFT calculations we reproduce the structural parameters found in experiments, and then we build a generalized Heisenberg magnetic model with single ion anisotropy, and calculate its parameters. The results show a anisotropic exchange interaction $J$ between FePc molecules, and an easy plane single ion anisotropy $D$. By means of Monte Carlo simulations, with this model, we found an explanation to the non-saturation of the magnetization found at high fields, which we interpret is due to the anisotropic exchange interaction $J$. Finally, we also investigate the presence of magnetic solitons versus temperature and magnetic field.

      <title>Enhanced controllable triplet proximity effect in superconducting spin-orbit coupled spin valves with modified superconductor/ferromagnet interfaces</title>

Abstract: In a superconductor/ferromagnet hybrid, a magnetically controlled singlet-to-triplet Cooper pair conversion can modulate the superconducting critical temperature. In these triplet superconducting spin valves, such control usually requires inhomogeneous magnetism. However, in the presence of spin-orbit coupling from an interfacial heavy-metal layer, the singlet/triplet conversion rate and thus the critical temperature, can be controlled via the magnetization direction of a single homogeneous ferromagnet. Here, we report significantly enhanced controllable pair conversion to a triplet state in a Nb/Pt/Co/Pt superconducting spin valve in which Pt/Co/Pt is homogeneously magnetized and proximity-coupled to a superconducting layer of Nb. The Co/Pt interface furthest away from Nb is modified by a sub-nanometer-thick layer of Cu or Au. We argue that the enhancement is most likely associated from an improvement of the Co/Pt interface due to the insertion of Cu and Au layers. Additionally, the higher normalized orbital moments in Au measured using X-ray magnetic circular dichroism shows that increasing spin-orbit coupling enhances the triplet proximity effect - an observation supported by our theoretical calculations. Our results provide a pathway to enhancing triplet pair creation by interface engineering for device development in superspintronics.</description>

      <title>Helical Topological Superconducting Pairing at Finite Excitation Energies</title>

Abstract: We propose helical topological superconductivity away from the Fermi surface in three-dimensional time-reversal-symmetric odd-parity multiband superconductors. In these systems, pairing between electrons originating from different bands is responsible for the corresponding topological phase transition. Consequently, a pair of helical topological Dirac surface states emerges at finite excitation energies. These helical Dirac surface states are tunable in energy by chemical potential and strength of band-splitting. They are protected by time-reversal symmetry combined with crystalline two-fold rotation symmetry. We suggest concrete materials in which this phenomenon could be observed.</description>

      <title>Axionic Instability of Periodic Weyl-Semimetal Superstructures</title>

Abstract: Weyl-semimetal superstructures with a spiraling position of a pair of Weyl nodes of opposite chirality can host a chiral-symmetry preserving Fermi-arc metal state, where the chirality is carried by cylindrical Fermi surfaces, electron- and hole-like depending on the chirality. The Fermi surfaces nest at vanishing momentum separation (zero nesting vector) at the electron-hole-compensation energy because the nesting is topologically protected by vanishing spatial overlap of any pair of equal-momentum opposite-chirality states. In this work we show that the nesting and Coulomb interaction drive a spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking in such a Fermi arc metal, which leads to a dynamical axion insulator state but without breaking translational symmetry (no charge-density-wave order) as in a conventional Weyl semimetal. As for material realization, we discuss magnetically doped Bi$_2$Se$_3$, for which the Weyl-node positions depend on the order of the magnetic dopands. In this case, the axionic condensation can itself stabilize a spiral order of the magnetization, and hence the spiraling node positions, even if the magnetic interaction is intrinsically ferromagnetic.</description>

Abstract: Topological quantum materials can exhibit unconventional surface states and anomalous transport properties. Still, their applications in spintronic devices are restricted as they require the growth of high-quality thin films with bulk-like properties. Here, we study 10--30 nm thick epitaxial ferromagnetic Co$_{\rm 2}$MnGa films with high structural order and very high values of the anomalous Hall conductivity, $\sigma_{\rm xy}=1.35\times10^{5}$ $\Omega^{-1} m^{-1}$ and the anomalous Hall angle, $\theta_{\rm H}=15.8\%$, both comparable to bulk values. We observe a dramatic crystalline orientation dependence of the Gilbert damping constant of a factor of two and a giant intrinsic spin Hall conductivity, $\mathit{\sigma_{\rm SHC}}=(6.08\pm 0.02)\times 10^{5}$ ($\hbar/2e$) $\Omega^{-1} m^{-1}$, an order of magnitude higher than literature values of multilayer Co$_{\rm 2}$MnGa stacks [1-3] and single-layer Ni, Co, Fe [4], and Ni$_{\rm 80}$Fe$_{\rm 20}$~[4,5]. As a consequence, spin-orbit-torque driven auto-oscillations of a 30 nm thick magnetic film are observed for the first time, at an ultralow threshold current density of $J_{th}=6.2\times10^{11}$ $Am^{-2}$. Theoretical calculations of the intrinsic spin Hall conductivity, originating from a strong Berry curvature, corroborate the results and yield values comparable to the experiment. Our results open up for the design of spintronic devices based on single layers of magnetic topological quantum materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.09304v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the first-order correction to the anomalous Hall conductivity of 2D massive Dirac fermions arising from electron-electron interactions. In a fully gapped system in the limit of zero temperature, we find that this correction vanishes, confirming the absence of perturbative corrections to the topological Hall conductivity. At finite temperature or chemical potential, we find that the total Hall response decays faster than in the non-interacting case, depending on the strength of electron-electron interactions. These features, which could potentially be observed experimentally, show the importance of two-body interactions for anomalous Hall transport.</description>

Abstract: Long-period moir\'e superlattices at the twisted interface of van der Waals heterostructures relax into preferential-stacking domains separated by dislocation networks. Here, we develop a mesoscale theory for dislocations in the networks formed in twistronic bilayers with parallel (P) and antiparallel (AP) alignment of unit cells across the twisted interface. For P bilayers we find an exact analytical displacement field across partial dislocations and determine analytic dependences of energy per unit length and width on orientation and microscopic model parameters. For AP bilayers we formulate a semi-analytical approximation for displacement fields across perfect dislocations, establishing parametric dependences for their widths and energies per unit length. In addition, we find regions in parametric space of crystal thicknesses and moir\'e periods for strong and weak relaxation of moir\'e pattern in multilayered twistronic heterostructures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09520v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the symmetry requirements for topologically protected spin-polarized Weyl points in 2D altermagnets. The topology is characterized by a quantized $\pi$-Berry phase and the degeneracy is protected by spin-space group symmetries. Gapped phases with finite Chern and/or spin/chirality Chern numbers emerge under different symmetry-breaking mass terms. We investigate the surface and transport properties of these gapped phases using representative electronic tight-binding and magnonic linear spin-wave models. In particular, we calculate the electronic and magnonic Hall currents and discuss implications for experiments.</description>

      <title>Electron-phonon coupling induced topological phase transition in an $\alpha$-$T_{3}$ Haldane-Holstein model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08467v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present impelling evidence of topological phase transitions induced by electron-phonon (e-ph) coupling in an $\alpha$-$T_3$ Haldane-Holstein model that presents smooth tunability between graphene ($\alpha=0$) and a dice lattice $(\alpha=1)$. The e-ph coupling has been incorporated via the Lang-Firsov transformation which adequately captures the polaron physics in the high frequency (anti-adiabatic) regime, and yields an effective Hamiltonian of the system through zero phonon averaging at $T=0$. While exploring the signature of the phase transition driven by polaron and its interplay with the parameter $\alpha$, we identify two regions based on the values of $\alpha$, namely, the low to intermediate range $(0 &lt; \alpha \le 0.6)$ and larger values of $\alpha~(0.6 &lt; \alpha &lt; 1)$ where the topological transitions show distinct behaviour. There exists a single critical e-ph coupling strength for the former, below which the system behaves as a topological insulator characterized by edge modes, finite Chern number, and Hall conductivity, with all of them vanishing above this value, and the system undergoes a spectral gap closing transition. Further, the critical coupling strength depends upon $\alpha$. For the latter case $(0.6 &lt; \alpha &lt; 1)$, the scenario is more interesting where there are two critical values of the e-ph coupling at which trivial-topological-trivial and topological-topological-trivial phase transitions occur for $\alpha$ in the range $[0.6:1]$. Our studies on e-ph coupling induced phase transitions show a significant difference with regard to the well-known unique transition occurring at $\alpha = 0.5$ (or at $0.7$) in the absence of the e-ph coupling, and thus underscore the importance of interaction effects on the topological phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Vortexability: A Unifying Criterion for Ideal Fractional Chern Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.15023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.15023v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fractional Chern insulators realize the remarkable physics of the fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) in crystalline systems with Chern bands. The lowest Landau level (LLL) is known to host the FQHE, but not all Chern bands are suitable for realizing fractional Chern insulators (FCI). Previous approaches to stabilizing FCIs focused on mimicking the LLL through momentum space criteria. Here instead we take a real-space perspective by introducing the notion of vortexability. Vortexable Chern bands admit a fixed operator that introduces vortices into any band wavefunction while keeping the state entirely within the same band. Vortexable bands admit trial wavefunctions for FCI states, akin to Laughlin states. In the absence of dispersion and for sufficiently short ranged interactions, these FCI states are the ground state -- independent of the distribution of Berry curvature. Vortexable bands are much more general than the LLL, and we showcase a recipe for constructing them. We exhibit diverse examples in graphene-based systems with or without magnetic field, and with any Chern number. A special class of vortexable bands is shown to be equivalent to the momentum space "trace condition" or "ideal band condition". In addition, we also identify a more general form of vortexability that goes beyond this criterion. We introduce a modified measure that quantifies deviations from general vortexability which can be applied to generic Chern bands to identify promising FCI platforms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.09326v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Kondo effect describes the scattering of conduction electrons by magnetic impurities, manifesting as an electronic resonance at the Fermi energy with a distinctive temperature evolution. In this letter, we present a critical evaluation of the current methodology employed to demonstrate Kondo behavior in transport measurements, underscoring the limitations of established theoretical frameworks and the influence of extrinsic broadening. We introduce a novel approach for analyzing spectroscopic indicators of the Kondo effect, employing the Hurwitz-Fano lineshape as a model for the Kondo resonance in the presence of extrinsic broadening. Through precise scanning tunneling spectroscopy measurements on an exemplary spin-1/2 Kondo system, phenalenyl on Au(111), we demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed protocol in extracting accurate intrinsic Kondo linewidths from finite-temperature measurements. The extracted linewidths exhibit a robust fit with a recently derived expression for the temperature-dependent intrinsic Kondo linewidth, providing compelling evidence for the validity of the underlying theory.</description>
