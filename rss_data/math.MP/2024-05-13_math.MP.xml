      <title>Integrability-preserving regularizations of Laplacian Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Laplacian Growth (LG) model is known as a universality class of scale-free aggregation models in two dimensions, characterized by classical integrability and featuring finite-time boundary singularity formation. A discrete counterpart, Diffusion-Limited Aggregation (or DLA), has a similar local growth law, but significantly different global behavior. For both LG and DLA, a proper description for the scaling properties of long-time solutions is not available yet. In this note, we outline a possible approach towards finding the correct theory yielding a regularized LG and its relation to DLA.</description>

      <title>Projective connections and extremal domains for analytic content</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This note expands on the recent proof \cite{ABKT} that the extremal domains for analytic content in two dimensions can only be disks and annuli. This result's unexpected implication for theoretical physics is that, for extremal domains, the analytic content is a measure of non-commutativity of the (multiplicative) adjoint operators $T, T^{\dag}$, where $T^{\dag} = \bar z$, and therefore of the quantum deformation parameter (``Planck's constant"). The annular solution (which includes the disk as a special case) is, in fact, a continuous family of solutions, corresponding to all possible positive values of the deformation parameter, consistent with the physical requirement that conformal invariance in two dimensions forbids the existence of a special length scale.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum walk is a quantum counterpart of the classical random walk. On the other hand, absolute zeta functions can be considered as zeta functions over $\mathbb{F}_1$. This study presents a connection between quantum walks and absolute zeta functions. In this paper, we focus on Hadamard walks and $3$-state Grover walks on cycle graphs. The Hadamard walks and the Grover walks are typical models of the quantum walks. We consider the periods and zeta functions of such quantum walks. Moreover, we derive the explicit forms of the absolute zeta functions of corresponding zeta functions. Also, it is shown that our zeta functions of quantum walks are absolute automorphic forms.</description>

      <title>Transmitted resonance in a coupled system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05997v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When two systems are coupled, one can play the role of the driver, and the other can be the driven or response system. In this scenario, the driver system can behave as an external forcing. Thus, we study its interaction when a periodic forcing drives the driver system. In the analysis a new phenomenon shows up: when the driver system is forced by a periodic forcing, it can suffer a resonance and this resonance can be transmitted through the coupling mechanism to the driven system. Moreover, in some cases the enhanced oscillations amplitude can also interplay with a previous resonance already acting in the driven system dynamics.</description>

      <title>Excited Abelian-Higgs vortices: decay rate and radiation emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The evolution of 1-vortices when their massive bound mode is excited is investigated in detail (both analytically and numerically) in the Abelian-Higgs model for different ranges of the self-coupling constant. The dependence of the spectrum of the 1-vortex fluctuation operator on the model parameter is discussed initially. A perturbative approach is employed to study the radiation emission in both the scalar and the vector channels. Our findings reveal that the oscillating initial configuration of the 1-vortex radiates at a frequency twice that of the internal mode. Through energy conservation considerations, we derive the decay law of the massive mode. Finally, these analytical results are compared with numerical simulations in field theory.</description>

      <title>Active nematic fluids on Riemannian 2-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in cell biology and experimental techniques using reconstituted cell extracts have generated significant interest in understanding how geometry and topology influence active fluid dynamics. In this work, we present a comprehensive continuous theory and computational method to explore the dynamics of active nematic fluids on arbitrary surfaces without topological constraints. The fluid velocity and nematic order parameter are represented as the sections of the complex line bundle of a 2-manifold. We introduce the Levi-Civita connection and surface curvature form within the framework of complex line bundles. By adopting this geometric approach, we introduce a gauge-invariant discretization method that preserves the continuous local-to-global theorems in differential geometry. We establish a nematic Laplacian on complex functions that can accommodate fractional topological charges through the covariant derivative on the complex nematic representation. We formulate advection of the nematic field based on a unifying definition of the Lie derivative, resulting in a stable geometric semi-Lagrangian discretization scheme for transport by the flow. In general, the proposed surface-based method offers an efficient and stable means to investigate the influence of local curvature and global topology on the 2D hydrodynamics of active nematic systems. Moreover, the complex line representation of the nematic field and the unifying Lie advection present a systematic approach for generalizing our method to active $k$-atic systems.</description>

      <title>Exact solution for heat transfer across the Sakiadis boundary layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of convective heat transfer across the laminar boundary-layer induced by an isothermal moving surface in a Newtonian fluid. In previous work (Barlow, Reinberger, and Weinstein, 2024, \textit{Physics of Fluids}, \textbf{36} (031703), 1-3) an exact power series solution was provided for the hydrodynamic flow, often referred to as the Sakiadis boundary layer. Here, we utilize this expression to develop an exact solution for the associated thermal boundary layer as characterized by the Prandtl number ($\Pr$) and local Reynolds number along the surface. To extract the location-dependent heat-transfer coefficient (expressed in dimensionless form as the Nusselt number), the dimensionless temperature gradient at the wall is required; this gradient is solely a function of $\Pr$, and is expressed as an integral of the exact boundary layer flow solution. We find that the exact solution for the temperature gradient is computationally unstable at large $\Pr$, and a large $\Pr$ expansion for the temperature gradient is obtained using Laplace's method. A composite solution is obtained that is accurate to $O(10^{-10})$. Although divergent, the classical power series solution for the Sakiadis boundary layer -- expanded about the wall -- may be used to obtain all higher-order corrections in the asymptotic expansion. We show that this result is connected to the physics of large Prandtl number flows where the thickness of the hydrodynamic boundary layer is much larger than that of the thermal boundary layer. The present model is valid for all Prandtl numbers and attractive for ease of use.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the asymptotics of matrix elements in canonical bases of irreducible representations of the unitary group as the highest weight goes to infinity, in terms of the symplectic geometry of the associated coadjoint orbit. This uses tools of Berezin-Toeplitz quantization, and recovers as a special case the asymptotics of Wigner's d-matrix elements for the spin representations in quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Learning PDEs from data on closed surfaces with sparse optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of underlying surface partial differential equation (PDE) from observational data has significant implications across various fields, bridging the gap between theory and observation, enhancing our understanding of complex systems, and providing valuable tools and insights for applications. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, termed physical-informed sparse optimization (PIS), for learning surface PDEs. Our approach incorporates both $L_2$ physical-informed model loss and $L_1$ regularization penalty terms in the loss function, enabling the identification of specific physical terms within the surface PDEs. The unknown function and the differential operators on surfaces are approximated by some extrinsic meshless methods. We provide practical demonstrations of the algorithms including linear and nonlinear systems. The numerical experiments on spheres and various other surfaces demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in simultaneously achieving precise solution prediction and identification of unknown PDEs.</description>

      <title>Local topology and perestroikas in protein structure and folding dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Methods of local topology are introduced to the field of protein physics. This is achieved by explaining how the folding and unfolding processes of a globular protein alter the local topology of the protein's C-alpha backbone through conformational bifurcations. The mathematical formulation builds on the concept of Arnol'd's perestroikas, by extending it to piecewise linear chains using the discrete Frenet frame formalism. In the low-temperature folded phase, the backbone geometry generalizes the concept of a Peano curve, with its modular building blocks modeled by soliton solutions of a discretized nonlinear Schroedinger equation. The onset of thermal unfolding begins when perestroikas change the flattening and branch points that determine the centers of solitons. When temperature increases, the perestroikas cascade, which leads to a progressive disintegration of the modular structures. The folding and unfolding processes are quantitatively characterized by a correlation function that describes the evolution of perestroikas under temperature changes. The approach provides a comprehensive framework for understanding the Physics of protein folding and unfolding transitions, contributing to the broader field of protein structure and dynamics.</description>

Abstract: We study the time evolution of an incompressible fluid with axial symmetry without swirl when the vorticity is sharply concentrated on $N$ annuli of radii of the order of $r_0$ and thickness $\varepsilon$. We prove that when $r_0= |\log \varepsilon|^\alpha$, $\alpha&gt;1$, the vorticity field of the fluid converges for $\varepsilon \to 0$ to the point vortex model, in an interval of time which diverges as $\log|\log\varepsilon|$. This generalizes previous result by Cavallaro and Marchioro in [J. Math. Phys. 62, 053102, (2021)], that assumed $\alpha&gt;2$ and in which the convergence was proved for short times only.</description>

Abstract: We consider classical steady water waves with a free surface, a flat bottom and constant vorticity $\gamma$. In the adverse case $\gamma&gt;0$ we prove that there is an absolute upper bound on the amplitude, independent of the physical constants, provided that $\gamma$ is sufficiently small. In any favorable case $\gamma\leq0$ we present a new proof of such an absolute bound on the amplitude and prove that the amplitude tends to zero as $\gamma$ tends to negative infinity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2005.12581v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study large deviations for a Markov process on curves in $\mathbb{Z}^2$ mimicking the motion of an interface. Our dynamics can be tuned with a parameter $\beta$, which plays the role of an inverse temperature, and coincides at $\beta$ = $\infty$ with the zero-temperature Ising model with Glauber dynamics, where curves correspond to the boundaries of droplets of one phase immersed in a sea of the other one. We prove that contours typically follow a motion by curvature with an influence of the parameter $\beta$, and establish large deviations bounds at all large enough $\beta$ &lt; $\infty$. The diffusion coefficient and mobility of the model are identified and correspond to those predicted in the literature.</description>

Abstract: Let $\Sigma_{g}$ be a closed surface of genus $g\geq 2$ and $\Gamma_{g}$ denote the fundamental group of $\Sigma_{g}$. We establish a generalization of Voiculescu's theorem on the asymptotic $*$-freeness of Haar unitary matrices from free groups to $\Gamma_{g}$. We prove that for a random representation of $\Gamma_{g}$ into $\mathsf{SU}(n)$, with law given by the volume form arising from the Atiyah-Bott-Goldman symplectic form on moduli space, the expected value of the trace of a fixed non-identity element of $\Gamma_{g}$ is bounded as $n\to\infty$. The proof involves an interplay between Dehn's work on the word problem in $\Gamma_{g}$ and classical invariant theory.</description>

      <title>On the uniqueness of the planar 5-body central configuration with a trapezoidal convex hull</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.01376v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To apply Morse's critical point theory, we use mutual distances as coordinates to discuss a kind of central configuration of the planar Newtonian 5-body problem with a trapezoidal convex hull, i.e., four of the five bodies are located at the vertices of a trapezoid, and the fifth one is located on one of the parallel sides. We show that there is at most one central configuration of this geometrical shape for a given cyclic order of the five bodies along the convex hull.</description>

      <title>Generation of Kochen-Specker contextual sets in higher dimensions by dimensional upscaling whose complexity does not scale with dimension and their applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.08267v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, handling of contextual sets, in particular Kochen-Specker (KS) sets, in higher dimensions has been given an increasing attention, both theoretically and experimentally. However, methods of their generation are diverse, not generally applicable in every dimension, and of exponential complexity. Therefore, we design a dimensional upscaling method, whose complexity does not scale with dimension. As a proof of principle we generate manageable-sized KS master sets in up to 27 dimensional spaces and show that well over 32 dimensions can be reached. From these master sets we obtain an ample number of smaller KS sets. We discuss three kinds of applications that work with KS sets in higher dimensions. We anticipate other applications of KS sets for quantum information processing that make use of large families of nonisomorphic KS sets.</description>

      <title>Onsager-Machlup functional for $\text{SLE}_{\kappa}$ loop measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.00209v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We relate two ways to renormalize the Brownian loop measure on the Riemann sphere. One by considering the Brownian loop measure on the sphere minus a small disk, known as the normalized Brownian loop measure; the other by taking the measure on simple loops induced by the outer boundary of the Brownian loops, known as Werner's measure. This result allows us to interpret the Loewner energy as an Onsager--Machlup functional for SLE$_\kappa$ loop measure for any fixed $\kappa \in (0, 4]$, and more generally, for any Malliavin--Kontsevich--Suhov loop measure of the same central charge.</description>

      <title>On a class of fusion 2-category symmetry: condensation completion of braided fusion category</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15947v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, many studies are focused on generalized global symmetry, a mixture of both invertible and non-invertible symmetries in various space-time dimensions. The complete structure of generalized global symmetry is described by higher fusion category theory. In this paper, We first review the construction of fusion 2-category symmetry $\Sigma \cal B$ where $\cal B$ is a a braided fusion category. In particular, we elaborate on the monoidal structure of $\Sigma \cal B$ which determines fusion rules and controls the dynamics of topological operators/defects. We then take $\Sigma \mathrm{sVec}$ as an example to demonstrate how we calculate fusion rule, quantum dimension and 10j-symbol of the fusion 2-category. With our algorithm, all these data can be efficiently encoded and computed in computer program. The complete program will be uploaded to github soon. Our work can be thought as explicitly computing the representation theory of $\cal B$, in analogy to, for example the representation theory of $SU(2)$. The choice of basis bimodule maps are in analogy to the Clebsch-Gordon coefficients and the 10j-symbol are in analogy to the 6j-symbol.</description>

      <title>Macroscopic Irreversibility in Quantum Systems: ETH and Equilibration in a Free Fermion Chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15263v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a free fermion chain with uniform nearest-neighbor hopping and let it evolve from an arbitrary initial state with a fixed macroscopic number of particles. We then prove that, at a sufficiently large and typical time, the measured coarse-grained density distribution is almost uniform with (quantum mechanical) probability extremely close to one. This establishes the emergence of irreversible behavior, i.e., a ballistic diffusion, in a system governed by quantum mechanical unitary time evolution. It is conceptually important that irreversibility is proved here without introducing any randomness to the initial state or the Hamiltonian, while the derivation of irreversibility in classical systems mostly relies on certain randomness. The essential new ingredient in the proof is the justification of the strong ETH (energy eigenstate thermalization hypothesis) in the large-deviation form.</description>

      <title>Modified version of open TASEP with dynamic defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04956v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a modification to the study of site-wise dynamically disordered totally asymmetric simple exclusion process (TASEP). Motivated by the process of gene transcription, a study in ref. \cite{waclaw2019totally} introduced an extension of TASEP, where the defects (or obstacles) bind/un-bind dynamically to the sites of the lattice and the hopping of the particles on lattice faces a hindrance if the arrival site is occupied by an obstacle. In addition, the particle is only allowed to enter the lattice provided the first site is defect-free. In our study, we propose that the particle movement at the entry of the lattice must face an equal hindrance that is provided by the obstacles to the rest of the particles on the lattice. For open boundaries, the continuum mean-field equations are derived and solved numerically to obtain steady-state phase diagrams and density profiles. The presence of obstacles produces a shift in the phase boundaries obtained but the same three phases as obtained for the standard TASEP. Contrary to the model introduced in ref. \cite{waclaw2019totally}, the idea to introduce the modification at the entrance shows that the limiting case $p_d \rightarrow 1$ converges to the standard TASEP, where $p_d$ refers to the affected hopping rate due to presence of obstacle. The mean-field solutions are validated using extensive Monte Carlo simulations.</description>
