      <title>A Mega-FPS low light camera</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: From biology and astronomy to quantum optics, there is a critical need for high frame rate, high quantum efficiency imaging. In practice, most cameras only satisfy one of these requirements. Here we introduce interlaced fast kinetics imaging, a technique that allows burst video acquisition at frame rates up to 3.33 Mfps using a commercial EMCCD camera with single-photon sensitivity. This approach leverages EMCCD's intrinsic fast row transfer dynamics by introducing a tilted lens array into the imaging path, creating a spatially distributed grid of exposed pixels, each aligned to its own column of the sensor. The remaining unexposed pixels serve as in-situ storage registers, allowing subsequent frames to be captured after just one row shift operation. Our interlaced fast kinetics camera maintains 50% contrast for square wave intensity modulation frequencies up to 1.61 MHz. We provide benchmarks of the video performance by capturing two dimensional videos of spatially evolving patterns that repeat every 2$\mu$s, with spatial resolution of 11$\times$15 pixels. Our approach is compatible with commercial EMCCDs and opens a new route to ultra-fast imaging at single-photon sensitivity with applications from fast fluorescence imaging to photon correlation measurement.</description>

      <title>Improved absolute frequency measurement of $^{171}$Yb at NMIJ with uncertainty below $2\times10^{-16}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report improved absolute frequency measurement of the $^{1}$S$_{0}-^{3}$P$_{0}$ transition of $^{171}$Yb at National Metrology Institute of Japan (NMIJ) by comparing the $^{171}$Yb optical lattice clock NMIJ-Yb1 with 13 Cs primary frequency standards via International Atomic Time from August 2021 to May 2023. The measured absolute frequency is 518 295 836 590 863.62(10) Hz with a fractional uncertainty of $1.9\times10^{-16}$, in good agreement with the recommended frequency of $^{171}$Yb as a secondary representation of the second. This uncertainty is 2.6 times lower than our previous measurement uncertainty, and slightly lower than any uncertainties of the absolute frequency measurements of $^{171}$Yb that have so far been reported by other institutes. We also estimate correlation coefficients between our present and previous measurements, which is important for updating the recommended frequency.</description>

      <title>Excited-state magnetic properties of carbon-like $\text{Ca}^{14+}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We measured the $g$-factor of the excited state $^3\text{P}_1$ in $\text{Ca}^{14+}$ ion to be $g = 1.499032(6)$ with a relative uncertainty of $4\times10^{-6}$. The magnetic field magnitude is derived from the Zeeman splitting of a $\text{Be}^+$ ion, co-trapped in the same linear Paul trap as the highly charged $\text{Ca}^{14+}$ ion. Furthermore, we experimentally determined the second-order Zeeman coefficient $C_2$ of the $^3\text{P}_0$ - $^3\text{P}_1$ clock transition. For the $m_J=0\rightarrow m_{J'}=0$ transition, we obtain $C_2 = 0.39\pm0.04\text{HzmT}^{-2}$, which is to our knowledge the smallest reported for any atomic transition to date. This confirms the predicted low sensitivity of highly charged ions to higher-order Zeeman effects, making them ideal candidates for high-precision optical clocks. Comparison of the experimental results with our state-of-the art electronic structure calculations shows good agreement, and demonstrates the significance of the frequency-dependent Breit contribution, negative energy states and QED effects on magnetic moments.</description>

      <title>Novel approach for non-invasive phase-sensitive 2D imaging of biological objects with photovoltaic trapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel non-invasive microscopy technique for imaging and sizing of folded DNA molecules with the use of photovoltaic tweezers and phase-sensitive detection is elaborated and realized. This novel method is compared with the state-of-the-art method of visualization of DNA molecules by fluorescent microscopy technique which requires the labeling of the DNA by dye molecules. The advantage of the novel method is no requirement for the incubation of DNA with a fluorescent label, as well as the simultaneous observation of the light-induced inside the crystal refractive lattice (i.e. photovoltaic field configuration) and the trapped micro-objects by the phase-contrast method. The suggested novel method provides the accurate measurement of the size and shape of the folded DNA molecules as well as the determination of the charged or neutral nature of the trapped bio-objects by their disposition relative to the lattice fringes. We demonstrate that the labeling of DNA causes an overestimation of the molecular size. The method can be extended to the other bio-objects. The high-performance photovoltaic tweezers operating in an autonomous regime as lab-on-a-chip devices are promising for applications in integrated optics, microscopy, micro- and nanoelectronics, and biotechnology.</description>

      <title>Phase evolution of strong-field ionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the time-dependent evolution of the dipole phase shift induced by strong-field ionization (SFI) using attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy (ATAS) for time-delays where the pump-probe pulses overlap. We study measured and calculated time-dependent ATA spectra of the ionic 4d-5p transition in xenon, and present the time-dependent line shape parameters in the complex plane. We attribute the complex, attosecond-scale dynamics to the contribution of three distinct processes: accumulation of ionization, transient population, and reversible population of excited states arising from polarization of the ground state.</description>

      <title>Formation of Complex Discrete Time Crystals with Ultracold Atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study discrete time crystal formation in a system driven periodically by an oscillating atomic mirror, consisting of two distinct ultracold atomic clouds in the presence of a gravitational field. The intra-species interactions are weak and attractive, while the inter-species interactions are infinitely strong and repulsive. The clouds are arranged in a one-dimensional stack, where the bottom cloud bounces on an oscillating atomic mirror, which effectively acts as a driving force for the upper cloud due to the infinite inter-species repulsion. Using a Jastrow-like variational ansatz for the many-body wavefunction, we show that sufficiently strong attractive intra-species interactions drive each subsystem to spontaneously break discrete time translation symmetry, resulting in the formation of a complex discrete time crystal evolving with a period different than the driving period. Since the bottom cloud serves as the effective periodic driving for the upper cloud, this leads to a cascade of spontaneous symmetry breaking. With increasing intra-species interactions, we first observe a pronounced effect of spontaneous time translation symmetry breaking in the upper cloud, followed by a similar effect in the lower atomic cloud.</description>

      <title>Enantiosensitive positions of exceptional points in open chiral systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exceptional points are remarkable features of open quantum systems, such as photo-ionizing or photo-dissociating molecules, amplified or dissipated light states in photonic structures, and many others. These points mark spectral degeneracies in a system's parameter space where the eigenstates become non-orthogonal, enabling precise control over decay rates, topological transitions in parity-time (PT)-symmetric systems, or boosting the system's sensitivity to external stimuli. Here we show that exceptional points can be enantiosenstive, enabling a new type of control over topological and chiral properties of non-Hermitian open chiral systems. We apply the concept of enantio-sensitive exceptional points to demonstrate a broad range of phenomena, from enantiosensitive topological population transfer, to lifetime branching in resonant photo-decay of chiral molecules, to enhanced chiral sensing in optical fibers. Our results combine high enantiosensitivity with topological robustness in chiral discrimination and separation, paving the way for new approaches in the control of non-Hermitian and chiral phenomena.</description>

      <title>Strong-Field-Assisted X-ray Second Harmonic Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10211v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically demonstrate x-ray second harmonic generation (SHG) with strong-field-driven high harmonic generation (HHG) from core electrons in gas-phase atoms, highlighting its potential as a powerful spectroscopic tool for studying atomic and molecular systems. Our simulations confirm the generation of HHG with x-ray SHG (HHG-XSHG) from atomic core electrons through the rescattering of electrons from x-ray two-photon excitation and subsequent tunneling ionization in an optical laser field. The resulting HHG-XSHG spectrum features a broadband multi-peak structure and a distinct spectral cutoff in the x-ray regime. These findings indicate that HHG-XSHG is a valuable technique for probing core-electron dynamics, generating attosecond x-ray pulses, and exploring nonlinear interactions, effectively merging laser-driven attosecond technology with nonlinear x-ray methodologies provided by x-ray free-electron lasers.</description>

      <title>Non-Gaussian generalized two-mode squeezing: applications to two-ensemble spin squeezing and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00721v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bosonic two-mode squeezed states are paradigmatic entangled Gaussian states that have wide utility in quantum information and metrology. Here, we show that the basic structure of these states can be generalized to arbitrary bipartite quantum systems in a manner that allows simultaneous, Heisenberg-limited estimation of two independent parameters for finite-dimensional systems. Further, we show that these general states can always be stabilized by a relatively simple Markovian dissipative process. In the specific case where the two subsystems are ensembles of two-level atoms or spins, our generalized states define a notion of two-mode spin squeezing that is valid beyond the Gaussian limit and that enables true multi-parameter estimation. We discuss how generalized Ramsey measurements allow one to reach the two-parameter quantum Cramer-Rao bound, and how the dissipative preparation scheme is compatible with current experiments.</description>

      <title>Group Conductivity and Nonadiabatic Born Effective Charges of Disordered Metals, Warm Dense Matter, and Hot Dense Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16230v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The average ionization state is a critical parameter in plasma models for charged particle transport, equation of state, and optical response. The dynamical or nonadiabatic Born effective charge (NBEC), calculated via first principles time-dependent density functional theory, provides exact ionic partitioning of bulk electron response for both metallic and insulating materials. The NBEC can be trivially transformed into a ''group conductivity," that is, the electron conductivity ascribed to a subset of ions. We show that for disordered metallic systems, such as warm dense matter (WDM) and hot dense plasma, the static limit of the NBEC is different from the average ionization state, but that the ionization state can be extracted from the group conductivity even in mixed systems. We demonstrate this approach using a set of archetypical examples, including cold and warm aluminium, low- and high- density WDM carbon, and a WDM carbon-beryllium-hydrogen mixture.</description>

      <title>Simulating quantum emitters in arbitrary photonic environments using FDTD: beyond the semi-classical regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16118v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a numerical algorithm that integrates quantum two-level systems (TLSs) into the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) framework for simulating quantum emitters in arbitrary 3D photonic environments. Conventional methods struggle with these systems due to their semi-classical nature and spurious self-interactions that arise when a TLS is driven by its own radiation field. We address these issues by determining the correct electric field for driving the TLS, as well as the current source used in FDTD for modeling photon emission. Our method, focusing on single-excitation states, employs a total field-incident field (TF-IF) technique to eliminate self-interactions, enabling precise simulations of photon emission and scattering. The algorithm also successfully models complex phenomena such as resonant energy transfer, superradiance, and vacuum Rabi splitting. This powerful computational tool is expected to substantially advance research in nanophotonics, quantum physics, and beyond.</description>

      <title>Compact 780 nm Rb Optical Clock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01826v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrated a compact 780 nm rubidium optical clock, which includes an optical frequency standard and an optical frequency comb, with an optical volume of 11.6 liters. Unlike the 778 nm rubidium atomic clocks based on two-photon transition, here, the laser frequency is stabilized to the Rb D2 transition, using modulation transfer spectroscopy. This approach effectively eliminates Doppler background and provides a high signal to noise ratio and high sensitivity. A nearly 300 MHz microwave signal, whose phase exactly tracks that of the optical frequency standard, is generated via the optical frequency comb, yielding a frequency instability of 1.91 E-13 @1 s and 5.29 E-14 @1000 s in the electronic domain. To the best of our knowledge, this is the most precise frequency stabilization result for the first-excited-state transition of alkali metal atoms to date and represents the first optical clock based on this transition. These results offer a promising approach for the development of portable optical clocks.</description>

      <title>Low-dispersive phase-modulated rapid scanning interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17256v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time-domain interferometry is an important principle in Fourier transform (FT) and nonlinear femto- to attosecond spectroscopy. To optimize the resolution and sensitivity of this approach, various interferometer stabilization schemes have been developed. Among them, acousto-optical phase modulation (AOPM) of the interferometer arms combined with phase-synchronous lock-in detection has proven as a particular sensitive technique. However, the acousto-optical modulators (AOMs), required for this technique, introduce several disadvantages. Here, we demonstrate an alternative phase modulation scheme which omits AOMs, termed PM scheme here. As a benchmark, we directly compare the performance between the PM and the AOPM scheme in a linear FT spectroscopy experiment and find comparable sensitivity in both approaches.</description>
