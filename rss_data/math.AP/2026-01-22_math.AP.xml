      <title>A simple proof of the Uniqueness of blow-up solutions of mean field equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a regular mean field equation defined on a compact Riemann surface, an important work of Bartolucci-Jevnikar-Lee-Yang \cite{bart-4} proved a uniqueness theorem for blow-up solutions under non-degeneracy assumptions. However, the proof is highly nontrivial and challenging to read. In this article, we not only provide a simple proof for the regular equation but also extend our proof to the case of singular equations with negative singular poles. Our proof supplements what is not written in a recent outstanding work by Bartolucci-Yang-Zhang \cite{byz-1}.</description>

      <title>The stochastic nonlocal Cahn-Hilliard equation with regular potential and multiplicative noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we deal with the stochastic counterpart of the nonlocal Cahn-Hilliard equation with regular potential in a smooth bounded two- or three-dimensional domain. The problem is endowed with homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions and random initial data. Furthermore, the system is driven by cylindrical noise of multiplicative type. For the resulting system, we are able to show the existence of probabilistically-weak (or martingale) solutions in two and three dimensions, that are unique and probabilistically-strong under suitable assumptions on the stochastic diffusion. Moreover, we investigate the nonlocal-to-local asymptotics toward solutions of the local stochastic Cahn-Hilliard equations, establishing, under regularity conditions, a precise rate of convergence as well.</description>

      <title>p-Wasserstein distances on networks and 3D to 1D convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study transport distances on metric graphs representing gas networks. Starting from the dynamic formulation of the Wasserstein distance, we review extensions to networks, with and without the possibility of storing mass on the vertices.
  Next, we examine the asymptotic behavior of the static Wasserstein distance on a three-dimensional network domain that converges to a metric graph. We show convergence of the distance with a proof that is based on the characterization of optimal transport plans as $c$-cyclically monotone sets.
  We conclude by illustrating our finding with several numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Sharp macroscopic blow-up behavior for the parabolic-elliptic Keller-Segel system in dimensions $n\ge 3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the space-time concentration or blow-up asymptotics of radially decreasing solutions of the parabolic-elliptic Keller-Segel system in the whole space or in a ball. We show that, for any solution in dimensions $3\le n\le 9$ (assuming finite mass in the whole space case), there exists a nonflat backward self-similar solution $U$ such that $$u(x,t)=(1+o(1))U(x,t),\quad\hbox{as $(x,t)\to (0,T)$.}$$ This macroscopic behavior is important from the physical point of view, since it gives a sharp description of the concentration phenomenon in the scale of the original space-time variables~$(x,t)$. It strongly improves on existing results, since such behavior was previously known (\cite{GMS}) to hold only in the microscopic scale $|x|\le O(\sqrt{T-t})$ as $t\to T$ (and in the whole space case only). As a consequence, we obtain the two-sided global estimate $$C_1\le (T-t+|x|^2)u(x,t)\le C_2\quad\hbox{in $B_R\times(T/2,T)$},$$ whose upper part only was known before (\cite{Soup-Win}), as well as the sharp final profile: $$\lim_{x\to 0} |x|^2u(x,T)=L\in(0,\infty).$$ The latter improves, with a different proof, the recent result of \cite{BZ} by excluding the possibility $L=0$. We also give extensions of these results, in higher dimensions, to type~I and to time monotone solutions. Moreover, we extend the known results on type I estimates and on convergence in similarity variables, and significantly simplify their proofs.</description>

      <title>Global solution curves in harmonic parameters, and multiplicity of solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: \[ \Delta u+g(u)=f(x) \s \mbox{for $x \in \Omega$}, \s u=0 \s \mbox{on $\partial \Omega$} \] decompose $f(x)=\mu _1 \p _1+e(x)$, where $\p _1$ is the principal eigenfunction of the Laplacian with zero boundary conditions, and $e(x) \perp \p _1$ in $L^2(\Omega)$, and similarly write $u(x)= \xi _1 \p _i+U (x)$, with $ U \perp \p _1$ in $L^2(\Omega)$. We study properties of the solution curve $(u(x),\mu _1)(\xi _1)$, and in particular its section $\mu _1=\mu _1(\xi _1)$, which governs the multiplicity of solutions. We consider both general nonlinearities, and some important classes of equations, and obtain detailed description of solution curves under the assumption $g'(u)&lt;\la _2$. We obtain particularly detailed results in case of one dimension. This approach is well suited for numerical computations, which we perform to illustrate our results.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness of Ground State Solutions for a Defocusing Hartree Equation via Inverse Optimal Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a generalized defocusing Hartree equation with nonlocal exchange potential and repulsive Hartree--Fock interaction. Using an inverse optimal problem (IOP) approach, we prove the existence and uniqueness of ground state solutions. Additionally, we establish the existence of principal solutions, their continuous dependence on parameters, and a dual variational formulation. The IOP method provides a systematic framework for addressing inverse problems in nonlocal Schr\"{o}dinger operators and offers new insights into the structure of solutions for defocusing Hartree-type equations.</description>

      <title>Nontrivial integrable weak stationary solutions to active scalar equations with non-odd drift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we construct nontrivial weak solutions to a class of stationary active scalar equations with a non-odd nonlocal operator in the drift term using a convex integration scheme. We show our solutions lie in $$ \bigcap_{0 &lt; \epsilon &lt; 1} \dot{B}^{-\epsilon}_{\infty,\infty}(\mathbb{T}^d) \cap L^{2-\epsilon}(\mathbb{T}^d) $$ for $d \geq 2$. The key ingredient of the construction is the use of highly oscillatory corrections with a variable degree of intermittency, which is arranged to decrease to zero at higher stages of the iteration procedure.</description>

      <title>Multiple standing waves of Helmholtz equation with mixed dispersion concentrating in the high frequency limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the nonlinear Helmholtz equation with mixed dispersion \begin{equation*}
  \Delta^2 u-\beta k^2\, \Delta u+\alpha k^4 u=W(x)\, |u|^{p-2}u~\text{in}~\mathbb{R}^N, \end{equation*} where the weight function $W(x)$ is continuous, nonnegative, and satisfies \[ \limsup_{|x|\to\infty} W(x) \;&lt;\; \sup_{x\in\mathbb{R}^N} W(x). \] Within each of the following parameter ranges, \begin{center}
  (a) $\alpha&lt;0$, $\beta\in\mathbb{R}$; \qquad (b) $\alpha&gt;0$, $\beta&lt;-2\sqrt{\alpha}$; \qquad (c) $\alpha=0$, $\beta&lt;0$, \end{center} After a suitable rescaling, we obtain the existence of dual ground state solutions, which concentrate along the global maximizers of $W$ as $k\to\infty$. In addition, we establish the existence of multiple solutions associated with the set of global maximum points of $W$, and we further characterize the precise concentration behavior of these solutions.</description>

      <title>Integrating the probe and singular sources methods: IV. IPS function for the Schr\"odinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integrated theory of the probe and singular sources methods (IPS) is developed for an inverse obstacle problem governed by the stationary Schr\"odinger equation in a bounded domain. The unknown obstacles are penetrable, and their surface is modeled by a part of the support of the potential in the governing equation. The main results concern an analytical detection method for these obstacles from the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map. They consist of three parts: a singular sources method via the probe method using a solution with higher-order singularity for the governing equation of the background medium; the discovery of an IPS function whose two ways of decomposition give us the indicator functions for both the probe and singular sources methods; a completely integrated version of both methods, which means their indicator functions coincide. Furthermore, a result on Side B of IPS is also given, concerning the blowing-up property of a sequence calculated from the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map.</description>

      <title>Couette Taylor instabilities in the small-gap regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Couette-Taylor instability occurs in a viscous fluid confined between two coaxial rotating cylinders. When the Taylor number surpasses a critical value, the stable Couette flow destabilizes, giving way to steady Taylor vortices. As the Taylor number increases further, these vortices themselves become unstable, transitioning into wavy Taylor vortices.
  In this article, we focus on the small-gap limit, where the ratio of the cylinder radii approaches unity and the rotation rates of the cylinders are nearly identical. We provide a rigorous proof of the existence of a critical Taylor number $T_c$, at which the Couette flow loses stability.
  For Taylor numbers just above $T_c$, under fixed axial periodicity, the solutions to the limiting Navier-Stokes system are governed by a Ginzburg-Landau-type partial differential equation. Beyond the classical Taylor vortex flow, we demonstrate that a two-parameter family of solutions emerges at criticality for $T&gt;T_c$. This family includes not only wavy vortices but also a variety of other exotic flow patterns, all of which remain steady in the frame rotating at the average angular velocity of the cylinders.</description>

      <title>The Nonlocal-to-Local Limit for the Inviscid Leray-{\alpha} Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the inviscid Leray-$\alpha$ equations - an inviscid nonlocal regularisation of the Euler equations. In the first part, we prove the convergence of strong solutions of the Leray-$\alpha$ equations to strong solutions of the Euler equations in $H^s(\mathbb{R}^d)$ for $s&gt;d/2 +1 $, $d\in \{2,3\}$, for a large class of regularising kernels. In the second part, we consider weak solutions on a bounded domain with a local scaling property far away from the boundary. The scaling relates to second-order structure functions from turbulence theory and does not imply regularity. Nonetheless, under these assumptions, the weak solutions converge to (possibly wild) weak solutions of Euler in $L^2$ for almost every $t$.</description>

      <title>Mild Solutions for Time--Fractional Stochastic Nonlocal Diffusion Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a time--space nonlocal diffusion equation driven by additive time--space white noise, where the time derivative is the Caputo derivative of order $\alpha\in(0,2)$. The model couples local diffusion with a nonlocal convolution operator generated by a radial probability density, thus incorporating memory effects and long-range spatial interactions.
  For Dirac initial data, we derive an explicit solution formula in the space of tempered distributions, decomposing the solution into a deterministic part and a stochastic convolution kernel expressed through Mittag--Leffler functions. Our main contribution is a sharp characterization of the existence of mild solutions in terms of $\alpha$, the spatial dimension $N$, and the coefficients of the local and nonlocal diffusion terms. In particular, when the Laplacian term is absent, no mild solution exists, whereas for $\lambda&gt;0$ the admissible regimes depend critically on $(\alpha,N)$, extending and sharpening the known results for purely local fractional stochastic heat equations. Numerical simulations illustrate the evolution of the mean and variance and emphasize subdiffusive spreading and memory effects.</description>

      <title>Helmholtz transmission problem and intrinsic impedance scattering problem on extension domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a transmission problem for the Helmholtz equation across the boundary of an extension domain. A such boundary can be Lipschitz, fractal, or of varying Hausdorff dimension for instance. We generalise the notions of layer potential and Neumann-Poincar{\'e} operators, and of Calder{\'o}n projectors in that context. Those boundary operators allow to connect the transmission problem (on the whole space) to one-sided problems -- notably, scattering problems -- with Dirichlet, Neumann and Robin boundary conditions. Since an extension domain needs no specific boundary measure, the Robin (impedance) condition is not understood in a boundary L^2-type space, rather by duality on the trace space itself. We discuss the well-posedness of the impedance scattering problem in that framework and compare to the classical L^2 setting. Our analysis allows to generalise optimisation results for acoustic scattering when the obstacle is an extension domain in any dimension.</description>

      <title>On a Class of Global Solutions to 3D Free-Boundary Relativistic Euler Equations with a Physical Vacuum Boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the free-boundary relativistic Euler equations in Minkowski spacetime $\mathbb{M}^{1+3}$ equipped with a physical vacuum boundary, which models the motion of a relativistic gas. We concern ourselves with the family of isentropic, barotropic, and polytropic gas, with an equation of state $p = \rho^{1+\kappa}, \kappa \in (0,\frac23]$. We construct an open class of initial data that launches future-global solutions. Such solutions are spherically symmetric, have small initial density, and expand asymptotically linearly in time. In particular, the asymptotic rate of expansion is allowed to be arbitrarily close to the speed of light. Therefore, our main result is far from a perturbation of existing results concerning the classical isentropic Euler counterparts.</description>

      <title>Gauge transform for the Korteweg-de Vries equation and well-posedness below the $H^{-1}$-scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new formulation of the Korteweg-de Vries equation (KdV) on the real line, via a gauge transform. While KdV and the gauged equation are equivalent for smooth solutions, the latter is better behaved at low regularity in Fourier-Lebesgue spaces. In particular, the admissible regularities go beyond the $H^{-1}$-scale, which is a well-known threshold for KdV. As a byproduct, by reversing the gauge transform, we are able to improve on the known theory for KdV and derive sharp local well-posedness in Fourier-Lebesgue spaces with large integrability exponent. Our strategy is based on an infinite normal form reduction and Fourier restriction estimates, together with a thorough exploitation of algebraic cancellations. Additionally, our method is totally independent of the KdV completely integrable structure, and extends to other non-integrable models with quadratic nonlinearities.</description>

      <title>Partial H\"older regularity for fully nonlinear nonlocal parabolic equations with integrable kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we consider solutions to (fully nonlinear) parabolic integro-differential equations with integrable interaction kernels. A typical equation would be that obtained by starting with, for $s\in(0,1)$, the $s$-fractional heat equation, but replacing the interaction kernel in the integro-differential term with one which has been truncated, for $\rho&gt;0$, at the value $\rho^{-d-2s}$, hence integrable. We show that solutions to these equations have a partial regularity estimate which captures differences of the solution up to the scale at which the kernel has a truncation in its singularity. The estimates we provide are robust with respect to the truncation parameter, and they include the existing results for the original operators without truncation. There are some earlier results for linear and elliptic cases of this situation of integrable interaction kernels, and so our work is a generalization of those to the nonlinear and parabolic setting.</description>

      <title>Traveling waves for bistable reaction-diffusion-convection equations with discontinuous density-dependent coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuing our previous study \cite{DJKZ} on the monostable reaction-diffusion-convection equation, we analyze the bistable case under weak regularity assumptions. Our approach applies monostable results on the subintervals where the reaction term $g$ has constant sign, thereby establishing both existence and nonexistence of bistable traveling wave solutions. We extend the results of \cite{MMM04}, obtained for $p=2$ under higher regularity assumptions ($d \in C^1[0,1]$, $g,h \in C[0,1]$), to the $p$-Laplacian with $p&gt;1$ in our weak regularity setting.</description>

      <title>A New Measure of Coarseness for Solutions to Cahn--Hilliard Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new measure of coarseness for characterizing phase separation processes such as those described by Cahn--Hilliard equations. An advantage of our measure is that it remains consistent throughout the evolution, including for solutions with no periodic structure. We use our measure to compare two previous models of coarsening dynamics with numerically generated dynamics, providing the first direct check that we are aware of for the efficacy of these methods.</description>

      <title>Variational and Quasi-variational solutions to thick flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formulate the flow of thick fluids as evolution variational and quasi-variational inequalities, with a variable threshold on the absolute value of the deformation rate tensor. In the variational case, we show the existence and uniqueness of strong and weak solutions in the viscous case and also the existence of strong and weak solutions in the inviscid case. These problems correspond to solve, respectively, the Navier-Stokes and the Euler equations with an additional generalised Lagrange multiplier associated with the threshold on the deformation rate tensor. Applying the continuous dependence of strong and weak solutions to the variational inequalities for the Navier-Stokes with constraints on the derivatives, and on their respective generalised Lagrange multipliers, we can solve the case of the variable threshold depending on the solution itself that correspond to quasi-variational problems.

      <title>De Giorgi's regularity theory for elliptic, parabolic and kinetic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This book presents a comprehensive regularity theory for solutions of elliptic, parabolic, and kinetic equations. The foundation of this theory was laid by E. De Giorgi's groundbreaking resolution of Hilbert's nineteenth problem in 1956. The innovative tools he developed to tackle this problem proved to be remarkably versatile. In 1957, just one year later, J. Nash independently developed analogous techniques for parabolic equations, concurrently with De Giorgi's research. By the year 2000, these techniques had been extended to address elliptic and parabolic equations featuring integral diffusion, such as the fractional Laplacian. More recently, the theory has evolved to encompass kinetic equations, accommodating both local and integral diffusions. This book aims to present these results in a unified and coherent manner, beginning with the classical elliptic framework and progressing through to the most recent advancements in kinetic equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.15259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the existence of non-hydrodynamic solutions to the linear density-dependent BGK equation in $d$ dimensions. Specifically, we show the existence of an initial condition for any Knudsen number $\tau$ for which the dissipation rate of the macroscopic mass density diverges $\sim 1/\tau$. Our results rely on a detailed spectral analysis of the linear BGK operator, an explicit solution formula for the time-dependent problem using a combination of Fourier series with the Laplace transform and subsequent contour integration arguments from complex analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.14332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we formulate topology optimization problems concerning the mass distribution as minimization problems for functionals on the Wasserstein space. We relax optimization problems regarding non-convex objective functions on the Wasserstein space by using the Neumann heat semigroup and prove the existence of minimizers of relaxed problems. Furthermore, we introduce the filtered Wasserstein gradient flow and derive the error estimate between the original Wasserstein gradient flow and the filtered one in terms of the Wasserstein distance. We also construct a candidate for the optimal mass distribution for a given fixed total mass and simultaneously obtain the shape of the material by the numerical calculation of filtered Wasserstein gradient flows.</description>

      <title>Learning PDE Solvers with Physics and Data: A Unifying View of Physics-Informed Neural Networks and Neural Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Partial differential equations (PDEs) are central to scientific modeling. Modern workflows increasingly rely on learning-based components to support model reuse, inference, and integration across large computational processes. Despite the emergence of various physics-aware data-driven approaches, the field still lacks a unified perspective to uncover their relationships, limitations, and appropriate roles in scientific workflows. To this end, we propose a unifying perspective to place two dominant paradigms: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and Neural Operators (NOs), within a shared design space. We organize existing methods from three fundamental dimensions: what is learned, how physical structures are integrated into the learning process, and how the computational load is amortized across problem instances. In this way, many challenges can be best understood as consequences of these structural properties of learning PDEs. By analyzing advances through this unifying view, our survey aims to facilitate the development of reliable learning-based PDE solvers and catalyze a synthesis of physics and data.</description>

      <title>Sobolev multipliers and fractional Gaussian fields on Lipschitz boundaries with applications to deterministic and random acoustic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by Applied Physics and Photonics studies of random resonators, we study in the stochastic part of this paper random acoustic operators in non-smooth bounded domains $G \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ and introduce m-dissipative impedance boundary conditions containing fractional Gaussian fields (FGFs). The deterministic part of the paper constructs and studies the spaces of pointwise multipliers on Lipschitz continuous boundaries $\partial G$, as well as the spaces of Sobolev (distribution-type) multipliers on boundaries $\partial G$ of better regularity. These multipliers are used as generalized impedance coefficients $\zeta (x)$, $x \in \partial G$, in impedance boundary conditions accompanying the first order acoustic system. The main efforts are aimed on the m-dissipativity of associated acoustic operators and the discreteness of the related spectra under weakest possible assumptions on the regularity of $\zeta$. In order to connect the deterministic results with the randomization, we introduce FGFs on Lipschitz boundaries $\partial G$ and study their regularity. To this end, we prove that a rough Weyl-type asymptotics takes place for the Laplace-Beltrami eigenvalues on arbitrary compact boundary $\partial G$ of $C^{0,1}$-regularity.</description>

      <title>Rate of convergence of random attractors towards deterministic singleton attractor for a class of non-Newtonian fluids of differential type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15217v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate the long-term dynamics of a class of two- and three-dimensional non-Newtonian fluids of differential type, known as third-grade fluids. We first show that when the external forcing is sufficiently small, the global attractor of the underlying system (which characterizes its asymptotic behavior) reduces to a single point. We then consider the system under stochastic perturbations, specifically infinite-dimensional additive white noise. In this random setting, we do not find conclusive evidence that the corresponding random attractor remains a single point, as in the deterministic case. However, we are able to estimate the rate at which the random attractor approaches the deterministic singleton attractor as the intensity of the stochastic noise tends to zero.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.15218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Controlling the $\mathcal W_\infty$ Wasserstein distance by the $\mathcal W_p$ Wasserstein distance is interesting both for theorical and numerical applications. A first paper on this problem was written several years ago [3]. Some year later [14] framed it in the same inequality for more general costs which increase with the distance. In this paper, we prove this type of inequality for optimal transport problems with pointwise cost which is a decreasing function of the distance. We show, in particular, that there is a general framework that encompasses all the cases above.</description>

      <title>Transonic shock solutions for steady 3-D axisymmetric full Euler flows with large swirl velocity in a finite cylindrical nozzle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09917v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper concerns the existence and location of three-dimensional axisymmetric transonic shocks with large swirl velocity for shock solutions of the steady compressible full Euler system in a cylindrical nozzle with prescribed receiver pressure. As far as we know, it is the first mathematical result on the three-dimensional transonic shock with either large vorticity or large swirl velocity. One of the key difficulties is the fact that the Euler system is elliptic-hyperbolic composite for the flow behind the shock front, and its elliptic part and hyperbolic part are strongly coupled in the lower order terms because of the large swirl velocity, such that they cannot be simply decoupled in the principal parts as the case for the flow without swirls or with small swirl velocity. New decomposition techniques for the elliptic-hyperbolic composite system are developed to deal with this difficulty, and the solvability condition for the boundary value problem is deduced to determine the location of the shock front. It finally turns out that the non-zero swirl velocity, which brings new challenging difficulties in the analysis, plays an essential and fundamental role in determining the location of the shock front. Another key difficulty in the analysis is that there are no readily established shock solutions available. Non-trivial special shock solutions are first constructed as background solutions under the assumption that the flow parameters depend only on the radial distance to the symmetric axis. Necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of such solutions are also found. Even though the shock location can be arbitrarily shifted for the special shock solutions, it will be shown that the shock solution with a determined shock position can be established as the boundary data are perturbations of one of the established special shock solutions under certain conditions.</description>

      <title>Soliton resolution for Calogero--Moser derivative nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12843v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider soliton resolution for the Calogero--Moser derivative nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (CM-DNLS). A rigorous PDE analysis of (CM-DNLS) was recently initiated by G\'erard and Lenzmann, who demonstrated its Lax pair structure. Additionally, (CM-DNLS) exhibits several symmetries, such as mass-criticality with pseudo-conformal symmetry and a self-dual Hamiltonian. Despite its integrability, finite-time blow-up solutions have been constructed.
  The purpose of this paper is to establish soliton resolution for both finite-time blow-up solutions and global solutions in a fully general setting, \emph{without imposing radial symmetry or size constraints}. To our knowledge, this is the first non-integrable proof of full soliton resolution for Schr\"odinger-type equations. A key aspect of our proof is the control of the energy of the outer radiation after extracting a soliton, referred to as the \emph{energy bubbling} estimate. This benefits from two levels of convervation laws, mass and energy, and self-duality. This approach allows us to directly prove continuous-in-time soliton resolution, bypassing time-sequential soliton resolution. Importantly, our proof does not rely on the integrability of the equation, potentially offering insights applicable to other non-integrable models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00191v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the ordinary or fractional Laplacian plus a homogeneous, scaling-critical drift term. This operator is non-symmetric but homogeneous, and generates scales of $L^p$-Sobolev spaces which we compare with the ordinary homogeneous Sobolev spaces. Unlike in previous studies concerning Hardy operators, i.e., ordinary or fractional Laplacians plus scaling-critical scalar perturbations, handling the drift term requires an additional, possibly technical, restriction on the range of comparable Sobolev spaces, which is related to the unavailability of gradient bounds for the associated semigroup.</description>

      <title>Bound states of nonlinear Dirac equations on periodic quantum graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02036v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study nonlinear Dirac equations (NLDE) on periodic quantum graphs endowed with Kirchhoff-type vertex conditions. Our main goal is to establish existence and multiplicity of bound states, which arise as critical points of the associated NLDE action functional. The underlying Dirac operator has a spectral gap around the origin, so the corresponding functional is strongly indefinite, and in addition the Palais--Smale condition fails due to the noncompactness and the periodic structure of the graph. To overcome these difficulties, we combine the spectral properties of the periodic Dirac operator with critical point theorems for strongly indefinite functionals and a concentration--compactness analysis adapted to periodic quantum graphs, and derive existence and multiplicity results for bound states with frequencies lying in the spectral gap.</description>

      <title>A mean field game model with non-local spatial interactions and resources accumulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01200v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a family of mean field games arising in modeling the behavior of strategic economic agents which move across space maximizing their utility from consumption and have the possibility to accumulate resources for production (such as human capital). The resulting mean field game PDE system is not covered in the actual literature on the topic as it displays weaker assumptions on the regularity of the data (in particular global Lipschitz continuity and boundedness of the objective are lost), state constraints, and a non-standard interaction term. We obtain a first result on the existence of solution of the mean field game PDE system.</description>

      <title>Direct and inverse scattering for an isotropic medium with a second-order boundary condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11818v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the direct and inverse scattering problem for a penetrable, isotropic obstacle with a second-order Robin boundary condition, which asymptotically models the delamination of the boundary of the scatterer. We develop a direct sampling method to solve the inverse shape problem by numerically recovering the scatterer. Here, we assume that the corresponding Cauchy data is measured on the boundary of a region that fully contains the scatterer. Similar methods have been applied to other inverse shape problems, but they have not been studied for a penetrable, isotropic scatterer with a second-order Robin boundary condition. We also initiate the study of the corresponding transmission eigenvalue problem, which is derived from assuming zero Cauchy data is measured on the boundary of the region that fully contains the scatterer. We prove that the transmission eigenvalues for this problem are at most a discrete set. Numerical examples will be presented for the inverse shape problem in two dimensions for circular and non-circular scatterers. Further, transmission eigenvalues are computed numerically for various scatterers.</description>

      <title>Lipschitz regularity of weakly coupled vectorial almost-minimizers for Alt-Caffarelli functionals in Orlicz spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17616v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a fixed constant $\lambda &gt; 0$ and a bounded Lipschitz domain $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ with $n \geq 2$, we establish that almost-minimizers (functions satisfying a sort of variational inequality) of the Alt-Caffarelli type functional \[ \mathcal{J}_G({\bf v};\Omega) \coloneqq \int_\Omega \left(\sum_{i=1}^mG\big(|\nabla v_i(x)|\big) + \lambda \chi_{\{|{\bf v}|&gt;0\}}(x)\right) dx , \] where ${\bf v} = (v_1, \dots, v_m)$ and $m \in \mathbb{N}$, exhibit optimal Lipschitz continuity on compact subsets of $\Omega$, where $G$ is a Young function satisfying specific growth conditions. Furthermore, we obtain universal gradient estimates for non-negative almost-minimizers in the interior of non-coincidence sets. %{\color{blue}Furthermore, under the additional convexity assumption on $G$, we address the problem of boundary Lipschitz regularity for $v$ by adopting a fundamentally different analytical approach.} Notably, this method also provides an alternative proof of the optimal local Lipschitz regularity in the domain's interior. Our work extends the recent regularity results for weakly coupled vectorial almost-minimizers for the $p$-Laplacian addressed in \cite{BFS24}, and even the scalar case treated in \cite{daSSV}, \cite{DiPFFV24} and \cite{PelegTeix24}, thereby providing new insights and approaches applicable to a variety of non-linear one or two-phase free boundary problems with non-standard growth.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.16809v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Cauchy problem for the fractional semilinear heat equation with distributional inhomogeneous terms. By introducing the Lorentz--Morrey spaces, we overcome limitations of real interpolation in the classical local Morrey spaces and obtain a sharp integral estimate for the nonlinear term. Moreover, in terms of Besov-type spaces, we give necessary conditions and sufficient conditions on inhomogeneous terms for the local-in-time existence of solutions belonging to Lorentz--Morrey spaces.</description>

      <title>Conditional stability in determining source terms of semilinear parabolic partial differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08460v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study an inverse source problem for a semilinear parabolic equation in a bounded domain, where the nonlinearity depends on the unknown function and its gradient through a quadratic reaction term and a Burgers-type convection term. From partial boundary observation of the time derivative and its spatial gradient on an open portion of the boundary, together with an interior snapshot of the solution at a fixed time, we aim to recover an unknown spatial source factor. The analysis combines (i) a paradifferential paralinearization in Besov spaces on a short time window, which converts the nonlinear model into a linear parabolic equation with small bounded coefficients, and (ii) a Carleman estimate for the time-differentiated equation, yielding conditional Holder stability. The approach extends the cut-off free Carleman method for linear inverse source problems to a nonlinear setting while keeping the observation geometry unchanged.</description>

      <title>Variational Approach to the Lane--Emden--Fowler System with Applications in Edge-Preserving Image Denoising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14246v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to image restoration by employing a coupled sublinear Lane--Emden--Fowler system with edge-preserving diffusion properties. We introduce a rigorous variational formulation for the system, establishing the existence and uniqueness of bounded positive solutions in the presence of noise. The proposed model integrates a nonlinear reaction term of the Lane--Emden type, $p(x)v^\alpha$ and $q(x)u^\beta$, with a gradient-dependent diffusion coefficient to effectively suppress Gaussian noise while preserving structural edges. We provide a complete mathematical analysis of the problem, using the method of sub- and supersolutions and fixed-point theory. Numerical simulations, strictly aligned with a Python implementation, validate the theoretical results, demonstrating superior performance in terms of Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) compared to the noisy input.</description>

      <title>On Viscosity Solutions of Hamilton-Jacobi Equations in the Wasserstein space and the Vanishing Viscosity Limit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.14568v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The aim of this article is twofold. First, we develop a unified framework for viscosity solutions to both first-order Hamilton-Jacobi equations and semilinear Hamilton-Jacobi equations driven by the idiosyncratic operator, defined on the Wasserstein Space. Second, we establish a vanishing-viscosity limit-extending beyond the classical control-theoretic setting-for solutions of semilinear Hamilton-Jacobi equations, proving their convergence to the corresponding first-order solution as the idiosyncratic noise vanishes. Our approach provides an optimal convergence rate. We also present some results of independent interest. These include existence theorems for the first-order equation, obtained through an appropriate Hopf-Lax representation, and a useful description of the action of the idiosyncratic operator on geodesically convex functions.</description>

      <title>Global Existence for General Systems of Isentropic Gas Dynamics via a Weighted Pressure Perturbation Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08157v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish the global existence of weak entropy solutions for 1D isentropic gas dynamics with general pressure laws ($\gamma &gt; 1$). To address vacuum degeneracy, we introduce a novel structural regularization via a "Synchronized Dual Translation" strategy. This approach offers a distinct advantage over the flux-modification method of Lu (2007): while Lu's method induces a structural mismatch requiring restrictive constraints on $P'''$ to control regularization artifacts, our construction preserves structural isomorphism with the standard Euler equations. Consequently, the approximate entropies satisfy a homogeneous Generalized Euler-Poisson-Darboux equation. This allows us to prove strong convergence under natural asymptotic assumptions, effectively eliminating the need for the technical higher-order derivative constraints required in prior works.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic-Sobolev inequalities on non-compact Euclidean submanifolds: sharpness and rigidity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09419v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The paper is devoted to provide Michael-Simon-type $L^p$-logarithmic-Sobolev inequalities on complete, not necessarily compact $n$-dimensional submanifolds $\Sigma$ of the Euclidean space $\mathbb R^{n+m}$. Our first result, stated for $p=2$, is sharp, it is valid on general submanifolds, and it involves the mean curvature of $\Sigma$. It implies in particular the main result of S. Brendle [Comm. Pure Appl. Math.}, 2022]. In addition, it turns out that equality can only occur if and only if $\Sigma$ is isometric to the Euclidean space $\mathbb R^{n}$ and the extremizer is a Gaussian. The second result is a general $L^p$-logarithmic-Sobolev inequality for $p\geq 2$ on Euclidean submanifolds with constants that are codimension-free in case of minimal submanifolds. In order to prove the above results - especially, to deal with the equality cases - we elaborate the theory of optimal mass transport on submanifolds between measures that are not necessarily compactly supported. Applications are provided to sharp hypercontractivity estimates of Hopf-Lax semigroups on submanifolds. The first hypercontractivity estimate is for general submanifolds with bounded mean curvature vector, the second one is for self-similar shrinkers endowed with the natural Gaussian measure. The equality cases are characterized here as well.</description>

      <title>On photonic band gaps in two-dimensional photonic crystal fibres. Analysis in the vicinity of the low-dielectric light line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10536v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider `off-axis' electromagnetic wave propagation down the homogeneous direction of a low-loss two-dimensional periodic dielectric (or photonic crystal fibre) near the light line of the low-dielectric material constituent. Numerous physical and numerical experiments demonstrate the presence of photonic band gaps in the vicinity of this `critical' light line. We mathematically analyse the existence of photonic band gaps near the line and characterise them in terms of frequency gaps in the spectrum of the Maxwell equations restricted to the line. We apply the results to both one-dimensional photonic crystal fibres, and a genuinely two-dimensional photonic crystal fibres with `thin' inclusions, namely ``ARROW'' fibres. In the case of ARROW fibres, by an asymptotic analysis, in terms of the small inclusion parameter, we demonstrate the existence of low frequency photonic band gaps. It is important to note that our analysis does not assume any specific ratio between the dielectric contrasts; as a result, moderate or even low contrast models are fully encompassed. Similarly, no limiting assumptions are imposed on the wave propagation constant along the fibre.</description>

      <title>Analysis of a class of recursive distributional equations including the resistance of the series-parallel graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11036v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper analyzes a class of recursive distributional equations (RDE's) proposed by Gurel-Gurevich [17] and involving a bias parameter $p$, which includes the logarithm of the resistance of the series-parallel graph. A discrete-time evolution equation resembling a quasilinear Fisher-KPP equation is derived to describe the CDF's of solutions. When the bias parameter $p = \frac{1}{2}$, this equation is shown to have a PDE scaling limit, from which distributional limit theorems for the RDE are derived. Applied to the series-parallel graph, the results imply that $N^{-1/3} \log R^{(N)}$ has a nondegenerate limit when $p = \frac{1}{2}$, as conjectured by Addario-Berry, Cairns, Devroye, Kerriou, and Mitchell [1].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.11605v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish a boundary delocalization principle for high-frequency Dirichlet eigenfunctions on smooth strictly convex domains. The main result excludes persistent boundary concentration at the level of individual eigenmodes when compared to short spectral packets of sublinear length. Quantitatively, we compare boundary energies of single eigenfunctions to packet sums over frequency windows of size N_k = o(k), without asserting any asymptotic gain in magnitude. The main mode-to-packet estimate relies only on the Rellich identity. For the multi-mode bias exclusion we additionally use the boundary local Weyl law to obtain a packet zero-mean cancellation estimate. This mode-to-packet comparison is independent of eigenvalue monotonicity and is stable under eigenvalue crossings.</description>
