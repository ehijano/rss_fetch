      <title>Crystal-Field--Driven Magnetoelectricity in the Triangular Quantum Magnet CeMgAl$_{11}$O$_{19}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report dielectric and magnetoelectric studies of single-crystalline \ce{CeMgAl11O19}, a Kramers triangular magnet embedded in a polarizable hexaaluminate lattice. In zero magnetic field, the permittivity $\varepsilon'(T)$ follows the Barrett law of a quantum paraelectric down to 25 K, below which a broad minimum develops near 3 K without evidence of static ferroelectric or magnetic order. Application of magnetic fields up to \SI{9}{\tesla} shifts this minimum to higher temperatures and broadens it, evidencing a tunable magnetoelectric response.The magnetoelectric coupling was characterized using results from magnetization measurements. The anomaly temperature $T^*$, extracted from the local minimum of $\varepsilon'(T)$, exhibits a linear dependence on the squared magnetization $M^2$, consistent with the biquadratic magnetoelectric coupling allowed in centrosymmetric systems. This magnetoelectric effect, mediated by spin-orbit-entangled Kramers doublets interacting with a frustrated antipolar liquid, establishes \ce{CeMgAl11O19} as a prototype for exploring quantum magnetoelectricity in frustrated systems.</description>

      <title>Nematic Fluctuations and Electronic Correlations in Heavily Hole-Doped Ba$_{1-x}$K$_x$Fe$_2$As$_2$ Probed by Elastoresistance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates nematic fluctuations and electronic correlations in the hole-doped iron pnictide superconductor Ba$_{1-x}$K$_x$Fe$_2$As$_2$ by means of longitudinal and transverse elastoresistance measurements over a wide doping range ($0.63 &lt; x &lt; 0.98$). For this purpose, the orbital character of the electronic response was revealed by decomposition of the elastoresistance into the $A_{1g}$ and $B_{2g}$ symmetry channels. It was shown that at lower doping levels nematic fluctuations in the $B_{2g}$ channel dominate, while for $x &gt; 0.68$ the $A_{1g}$ channel becomes dominant and reaches a pronounced maximum at $x \approx 0.8$ which indicates strong orbital-selective electronic correlations. Despite the dominance of the $A_{1g}$ signal at high doping, a weak contribution in the $B_{2g}$ channel persists, which can be interpreted as a remnant of nematic fluctuations. Model calculations based on a five-orbital tight-binding Hamiltonian with interactions attribute the observed enhancement in the $A_{1g}$ channel to an orbital-selective Kondo-like resonance, predominantly involving the $d_{xy}$ orbital. We discuss our results in relation to the evolution of the Sommerfeld coefficient reported in the literature and a reported change of the superconducting order parameter. All this indicates that for $x &gt; 0.68$ qualitatively new physics emerges. Our findings suggest that electronic correlations in the strongly hole-doped regime play an important role in superconductivity, while the detectable weak nematic fluctuations may also be of relevance.</description>

      <title>Consistent gauge theories for the slave particle representation of the strongly correlated $t$-$J$ model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This note aims to clarify the confusion and inconsistency, and to address the incompleteness in our recent work [1,2]. In order to avoid the ill-defined nature of the free propagator of the gauge field in the ordered states of the $t$-$J$ model, we adopted a gauge fixing that was not of the Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST) exact form in our previous work [2]. This led to the situation where Dirac's second-class constraints, namely, the slave particle number constraint and the Ioffe-Larkin current constraint, were not rigorously obeyed. Here we show that a consistent gauge fixing condition that enforces the exact constraints must be BRST-exact. An example is the Lorenz gauge. On the other hand, we prove that although the free propagator of the gauge field in the Lorenz gauge is ill-defined, the full propagator is still well-defined. This implies that the strongly correlated $t$-$J$ model can be exactly mapped to a perturbatively controllable theory within the slave particle representation.</description>

      <title>Cubic magnetic anisotropy in $B$20 magnets: Interplay of anisotropy and magnetic order in Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_{x}$Si</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The metallic systems MnSi and Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_{x}$Si are known to feature a generic magnetic phase diagram primarily determined by the isotropic exchange and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions. However, additional weaker anisotropies, lowest in the hierarchy of energy scales, play a crucial role: they determine the relative order of phases in the phase diagram and may even enable skyrmion stability far below the ordering temperature. Among cubic B20 helimagnets, the insulator Cu$_2$OSeO$_3$ is currently the only known example exhibiting a low-temperature, anisotropy-induced skyrmion pocket. In this manuscript, we present a systematic study of cubic magnetocrystalline anisotropy by means of angle-resolved SQUID magnetization measurements in MnSi and Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_{x}$Si ($0.08 \leq x \leq 0.70$) single crystals and provide quantitative values of the anisotropy constants. For Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_{x}$Si, the cubic anisotropy is found to be strongly dependent on the Co concentration $x$. In particular, for low Co concentrations ($x \sim 0.10$), the anisotropy is sufficiently strong to stabilize a low-temperature skyrmion lattice, in agreement with theoretical predictions. This finding suggests that Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_{x}$Si may represent the first chiral metallic system to exhibit a low-temperature skyrmion phase controllably stabilized by cubic anisotropy for specific directions of the magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Field-induced magnetic phases in the Kitaev candidate Na$_3$Co$_2$SbO$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a rich anisotropic magnetic phase diagram of Na$_3$Co$_2$SbO$_6$, a previously proposed cobaltate Kitaev candidate, based on field- and temperature-dependent magnetization, specific heat, and magnetocaloric effect studies. At low temperatures, our experiments uncover a low-lying $j_{\textrm{eff}} = \frac{1}{2}$ state with an antiferromagnetic ground state and pronounced in-plane versus out-of-plane anisotropy. The experimentally identified magnetic phases are theoretically characterized through classical Monte Carlo simulations within an extended Kitaev-Heisenberg model with additional ring exchange interactions. The resulting phase diagram reveals a variety of exotic field-induced magnetic phases, including double-$\textbf{q}$, $\frac{1}{3}$-AFM, zigzag, and vortex phases.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity in the repulsive Hubbard model on different geometries induced by density-assisted hopping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the effect of density-assisted hopping on different dimerized lattice geometries, such as bilayers and ladder structures. We show analytically that the density-assisted hopping induces an attractive interaction in the lower (bonding) band of the dimer structure and a repulsion in the upper (anti-bonding) band. Overcoming the onsite repulsion, this can lead to the appearance of superconductivity. The superconductivity depends strongly on the filling, and present a pairing structure more complex than s-wave pairing. Combining numerical and analytical methods such as the matrix product states ansatz, bosonization and perturbative calculations we map out the phase diagram of the two-leg ladder system and identify its superconducting phase. We characterize the transition from the non-density-assisted repulsive regime to the spin-gapped superconducting regime as a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition.</description>

      <title>A microscopic approach to nonlinear theory of spin-charge separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fate of spin-charge separation beyond the low energy remains elusive up to now. Here we develop a microscopic theory of the correlation functions using the strong coupling expansion of the Hubbard model and demonstrate its validity down to the experimentally relevant $r_{\rm s}&gt;1$. Evaluating the spectral function, we show the general stability of the nonlinear spin-charge modes in whole energy band and investigate all the nonlinear features systematically. We confirm the general prediction experimentally in semiconductor quantum wires. Furthermore, we observe a signal consistent with a continuum of the nonlinear excitations and with a final spectral density around the $3 k_{\rm F}$ point, indicating the robustness of the Hubbard model predictions for a finite range interaction.</description>

      <title>Optimizing VQE Ansatz for Studying Tight-Binding Models with \textit{sd}-Interaction and On-Site Coulomb Repulsion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The VQE algorithm is applied to the problem of finding the ground state of a lattice model with on-site Coulomb repulsion, nearest-neighbor hopping, and on-site sd-interaction. We compare the performance of several ansatze, including cluster and generic forms. Several modifications of the standard cluster ansatz implementation are proposed, which significantly reduce the number of two-qubit gates. Different classical optimizers are employed within the VQE algorithm. The performance of the algorithms is evaluated using both noiseless and noisy simulations.</description>

      <title>Altermagnetism and Superconductivity: A Short Historical Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article explores the deep interconnections among three seemingly unrelated concepts in condensed matter physics: electronic liquid crystal phases, multipole expansions, and altermagnetism. At the heart of these phenomena lies a shared foundation: spin-momentum locking in the nonrelativistic regime. Originally proposed in the context of electronic liquid crystal phases, spin-momentum locking was later elegantly incorporated into the formalism of multipole expansions. This framework can be further extended across multiple atomic sites, making it particularly effective for describing altermagnets, which feature localized magnetic moments distributed over at least two sublattices. In the second part of the article, we examine superconducting phenomena that stem from this shared mechanism, focusing on superconductivity in systems with spin-momentum locked Fermi surfaces. We highlight a rich variety of unconventional superconducting states, including finite-momentum pairing, $d$-wave and spin-triplet superconductivity, and topological Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces, among others. Additional related topics are addressed in the concluding section. Overall, this work offers both an accessible introduction to the newly identified magnetic order known as altermagnetism and a conceptual guide for researchers aiming to harness the ensuing unconventional superconductivity in the development of future quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Partial Self-Correction in Layer Codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.09218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The storage of large-scale quantum information at finite temperature requires an autonomous and reliable quantum hard drive, also known as a self-correcting quantum memory. It is a long-standing open problem to find a self-correcting quantum memory in three dimensions. The recently introduced Layer Codes achieve the best possible scaling of code parameters and logical energy barrier in three dimensions, these are tantalizing features for the purposes of self-correction. In this work we show that a family of Layer Codes, based on good Quantum Tanner Codes, exhibit partial self-correction. Their memory time grows exponentially with linear system size, up to a length scale that is exponential in the inverse temperature. At this length scale, the memory time scales as a double exponential of inverse temperature. To establish this result we introduce a concatenated matching decoder that combines three rounds of parallelized minimum-weight perfect-matching with a decoder for good Quantum Tanner Codes. We show that our decoder corrects errors up to a constant fraction of the energy barrier, and a constant fraction of the code distance, for a family of Layer Codes. Our results position Layer Codes as the leading candidate for a partially self-correcting memory in three dimensions. While they fall short of achieving strict self-correction in the thermodynamic limit, our work highlights the potential of these local codes in three dimensions, with fast distance and logical qubit growth, fast decoders, and a long memory time over a wide range of parameters.</description>

      <title>Unveiling dynamical quantum error correcting codes via non-invertible symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamical stabilizer codes (DSCs) have recently emerged as a powerful generalization of static stabilizer codes for quantum error correction, replacing a fixed stabilizer group with a sequence of non-commuting measurements. This dynamical structure unlocks new possibilities for fault tolerance but also introduces new challenges, as errors must now be tracked across both space and time. In this work, we provide a physical and topological understanding of DSCs by establishing a correspondence between qudit Pauli measurements and non-invertible symmetries in 4+1-dimensional 2-form gauge theories. Sequences of measurements in a DSC are mapped to a fusion of the operators implementing these non-invertible symmetries. We show that the error detectors of a DSC correspond to endable surface operators in the gauge theory, whose endpoints define line operators, and that detectable errors are precisely those surface operators that braid non-trivially with these lines. Finally, we demonstrate how this framework naturally recovers the spacetime stabilizer code associated with a DSC.</description>

      <title>Disorder operators in two-dimensional Fermi and non-Fermi liquids through multidimensional bosonization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04334v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Disorder operators are a type of non-local observables for quantum many-body systems, measuring the fluctuations of symmetry charges inside a region. It has been shown that disorder operators can reveal global aspects of many-body states that are otherwise difficult to access through local measurements. We study the disorder operator for U(1) (charge or spin) symmetry in two-dimensional Fermi and non-Fermi liquid states, using the multidimensional bosonization formalism. For a region $A$, the logarithm of the charge disorder parameter in a Fermi liquid with isotropic interactions scales asymptotically as $l_A\ln l_A$, with $l_A$ being the linear size of the region $A$. We calculate the proportionality coefficient in terms of Landau parameters of the Fermi liquid theory. We then study models of the Fermi surface coupled to gapless bosonic fields realizing non-Fermi liquid states. In a simple spinless model, where the fermion density is coupled to a critical scalar, we find that at the quantum critical point the scaling behavior of the charge disorder operators is drastically modified to $l_A \ln^2 l_A$. We also consider the composite Fermi liquid state and argue that the charge disorder operator scales as $l_A$.</description>

Abstract: Spin-orbit coupling and quantum geometry are fundamental aspects in modern condensed matter physics, with their primary manifestations in momentum space being spin textures and Berry curvature. In this work, we investigate their interplay with high-harmonic generation (HHG) in two-dimensional non-centrosymmetric materials, with an emphasis on even-order harmonics. Our analysis reveals that the emergence of finite even-order harmonics necessarily requires a broken twofold rotational symmetry in the spin texture, as well as a non-trivial Berry curvature in systems with time-reversal invariance. This symmetry breaking can arise across various degrees of freedom and impact both spin textures and optical response via spin-orbit interactions. We also show that HHG is particularly sensitive to dynamical rotational-symmetry breaking, as even high-order components can be modulated by a time-dependent symmetry breaking. These findings underscore the potential of HHG as a tool for exploring electronic phases with broken rotational symmetry, as well as the associated phase transitions in two-dimensional materials, and provide novel perspectives for designing symmetry-dependent nonlinear optical phenomena.</description>

      <title>Incommensurate gapless ferromagnetism connecting competing symmetry-enriched deconfined quantum phase transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14958v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a scenario, in which a gapless extended phase serves as a "hub" connecting multiple symmetry-enriched deconfined quantum critical points. As a concrete example, we construct a lattice model with $\mathbb{Z}^{\,}_{2}\times \mathbb{Z}^{\,}_{2}\times \mathbb{Z}^{\,}_{2}$ symmetry for quantum spin-1/2 degrees of freedom that realizes four distinct gapful phases supporting antiferromagnetic long-range order and one extended incommensurate gapless ferromagnetic phase. The quantum phase transition between any two of the four gapped and antiferromagnetic phases goes through either a (deconfined) quantum critical point, a quantum tricritical point, or the incommensurate gapless ferromagnetic phase. In this phase diagram, it is possible to interpolate between four deconfined quantum critical points by passing through the extended gapless ferromagnetic phase. We identify the phases in the model and the nature of the transitions between them through a combination of analytical arguments and density matrix renormalization group studies.</description>

      <title>Universality of the topological phase transition in the interacting Haldane model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00853v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Haldane model is a standard tight-binding model describing electrons hopping on a hexagonal lattice subject to a transverse, dipolar magnetic field. We consider its interacting version for values of the interaction strength that are small compared to the bandwidth. We study the critical case at the transition between the trivial and the `topological' insulating phases, and we rigorously establish that the transverse conductivity on the dressed critical line is quantized at a half-integer multiple of $e^2/h$: this is the average of the integer values of the Hall conductivity in the insulating phases on either side of the dressed critical line. Together with previous results, this fully characterizes the nature of the phase transition between different Hall plateaus and proves its universality with respect to many-body interactions. The proof is based on a combination of constructive renormalization group methods and exact lattice Ward identities.</description>

      <title>Generalized Modulated Symmetries in $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Topological Ordered Phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10819v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological ordered phases in 2+1 dimensions characterized by generalized modulated symmetries. Such phases have explicit realizations in terms of fixed-point Hamiltonians involving commuting projectors with support $h=3,5,7,\ldots$ in the horizontal direction, which dictates the modulation of the generalized symmetries. These symmetries are sensitive to the lattice sizes. For certain sizes, they are spontaneously broken and the ground state is degenerated, while for the remaining ones, the symmetries are explicitly broken and the ground state is unique. The ground state dependence on the lattice sizes is a manifestation of the ultraviolet/infrared (UV/IR) mixing. The structure of the modulated symmetries implies that the anyons can move only in rigid steps of size $h$, leading to the notion of position-dependent anyons. The phases exhibit rich boundary physics with a variety of gapped phases, including trivial, partial and total symmetry-breaking, and SPT phases. Effective field theory descriptions are discussed, making transparent the relation between the generalized modulated symmetries and the restrictions on anyon mobility, incorporating the boundary physics in a natural way, and showing how the short-distance details can be incorporated into the continuum by means of twisted boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Strong-coupling superconductivity near Gross-Neveu quantum criticality in Dirac systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25318v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study two-dimensional massless Dirac fermions at neutrality, coupled to bosonic modes through a Yukawa interaction. We then examine the intriguing possibility that such a system, devoid of carriers at zero temperature, might nevertheless exhibit superconductivity. Remarkably, we find that superconductivity emerges in the vicinity of Gross-Neveu quantum criticality, provided the fermions cease to behave as well-defined quasiparticles, that is, once their anomalous dimension in the normal state becomes sufficiently large. In other words, well-defined fermions do not superconduct, whereas ill-defined ones do. We analyze four symmetry-distinct bosonic modes, each capable of driving normal-state criticality and, in three of the four cases, giving rise to a distinct superconducting phase. While phase fluctuations are strong in this regime, we argue that they do not destroy the superconducting state. We further characterize the resulting pairing states for a concrete Dirac model of spin-orbit coupled systems with orbitals of different parity. Our results are obtained using the SYK-inspired framework for Dirac systems introduced by Kim et al.[1], which provides a controlled approach to the strongly coupled regime of Dirac fluids near Gross-Neveu criticality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.26607v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Holstein-Primakoff boson representation of quantum spins and associated large-$S$ expansion have been the standard framework for describing the spin wave excitations in magnetically order phases of quantum spin systems. However, we will show that the omission of projection operators and normal-ordering in this representation can produce incorrect magnon hamiltonians for finite $S$. We will present the exact normal-ordered forms of the finite-$S$ projection operators and projected Holstein-Primakoff boson representations of spin and quadrupole operators, which can produce exact two-magnon interaction terms under ferromagnetic or fully polarized states. We will also discuss the difficulties of applying this projected representation to antiferromagnetic spin wave theory.</description>

      <title>Frustrated Quantum Magnetism on Complex Networks: What Sets the Total Spin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09116v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider equal antiferromagnetic Heisenberg interactions between qubits forming a complex, nonbipartite network. We ask the question: How does the network topology determine the net magnetization of the ground state and to what extent is it tunable? By examining over 75000 networks of different families with tunable structural properties, we demonstrate that (i) heterogeneity in the number of neighbors is essential for a nonzero total spin, and (ii) apart from the number of neighbors, the key determinant is the presence of (disassortative) hubs, as opposed to the frustration level. In fact, one can vary the magnetization throughout its range by embedding such hubs. We also discuss simple, exactly solvable networks where such tunability leads to both abrupt and continuous transitions, with quantum effects giving rise to a diverging susceptibility. Our findings can be realized on emerging platforms and pose a number of fundamental questions, strongly motivating wider exploration of quantum many-body phenomena on complex networks.</description>

      <title>Holography of dislocations and ring defects in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet AdS gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18853v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study torsional topological defects in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity in ($4+1$)-dimensional anti-de Sitter spacetime. In the holographic interpretation, these correspond to crystalline dislocation defects associated with the discrete lattice translational symmetry. The Gauss-Bonnet coupling is fixed at the Chern-Simons point. By solving the equations of motion through an asymptotic expansion near the boundary, we show that the dual ($3+1$)-dimensional theory admits axially symmetric solutions. These solutions describe holographic materials with dislocation defects at finite temperature, encoded by a black hole in the bulk. At the same time, they feature ring-shaped defects arising from the background Riemann-Cartan geometry, characterized by nontrivial Burgers vectors. We also discuss the possible appearance of an odd-parity Abelian holographic anomaly, proportional to the Nieh-Yan invariant. Our results motivate further studies of holographic defects using bulk gravitational theories and support the view that torsion provides a holographic counterpart of crystalline dislocation defects.</description>

      <title>Many-body critical phase in a quasiperiodic chain and dynamical Widom lines in Fock space properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02234v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a quasiperiodic model in one dimension, namely the extended Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper (EAAH) chain, that realizes a critical phase comprising entirely single-particle critical states in the non-interacting limit. In the presence of short-range interactions, the non-interacting critical phase transforms to a many-body critical (MBC) phase, separated by lines of MBC-ergodic, MBC-many-body localized (MBL) and ergodic-MBL phase transitions that meet at a triple point. We elucidate the unusual characteristics of the MBC phase compared to the ergodic and MBL phases through the localization properties of the excitations in real space and Fock space (FS), and eigenstate inverse participation ratio (IPR). We show that the MBC phase, like the MBL phase, is well described by a multifractal scaling of the IPR and a linear finite-size scaling ansatz near the transition to the ergodic and MBL phases. However, the MBC phase, at the same time, exhibits delocalization of all single-particle excitations and a system-size dependent Fock-space localization length, analogous to the ergodic phase. Remarkably, we find evidence of unusual Widom lines on the phase diagram in the form of lines of pronounced peaks or dips in the FS localization properties inside the MBC and MBL phases. These Widom lines either emerge as a continuation of the precursor phase transition line, terminating at the triple point, or originate from a phase boundary.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06098v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Interlayer excitons in semiconducting bilayers separated by insulating hBN layers constitute a promising platform for investigation of strongly correlated bosonic phases. Here, we report an optical method for the generation and characterization of long-lived interlayer excitons. We confirm the presence of tightly bound interlayer excitons by measuring 1s and 2s intralayer excitons in each layer concurrently. Using a pump-probe technique, we find interlayer exciton lifetimes up to 8.8 $\mu$s, increasing with the thickness of the hBN. With optical access to long-lived interlayer excitons, our approach provides a new route to explore degenerate Bose--Fermi mixtures of excitons and itinerant electrons with high spatial and temporal resolution.</description>

      <title>An operator algebraic approach to fusion category symmetry on the lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05185v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a framework for fusion category symmetry on the (1+1)D lattice in the thermodynamic limit by giving a formal interpretation of SymTFT decompositions. Our approach is based on axiomatizing physical boundary subalgebra of quasi-local observables, and applying ideas from algebraic quantum field theory to derive the expected categorical structures. We show that given a physical boundary subalgebra $B$ of a quasi-local algebra $A$, there is a canonical fusion category $\mathcal{C}$ that acts on $A$ by bimodules and whose fusion ring acts by locality preserving quantum channels on the quasi-local algebra such that $B$ is recovered as the fixed point operators. We show that a fusion category can be realized as symmetries on a tensor product quasi-local algebra if and only if all of its objects have integer dimensions, and that it admits an ``on-site" action on a tensor product spin chain if and only if it admits a fiber functor. We give a formal definition of a topological symmetric state, and prove two anomaly enforced gaplessness theorems, one for internal categorical symmetries and one for anomalous duality channels. Using the first, we show that for any fusion category $\mathcal{C}$ with no fiber functor there always exist gapless pure symmetric states on an anyon chain.</description>
