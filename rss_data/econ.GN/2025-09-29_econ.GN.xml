      <title>Pattern Recognition of Illicit E-Waste Misclassification in Global Trade Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21395v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The global trade in electronic and electrical goods is complicated by the challenge of identifying e-waste, which is often misclassified to evade regulations. Traditional analysis methods struggle to discern the underlying patterns of this illicit trade within vast datasets. This research proposes and validates a robust, data-driven framework to segment products and identify goods exhibiting an anomalous "waste signature" a trade pattern defined by a clear 'inverse price-volume'. The core of the framework is an Outlier-Aware Segmentation method, an iterative K-Means approach that first isolates extreme outliers to prevent data skewing and then re-clusters the remaining products to reveal subtle market segments. To quantify risk, a "Waste Score" is developed using a Logistic Regression model that identifies products whose trade signatures are statistically similar to scrap. The findings reveal a consistent four-tier market hierarchy in both Malaysian and global datasets. A key pattern emerged from a comparative analysis: Malaysia's market structure is defined by high-volume bulk commodities, whereas the global market is shaped by high-value capital goods, indicating a unique national specialization. The framework successfully flags finished goods, such as electric generators (HS 8502), that are traded like scrap, providing a targeted list for regulatory scrutiny.</description>

      <title>Impact of government spending shocks in the Visegrad countries, 1999Q1-2019Q4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the impact of a fiscal policy spending shock on the economy of the Visegrad 4 countries. The impact is estimated with an SVAR model, and the calculations are based on 84 quarterly observations (1999Q1-2019Q4). The results suggest that fiscal expansion has a larger than usual impact in the V4 countries (except for Slovakia): the estimated long-term (5-year) cumulative spending multipliers are 0.81 for Czechia, 1.14 for Hungary, and 1.76 for Poland (the Slovakian multiplier has a value of -0.18, but it is not significant). The discussion section also connects higher spending multipliers with a higher share of VAT revenues, a higher debt ratio, higher foreign debt, and lower openness.</description>

      <title>Student perception and the efficacy of universities in shaping the entrepreneurial mindset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern universities may play a significant role in entrepreneurial ecosystems by boosting the entrepreneurial activity of the region. One way to achieve this is through entrepreneurship education. In this study we suggest that one reason why entrepreneurship education has a weak impact on entrepreneurial activity is that the effect of courses and extracurricular programmes depends on how students perceive the entrepreneurial activity. We use the 2018 GUESSS database, which includes 9,667 answers for Hungary, to develop a general linear model. The model suggests that students' entrepreneurial intentions, attitudes toward entrepreneurship, self-efficacy, social norms, as well as the university, and the field of study all have a small but statistically significant impact on how students perceive the entrepreneurial ecosystem within the university. Our conclusion is that more emphasis on shaping attitudes and arousing student interest can increase the efficiency of entrepreneurship education.</description>

      <title>The Impact of the UEFA Women's EURO on Hotel Overnight Stays: Evidence from a Causal Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The impact evaluation of female sports events remains an important yet neglected area of research. To fill this gap, this working paper provides a timely assessment of the 2025 UEFA Women's European Championship (WEURO) in Switzerland-the largest women-specific sports event in Europe with more than 657,000 spectators. Using city-level data on hotel overnight stays, we apply the Synthetic Difference-in-Differences approach of Arkhangelsky et al. (2021) to compare WEURO host cities with non-host destinations. In summary, our results do not support strong claims of large tourism impacts but rather point to a small positive effect. Sensitivity analyses also suggest positive effects. However, confidence intervals permit firm conclusions only for the main venues, indicating an increase in overnight stays of 1.6% attributable to the WEURO. Overall, our findings indicate positive but modest tourism impacts of the WEURO and outline a framework for further policy evaluation of sports events.</description>

      <title>Forecasting House Prices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article identifies the factors that drove house prices in 13 advanced countries over the past 35 years. It does so based on Breiman s (2001) random forest model. Shapley values indicate that annual house price growth across countries is explained first and foremost by price momentum, initial valuations (proxied by price to rent ratios) and household credit growth. Partial effects of explanatory variables are also elicited and suggest important non-linearities, for instance as to what concerns the effects of CPI inflation on house price growth. The out-of-sample forecast test reveals that the random forest model delivers 44% lower house price variation RMSEs and 45% lower MAEs when compared to an OLS model that uses the same set of 10 pre-determined explanatory variables. Notably, the same model works well for all countries, as the random forest attributes minimal values to country fixed effects.</description>

      <title>Persistent Gaps, Partial Gains: A Population-Level Study of COVID-19 Learning Inequalities in the Netherlands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted schooling worldwide, raising concerns about widening educational inequalities. Using population-level administrative data from the Netherlands (N = 1,471,217), this study examines how socio-economic disparities in secondary school performance evolved before, during, and after pandemic-related school closures. We analyze final central examination scores for cohorts graduating between 2017 and 2023 across four educational tracks, estimating generalized linear models with interactions between pandemic exposure and key stratification variables: parental education, household income, migration background, and urbanicity. Results show that while average performance partially recovered by 2023, inequalities by parental education and migration background persisted or intensified, particularly in vocational tracks. First-generation students with a non-Western background experienced the largest sustained losses, whereas students in rural areas (previously disadvantaged) narrowed or reversed pre-pandemic performance gaps. Findings suggest that systemic shocks can both exacerbate and recalibrate inequality patterns, depending on the socio-demographic dimension and educational context. We discuss implications for stratification theory, highlighting the role of educational pathways and local contexts in shaping resilience to crisis-induced learning disruptions.</description>

      <title>How firms, bureaucrats, and ministries benefit from the revolving door: Evidence from Japan</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A growing literature finds high returns to firms with legislative connections. Less attention has been paid to returns from bureaucratic connections and to organizations beyond for-profit firms. Using data recording the first post-bureaucracy position occupied by all former civil servants in Japan, I reveal a bifurcated job market for former bureaucrats. High-ranking officials from elite economic ministries are more likely to join for-profit firms, where they generate returns such as increased government loans and positive stock market reactions. Lower-ranking officials are more likely to join nonprofits linked to government ministries, which receive higher-value contracts when former bureaucrats are in leadership roles. These patterns suggest that while firms wish to hire bureaucrats who can deliver tangible benefits, ministries also shape revolving door pathways by directing benefits to ensure long-term career value for civil servants. These findings reframe revolving door dynamics as the result of both firm-driven demand and bureaucratic incentives.</description>

      <title>Metro 3 in Brussels under uncertainty: scenario-based public transport accessibility analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metro Line 3 in Brussels is one of Europe's most debated infrastructure projects, marked by escalating costs, delays, and uncertainty over completion. Yet no public accessibility appraisal exists to inform this policy debate. This paper provides a scenario-based assessment of the spatial and distributional accessibility impacts of Metro 3 using schedule-based public transport data. Official GTFS feeds from all regional operators were combined and adapted to represent three scenarios: (i) the current network, (ii) partial implementation of Metro 3 (conversion of the southern premetro section), and (iii) full implementation to Bordet. Accessibility was measured as public transport travel time between 647 evenly spaced 500 m points covering the Brussels-Capital Region. Simulations were conducted for morning, evening, and weekend midday periods, each with three departure times (t-10, t, t+10), capturing robustness to short-term timetable variation. Results show substantial but uneven accessibility gains, with the largest improvements occurring in neighborhoods with below-average incomes. Temporal robustness analysis highlights variability in accessibility outcomes, underscoring the need to account for uncertainty in departure timing. These findings suggest that Metro 3 has the potential to reduce socio-spatial inequalities in accessibility, providing transparent evidence for a project where public debate is dominated by cost concerns.</description>

      <title>Financial viability of social enterprises</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our study presents a model of factors influencing the financial viability of Hungarian social enterprises, and tests the model on a sample of 220 Hungarian firms involved in social entrepreneurship. In the model we suggest that the most important factors for financial viability are the Regulatory environment (the transparency of regulations); the Entrepreneurial attributes of the entrepreneur (business orientation, business skills and experience, business planning tendencies); the Financial support provided by the environment (the ratio of grants, donations and subsidies within the total revenues of the firm); and the Strategy followed by the firms (the presence of such generic strategies as cost leadership or differentiation). We find that only two of the model's four factors are significantly associated with Financial viability: Entrepreneurial attributes and Financial support. The results suggest that the best way of strengthening the viability of social enterprises is through entrepreneurship training (to enhance the business skills and experience of the entrepreneurs, and to propagate business planning), and to provide grants and subsidies to these firms. As no significant association was found between Financial viability and Strategy, we can conclude that the role of market competition is probably relatively week among Hungarian social enterprises.</description>

      <title>Reimagining Agent-based Modeling with Large Language Model Agents via Shachi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21862v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of emergent behaviors in large language model (LLM)-driven multi-agent systems is a critical research challenge, yet progress is limited by a lack of principled methodologies for controlled experimentation. To address this, we introduce Shachi, a formal methodology and modular framework that decomposes an agent's policy into core cognitive components: Configuration for intrinsic traits, Memory for contextual persistence, and Tools for expanded capabilities, all orchestrated by an LLM reasoning engine. This principled architecture moves beyond brittle, ad-hoc agent designs and enables the systematic analysis of how specific architectural choices influence collective behavior. We validate our methodology on a comprehensive 10-task benchmark and demonstrate its power through novel scientific inquiries. Critically, we establish the external validity of our approach by modeling a real-world U.S. tariff shock, showing that agent behaviors align with observed market reactions only when their cognitive architecture is appropriately configured with memory and tools. Our work provides a rigorous, open-source foundation for building and evaluating LLM agents, aimed at fostering more cumulative and scientifically grounded research.</description>

      <title>Impact IRR: Leveraging Modern Portfolio Theory to Define Impact Investments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The impact investment market has an estimated value of almost $1.6 trillion. Significant progress has been made in determining the financial returns of impact investing. Investors are still, however, in the early stages of determining impact return. In this study, the author proposes the use of impact internal rate of return (impact IRR) to evaluate and monitor impact investments. This approach, which utilizes components of modern portfolio theory, adapted financial tools, and existing datasets, is demonstrated herein through initial use cases and examples showing how it can be employed to optimize impact.</description>
