      <title>Ordinarization numbers of numerical semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There has been significant recent interest in studying how the number of numerical semigroups of genus $g$ behaves as a function of $g$. Bras-Amor\'os has shown how to organize the collection of numerical semigroups of genus $g$ into a rooted tree called the ordinarization tree. The ordinarization number of a numerical semigroup $S$ is the length of the path from $S$ back to the root of the tree. We study the problem of counting numerical semigroups of genus $g$ with a fixed ordinarization number $r$. We show how this can be interpreted as a counting problem about integer points in a certain rational polyhedral cone and use ideas from Ehrhart theory to study this problem. We give a formula for the number of numerical semigroups of genus $g$ and ordinarization number $2$, building on the corresponding result of Bras-Amor\'os for ordinarization number $1$. We show that the ordinarization number of a numerical semigroup generated by two elements is equal to the number of integer points in a certain right triangle with rational vertices. We consider the analogous problem for supersymmetric numerical semigroups with more generators. We also study ordinarization numbers of numerical semigroups generated by an interval.</description>

      <title>Suns in triangle-free graphs of large chromatic number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For an integer $t\geq 4$, a $t$-sun is a graph obtained from a $t$-vertex cycle $C$ by adding a degree-one neighbor for each vertex of $C$. Trotignon asked whether every triangle-free graph of sufficiently large chromatic number has an induced subgraph that is a $t$-sun for some $t\geq 4$. This remains open, but we show that every triangle-free graph of chromatic number at least $44$ has an induced subgraph that is either a $t$-sun for some $t\geq 5$, or a $4$-sun with a single degree-one vertex deleted. In fact, we prove that for all $\ell\geq 5$, there exists $c=c(\ell)\in \mathbb{N}$ such that every triangle-free graph of chromatic number at least $c$ has an induced subgraph that is either a $t$-sun for some $t\geq \ell$, or a $4$-sun with a single degree-one vertex deleted.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{D}$ be a non-trivial quasi-symmetric $2$-design with two block intersection numbers $x=0$ and $2\leq y\leq10$, and suppose that $G$ is an automorphism group of $\mathcal{D}$. If $G$ is flag-transitive and point-primitive, then it is known that $G$ is either of affine type or almost simple type. In this paper, we show that the socle of $G$ cannot be a finite simple exceptional group of Lie type.</description>

Abstract: We introduce the notion of doubling and r-tupling for simplicial complexes, a notion reminiscent to that of matching complexes in graph theory. We prove a connectivity result for such complexes and relate r-tupling to stabilizing r times faster in homological stability.</description>

      <title>The Ramsey number of the 4-cycle versus a book graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given positive integers $n$ and $k$, the book graph $B_n^{(k)}$ consists of $n$ copies of $K_{k+1}$ sharing a common $K_k$. The book graph is a common generalization of a star and a clique, which can be seen by taking $k=1$ and $n=1$ respectively. In addition, the Ramsey number of a book graph is closely related to the diagonal Ramsey number. Thus the study of extremal problems related to the book graph is of substantial significance. In this paper, we aim to investigate the Ramsey number $r(C_4,B_n^{(k)})$ which is the smallest integer $N$ such that for any graph $G$ on $N$ vertices, either $G$ contains $C_4$ as a subgraph or the complement $\overline{G}$ contains $B_n^{(k)}$ as a subgraph. For $k=1$, a pioneer work by Parsons ({\it Trans.~Amer.~Math.~Soc.,} 209 (1975), 33--44) gives an upper bound for $r(C_4,B_n^{(1)})$, which is tight for infinitely many $n$. For $k=2$, in a recent paper ({\em J. Graph Theory,} 103 (2023), 309--322), the second, the third, and the fourth authors obtained the exact value of $r(C_4,B_{n}^{(2)})$ for infinitely many $n$. The goal of this paper is to prove a similar result for each integer $k \geq 3$. To be precise, given an integer $k \geq 3$ and a constant $0&lt;\varepsilon&lt;1$, let $n=q^2-kq+t+\binom{k}{2}-k$ and $Q(k,\varepsilon)=(320k^4)^{k+1}/\varepsilon^{2k}$, where $1 \leq t \leq (1-\varepsilon)q$. We first establish an upper bound for $r(C_4,B_n^{(k)})$ provided $q \geq Q(k,\varepsilon)$. Then we show the upper bound is tight for $q \geq Q(k,\varepsilon)$ being a prime power and $1 \leq t \leq (1-\varepsilon)q$ under some assumptions. The proof leverages on a simple but novel refinement of a well-known inequality related to a $C_4$-free graph. Therefore, for each $k \geq 3$, we obtain the exact value of $r(C_4,B_n^{(k)})$ for infinitely many $n$. Moreover, we prove general upper and lower bounds of $r(C_4,B_n^{(k)})$ for $k \geq 3$.</description>

      <title>On the $4$-clique cover number of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1966, Erd\H{o}s, Goodman, and P\'osa proved that $\lfloor n^2/4 \rfloor$ cliques are sufficient to cover all edges in any $n$-vertex graph, with tightness achieved by the balanced complete bipartite graph. This result was generalized by Dau, Milenkovic, and Puleo, who showed that at most $\lfloor \frac n 3 \rfloor \lfloor \frac {n+1} 3 \rfloor \lfloor \frac {n+2} 3 \rfloor$ cliques are needed to cover all triangles in any $n$-vertex graph $G$, and the bound is best possible as witnessed by the balanced complete tripartite graph. They further conjectured that for $t \geq 4$, the $t$-clique cover number is maximized by the Tur\'an graph $T_{n,t}$. We confirm their conjecture for $t=4$ using novel techniques, including inductive frameworks, greedy partition method, local adjustments, and clique-counting lemmas by Erd\H{o}s and by Moon and Moser.</description>

      <title>Structural Properties and Adjacency Spectrum of Coprime Graph of Integers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $TCG_n$ denote the coprime graph having vertex set $\{1,2,\ldots,n\}$ with any two vertices $i,j$ being adjacent if and only if $\gcd(i,j)=1$. In this article, we first study some structural properties of $TCG_n$. We study the vertex connectivity and crossing number of the coprime graph of integers. We discover a lower constraint on the multiplicity of $-1$, which appears as an eigenvalue in the adjacency matrix of $TCG_n$. We demonstrate our findings with a variety of cases. We also show that the adjacency matrix of $TCG_n$ is singular, i.e. has determinant $0$. Furthermore, we give a lower bound on the multiplicity of $0$, which appears as an eigenvalue in the adjacency matrix of $TCG_n$. Finally, we establish that the greatest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix of $TCG_n$ is always above $2.$</description>

      <title>Counting Small Cycle Double Covers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A theorem due to Seyffarth states that every planar $4$-connected $n$-vertex graph has a cycle double cover (CDC) containing at most $n-1$ cycles (a "small" CDC). We extend this theorem by proving that, in fact, such a graph must contain linearly many small CDCs (in terms of $n$), and provide stronger results in the case of planar $4$-connected triangulations. We complement this result with constructions of planar $4$-connected graphs which contain at most polynomially many small CDCs. Thereafter we treat cubic graphs, strengthening a lemma of Hu\v{s}ek and \v{S}\'amal on the enumeration of CDCs, and, motivated by a conjecture of Bondy, give an alternative proof of the result that every planar 2-connected cubic graph on $n &gt; 4$ vertices has a CDC of size at most $n/2$. Our proof is much shorter and obtained by combining a decomposition based argument, which might be of independent interest, with further combinatorial insights. Some of our results are accompanied by a version thereof for CDCs containing no cycle twice.</description>

      <title>The Classification of Graphs on $8$ vertices with Coinciding Zero Forcing number and Maximum Nullity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the minimum rank of a (simple, undirected) graph, which is the minimum rank among all matrices in a space determined by the graph. We determine the exact set of graphs on eight vertices for which the nullity of a minimum rank matrix does not coincide with a bound determined by the zero forcing number of a graph. Although our goal was to determine which eight-vertex graphs satisfy maximum nullity equal to the zero forcing number, we also established several additional methods to assist in the computation of minimum rank for general graphs.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic methods of finite discrete structures. Topological graph drawing (part III)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The manuscript considers mathematical models for creating a topological drawing of a graph based on the methods of G. Ringel's vertex rotation theory. An algorithm is presented for generating a topological drawing of a flat part of a graph based on the selection of a basis for the cycle subspace C(G) using the Monte Carlo method. A steepest descent method for constructing a topological drawing of a flat subgraph is described in the manuscript. The topological drawing of a graph is constructed using a combination of the methods of vector intersection algebra developed by L. I. Rapport. Three stages of constructing a flat subgraph of a non-separable graph are described. The issues of constructing a Hamiltonian cycle based on constructing a flat subgraph are considered. A new method for constructing a Hamiltonian cycle of a graph based on the cycle graph of a flat subgraph is described.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show coordinate rings of open Richardson varieties are upper cluster algebras for any symmetrizable Kac--Moody type. We further show the coordinate rings of (generalized) open Richardson varieties on the twisted product of flag varieties are upper cluster algebras for any symmetrizable Kac--Moody type. This includes, as special cases, reduced double Bruhat cells, Bott-Samelson varieties, braid varieties. Our results generalize various results by Casals--Gorsky--Gorsky--Le--Shen--Simental and Galashin--Lam--Sherman-Bennett--Speyer in finite types.</description>

      <title>Groups represented by incidence geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to use the framework of incidence geometry to develop a theory that permits to model both the inner and outer automorphisms of a group G simultaneously. More precisely, to any group G, we attempt to associate an incidence system whose group of type-preserving automorphisms is Inn(G), the group of inner automorphisms of G, and whose full group of automorphisms is the group Out(G) of outer automorphisms of G, getting what we call an incidence geometric representation theory for groups. Hence, in this setting, the group Inn(G) preserves the types of the associated incidence structure while the group Out(G) is acting non-trivially on the typeset of it, realizing the outer automorphisms of G as correlations. We give examples of incidence geometric representations for the dihedral groups, the symmetric groups, the automorphism groups of the five platonic solids, families of classical groups defined over fields such as the projective linear groups, and finally subgroups of free groups whose outer automorphism group is the largest finite subgroup of their automorphism group.</description>

      <title>Contributions to conjectures in planar graphs: Induced Substructures, Treewidth, and Dominating Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two of the most prominent unresolved conjectures in graph theory, the Albertson-Berman conjecture and the Matheson-Tarjan conjecture, have been extensively studied by many researchers.
  (AB) Every planar graph of order $n$ has an induced forest of order at least $\frac{n}{2}$.
  (MT) Every plane triangulation of sufficiently large order $n$ has a dominating set of cardinality at most $\frac{n}{4}$.
  Although partial results and weaker bounds than those originally conjectured have been obtained, both problems remain open. To contribute to their resolution, various generalizations and variations of the original concepts have been investigated, such as total dominating set, induced linear forests, and others. In this paper, we clarify the relations among several notions related to these two major conjectures, such as connected domination and induced outerplanar subgraphs, etc., and survey the associated conjectures. We then provide counterexamples to some of these conjectures and establish the best bounds on the gap between the maximum orders of induced subgraphs under different structural conditions. In addition, we present a general upper bound on the order of induced subgraphs in terms of treewidth, a fundamental graph invariant.</description>

      <title>Circulant TSP: Vertices of the Edge-Length Polytope and Superpolynomial Lower Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the edge-length polytope, motivated both by algorithmic research on the Circulant Traveling Salesman Problem (Circulant TSP) and number-theoretic research related to the Buratti-Horak-Rosa conjecture. Circulant TSP is a special case of TSP whose overall complexity is a significant still-open question, and where on an input with vertices $\{1, 2, ..., n\}$, the cost of an edge $\{i, j\}$ depends only on its length $\min\{|i-j|, n-|i-j|\}$. The edge-length polytope provides one path to solving circulant TSP instances, and we show that it is intimately connected to the factorization of $n$: the number of vertices scales with $n$ whenever $n$ is prime and with $n^{3/2}$ whenever $n$ is a prime-squared, but there are a superpolynomial number of vertices whenever $n$ is a power of 2. In contrast, the more-standard Symmetric TSP Polytope has roughly $n!$ vertices. Hence, for Circulant TSP, a brute-force algorithm checking every vertex is actually efficient in some cases, based on the factorization of $n$. As an intermediate step, we give superpolynomial lower-bounds on two combinatorial sequences related to the Buratti-Horak-Rosa conjecture, which asks what combinations of edge lengths can comprise a Hamiltonian path.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coalescent models of bifurcating genealogies are used to infer evolutionary parameters from molecular data. However, there are many situations where bifurcating genealogies do not accurately reflect the true underlying ancestral history of samples, and a multifurcating genealogy is required. The space of multifurcating genealogical trees, where nodes can have more than two descendants, is largely underexplored in the setting of coalescent inference. In this paper, we examine the space of rooted, ranked, and unlabeled multifurcating trees. We recursively enumerate the space and then construct a partial ordering which induces a lattice on the space of multifurcating ranked tree shapes. The lattice structure lends itself naturally to defining Markov chains that permit exploration on the space of multifurcating ranked tree shapes. Finally, we prove theoretical bounds for the mixing time of two Markov chains defined on the lattice, and we present simulation results comparing the distribution of trees and tree statistics under various coalescent models to the uniform distribution on this tree space.</description>

      <title>The Bruhat Order on Symmetric Groups via Intrinsic Coverings of Compositions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2202.00835v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lehmer's code defines a bijection between the symmetric group and the set of staircase compositions. In this paper, we characterize a poset structure on these compositions that is equivalent to the strong Bruhat order on the symmetric group. This construction is intrinsic and does not require any reference to the associated permutations.</description>

      <title>The Leaf Function of Penrose P2 Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08262v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a graph-theoretic problem in the Penrose P2-graphs which are the dual graphs of Penrose tilings by kites and darts. Using substitutions, local isomorphism and other properties of Penrose tilings, we construct a family of arbitrarily large induced subtrees of Penrose graphs with the largest possible number of leaves for a given number $n$ of vertices. These subtrees are called fully leafed induced subtrees. We denote their number of leaves $L_{P2}(n)$ for any non-negative integer $n$, and the sequence $\left(L_{P2}(n)\right)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ is called the leaf function of Penrose P2-graphs. We present exact and recursive formulae for $L_{P2}(n)$, as well as an infinite sequence of fully leafed induced subtrees, which are caterpillar graphs. In particular, our proof relies on the construction of a finite graded poset of 3-internal-regular subtrees.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18177v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a connected graph $G$, its resistance distance matrix is denoted by $R(G)$. A graph is called resistance regular if all the row (or column) sums of $R(G)$ are equal. We provide a necessary and sufficient condition for a simple connected graph to be resistance regular. Additionally, we establish sharp bounds for the resistance spectral radius and present various bounds for the resistance energy of $G$. Furthermore, we compute the resistance spectrum and resistance energy of some resistance regular graphs.</description>

      <title>Root polytopes, flow polytopes, and order polytopes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15803v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study the class of polytopes which can be obtained by taking the convex hull of some subset of the points $\{e_i-e_j \ \vert \ i \neq j\} \cup \{\pm e_i\}$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$, where $e_1,\dots,e_n$ is the standard basis of $\mathbb{R}^n$. Such a polytope can be encoded by a quiver $Q$ with vertices $V \subseteq \{v_1,\dots,v_n\} \cup \{\star\}$, where each edge $v_j\to v_i$ or $\star \to v_i$ or $v_i\to \star$ gives rise to the point $e_i-e_j$ or $e_i$ or $-e_i$, respectively; we denote the corresponding polytope as $\operatorname{Root}(Q)$. These polytopes have been studied extensively under names such as edge polytope and root polytope. We show that if the quiver $Q$ is strongly-connected then the root polytope $\operatorname{Root}(Q)$ is reflexive and terminal; we moreover give a combinatorial description of the facets of $\operatorname{Root}(Q)$. We also show that if $Q$ is planar, then $\operatorname{Root}(Q)$ is (integrally equivalent to the) polar dual of the flow polytope of the dual quiver. Finally we consider the case that $Q$ comes from a ranked poset $P$, and show that $\operatorname{Root}(Q)$ is polar dual to (a translation of) a marked poset polytope. We then study the toric variety $Y(\mathcal{F}_Q)$ associated to the face fan $\mathcal{F}_Q$ of $\operatorname{Root}(Q)$. If $Q$ comes from a ranked poset $P$ we give a combinatorial description of the Picard group of $Y(\mathcal{F}_Q)$, and we show that $Y(\mathcal{F}_Q)$ is a small partial desingularisation of the Hibi toric variety $Y_{\mathcal{O}(P)}$ of the order polytope $\mathcal{O}(P)$. We show that $Y(\mathcal{F}_Q)$ has a small crepant toric resolution of singularities $Y(\widehat{\mathcal{F}}_Q)$, and as a consequence that the Hibi toric variety $Y_{\mathcal{O}(P)}$ has a small resolution of singularities for any ranked poset $P$. These results have applications to mirror symmetry.</description>

      <title>$L^p$ averages of the Fourier transform in finite fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08589v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Fourier transform plays a central role in many geometric and combinatorial problems cast in vector spaces over finite fields. If a set admits optimal $L^\infty$ bounds on its Fourier transform (that is, it is a Salem set), then it can often be analysed more easily. However, in many cases obtaining good \emph{uniform} bounds is not possible, even if `most' points admit good pointwise bounds. Motivated by this, we propose a framework where one systematically studies the $L^p$ averages of the Fourier transform and keeps track of how good the $L^p$ bounds are as a function of $p$. This captures more nuanced information about a set than, for example, asking whether it is Salem or not. We explore this idea by considering several examples and find that a rich theory emerges. Further, we provide various applications of this approach; including to sumset type problems, the finite fields distance conjecture, and the problem of counting $k$-simplices inside a given set. Our typical application is of the form: if a set admits good $L^p$ bounds on its Fourier transform, then we are able to make strong geometric conclusions.</description>

      <title>New infinite families of uniformly packed near-MDS codes and multiple coverings, based on the ternary Golay code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10223v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present five new infinite families of linear near-MDS codes uniformly packed in the wide sense (UPWS). These codes are also almost perfect multiple coverings of the deep holes or farthest-off points (APMCF), i.e.\ the vectors lying at distance $R$ (covering radius) from the code. The families are constructed by $m$-lifting when one takes a starting code $C$ over the ground Galois field $\F_q$ with a parity check matrix $H(C)$ and then considers the codes $C_m$ over $F_{q^m}$, $m\ge2$, with the same parity check matrix $H(C)$. As starting codes we used the ternary perfect Golay code and codes obtained by its extension and puncturing. To prove the needed combinatorial properties (UPWS and APMCF), we used the $m$-lifting of the dual codes and features of near-MDS codes. A general theorem on infinite families of UPWS near-MDS codes is proved.</description>

      <title>Regularities of Typical Sigma Index on Caterpillar Trees of Pendent Vertices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10469v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a study of topological indices according to caterpillar trees through Albertson index $\operatorname{irr}(G)=\sum_{\operatorname{ur\in E}(G)}\left|d_G(u)-d_G(v)\right|$ and the sigma index and total sigma index $\sigma_{t}(G)=\sum_{1\leq i &lt; j \leq n} (d_{i}-d_{j})^{2}$, which analyses the maximum and minimum values for specific graph properties under certain restrictions of caterpillar tree, where albertson index on caterpillar tree define as $\operatorname{irr}(C(n,m))=\sum_{n=3, m=3}(m-2)(10n-1)$.
  Through the election of these topological indices, we provide efficient models of these indices on caterpillar trees, as it is known that the Albertson index is the basis on which most of the topological indices are built and we have shown this through the close correlation between the Albertson's index and the Sigma index.</description>

      <title>Every Non-regular Subcubic Graph is (1,1,2,2)-Packing Colorable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20239v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a non-decreasing sequence of integers $S=(s_1,s_2, \dots, s_k)$, an $S$-packing coloring of $G$ is a partition of $V(G)$ into $k$ subsets $V_1,V_2,\dots,V_k$ such that the distance between any two distinct vertices $x,y \in V_i$ is at least $s_{i}+1$, $1\leq i\leq k$. Gastinau and Togni posed the question of whether every subcubic graph admits a $(1,1,2,2)$-packing coloring, except for the Petersen graph, which admits a $(1, 1, 2,2, 3)$-packing coloring. While several studies have investigated this question for special classes of subcubic graphs, a complete solution remains open. In this paper, we make progress toward answering this question by proving that every non-regular subcubic graph is $(1,1,2,2)$-packing colorable.</description>

      <title>On the Regularity, Planarity and Edge Bounds of Link-irregular Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21916v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A graph $G$ is a link-irregular graph if every two distinct vertices of $G$ have non-isomorphic links. The link of a vertex $v$ in $G$ is the subgraph induced by the neighbors of $v$ in $G$. Ali, Chartrand and Zhang [Discussiones Mathematicae. Graph Theory, 45(1) (2025) p.95] conjectured that there exists no regular link-irregular graph. In this paper, we show that the existence of an $r$-regular link irregular graph is very likely for large enough $r$. In particular, we provide a 7-regular link irregular graph on 12 vertices, which serves as a counterexample to the conjecture. Additionally, we prove that no bipartite link-irregular graphs exist, and there are no regular link-irregular graphs on $n$-vertices for $n \leq 9$. Also, we determine upper and lower bounds for the number of edges of link-irregular graphs. Furthermore, we show the minimum number of edges in a link-irregular graph on the $n$ vertices is $\Omega(n\sqrt{\log n})$. Finally, we prove that all but finitely many link-irregular graphs are non-planar, and there is no regular link-irregular planar graphs.</description>

      <title>Coloring graphs as complete graph invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20978v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the extent to which the $k$-coloring graph $\mathcal{C}_{k}(G)$ uniquely determines the base graph $G$ and the number of colors $k$. The vertices of $\mathcal{C}_{k}(G)$ are the proper $k$-colorings of $G$, and edges connect colorings that differ on exactly one vertex. There are nonisomorphic graphs $G_1$ and $G_2$ with isomorphic coloring graphs, so $\mathcal{C}_{k}(G)$ is not a complete invariant in general. However, for color palettes with surplus colors (when the number of colors $k$ is greater than the chromatic number), we prove that the coloring graph is a complete invariant. Specifically, provided that $k_1 &gt; \chi(G_1)$, we show that $\mathcal{C}_{k_1}(G_1)\cong \mathcal{C}_{k_2}(G_2)$ implies $G_1\cong G_2$ and $k_1=k_2$. Thus, there is a natural bijection between pairs $(G, k)$ with $k &gt; \chi(G)$ and their coloring graphs $\mathcal{C}_k(G)$. Furthermore, no coloring graph of the form $\mathcal{C}_{\chi(G)}(G)$ is isomorphic to a coloring graph with surplus colors. Our constructive proof provides a method to decide whether a coloring graph is generated with surplus colors, although the resulting algorithms are inefficient.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21093v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A bull is a graph obtained from a four-vertex path by adding a vertex adjacent to the two middle vertices of the path. A graph $G$ is bull-free if no induced subgraph of $G$ is a bull. We prove that for all $k,t\in \mathbb{N}$, if $G$ is a bull-free graph of clique number at most $k$ and every triangle-free induced subgraph of $G$ has chromatic number at most $t$, then $G$ has chromatic number at most $k^{\mathcal{O}(\log t)}$. We further show that the bound $k^{\mathcal{O}(\log t)}$ is best possible up to a multiplicative constant in the exponent.
  Thomass\'{e}, Trotignon and Vu\v{s}kovi\'{c} (2017) were the first to give a bound, of the form $2^{p\log p}$ where $p=\mathcal{O}(k^2+t)$, with a proof that uses Chudnovsky's structure theorem for bull-free graphs. This was improved by Chudnovsky, Cook, Davies and Oum (2023) to a bound that is polynomial in $k$ (of degree linear in $t$), with a 10-page proof that again relies heavily on Chudnovsky's structure theorem.
  Our proof is a single page long and completely avoids the structure theorem; instead using only one result of Chudnovsky and Safra (which itself has a short proof).</description>

      <title>Star decompositions via orientations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05194v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A $k$-star decomposition of a graph is a partition of its edges into $k$-stars (i.e., $k$ edges with a common vertex). The paper studies the following problem: given $k \leq d/2$, does the random $d$-regular graph have a $k$-star decomposition (asymptotically almost surely, provided that the number of edges is divisible by $k$)? Delcourt, Greenhill, Isaev, Lidick\'y, and Postle proved the a.a.s. existence for every odd $k$ using earlier results regarding orientations satisfying certain degree conditions modulo $k$.
  In this paper we give a direct, self-contained proof that works for every $d$ and every $k&lt;d/2-1$. In fact, we prove stronger results. Let $s\geq 1$ denote the integer part of $d/(2k)$. We show that the random $d$-regular graph a.a.s. has a $k$-star decomposition such that the number of stars centered at each vertex is either $s$ or $s+1$. Moreover, if $k &lt; d/3$ or $k \leq d/2 - 2.6 \log d$, we can even prescribe the set of vertices with $s$ stars, as long as it is of the appropriate size.</description>

Abstract: We describe the twisted $K$-polynomial of multiplicity-free varieties in a multiprojective setting. More precisely, for multiplicity-free varieties, we show that the support of the twisted $K$-polynomial is a generalized polymatroid. As applications, we show that the support of the M\"obius function of a linear polymatroid is a generalized polymatroid, and we settle a conjecture of Monical, Tokcan and Yong regarding Grothendieck polynomials for the case of zero-one Schubert polynomials.</description>

      <title>The Packing Chromatic Number of the Infinite Square Grid is 15</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.09757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.09757v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A packing $k$-coloring is a natural variation on the standard notion of graph $k$-coloring, where vertices are assigned numbers from $\{1, \ldots, k\}$, and any two vertices assigned a common color $c \in \{1, \ldots, k\}$ need to be at a distance greater than $c$ (as opposed to $1$, in standard graph colorings). Despite a sequence of incremental work, determining the packing chromatic number of the infinite square grid has remained an open problem since its introduction in 2002. We culminate the search by proving this number to be 15. We achieve this result by improving the best-known method for this problem by roughly two orders of magnitude. The most important technique to boost performance is a novel and surprisingly effective propositional encoding. Additionally, we developed a new symmetry-breaking method. Since both new techniques are more complex than existing techniques for this problem, a verified approach is required to trust them. We include both techniques in a proof of unsatisfiability, reducing the trusted core to the correctness of the direct encoding.</description>

      <title>Faces of homogeneous cones and applications to homogeneous chordality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09581v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A convex cone $\mathcal{K}$ is said to be homogeneous if its group of automorphisms acts transitively on its relative interior. Important examples of homogeneous cones include symmetric cones and cones of positive semidefinite (PSD) matrices that follow a sparsity pattern given by a homogeneous chordal graph. Our goal in this paper is to elucidate the facial structure of homogeneous cones and make it as transparent as the faces of the PSD matrices. We prove that each face of a homogeneous cone $\mathcal{K}$ is mapped by an automorphism of $\mathcal{K}$ to one of its finitely many so-called principal faces. Furthermore, constructing such an automorphism can be done algorithmically by making use of a generalized Cholesky decomposition. Among other consequences, we give a proof that homogeneous cones are projectionally exposed, which strengthens the previous best result that they are amenable. Using our results, we will carefully analyze the facial structure of cones of PSD matrices satisfying homogeneous chordality and discuss consequences for the corresponding family of PSD completion problems.</description>

Abstract: Pure states correspond to one-dimensional subspaces of $\mathbb{C}^n$ represented by unit vectors. In this paper, we develop the theory of perfect state transfer (PST) between real pure states with emphasis on the adjacency and Laplacian matrices as Hamiltonians of a graph representing a quantum spin network. We characterize PST between real pure states based on the spectral information of a graph and prove three fundamental results: (i) every periodic real pure state $\mathbf{x}$ admits perfect state transfer with another real pure state $\mathbf{y}$, (ii) every connected graph admits perfect state transfer between real pure states, and (iii) for any pair of real pure states $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$ and for any time $\tau$, there exists a real symmetric matrix $M$ such that $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$ admits perfect state transfer relative to $M$ at time $\tau$. We also determine all real pure states that admit PST in complete graphs, complete bipartite graphs, paths, and cycles. This leads to a complete characterization of pair and plus state transfer in paths and complete bipartite graphs. We give constructions of graphs that admit PST between real pure states. Finally, using results on the spread of graphs, we prove that amongst all $n$-vertex simple unweighted graphs, the least minimum PST time between real pure states relative to the Laplacian is attained by any join graph, while the it is attained by the join of an empty graph and a complete graph of appropriate sizes relative to the adjacency matrix.</description>
