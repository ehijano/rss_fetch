      <title>Heat Kernel Approach to the Weyl Law for Schr\"odinger Operators on Non-compact Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a previous work by the authors, the heat kernel expansion for Schr\"odinger-type operators on noncompact manifolds was studied. Motivated by that work, this paper studies Weyl's law and the semiclassical Weyl's law for Schr\"odinger operators of the form $\Delta + V$ and $\hbar^2\Delta + V$ on noncompact complete manifolds with bounded geometry. We assume that the potential $V(x)$ satisfies certain H\"older continuity conditions and tends to $+\infty$ as $x$ approaches infinity.</description>

      <title>Mean Curvature Flow for Isoparametric Submanifolds in Hyperbolic Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mean curvature flows of isoparametric submanifolds in Euclidean spaces and spheres have been studied by Liu and Terng in \cite{X.CT} and \cite{X.C}. In particular, it was proved that such flows always have ancient solutions. This is also true for mean curvature flows of isoparametric hypersurfaces in hyperbolic spaces by a result of Reis and Tenenblat in \cite{S.H.T}. In this paper, we study mean curvature flows of isoparametric submanifolds in hyperbolic spaces with arbitrary codimension. In particular, we will show that they always have ancient solutions and study their limiting behaviors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time derivatives of pullbacks and push forwards along smooth curves of diffeomorphism of sections of natural vector bundles are computed in terms of Lie derivatives along adapted non-autonomous vector fields by extending a key lemma in [Markus Mauhart, Peter W. Michor: Commutators of flows and fields. Arch. Math. (Brno) 28 (1992), 228-236. arXiv:math/9204221]. There is also the analogous result about the first non-vanishing derivative of higher order.</description>

      <title>On the approximation of the Riemannian barycenter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a method to compute an approximate Riemannian barycenter of a collection of points lying on a Riemannian manifold. Our approach relies on the use of theoretically proven under- and overapproximations of the Riemannian distance function. We compare it to the exact computation of the Riemannian barycenter and to an approach that approximates the Riemannian logarithm using lifting maps. Experiments are conducted on the Stiefel manifold.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the notion of hyperbolic ellipsoids in hyperbolic space is introduced. Using a natural orthogonal projection from hyperbolic space to Euclidean space, we establish affine isoperimetric type inequalities for static convex domains in hyperbolic space. Moreover, equality of such inequalities is characterized by these hyperbolic ellipsoids.</description>

      <title>$\eta$-Einstein Sasakian Lie algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study $\eta$-Einstein Sasakian structures on Lie algebras, that is, Sasakian structures whose associated Ricci tensor satisfies an Einstein-like condition. We divide into the cases in which the Lie algebra's centre is non-trivial (and necessarily one-dimensional) and those where it is zero. In the former case we show that any Sasakian structure on a unimodular Lie algebra is $\eta$-Einstein. As for centreless Sasakian Lie algebras, we devise a complete characterisation under certain dimensional assumptions regarding the action of the Reeb vector. Using this result, together with the theory of normal $j$-algebras and modifications of Hermitian Lie algebras, we construct new examples of $\eta$-Einstein Sasakian Lie algebras and solvmanifolds, and provide effective restrictions for their existence.</description>

      <title>Minimization of Curve Length through Energy Minimization using Finite Difference and Numerical Integration in Real Coordinate Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The problem of determining the minimal length is garnering attention in various fields such as computer vision, robotics, and machine learning. One solution to this problem involves linearly interpolating the solution of a nonlinear optimization problem that approximates the curve's energy minimization problem using finite differences and numerical integration. This method tends to be easier to implement compared to others. However, it was previously unknown whether this approach successfully minimizes the curve's length under the Riemannian metric in real coordinate spaces. In this paper, we prove that the length of a curve obtained by linear interpolation of the solution to an optimization problem, where the energy of the curve is approximated using finite differences and the trapezoidal rule, converges to the minimal curve length at a rate of $1/2$ in terms of the number of points used in the numerical integration. Similarly, we prove that when using the left-point rule, the approximated curve's length likewise converges to the minimal curve length at a rate of $1/2$ in terms of the number of points used in the numerical integration.</description>

      <title>On GKM fiber bundles and realizability with full flag fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate under which conditions an equivariant fiber bundle whose base, total space and fiber are GKM manifolds induces a fibration or fiber bundle of the corresponding GKM graphs. In particular, we give several counterexamples. Concerning the converse direction, i.e., the realization problem for fiber bundles of GKM graphs, we restrict to the setting of fiberwise signed GKM fiber bundles over $n$-gons whose fiber is the GKM graph of a full flag manifold. While it was known that any such bundle is realizable for a $\mathbb{CP}^1$-fiber, we observe that new phenomena occur in higher dimensions where realizability depends on the twist automorphism of the GKM fiber bundle. We classify possible twist isomorphsims and show that realizability can be decided in terms of our classification.</description>

      <title>An equivalence theorem for algebraic and functorial QFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a novel approach to functorial quantum field theories (FQFTs) in the context of Lorentzian geometry. The key challenge is that globally hyperbolic Lorentzian bordisms between two Cauchy surfaces cannot change the topology of the Cauchy surface. This is addressed and solved by introducing a more flexible concept of bordisms which provide morphisms from tuples of causally disjoint partial Cauchy surfaces to a later-in-time full Cauchy surface. They assemble into a globally hyperbolic Lorentzian bordism pseudo-operad, generalizing the geometric bordism pseudo-categories of Stolz and Teichner. The associated FQFTs are defined as pseudo-multifunctors into a symmetric monoidal category of unital associative algebras. The main result of this paper is an equivalence theorem between such globally hyperbolic Lorentzian FQFTs and algebraic quantum field theories (AQFTs), both subject to the time-slice axiom and a mild descent condition called additivity.</description>

Abstract: We study the nature of finite-time singularities for the Chern-Ricci flow, partially answering a question of Tosatti-Weinkove. We show that a solution of degenerate parabolic complex Monge-Amp\`ere equations starting from arbitrarily positive (1,1)-currents are smooth outside some analytic subset, generalizing works by Di Nezza-Lu. We extend Guedj-Lu's recent approach to establish uniform a priori estimates for degenerate complex Monge-Amp\`ere equations on compact Hermitian manifolds. We apply it to studying the Chern-Ricci flows on complex log terminal varieties starting from an arbitrary current.</description>

      <title>On the existence of critical compatible metrics on contact $3$-manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.15833v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We disprove the generalized Chern-Hamilton conjecture on the existence of critical compatible metrics on contact $3$-manifolds. More precisely, we show that a contact $3$-manifold $(M,\alpha)$ admits a critical compatible metric for the Chern-Hamilton energy functional if and only if it is Sasakian or its associated Reeb flow is $C^\infty$-conjugate to an algebraic Anosov flow modeled on $\widetilde{SL}(2, \mathbb R)$. In particular, this yields a complete topological classification of compact $3$-manifolds that admit critical compatible metrics. As a corollary we prove that no contact structure on $\mathbb{T}^3$ admits a critical compatible metric and that critical compatible metrics can only occur when the contact structure is tight.</description>

      <title>Removing scalar curvature assumption for Ricci flow smoothing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11115v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent work of Chan-Huang-Lee, it is shown that if a manifold enjoys uniform bounds on (a) the negative part of the scalar curvature, (b) the local entropy, and (c) volume ratios up to a fixed scale, then there exists a Ricci flow for some definite time with estimates on the solution assuming that the local curvature concentration is small enough initially (depending only on these a priori bounds). In this work, we show that the bound on scalar curvature assumption (a) is redundant. We also give some applications of this quantitative short-time existence, including a Ricci flow smoothing result for measure space limits, a Gromov-Hausdorff compactness result, and a topological and geometric rigidity result in the case that the a priori local bounds are strengthened to be global.</description>

      <title>Sp(2)-invariant expanders and shrinkers in Laplacian flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05437v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the complete Sp(2)-invariant expanding solitons for Bryant's Laplacian flow on the anti-self-dual bundle of the 4-sphere form a 1-parameter family, and that they are all asymptotically conical (AC). We determine their asymptotic cones, and prove that this cone determines the complete expander (up to scale). Neither the unique Sp(2)-invariant torsion-free G_2-cone nor the asymptotic cone of the explicit AC Sp(2)-invariant shrinker from arxiv:2112.09095 occurs as the asymptotic cone of a complete AC Sp(2)-invariant expander.
  We determine all possible end behaviours of Sp(2)-invariant solitons, identifying novel forward-complete end solutions for both expanders and shrinkers with faster-than-Euclidean volume growth. We conjecture that there exists a 1-parameter family of complete SU(3)-invariant expanders on the anti-self-dual bundle of the complex projective plane CP^2 with such asymptotic behaviour.
  We also conjecture that, in contrast to the Sp(2)-invariant case, there exist complete SU(3)-invariant AC expanders with asymptotic cone matching that of the explicit AC SU(3)-invariant shrinker from arxiv:2112.09095. The latter conjecture suggests that Laplacian flow may naturally implement a type of surgery in which a CP^2 shrinks to a conically singular point, but after which the flow can be continued smoothly, expanding a topologically different CP^2 from the singularity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12391v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A Riemannian manifold is called a geodesic orbit manifolds, GO for short, if any geodesic is an orbit of a one-parameter group of isometries. By a result of C.Gordon, a non-flat GO nilmanifold is necessarily a two-step nilpotent Lie group with a left-invariant metric. We give a complete classification of non-singular GO nilmanifolds. Besides previously known examples, there are new families with 3-dimensional center, and two one-parameter families of dimensions 14 and 15.</description>

      <title>A Spectral Splitting Theorem for the $N$-Bakry \'Emery Ricci tensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14962v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the spectral generalization of the Cheeger-Gromoll splitting theorem to smooth metric measure space. We show that if a complete non-compact weighted Riemannian manifold $(M,g,e^{-f}\,dvolg)$ of dimension $n\ge 2$ has at least two ends where $f$ is smooth and bounded. If there is some $N\in (0,\infty)$ and $\gamma&lt;\left(\frac{1}{(n-1)\left(1 + \frac{n-1}{N}\right)} + \frac{n-1}{4}\right)^{-1}$ such that $$\lambda_1(-\gamma \Delta_f+\operatorname{Ric}^N_f)\ge 0$$then $M$ splits isometrically as $\mathbb{R}\times X$ for some complete Riemannian manifold $X$ with $(\operatorname{Ric}_X)^N_f\ge 0$. The estimate can recover the spectral splitting result and its sharp constant $\frac{4}{n-1}$ in Antonelli-Pozzetta-Xu and and Catino--Mari--Mastrolia--Roncoroni.</description>

      <title>One Dimensional Asymptotic Plateau Problem in $n$-Dimensional Asymptotically Conical Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15058v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $(M,g)$ be an asymptotically conical Riemannian manifold having dimension $n\ge 2$, opening angle $\alpha \in (0,\pi/2) \setminus \{\arcsin \frac{1}{2k+1}\}_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$ and positive asymptotic rate. Under the assumption that the exponential map is proper at each point, we give a solution to the one dimensional asymptotic Plateau problem on $M$. Precisely, for any pair of antipodal points in the ideal boundary $\partial_\infty M = \mathbb S^{n-1}$, we prove the existence of a geodesic line with asymptotic prescribed boundaries and the Morse index $\le n-1$.</description>

      <title>K\"ahler-Ricci solitons on Fano threefolds with non-trivial moduli</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.14212v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We find Fano threefolds $X$ admitting K\"ahler-Ricci solitons (KRS) with non-trivial moduli, which are $\mathbb{T}$-varieties of complexity two. More precisely, we show that the weighted K-stability of $(X,\xi_0)$ (where $\xi_0$ is the soliton candidate) is equivalent to certain GIT-stability. In particular, this provides the first examples of strictly weighted K-semistable Fano varieties. On the other hand, we generalize Koiso's theorem to the log Fano setting. Indeed, we show that the K-stability of a log Fano pair $(V,\Delta_V)$ is equivalent to the weighted K-stability of a cone $(Y, \Delta_Y, \xi_0)$ over it. This also leads to new examples of KRS Fano varieties with non-trivial moduli and small automorphism groups. To achieve these, we establish the weighted Abban-Zhuang estimate generalizing the work of \cite{AZ22}, which gives a lower bound of the weighted stability threshold $\delta^g_{\mathbb{T}}(X,\Delta)$. This is an effective way to check the weighted K-semistablity of a log Fano triple $(X,\Delta,\xi_0)$. This estimate is also useful in testing (weighted) K-polystability based on the work of \cite{BLXZ23}.</description>
