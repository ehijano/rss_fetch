      <title>Responsible Adoption of Generative AI in Higher Education: Developing a "Points to Consider" Approach Based on Faculty Perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes an approach to the responsible adoption of generative AI in higher education, employing a ''points to consider'' approach that is sensitive to the goals, values, and structural features of higher education. Higher education's ethos of collaborative faculty governance, pedagogical and research goals, and embrace of academic freedom conflict, the paper argues, with centralized top down approaches to governing AI that are common in the private sector. The paper is based on a semester long effort at the University of Pittsburgh which gathered and organized perspectives on generative AI in higher education through a collaborative, iterative, interdisciplinary process that included recurring group discussions, three standalone focus groups, and an informal survey. The paper presents insights drawn from this effort that give rise to the ''points to consider'' approach the paper develops. These insights include the benefits and risks of potential uses of generative AI In higher education, as well as barriers to its adoption, and culminate in the six normative points to consider when adopting and governing generative AI in institutions of higher education.</description>

      <title>Position: The Causal Revolution Needs Scientific Pragmatism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Causal models and methods have great promise, but their progress has been stalled. Proposals using causality get squeezed between two opposing worldviews. Scientific perfectionism--an insistence on only using "correct" models--slows the adoption of causal methods in knowledge generating applications. Pushing in the opposite direction, the academic discipline of computer science prefers algorithms with no or few assumptions, and technologies based on automation and scalability are often selected for economic and business applications. We argue that these system-centric inductive biases should be replaced with a human-centric philosophy we refer to as scientific pragmatism. The machine learning community must strike the right balance to make space for the causal revolution to prosper.</description>

      <title>Crisis Communication in the Face of Data Breaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data breaches refer to unauthorized accesses to data. Typically but not always, data breaches are about cyber crime. An organization facing such a crime is often also in a crisis situation. Therefore, organizations should prepare also for data breaches in their crisis management procedures. These procedures should include also crisis communication plans. To this end, this paper examines data breach crisis communication strategies and their practical executions. The background comes from the vibrant crisis communication research domain. According to a few qualitative case studies from Finland, the conventional wisdom holds well; the successful cases indicate communicating early, taking responsibility, offering an apology, and notifying public authorities. The unsuccessful cases show varying degrees of the reverse, including shifting of blame, positioning of an organization as a victim, and failing to notify public authorities. With these qualitative insights, the paper contributes to the research domain by focusing specifically on data breach crises, their peculiarities, and their management, including with respect to European regulations that have been neglected in existing crisis communication research.</description>

      <title>Position: Cracking the Code of Cascading Disparity Towards Marginalized Communities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rise of foundation models holds immense promise for advancing AI, but this progress may amplify existing risks and inequalities, leaving marginalized communities behind. In this position paper, we discuss that disparities towards marginalized communities - performance, representation, privacy, robustness, interpretability and safety - are not isolated concerns but rather interconnected elements of a cascading disparity phenomenon. We contrast foundation models with traditional models and highlight the potential for exacerbated disparity against marginalized communities. Moreover, we emphasize the unique threat of cascading impacts in foundation models, where interconnected disparities can trigger long-lasting negative consequences, specifically to the people on the margin. We define marginalized communities within the machine learning context and explore the multifaceted nature of disparities. We analyze the sources of these disparities, tracing them from data creation, training and deployment procedures to highlight the complex technical and socio-technical landscape. To mitigate the pressing crisis, we conclude with a set of calls to action to mitigate disparity at its source.</description>

      <title>#EpiTwitter: Public Health Messaging During the COVID-19 Pandemic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effective communication during health crises is critical, with social media serving as a key platform for public health experts (PHEs) to engage with the public. However, it also amplifies pseudo-experts promoting contrarian views. Despite its importance, the role of emotional and moral language in PHEs' communication during COVID-19 remains under explored. This study examines how PHEs and pseudo-experts communicated on Twitter during the pandemic, focusing on emotional and moral language and their engagement with political elites. Analyzing tweets from 489 PHEs and 356 pseudo-experts from January 2020 to January 2021, alongside public responses, we identified key priorities and differences in messaging strategy. PHEs prioritize masking, healthcare, education, and vaccines, using positive emotional language like optimism. In contrast, pseudo-experts discuss therapeutics and lockdowns more frequently, employing negative emotions like pessimism and disgust. Negative emotional and moral language tends to drive engagement, but positive language from PHEs fosters positivity in public responses. PHEs exhibit liberal partisanship, expressing more positivity towards liberals and negativity towards conservative elites, while pseudo-experts show conservative partisanship. These findings shed light on the polarization of COVID-19 discourse and underscore the importance of strategic use of emotional and moral language by experts to mitigate polarization and enhance public trust.</description>

      <title>A Comparative Study of Sampling Methods with Cross-Validation in the FedHome Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a comparative study of sampling methods within the FedHome framework, designed for personalized in-home health monitoring. FedHome leverages federated learning (FL) and generative convolutional autoencoders (GCAE) to train models on decentralized edge devices while prioritizing data privacy. A notable challenge in this domain is the class imbalance in health data, where critical events such as falls are underrepresented, adversely affecting model performance. To address this, the research evaluates six oversampling techniques using Stratified K-fold cross-validation: SMOTE, Borderline-SMOTE, Random OverSampler, SMOTE-Tomek, SVM-SMOTE, and SMOTE-ENN. These methods are tested on FedHome's public implementation over 200 training rounds with and without stratified K-fold cross-validation. The findings indicate that SMOTE-ENN achieves the most consistent test accuracy, with a standard deviation range of 0.0167-0.0176, demonstrating stable performance compared to other samplers. In contrast, SMOTE and SVM-SMOTE exhibit higher variability in performance, as reflected by their wider standard deviation ranges of 0.0157-0.0180 and 0.0155-0.0180, respectively. Similarly, the Random OverSampler method shows a significant deviation range of 0.0155-0.0176. SMOTE-Tomek, with a deviation range of 0.0160-0.0175, also shows greater stability but not as much as SMOTE-ENN. This finding highlights the potential of SMOTE-ENN to enhance the reliability and accuracy of personalized health monitoring systems within the FedHome framework.</description>

      <title>Investigating Assumptions and Proposals for Blockchain Integration in the Circular Economy. A Delphi Study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13774v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given the rising interest in the circular economy and blockchain hype, numerous integrations were proposed. However, studies on the practical feasibility were scarce, and the assumptions of blockchain potential in the circular economy were rarely questioned. With the help of eleven of the most prominent blockchain experts, the present study critically analyzed technology integration in many areas of the circular economy to forecast their possible outcomes. Delphi's technique is leveraged to reach a consensus among experts' visions and opinions. Results support the view that some circular economy integrations are unlikely to succeed, while others if specific conditions are met, may prove to be successful in the long run.</description>

      <title>Prioritizing Safeguarding Over Autonomy: Risks of LLM Agents for Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04247v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Intelligent agents powered by large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated substantial promise in autonomously conducting experiments and facilitating scientific discoveries across various disciplines. While their capabilities are promising, these agents, called scientific LLM agents, also introduce novel vulnerabilities that demand careful consideration for safety. However, there exists a notable gap in the literature, as there has been no comprehensive exploration of these vulnerabilities. This perspective paper fills this gap by conducting a thorough examination of vulnerabilities in LLM-based agents within scientific domains, shedding light on potential risks associated with their misuse and emphasizing the need for safety measures. We begin by providing a comprehensive overview of the potential risks inherent to scientific LLM agents, taking into account user intent, the specific scientific domain, and their potential impact on the external environment. Then, we delve into the origins of these vulnerabilities and provide a scoping review of the limited existing works. Based on our analysis, we propose a triadic framework involving human regulation, agent alignment, and an understanding of environmental feedback (agent regulation) to mitigate these identified risks. Furthermore, we highlight the limitations and challenges associated with safeguarding scientific agents and advocate for the development of improved models, robust benchmarks, and comprehensive regulations to address these issues effectively.</description>

      <title>Improved Digital Therapy for Developmental Pediatrics Using Domain-Specific Artificial Intelligence: Machine Learning Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.08678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2012.08678v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Background: Automated emotion classification could aid those who struggle to recognize emotions, including children with developmental behavioral conditions such as autism. However, most computer vision emotion recognition models are trained on adult emotion and therefore underperform when applied to child faces. Objective: We designed a strategy to gamify the collection and labeling of child emotion-enriched images to boost the performance of automatic child emotion recognition models to a level closer to what will be needed for digital health care approaches. Methods: We leveraged our prototype therapeutic smartphone game, GuessWhat, which was designed in large part for children with developmental and behavioral conditions, to gamify the secure collection of video data of children expressing a variety of emotions prompted by the game. Independently, we created a secure web interface to gamify the human labeling effort, called HollywoodSquares, tailored for use by any qualified labeler. We gathered and labeled 2155 videos, 39,968 emotion frames, and 106,001 labels on all images. With this drastically expanded pediatric emotion-centric database (&gt;30 times larger than existing public pediatric emotion data sets), we trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) computer vision classifier of happy, sad, surprised, fearful, angry, disgust, and neutral expressions evoked by children. Results: The classifier achieved a 66.9% balanced accuracy and 67.4% F1-score on the entirety of the Child Affective Facial Expression (CAFE) as well as a 79.1% balanced accuracy and 78% F1-score on CAFE Subset A, a subset containing at least 60% human agreement on emotions labels. This performance is at least 10% higher than all previously developed classifiers evaluated against CAFE, the best of which reached a 56% balanced accuracy even when combining "anger" and "disgust" into a single class.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2204.09389v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep neural networks are highly susceptible to learning biases in visual data. While various methods have been proposed to mitigate such bias, the majority require explicit knowledge of the biases present in the training data in order to mitigate. We argue the relevance of exploring methods which are completely ignorant of the presence of any bias, but are capable of identifying and mitigating them. Furthermore, we propose using Bayesian neural networks with a predictive uncertainty-weighted loss function to dynamically identify potential bias in individual training samples and to weight them during training. We find a positive correlation between samples subject to bias and higher epistemic uncertainties. Finally, we show the method has potential to mitigate visual bias on a bias benchmark dataset and on a real-world face detection problem, and we consider the merits and weaknesses of our approach.</description>

      <title>A Perspective on Crowdsourcing and Human-in-the-Loop Workflows in Precision Health</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.03578v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern machine learning approaches have led to performant diagnostic models for a variety of health conditions. Several machine learning approaches, such as decision trees and deep neural networks, can, in principle, approximate any function. However, this power can be considered to be both a gift and a curse, as the propensity toward overfitting is magnified when the input data are heterogeneous and high dimensional and the output class is highly nonlinear. This issue can especially plague diagnostic systems that predict behavioral and psychiatric conditions that are diagnosed with subjective criteria. An emerging solution to this issue is crowdsourcing, where crowd workers are paid to annotate complex behavioral features in return for monetary compensation or a gamified experience. These labels can then be used to derive a diagnosis, either directly or by using the labels as inputs to a diagnostic machine learning model. This viewpoint describes existing work in this emerging field and discusses ongoing challenges and opportunities with crowd-powered diagnostic systems, a nascent field of study. With the correct considerations, the addition of crowdsourcing to human-in-the-loop machine learning workflows for the prediction of complex and nuanced health conditions can accelerate screening, diagnostics, and ultimately access to care.</description>

      <title>Correcting Underrepresentation and Intersectional Bias for Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.11112v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of learning from data corrupted by underrepresentation bias, where positive examples are filtered from the data at different, unknown rates for a fixed number of sensitive groups. We show that with a small amount of unbiased data, we can efficiently estimate the group-wise drop-out rates, even in settings where intersectional group membership makes learning each intersectional rate computationally infeasible. Using these estimates, we construct a reweighting scheme that allows us to approximate the loss of any hypothesis on the true distribution, even if we only observe the empirical error on a biased sample. From this, we present an algorithm encapsulating this learning and reweighting process along with a thorough empirical investigation. Finally, we define a bespoke notion of PAC learnability for the underrepresentation and intersectional bias setting and show that our algorithm permits efficient learning for model classes of finite VC dimension.</description>

      <title>Fair Wasserstein Coresets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.05436v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data distillation and coresets have emerged as popular approaches to generate a smaller representative set of samples for downstream learning tasks to handle large-scale datasets. At the same time, machine learning is being increasingly applied to decision-making processes at a societal level, making it imperative for modelers to address inherent biases towards subgroups present in the data. While current approaches focus on creating fair synthetic representative samples by optimizing local properties relative to the original samples, their impact on downstream learning processes has yet to be explored. In this work, we present fair Wasserstein coresets (FWC), a novel coreset approach which generates fair synthetic representative samples along with sample-level weights to be used in downstream learning tasks. FWC uses an efficient majority minimization algorithm to minimize the Wasserstein distance between the original dataset and the weighted synthetic samples while enforcing demographic parity. We show that an unconstrained version of FWC is equivalent to Lloyd's algorithm for k-medians and k-means clustering. Experiments conducted on both synthetic and real datasets show that FWC: (i) achieves a competitive fairness-utility tradeoff in downstream models compared to existing approaches, (ii) improves downstream fairness when added to the existing training data and (iii) can be used to reduce biases in predictions from large language models (GPT-3.5 and GPT-4).</description>

Abstract: We propose a new benchmark evaluating the performance of multimodal large language models on rebus puzzles. The dataset covers 333 original examples of image-based wordplay, cluing 13 categories such as movies, composers, major cities, and food. To achieve good performance on the benchmark of identifying the clued word or phrase, models must combine image recognition and string manipulation with hypothesis testing, multi-step reasoning, and an understanding of human cognition, making for a complex, multimodal evaluation of capabilities. We find that GPT-4o significantly outperforms all other models, followed by proprietary models outperforming all other evaluated models. However, even the best model has a final accuracy of only 42\%, which goes down to just 7\% on hard puzzles, highlighting the need for substantial improvements in reasoning. Further, models rarely understand all parts of a puzzle, and are almost always incapable of retroactively explaining the correct answer. Our benchmark can therefore be used to identify major shortcomings in the knowledge and reasoning of multimodal large language models.</description>

      <title>Beyond prompt brittleness: Evaluating the reliability and consistency of political worldviews in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17649v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Due to the widespread use of large language models (LLMs) in ubiquitous systems, we need to understand whether they embed a specific worldview and what these views reflect. Recent studies report that, prompted with political questionnaires, LLMs show left-liberal leanings (Feng et al., 2023; Motoki et al., 2024). However, it is as yet unclear whether these leanings are reliable (robust to prompt variations) and whether the leaning is consistent across policies and political leaning. We propose a series of tests which assess the reliability and consistency of LLMs' stances on political statements based on a dataset of voting-advice questionnaires collected from seven EU countries and annotated for policy domains. We study LLMs ranging in size from 7B to 70B parameters and find that their reliability increases with parameter count. Larger models show overall stronger alignment with left-leaning parties but differ among policy programs: They evince a (left-wing) positive stance towards environment protection, social welfare state and liberal society but also (right-wing) law and order, with no consistent preferences in foreign policy and migration.</description>

      <title>Social Choice Should Guide AI Alignment in Dealing with Diverse Human Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10271v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Foundation models such as GPT-4 are fine-tuned to avoid unsafe or otherwise problematic behavior, such as helping to commit crimes or producing racist text. One approach to fine-tuning, called reinforcement learning from human feedback, learns from humans' expressed preferences over multiple outputs. Another approach is constitutional AI, in which the input from humans is a list of high-level principles. But how do we deal with potentially diverging input from humans? How can we aggregate the input into consistent data about "collective" preferences or otherwise use it to make collective choices about model behavior? In this paper, we argue that the field of social choice is well positioned to address these questions, and we discuss ways forward for this agenda, drawing on discussions in a recent workshop on Social Choice for AI Ethics and Safety held in Berkeley, CA, USA in December 2023.</description>

      <title>The Role of Learning Algorithms in Collective Action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06582v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Collective action in machine learning is the study of the control that a coordinated group can have over machine learning algorithms. While previous research has concentrated on assessing the impact of collectives against Bayes (sub-)optimal classifiers, this perspective is limited in that it does not account for the choice of learning algorithm. Since classifiers seldom behave like Bayes classifiers and are influenced by the choice of learning algorithms along with their inherent biases, in this work we initiate the study of how the choice of the learning algorithm plays a role in the success of a collective in practical settings. Specifically, we focus on distributionally robust optimization (DRO), popular for improving a worst group error, and on the ubiquitous stochastic gradient descent (SGD), due to its inductive bias for "simpler" functions. Our empirical results, supported by a theoretical foundation, show that the effective size and success of the collective are highly dependent on properties of the learning algorithm. This highlights the necessity of taking the learning algorithm into account when studying the impact of collective action in machine learning.</description>

      <title>CPsyCoun: A Report-based Multi-turn Dialogue Reconstruction and Evaluation Framework for Chinese Psychological Counseling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16433v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using large language models (LLMs) to assist psychological counseling is a significant but challenging task at present. Attempts have been made on improving empathetic conversations or acting as effective assistants in the treatment with LLMs. However, the existing datasets lack consulting knowledge, resulting in LLMs lacking professional consulting competence. Moreover, how to automatically evaluate multi-turn dialogues within the counseling process remains an understudied area. To bridge the gap, we propose CPsyCoun, a report-based multi-turn dialogue reconstruction and evaluation framework for Chinese psychological counseling. To fully exploit psychological counseling reports, a two-phase approach is devised to construct high-quality dialogues while a comprehensive evaluation benchmark is developed for the effective automatic evaluation of multi-turn psychological consultations. Competitive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework in psychological counseling. We open-source the datasets and model for future research at https://github.com/CAS-SIAT-XinHai/CPsyCoun</description>
