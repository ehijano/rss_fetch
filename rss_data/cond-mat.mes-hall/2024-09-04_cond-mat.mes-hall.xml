      <title>Massive Dirac particles based on gapped graphene with Rosen-Morse potential in a uniform magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the gapped graphene structure in the two-dimensional plane in the presence of the Rosen-Morse potential and an external uniform magnetic field. In order to describe the corresponding structure, we consider the propagation of electrons in graphene as relativistic fermion quasi-particles, and analyze it by the wave functions of two-component spinors with pseudo-spin symmetry using the Dirac equation. Next, to solve and analyze the Dirac equation, we obtain the eigenvalues and eigenvectors using the Legendre differential equation. After that, we obtain the bounded states of energy depending on the coefficients of Rosen-Morse and magnetic potentials in terms of quantum numbers of principal \(n\) and spin-orbit \(k\). Then, the values of the energy spectrum for the ground state and the first excited state are calculated, and the wave functions and the corresponding probabilities are plotted in terms of coordinates $r$. In what follows, we explore the band structure of gapped graphene by the modified dispersion relation and write it in terms of the two-dimensional wave vectors $K_x$ and $K_y$. Finally, the energy bands are plotted in terms of the wave vectors $K_x$ and $K_y$ with and without the magnetic term.</description>

      <title>Spin-orbit control of Dirac points and end states in inverted gap nanowires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We predict that in InAs/GaSb nanowires with an inverted band alignment a transverse electric field induces a collapse of the hybridization gap, and a semimetal phase occurs. We use a self-consistent k.p approach and an adapted Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang model to show that massless Dirac points result from exact cancellation between the kinetic electron-hole coupling and the field-controlled spin-orbit coupling. End states - mid-gap states localized at the extremes of a finite nanowire - are supported up to a critical field, but suddenly fade away as the system is driven through the semimetal phase, eventually evolving to trivial surface states, which expose a spin-orbit induced topological transition to the normal phase.</description>

      <title>Radiation-induced dynamical formation of Floquet-Bloch bands in Dirac Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00285v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent experiments, combing ultrafast strong-field irradiation of surfaces with time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, allow for monitoring the time-dependent charge carrier dynamics and the build-up of transient sidebands due to the radiation pulses. While these structures are reminiscent of Floquet-Bloch bands, standard Floquet theory is not applicable since it requires a strictly time-periodic driving field. To study the emergence and formation of such sidebands, i.e. to provide a link between common Floquet physics and dynamical mechanisms underlying short driving pulses, we consider a generalization of Floquet theory, the so-called $t-t^{\prime}$ formalism. This approach naturally extents Floquet theory to driving field amplitudes with a superimposed envelope shape. Motivated by experiments we study 2D Dirac Hamiltonians subject to linearly and circularly polarised light waves with a Gaussian field envelope of a few cycles. For these Floquet-Bloch Hamiltonians we study the evolution of their Floquet-Bloch spectra, accompanied by a systematic analysis of the time-dependent (sideband) transitions. We show that sideband occupation requires circularly polarized light for linear Dirac systems such as graphene, while for Dirac models with trigonal warping, describing surface states of topological insulators such as Bi$_2$ Se$_3$, both linearly and circularly polarised pulses induce sideband excitations.</description>

      <title>Spectral heat flux redistribution upon interfacial transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In nonmetallic crystals, heat is transported by phonons of different frequencies, each contributing differently to the overall heat flux spectrum. In this study, we demonstrate a significant redistribution of heat flux among phonon frequencies when phonons transmit across the interface between dissimilar solids. This redistribution arises from the natural tendency of phononic heat to re-establish the equilibrium distribution characteristic of the material through which it propagates. Remarkably, while the heat flux spectra of dissimilar solids are typically distinct in their bulk forms, they can become nearly identical in superlattices or sandwich structures where the layer thicknesses are smaller than the phonon mean free paths. This phenomenon reflects that the redistribution of heat among phonon frequencies to the equilibrium distribution does not occur instantaneously at the interface, rather it develops over some time and distance.</description>

      <title>Extended dissipaton-equation-of-motion approach to study the electronic migration in adatom-graphene composite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graphene has garnered significant attention due to its unique properties. Among its many intriguing characteristics, the tuning effects induced by adsorbed atoms (adatoms) provide immense potential for the design of graphene-based electronic devices. This work explores the electronic migration in the adatom-graphene composite, using the extended dissipaton-equation-of-motion (DEOM) approach. As an exact dynamics theory for open quantum systems embedded in environments composed of non-interacting electrons, the extended DEOM is capable of handling both linear and quadratic environmental couplings (a certain non-Gaussian effect) which account for the interactions between the adatom and the graphene substrate. We demonstrate and analyze the adatom-graphene correlated properties and the tuning effects by simulating the adatom spectral functions with varied Coulomb repulsion strengths. This work offers not only advanced theoretical methods but also new insights into the theoretical investigation of complex functional materials such as graphene-based electronic devices.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast manipulations of nanoscale skyrmioniums</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advancement of next-generation magnetic devices depends on fast manipulating magnetic microstructures on the nanoscale. A universal method is presented for rapidly and reliably generating, controlling, and driving nano-scale skyrmioniums, through high-throughput micromagnetic simulations. Ultrafast switches are realized between skyrmionium and skyrmion states and rapidly change their polarities in monolayer magnetic nanodiscs by perpendicular magnetic fields. The transition mechanism by alternating magnetic fields differs from that under steady magnetic fields. New skyrmionic textures, such as flower-like and windmill-like skyrmions, are discovered. Moreover, this nanoscale skyrmionium can move rapidly and stably in nanoribbons using weaker spin-polarized currents. Explicit discussions are held regarding the physical mechanisms involved in ultrafast manipulations of skyrmioniums. This work provides further physical insight into the manipulation and applications of topological skyrmionic structures for developing low-power consumption and nanostorage devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Frequency-based synthetic dimensions are a promising avenue to extend the dimensionality of photonic systems. In this work, we show how a tilted synthetic lattice is naturally realised by periodically modulating a single-mode resonator under a coherent monochromatic drive. We theoretically study the Bloch wave dynamics in the tilted synthetic lattice, which gives rise to peculiar features in the spectral distribution of the cavity field. Our predictions are experimentally confirmed using a planar tunable superconducting microwave resonator.</description>

      <title>Longitudinal magnetoresistance in graphene with random Rashba spin-orbit interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider longitudinal electronic transport in a graphene monolayer with an external in-plane magnetic field and with extrinsic spin-orbit Rashba interaction. Our main interest is in the in-plane magnetoresistance, observed experimentally. We show, that scattering on Rashba spin-orbit fluctuations leads to a negative magnetoresistance, in agreement with experimental observations. To calculate transport properties we assume an effective model valid for low energy states around the Dirac points, and use the Green function method to derive the electron scattering rate and longitudinal conductivity.</description>

      <title>Phonon-Assisted Photoluminescence and Exciton Recombination in Monolayer Aluminum Nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient solid-state photon emitters with longer operating lifetimes in the ultraviolet (UV) wavelength range are crucial for optoelectronic devices. However, finding suitable material candidates has been a significant challenge. Here, we demonstrate that hexagonal aluminum nitride (AlN) monolayers exhibit strong photoluminescence emission within the UV range of 3.94 - 4.05 eV. We show that these emissions in indirect bandgap AlN are facilitated by phonon modes with finite lattice momentum. These phonon modes promote efficient recombination of electrons and holes from the $\Gamma$ to K point of the Brillouin zone. Our findings provide a foundation for developing advanced optoelectronic devices and efficient UV light sources based on hexagonal AlN monolayers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically study Rashba-Edelstein magnetoresistance (REMR) in a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) system with Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit interactions. Starting from a microscopic model of a junction system composed of a ferromagnetic insulator and 2DEG, we derive analytic expressions for the spin and current densities in the 2DEG using the Boltzmann equation. Our findings reveal that the sign of the REMR varies depending on the type of interface. We also discuss the experimental relevance of our results.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic and energetic constraints on out-of-equilibrium tunneling rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study bipartite quantum systems kept at different temperatures where a tunnel coupling between the two subsystems induces transitions. We find two independent constraints on the temperature-bias-dependent, out-of-equilibrium tunneling rates between the two subsystems, which both turn out to be particularly restrictive when the coupled quantum systems are small. These bounds take the form of a thermodynamic and of an energetic constraint, as they are associated with the dissipated heat and with the absorbed energy required to establish and deplete the temperature bias, respectively. The derived constraints apply to a large class of experimentally accessible quantum systems: except for the restriction to the tunneling regime, they hold for arbitrary subsystem Hamiltonians, including interactions or non-linear energy spectra. These results hold for a large class of experimentally relevant systems, ranging from molecular junctions to coupled cavities, and can be tested by, for instance, measuring the out-of-equilibrium tunneling current and its noise.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Nodal-Knot Transitions by Disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Under certain symmetries, degenerate points in three-dimensional metals form one-dimensional nodal lines. These nodal lines sometimes feature knotted structures and have been studied across diverse backgrounds. As one of the most common physical perturbations, disorder effects often trigger novel quantum phase transitions. For nodal-knot phases, whether disorder can drive knot transitions remains an unclear and intriguing problem. Employing renormalization-group calculations, we demonstrate that nodal-knot transitions emerges in the presence of weak disorder. Specifically, both chemical-potential-type and magnetic-type disorders can induce knot transitions, resulting in the emergence of distinct knot topologies. The transition can be quantitatively reflected in the change of topological invariants such as the knot Wilson loop integrals. Our findings open up a new avenue for manipulating the topology of nodal-knot phases through disorder effects.</description>

      <title>Hole spin precession and dephasing induced by nuclear hyperfine fields in CsPbBr$_3$ and CsPb(Cl,Br)$_3$ nanocrystals in a glass matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coherent spin dynamics of holes are investigated for CsPbBr$_3$ and CsPb(Cl,Br)$_3$ perovskite nanocrystals in a glass matrix using the time-resolved Faraday rotation/ellipticity techniques. In an external magnetic field, pronounced Larmor spin precession of the hole spins is detected across a wide temperature range from 5 to 300 K. The hole Land\'e $g$-factor varies in the range of $0.8-1.5$, in which it increases with increasing high energy shift of the exciton due to enhanced confinement in small nanocrystals. The hole spin dephasing time decreases from 1 ns to 50 ps in this temperature range. Nuclear spin fluctuations have a pronounced impact on the hole spin dynamics. The hyperfine interaction of the holes with nuclear spins modifies their spin polarization decay and induces their spin precession in zero external magnetic field. The results can be well described by the model developed in Ref. 41, from which the hyperfine interaction energy of a hole spin with the nuclear spin fluctuation in range of $2-5$ $\mu$eV is evaluated.</description>

      <title>Armchair carbon nanotube on Pt and hBN/Pt: from strong metallic contact to coherent spin transport regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study spin-orbit proximity effects in an armchair (4,4) carbon nanotube on the Pt(111) surface. By employing first-principles calculations, we show that the Dirac cone of the metallic nanotube is altered due to strong hybridization with the Pt substrate. Inserting a monolayer hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) between the nanotube and the substrate limits the hybridization effects leading to recovering the Dirac cone. The Dirac bands display asymmetric spin splitting, 0.7\,meV for the right movers and 1.7\,meV for the left movers at the K valley, due to the proximity to the Pt substrate. We find that the Dirac states exhibit almost perfect spin polarization, transverse to the nanotube axis and to the stacking direction, forming a proper condition for charge-to-spin conversion with coherent spin transport in the nanotube. We propose an effective Hamiltonian describing the proximity-induced effects on the Dirac electrons and their spin texture.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, a discussion about quantum holonomies around a possible bridge between two graphene sheets has been made. That bridge is widely known as a graphene wormhole, and some of its characteristics are also showed up here. As well as their build as a zigzag junction between a baggy nanotube and the graphene lattices. And how the localized electronic states could be mimicked by gauge fields in a low-energy regime. Further, the possibility to build holonomies handle by an effective flux from topological defects in junctions of that bridge has been discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we discuss an extension of the geometric description of graphene wormholes in a non-inertial situation. We present an effective metric that describes the wormhole connection between two graphene sheets with matter content in rotation. Additionally, a stretching term as a function of the classical redshift of space has been found and discussed. We also explore the influence of a rotation term on quantum holonomy, recovering previous results found for the static case.</description>

      <title>Fano-Rashba effect in the presence of Majorana bound states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the influence of Majorana bound states on the Fano-Rashba effect in a two-channel Fano-Anderson model. Employing Green's function formalism and the equation of motion method, we compute the transmission through the quantum dot and the density of states. Our analysis reveals that the Majorana bound states, localized at the ends of the topological superconductor nanowire, penetrate into the quantum dot, thereby altering the interference pattern in the electronic transmission profile through it, resulting from their interaction with the bound states in the continuum. Furthermore, we explore the robustness of the bound state in the continuum concerning its connection to Majorana bound states and the energy induced by the magnetic field. We posit that our findings contribute to a deeper comprehension of the Fano-Rashba effect in a two-channel quantum dot coupled to a topological superconducting nanowire.</description>

      <title>Higher-order Skin Effect through a Hermitian-non-Hermitian Correspondence and Its Observation in an Acoustic Kagome Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) is a distinctive topological phenomenon observed in nonHermitian systems. Recently, there has been considerable interest in exploring higher-order NHSE occurrences in two and three dimensions. In such systems, topological edge states collapse into a corner while bulk states remain delocalized. Through a Hermitian-non-Hermitian correspondence, this study predicts and experimentally observes the higher-order NHSE in an acoustic Kagome lattice possessing nonreciprocal hoppings. By rotating the frequency spectrum and employing complexfrequency excitation techniques, we observe the localization of acoustic energy towards a corner of the lattice in the topologically nontrivial phase, even when the source is located far from that corner. In contrast, the acoustic energy spreads out when excited at the frequencies hosting the bulk states. These observations are unequivocal evidence of the higher-order NHSE.</description>

      <title>Meron-mediated phase transitions in quasi-two-dimensional chiral magnets with easy-plane anisotropy: successive transformation of the hexagonal skyrmion lattice into the square lattice and into the tilted FM state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I revisit the well-known structural transition between hexagonal and square skyrmion lattices induced by increasing easy-plane anisotropy in quasi-two-dimensional chiral magnets. I show that the hexagonal skyrmion order, by the first-order phase transition, transforms into a distorted (rhombic) skyrmion lattice. The transition is mediated by merons and anti-merons emerging within the boundaries between skyrmion cells. Since the energy density associated with anti-merons is highly positive owing to the wrong rotational sense, one anti-meron per unit cell annihilates: anti-merons are squeezed by the pairs of approaching merons at the opposite sides of the hexagonal unit cell. Further, in a narrow range of anisotropy values, the distorted skyrmion lattice gradually transforms into a perfect square order of skyrmions (alternatively called "a square meron-antimeron crystal") when two merons eventually merge into one. Thus, within the square skyrmion lattice, there is one meron and two anti-merons per unit cell, which underlie the subsequent first-order phase transition into the tilted ferromagnetic state. A pair of oppositely charged merons mutually annihilates, whereas a remaining anti-meron couples with an anti-meron occupying the center of the unit cell. As an outcome, the tilted ferromagnetic state contains bimeron clusters (chains) with the attracting inter-soliton potential. Moreover, domain-wall merons are actively involved in dynamic responses of the square skyrmion lattices. As an example, I theoretically study spin-wave modes and their excitations by ac magnetic fields. Two found resonance peaks are the result of the complex dynamics of domain-wall merons: whereas in the high-frequency mode, merons rotate counterclockwise as one might expect, in the low-frequency mode, merons are created and annihilated consistently with the rotational motion of the domain boundaries.</description>

      <title>Deep Band Crossings Enhanced Nonlinear Optical Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear optical (NLO) effects in materials with band crossings have attracted significant research interests due to the divergent band geometric quantities around these crossings. Most current research has focused on band crossings between the valence and conduction bands. However, such crossings are absent in insulators, which are more relevant for NLO applications. In this work, we demonstrate that NLO effects can be significantly enhanced by band crossings within the valence or conduction bands, which we designate as "deep band crossings" (DBCs). As an example, in two dimensions, we show that shift conductivity can be substantially enhanced or even divergent due to a mirror-protected "deep Dirac nodal point". In three dimensions, we propose GeTe as an ideal material where shift conductivity is enhanced by "deep Dirac nodal lines". The ubiquity of this enhancement is further confirmed by high-throughput calculations. Other types of DBCs and NLO effects are also discussed. By manipulating band crossings between arbitrary bands, our work offers a simple, practical, and universal way to greatly enhance NLO effects.</description>

      <title>Consecutive Flat Chern Bands and Correlated States in Monolayer Re(Ag$X_3$)$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically propose that van der Waals monolayer Re(Ag$X_3$)$_2$ ($X=$ Cl, Br, I) have four consecutive flat Chern bands in the 120$^\circ$ spiral antiferromagnetic ground state. The nontrivial topology of these Chern bands emerges from the synergy between Re $t_{2g}$ band folding with non-collinear spin configuration and spin-orbit coupling. By constructing maximally localized Wannier functions directly from first-principles calculations, the tight-binding model is developed to describe the consecutive Chern bands. Exact diagonalization suggests that $1/3$ filling of these Chern bands host correlated states such as fractional Chern insulator and charge density wave state. Interestingly, the spin configurations and band topology of Chern bands are tunable by external magnetic field. The general physics from the $d$ orbitals here applies to a large class materials such as Re(Cu$X_3$)$_2$ and Re(Au$X_3$)$_2$. These interesting predictions, if realized experimentally, could greatly promote the research and application of topological quantum physics at elevated temperature.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Dirac points in electron-energy spectra of crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Specific properties, such as surface Fermi arcs, features of quantum oscillations and of various responses to a magnetic field, distinguish Dirac semimetals from ordinary materials. These properties are determined by Dirac points at which a contact of two electron-energy bands occurs and in the vicinity of which these bands disperse linearly in the quasimomentum. This work shows that almost the same properties are inherent in a wider class of materials in which the Dirac spectrum can have a noticeable gap comparable with the Fermi energy. In other words, the degeneracy of the bands at the point and their linear dispersion are not necessary for the existence of these properties. The only sufficient condition is the following: In the vicinity of such a quasi-Dirac point, the two close bands are well described by a two-band model that takes into account the strong spin-orbit interaction. To illustrate the results, the spectrum of ZrTe$_5$ is considered. This spectrum contains a special quasi-Dirac point, similar to that in bismuth.</description>

      <title>Raman signal enhancement via a microring resonator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Micro-ring resonators (MRRs) "trap" incoming light, and therefore, have been shown to achieve extremely high local intensities of light. Thus, they can be used to facilitate highly non-linear optical signals. By embedding materials that host non-linear optical processes inside the MRR, we expect to observe an enhancement in the strength of the non-linear optical signal. This concept is demonstrated here by extracting the Raman signature of graphene that is placed inside a MRR. A highly doped silica MRR which features an optical bus waveguide coupled to a loop (ring) tuned to near-infrared wavelengths is used. Raman signal with an excitation wavelength of 522 nm via third harmonic generation inside the MRR is observed. Higher order Raman signal of the embedded graphene at the 1597.6 nm excitation wavelength is also observed. This work demonstrates the feasibility of the MRR as a non-linear signal enhancer using novel MRR device setups.</description>

      <title>Chemical tuning of quantum spin-electric coupling in molecular nanomagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlling quantum spins using electric rather than magnetic fields promises significant architectural advantages for developing quantum technologies. In this context, spins in molecular nanomagnets offer tunability of spin-electric couplings (SEC) by rational chemical design. Here we demonstrate systematic control of SECs in a family of Mn(II)-containing molecules via chemical engineering. The trigonal bipyramidal (tbp) molecular structure with C3 symmetry leads to a significant molecular electric dipole moment that is directly connected to its magnetic anisotropy. The interplay between these two features gives rise to significant experimentally observed SECs, which can be rationalised by wavefunction theoretical calculations. Our findings guide strategies for the development of electrically controllable molecular spin qubits for quantum technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel quantum circuit using superfluid $^3$He, analogous to a superconducting quantum circuit. We design a mesoscopic device which consists of a superfluid Josephson weak-link and mechanical elements. We derive the Hamiltonian and predict the range of parameters in which this device can be operated in the quantum regime. The oscillations of the superfluid in this device are quantized with a well-defined resonance frequency, resolvable at mK temperatures essential to the superfluid state. We suggest an electromechanical coupling scheme for readout and to engineer the nonlinearity in this device. This device potentially realises a charge-neutral platform for a novel superfluid-based qubit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Altermagnetic (AM) materials have recently attracted significant interest due to the non-relativistic momentum-dependent spin splitting of their electronic band structure which may be useful for antiferromagnetic (AFM) spintronics. So far, however, most research studies have been focused on AM metals which can be utilized in spintronic devices, such as AFM tunnel junctions (AFMTJs). At the same time, AM insulators have remained largely unexplored in the realm of AFM spintronics. Here, we propose to employ AM insulators (AMIs) as efficient spin-filter materials. By analyzing the complex band structure of rutile-type altermagnets $MF_2$ ($M$ = $Fe, Co, Ni$), we demonstrate that the evanescent states in these AMIs exhibit spin- and momentum-dependent decay rates resulting in a substantial momentum-dependent spin polarization of the tunneling current. Using a model of spin-filter tunneling across a spin-dependent potential barrier, we estimate the TMR effect in spin-filter magnetic tunnel junctions (SF-MTJs) that include two magnetically decoupled $MF_2$ (001) barrier layers. We predict a sizable spin-filter TMR ratio of about 150-170% in SF-MTJs based on AMIs $CoF_2$ and $NiF_2$ if the Fermi energy is tuned to be close to the valence band maximum. Our results demonstrate that AMIs provide a viable alternative to conventional ferromagnetic or ferrimagnetic spin-filter materials, potentially advancing the development of next-generation AFM spintronic devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconductors can form ideal diodes carrying nondissipative supercurrents in the forward direction and dissipative currents in the backward direction. The Josephson diode has proven to be a promising design where the junction between the two superconductors comprises the weakest link and thus provides the dominant mechanism. We here propose a Josephson diode based on a single magnetic material with a conical spin structure. The helical spin rotation produces Rashba-like band splitting inversely proportional to the rotation period. Together with the Zeeman splitting caused by the time-reversal symmetry breaking of the noncoplanar spin texture, this results in a large diode efficiency close to the $0-\pi$ transition of the magnetic Josephson junction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pair density wave (PDW) is a distinct superconducting state characterized by a periodic modulation of its order parameter in real space. Its intricate interplay with the charge density wave (CDW) state is a continuing topic of interest in condensed matter physics. While PDW states have been discovered in cuprates and other unconventional superconductors, the understanding of diverse PDWs and their interactions with different types of CDWs remains limited. Here, utilizing scanning tunneling microscopy, we unveil the subtle correlations between PDW ground states and two distinct CDW phases -- namely, anion-centered-CDW (AC-CDW) and hollow-centered-CDW (HC-CDW) -- in 2H-NbSe$_2$. In both CDW regions, we observe coexisting PDWs with a commensurate structure that aligns with the underlying CDW phase. The superconducting gap size, $\Delta(r)$, related to the pairing order parameter is in phase with the charge density in both CDW regions. Meanwhile, the coherence peak height, $H(r)$, qualitatively reflecting the electron-pair density, exhibits a phase difference of approximately $2\pi/3$ relative to the CDW. The three-fold rotational symmetry is preserved in the HC-CDW region but is spontaneously broken in the AC-CDW region due to the PDW state, leading to the emergence of nematic superconductivity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use crystalline silicon (Si) antennas to efficiently extract broadband single-photon fluorescence from shallow nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond into free space. Our design features relatively easy-to-pattern high-index Si resonators on the diamond surface to boost photon extraction by overcoming total internal reflection and Fresnel reflection at the diamond-air interface, and providing modest Purcell enhancement, without etching or otherwise damaging the diamond surface. In simulations, ~20 times more single photons are collected from a single NV center compared to the case without the antenna; in experiments, we observe an enhancement of ~4 times, limited by spatial alignment between the NV and the antenna. Our approach can be readily applied to other color centers in diamond, and more generally to the extraction of light from quantum emitters in wide-bandgap materials.</description>

      <title>Driving noncollinear interlayer exchange coupling intrinsically in magnetic trilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ferromagnetic side layers sandwiching a nonmagnetic spacer as a metallic trilayer has become a pivotal platform for achieving spintronic devices. Recent experiments demonstrate that manipulating the width or the nature of conducting spacer induces noncollinear magnetic alignment between the side layers. Our theoretical analysis reveals that altering the width of spacer significantly affects the interlayer exchange coupling (IEC), resulting in noncollinear alignment. Through analytic and first-principles methods, our study on the Fe/Ag/Fe trilayer shows that at a specific width of the Ag spacer, the magnetic moments of side layers tend to be perpendicular. This alignment is mediated by Ag quantum well states, exhibiting spin spirals across the trilayer. Our results reveal that the noncollinear IEC offers a degree of freedom to control magnetic devices and boot spintronic technology with improved transport capabilities.</description>

Abstract: Thermal transport is a fundamental mechanism of energy transfer process quite distinct from wave propagation phenomena. It can be manipulated well beyond the possibilities offered by natural materials with a new generation of artificial metamaterials: thermal metamaterials. Topological physics, a focal point in contemporary condensed matter physics, is closely intertwined with thermal metamaterials in recent years. Inspired by topological photonics and topological acoustics in wave metamaterials, a new research field emerged recently, which we dub `topological thermotics', which encompasses three primary branches: topological thermal conduction, convection, and radiation. For topological thermal conduction, we discuss recent advances in both 1D and higher-dimensional thermal topological phases. For topological thermal convection, we discuss the implementation of thermal exceptional points with their unique properties and non-Hermitian thermal topological states. Finally, we review the most recent demonstration of topological effects in the near-field and far-field radiation. Anticipating future developments, we conclude by discussing potential directions of topological thermotics, including the expansion into other diffusion processes such as particle dynamics and plasma physics, and the integration with machine learning techniques.</description>

      <title>Impurity States in Altermagnetic Superconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01008v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Altermagnetic superconductors hold the potential for novel phenomena, including topological states, finite-momentum superconductivity, as well as promising applications in spintronics. However, an experimental demonstration of the coexistence of these two effects is still lacking. In this work, we propose potential impurities as a way to probe the distinctive properties of altermagnetic superconductors. These impurities induce spin-polarized subgap states that extend along the crystal axes, inheriting the magnetic characteristics of the bulk. When the impurities respect the bulk symmetries, they generate spin-degenerate doublets; otherwise, the degeneracy is lifted. An external magnetic field aligned with the N\'eel vector can tune the energies of the spin components of the subgap states. These components show different spatial extensions that can be measured via local probes, like scanning tunneling microscopy. For certain parameters, the impurity state can induce a local sign change on the order parameter, so-called $\pi$-transition. Lastly, we investigate the interaction between impurities, revealing a position-dependent effective coupling that facilitates the engineering of spin-dependent tunneling. This tunable coupling introduces a new approach for in-situ control of devices critical for quantum information processing and topological superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Localization at irrational fillings in the Aubry-Andr\'{e} model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We calculate the phase diagram of the Aubry-Andr\'{e} model as a function of filling and potential strength ($W$). We apply periodic boundary conditions and calculate the geometric Binder cumulant to determine the transition between the extended and localized phases. For rational fillings the phase transition occurs at $W=2t$ ($t$ denotes the hopping parameter), but spikes occur in the phase diagram at fillings which correspond to ratios of Fibonacci numbers. In the thermodynamic limit these ratios tend to specific irrational numbers, and $W \rightarrow 0$ at these fillings. We also calculate the phase diagram of an extended Aubry-Andr\'{e} model with second nearest neighbor hoppings. In addition to spikes, this phase diagram also exhibits discontinuities (jumps) at some of the irrational fillings at which the spikes occur.</description>

      <title>Computing virtual dark-field X-ray microscopy images of complex discrete dislocation structures from large-scale molecular dynamics simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dark-field X-ray Microscopy (DFXM) is a novel diffraction-based imaging technique that non-destructively maps the local deformation from crystalline defects in bulk materials. While studies have demonstrated that DFXM can spatially map 3D defect geometries, it is still challenging to interpret DFXM images of the high dislocation density systems relevant to macroscopic crystal plasticity. This work develops a scalable forward model to calculate virtual DFXM images for complex discrete dislocation (DD) structures obtained from atomistic simulations. Our new DD-DFXM model integrates a non-singular formulation for calculating the local strain from the DD structures and an efficient geometrical optics algorithm for computing the DFXM image from the strain. We apply the model to complex DD structures obtained from a large-scale molecular dynamics (MD) simulation of compressive loading on a single-crystal silicon. Simulated DFXM images exhibit prominent feature contrast for dislocations between the multiple slip systems, demonstrating the DFXM's potential to resolve features from dislocation multiplication. The integrated DD-DFXM model provides a toolbox for DFXM experimental design and image interpretation in the context of bulk crystal plasticity for the breadth of measurements across shock plasticity and the broader materials science community.</description>

      <title>Single nuclear spin detection and control in a van der Waals material</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optically active spin defects in solids are leading candidates for quantum sensing and quantum networking. Recently, single spin defects were discovered in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), a layered van der Waals (vdW) material. Due to its two-dimensional structure, hBN allows spin defects to be positioned closer to target samples than in three-dimensional crystals, making it ideal for atomic-scale quantum sensing, including nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) of single molecules. However, the chemical structures of these defects remain unknown, and detecting a single nuclear spin with an hBN spin defect has been elusive. In this study, we created single spin defects in hBN using $^{13}$C ion implantation and identified three distinct defect types. We observed both $S=1$ and $S=1/2$ spin states within a single hBN spin defect, with only the $S=1/2$ states showing strong hyperfine interactions with nearby $^{13}$C nuclear spins. For the first time, we demonstrated atomic-scale NMR and coherent control of individual nuclear spins in a vdW material. By comparing experimental results with density-functional theory calculations, we propose chemical structures for these spin defects. Our work advances the understanding of single spin defects in hBN and provides a pathway to enhance quantum sensing using hBN spin defects with nuclear spins as quantum memories.</description>

      <title>Probing the mesoscopics of competing interactions with the thermodynamic curvature: the case of a two-parameter ANNNI chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work examines the full scope of long-standing conjectures identifying the invariant thermodynamic curvature $R$ as the correlation volume $\xi^d$ and also as a measure of underlying statistical interactions. To this end, we set up a two-parameter ANNNI (Axial Next Nearest Neighbour Ising) chain featuring two next nearest neighbour (nnn) and a nearest neighbour (nn) interaction. Competition between interactions and resulting frustration engender a rich phase behaviour including a cross-over between two ferrimagnetic sub-phases. We show that $R$ attests to all its conjectured attributes with valuable insights into the character of mesoscopic fluctuating substructures. In a remarkable demonstration of its relevance at a far-from-critical point, $R$ is shown to resolve a hitherto unnoticed tricky issue involving $\xi$. A physically transparent expression for the zero field $R$ helps bring into focus the pivotal role played by some third order fluctuation moments.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous curvature in two-dimensional van der Waals heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures consist of different 2D crystals with diverse properties, constituting the cornerstone of the new generation of 2D electronic devices. Yet interfaces in heterostructures inevitably break bulk symmetry and structural continuity, resulting in delicate atomic rearrangements and novel electronic structures. In this paper, we predict that 2D interfaces undergo spontaneous curvature, which means when two flat 2D layers approach each other, they inevitably experience out-of-plane curvature. Based on deep-learning-assisted large-scale molecular dynamics simulations, we observed significant out-of-plane displacements up to 3.8 angstrom in graphene/BN bilayers induced by curvature, producing a stable hexagonal moire pattern, which agrees well with experimentally observations. Additionally, the out-of-plane flexibility of 2D crystals enables the propagation of curvature throughout the system, thereby influencing the mechanical properties of the heterostructure. These findings offer fundamental insights into the atomic structure in 2D vdW heterostructures and pave the way for their applications in devices.</description>

      <title>Long-distance strong coupling of magnon and photon: Effect of multi-mode waveguide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coupled mode theory predicts that the long-distance coupling between two distant harmonic oscillators is in the weak coupling regime. However, a recent experimental measurement observed strong coupling of magnon and critically-driven photon with a distance of over two meters. To explain the discrepancy between theory and experiment, we study long-distance coupling of magnon and photon mediated by a multi-mode waveguide. Our results show that strong coupling is achieved only when both critical coupling and multi-mode waveguide are involved. The former reduces the damping while the latter enhances the coupling strength by increasing the pathways of coupling magnon and photon. Our theory and results pave the way for understanding the long-distance coherence and designing the magnon-based distributed quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Quantum transport on Bethe lattices with non-Hermitian sources and a drain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider quantum transport on a tight-binding model on the Bethe lattice of a finite generation, or the Cayley tree, which may model the energy transport in a light-harvesting molecule. As a new feature to analyze the quantum transport, we add complex potentials for sources on the peripheral sites and for a drain on the central site. We find that the eigenstates that can penetrate from the peripheral sites to the central site are quite limited to the number of generation. All the other eigenstates are localized around the peripheral sites and cannot reach the central site. The former eigenstates can carry the current, which reduces the problem to the quantum transport on a parity-time ($PT$)-symmetric tight-binding chain. When the number of links is common to all generations, the current takes the maximum value at the exceptional point for the zero-energy states, which emerges because of the non-Hermiticity due to the $PT$-symmetric complex potentials. As we introduce randomness in the number of links in each generation of the tree, the resulting linear chain is a random-hopping tight-binding model. We find that the current reaches its maximum not exactly but approximately for a zero-energy state, although it is no longer located at an exceptional point in general.</description>

Abstract: Magneto-conductance in thin wires often exhibits complicated patterns due to the quantum interference of conduction electrons. These patterns reflect microscopic structures in the wires, such as defects or potential distributions. In this study, we propose an inverse design method to automatically generate a microscopic structure that exhibits desired magneto-conductance patterns. We numerically demonstrate that our method accurately generates defect positions in wires and can be effectively applied to various complicated patterns. We also discuss techniques for designing structures that facilitate experimental investigation.</description>

      <title>Revealing subterahertz atomic vibrations in quantum paraelectrics by surface-sensitive spintronic terahertz spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding surface collective dynamics in quantum materials is crucial for advancing quantum technologies. For example, surface phonon modes in quantum paraelectrics are thought to play an essential role in facilitating interfacial superconductivity. However, detecting these modes, especially below 1 terahertz (THz), is challenging due to limited sampling volumes and the need for high spectroscopic resolution. Here, we report surface soft transverse optical (TO1) phonon dynamics in KTaO3 and SrTiO3 by developing surface-sensitive spintronic THz spectroscopy that can sense the collective modes only a few nanometers deep from the surface. In KTaO3, the TO1 mode softens and sharpens with decreasing temperature, leveling off at 0.7 THz. In contrast, this mode in SrTiO3 broadens significantly below the quantum paraelectric crossover and coincides with the hardening of a sub-meV phonon mode related to the antiferrodistortive transition. These observations that deviate from their bulk properties may have implications for interfacial superconductivity and ferroelectricity. The developed technique opens opportunities for sensing low-energy surface excitations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.06123v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study local density of state (LDOS) oscillations arising from the scattering of electrons at atomic edge defects in topological insulator (TI) surfaces. To create edge scattering on the surface of a TI, we assume that half of its surface is covered with a semiconductor. In addition to modifying the TI states in the covered half, the presence of the semiconductor leads to a localized edge potential at the vacuum-semiconductor boundary. We study the induced LDOS by imposing time-reversal (TR) invariance and current conservation across the boundary. Additionally, we explore how the scattering of TI junctions with dissimilar spin textures and anisotropic Fermi velocities affect the modulations of the LDOS away from the junction edge. In all cases, for energies close to the Dirac point, we find that the decay envelope of the LDOS oscillations is insensitive to the scattering at the atomic edge defect, with a decay power given by $x^{-3/2}$. Quantitative differences in the amplitude of these oscillations depend on the details of the interface and the spin textures, while the period of the oscillations is defined by the size of the Fermi surface.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.00866v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Landau levels are the eigenstates of a charged particle in two dimensions under a magnetic field, and are at the heart of the integer and fractional quantum Hall effects, which are two prototypical phenomena showing topological features. Following recent discoveries of fractional quantum Hall phases in van der Waals materials, there is a rapid progress in understanding of the precise condition under which the fractional quantum Hall phases can be stabilized. It is now understood that the key to obtaining the fractional quantum Hall phases is the energy band whose eigenstates are holomorphic functions in both real and momentum space coordinates. Landau levels are indeed examples of such energy bands with an additional special property of having flat geometrical features. In this paper, we prove that, in fact, the only energy eigenstates having holomorphic wave functions with a flat geometry are the Landau levels and their higher Chern number analogs. Since it has been known that any holomorphic eigenstates can be constructed from the ones with a flat geometry such as the Landau levels, our uniqueness proof of the Landau levels allows one to construct any possible holomorphic eigenstate with which the fractional quantum Hall phases can be stabilized.</description>

Abstract: A theoretical study on electrical current fluctuations in a double quantum dot connected to electronic reservoirs is presented, with the aim of deriving the finite-frequency noise, the Fano factor and the $\Delta T$-noise. We establish a general expression for the noise in terms of Green functions in the double quantum dot and self-energies in the reservoirs. This result is then applied to model double quantum dots in various situations. For a non-interacting double quantum dot, we have highlighted several interesting features in the physical properties of this system. In particular, we have demonstrated the possibility of obtaining a significant reduction in zero-frequency noise and Fano factor either when the system is placed in a given operating regime, or when a temperature gradient is applied between the two reservoirs, resulting in a negative $\Delta T$-noise being generated. In addition, in the vicinity of honeycomb vertices, a sign change is observed in the finite-frequency cross-correlator between the two reservoirs, in contrast to what is obtained for the zero-frequency cross-correlator, which remains negative throughout the $(\varepsilon_1,\varepsilon_2)$-plane, $\varepsilon_{1,2}$ being the level energies in each of the two dots. By using an approximate first-level numerical approach, we finally study how the finite-frequency noise in a double quantum dot evolves under the influence of Coulomb interactions.</description>

Abstract: The nonlinear Hall effect has recently attracted significant interest due to its potential as a promising spectral tool and device applications. A theory of the nonlinear Hall effect on a disordered lattice is a crucial step towards explorations in realistic devices, but has not been addressed. We study the nonlinear Hall response on a lattice, which allows us to introduce strong disorder numerically. We reveal a disorder-induced fluctuation of the Berry curvature that was not discovered in the previous perturbation theories. The fluctuating Berry curvature induces a fluctuation of the nonlinear Hall conductivity, which anomalously increases as the Fermi energy moves from the band edges to higher energies. More importantly, the fluctuation may explain those observations in the recent experiments. We also discover an "Anderson localization" of the nonlinear Hall effect. This work shows a territory of the nonlinear Hall effect yet to be explored.</description>

      <title>Influence of disorder on antidot vortex Majorana states in 3D topological insulators</title>

Abstract: Topological insulator/superconductor two-dimensional heterostructures are promising candidates for realizing topological superconductivity and Majorana modes. In these systems, a vortex pinned by a pre-fabricated antidot in the superconductor can host Majorana zero-energy modes (MZMs), which are exotic quasiparticles that may enable quantum information processing. However, a major challenge is to design devices that can manipulate the information encoded in these MZMs. One of the key factors is to create small and clean antidots, so the MZMs, localized in the vortex core, have a large gap to other excitations. If the antidot is too large or too disordered, the level spacing for the subgap vortex states may become smaller than temperature. In this paper, we numerically investigate the effects of disorder, chemical potential, and antidot size on the subgap vortex spectrum, using a two-dimensional effective model of the topological insulator surface. Our model allows us to simulate large system sizes with vortices up to 1.8 $\mu$m in diameter (with a 6 nm lattice constant). We also compare our disorder model with the transport data from existing experiments. We find that the spectral gap can exhibit a non-monotonic behavior as a function of disorder strength, and that it can be tuned by applying a gate voltage.</description>

      <title>Breaking surface plasmon excitation constraint via surface spin waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04626v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Surface plasmons in two-dimensional (2D) electron systems have attracted great attention for their promising light-matter applications. However, the excitation of a surface plasmon, in particular, transverse-electric (TE) surface plasmon, remains an outstanding challenge due to the difficulty to conserve energy and momentum simultaneously in the normal 2D materials. Here we show that the TE surface plasmons ranging from gigahertz to terahertz regime can be effectively excited and manipulated in a hybrid dielectric, 2D material and magnet structure. The essential physics is that the surface spin wave supplements an additional freedom of surface plasmon excitation and thus greatly enhances the electric field in the 2D medium. Based on widely-used magnetic materials like yttrium iron garnet (YIG) and manganese difluoride ($\mathrm{MnF}_2$), we further show that the plasmon excitation manifests itself as a measurable dip in the reflection spectrum of the hybrid system while the dip position and the dip depth can be well controlled by an electric gating on the 2D layer and an external magnetic field. Our findings should bridge the fields of low-dimensional physics, plasmonics and spintronics and open a novel route to integrate plasmonic and spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Energy landscape of noncollinear exchange coupled magnetic multilayers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15910v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We conduct an exploration of the energy landscape of two coupled ferromagnetic layers with perpendicular-to-plane uniaxial anisotropy using finite-element micromagnetic simulations. These multilayers can be used to produce noncollinearity in spin-transfer torque magnetic random-access memory cells, which has been shown to increase the performance of this class of computer memory. We show that there exists a range of values of the interlayer exchange coupling constants for which the magnetic state of these multilayers can relax into two energy minima. The size of this region is determined by the difference in the magnitude of the layer anisotropies and is minimized when this difference is large. In this case, there is a wide range of experimentally achievable coupling constants that can produce desirable and stable noncollinear alignment. We investigate the energy barriers separating the local and global minima using string method simulations, showing that the stabilities of the minima increase with increasing difference in the anisotropy of the ferromagnetic layers. We provide an analytical solution to the location of the minima in the energy landscape of coupled macrospins, which has good agreement with our micromagnetic results for a case involving ferromagnetic layers with the same thickness and anisotropy, no demagnetization field, and large exchange stiffness. These results are important to understand how best to employ noncollinear coupling in the next generation of thin film magnetic devices.</description>

      <title>Breakdown of the static dielectric screening approximation of Coulomb interactions in atomically thin semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18639v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coulomb interactions in atomically thin materials are uniquely sensitive to variations in the dielectric screening of the environment, which can be used to control quasiparticles and exotic quantum many-body phases. A static approximation of the dielectric response, where increased dielectric screening is predicted to cause an energy redshift of the exciton resonance, has been until now sufficient. Here, we use charge-tunable exciton resonances to study screening effects in transition metal dichalcogenide monolayers embedded in materials with dielectric constants ranging from 4 to more than 1000. In contrast to expectations, we observe a blueshift of the exciton resonance exceeding 30 meV for larger dielectric constant environments. By employing a dynamical screening model, we find that while the exciton binding energy remains mostly controlled by the static dielectric response, the exciton self-energy is dominated by the high-frequency response. Dielectrics with markedly different static and high-frequency screening enable the selective addressing of distinct many-body effects in layered materials and their heterostructures, expanding the tunability range and offering new routes to detect and control correlated quantum many-body states and to design optoelectronic and quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Substrate, temperature and magnetic field dependence of electric polarisation in mixed-stacking tetralayer graphenes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09354v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Polytypes of tetralayer graphene (TLG: Bernal, rhombohedral and mixed stacking) are crystalline structures with different symmetries. Among those, mixed-stacking tetralayers lack inversion symmetry, which allows for intrinsic spontaneous out-of-plane electrical polarisation, inverted in the mirror-image pair, ABCB and ABAC stackings. Here, we compare the intrinsic polarisation of such TLGs with the symmetry-breaking effect of a substrate, which can also generate out-of-plane electric dipole moments with different sizes in all four polytypes, including ABCB and ABAC twins. We analyse their temperature and magnetic field dependence, in view of understanding the origin of the recently measured Kelvin probe force microscopy maps of tetralayer flakes, and notice that the intrinsic contribution could be singled out based on magnetic field dependence of polarisation measured at low temperatures.</description>

Abstract: Artificial quantum systems have emerged as indispensable platforms to realize exotic topological matter in a well-controlled manner. Here, we demonstrate topological quantum Heisenberg spin lattices, engineered with spin chains and two-dimensional spin arrays using spin 1/2 atoms on insulating films in a scanning tunnelling microscope (STM). We engineered with atomic precision both topological and trivial phases of the quantum spin model, realizing first- and second-order topological quantum magnets. Their many-body excitations were probed by single-atom electron spin resonance with ultrahigh energy resolution. The atomically-localized magnetic field of the STM tip allows us to directly visualize various topological bound modes including topological edge states, topological defects, and higher-order corner modes. Our results provide an important bottom-up approach to simulating exotic quantum many-body phases of interacting spins.</description>

      <title>pyMSER -- An open-source library for automatic equilibration detection in molecular simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19387v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Automated molecular simulations are used extensively for predicting material properties. Typically, these simulations exhibit two regimes: a dynamic equilibration part, followed by a steady state. For extracting observable properties, the simulations must first reach a steady state so that thermodynamic averages can be taken. However, as equilibration depends on simulation conditions, predicting the optimal number of simulation steps a priori is impossible. Here, we demonstrate the application of the Marginal Standard Error Rule (MSER) for automatically identifying the optimal truncation point in Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations. This novel automatic procedure determines the point in which steady state is reached, ensuring that figures-of-merits are extracted in an objective, accurate, and reproducible fashion. In the case of GCMC simulations of gas adsorption in metal-organic frameworks, we find that this methodology reduces the computational cost by up to 90%. As MSER statistics are independent of the simulation method that creates the data, this library is, in principle, applicable to any time series analysis in which equilibration truncation is required. The open-source Python implementation of our method, pyMSER, is publicly available for reuse and validation at https://github.com/IBM/pymser.</description>

Abstract: We theoretically consider a junction composed of a ferromagnetic insulator (FI) and a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) with Rashba- and Dresselhaus-type spin-orbit interactions. Using the Boltzmann equation, we calculate an electric current in 2DEG induced by the inverse Rashba-Edelstein effect when imposing the temperature difference between FI and 2DEG. We clarify how the induced current depends on the magnetization direction of FI, spin texture on the Fermi surface of 2DEG, and temperature. Our result provides an important foundation for an accurate analysis of the inverse Rashba-Edelstein effect induced by thermal spin injection.</description>

      <title>RKKY interaction in Rashba altermagnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06736v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interaction between two impurity spins provides vital information about the host system and has been suggested to form a building block in quantum computation and spintronic devices. We here determine this Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interaction in recently discovered altermagnetic materials, including the presence of a Zeeman field, in a two- and three-dimensional altermagnet. In two dimensions, we also study the effect of Rashba spin-orbit coupling. Our results reveal that the momentum-resolved spin-polarization of the itinerant carriers in the altermagnet changes the RKKY interaction qualitatively from the isotropic spin-splitting in a ferromagnet. The Ising-contribution directed parallel with the altermagnetism is found to exhibit a beating pattern reflecting the shape of the Fermi surface of the system and may thus be further influenced by an out-of-plane Zeeman field. However, the exchange interaction for in-plane impurity spins deviates only slightly from that of a normal metal. On shorter length scales, we find that the Ising, the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya terms, and other non-collinear interaction terms in the RKKY interaction acquire a rapidly oscillating behavior as a function of the relative angle between the impurity spins, which is not present in the ferromagnetic case. We determine how this new length scale depends on the system parameters analytically. Our results show that the RKKY interaction in altermagnets is qualitatively different from that of ferromagnets despite both breaking time-reversal symmetry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08058v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We uncover a novel physical mechanism that enables a switch between attractive and repulsive Casimir forces when a Teflon surface interacts with a new form of quantum material (i.e., gapped metal) surface across different liquid media. We demonstrate the discovery of a zero-frequency Casimir effect, which, for the first time, reveals the potential for quantum switching within nanometer distances-a scale previously thought to be unattainable. Hence, our results introduce a new method to induce phase (stoichiometry)-controlled attraction-repulsion transitions and achieving quantum levitation in a liquid medium by tuning the liquid environment. This study thus not only advances our understanding of quantum forces at the nanoscale via their correlation to dielectric properties of involved materials but also opens up exciting possibilities for their manipulation in novel ways, forming the basis towards innovative advancements in nanoscale technology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01664v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the well-known phonon scattering induced high-temperature linear-in-$T$ metallic resistivity, showing that a naive extrapolation of the effective linearity from high temperatures to $T=0$ leads to an apparent zero-temperature negative resistivity. The precise magnitude of this extrapolated $T=0$ negative resistivity depends on the temperature regime from where the extrapolation is carried out, and approaches the correct physical result of zero resistivity at $T=0$ only if the extrapolation starts from $T\gg T_D$, where $T_D$ is the Debye temperature. We establish a theoretical relationship between the negative intercept and the slope of the linear-in-$T$ resistivity as a function of the temperature $T$ from where the extrapolation is carried out. Experimental implications of our finding are discussed for the much-discussed Planckian behavior of the transport scattering rate.</description>

Abstract: Spin qubits in gate-defined quantum dots are emerging as a leading technology due to their scalability and long coherence times. However, maintaining these qubits at ultra-low temperatures typically requires complex cryogenic systems. This paper proposes a novel gate-defined double quantum dot (DQD) cooling system using microwave-induced state depopulation and phonon filtering to achieve local temperatures below 10 mK at a bath temperature of 1 K. The system utilizes microwave-induced state depopulation and phonon filtering, combined with fast cyclic detuning of the quantum dot on-site energies and Rabi oscillations, to efficiently transfer thermal populations to the ground state, thereby surpassing natural thermal transition rates. The cooling cycle involves adjusting gate potentials to drive the system through adiabatic and diabatic transitions, complemented by microwave pulses resonant with specific energy level differences. This mechanism continuously pumps the population from excited states into the ground state, effectively reducing the system's temperature. Numerical calculations demonstrate the feasibility of achieving these low local temperatures, with detailed analysis showing the sensitivity of cooling performance to detuning energy, magnetic field strength, and diabatic return time.</description>

Abstract: Magnetic inertia has emerged as a possible way to manipulate ferromagnetic spins at a higher frequency e.g., THz. Theoretical treatments so far have considered the magnetic inertia as a scalar quantity. Here, we explore the magnetic inertial dynamics with a magnetic inertia tensor as macroscopic derivations predicted it to be a tensor. First, the inertia tensor has been decomposed into three terms: (a) scalar and isotropic inertia, (b) anisotropic and symmetric inertia tensor, (c) chiral and antisymmetric tensor. Further, we employ linear response theory to the inertial Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation with the inertia tensor and calculate the effect of chiral and anisotropic inertia on ferromagnets, antiferromagnets, and ferrimagnets. It is established that the precession and nutation resonance frequencies decrease with scalar magnetic inertia. Our results suggest that the nutation resonance frequencies further reduce due to inertia tensor. However, the effective damping of the nutation resonance increases with the chiral and antisymmetric part of the inertia tensor. We show that the precession resonances remain unaffected, while the nutation resonances are modified with the chiral magnetic inertia.</description>

      <title>Influence of Nonequilibrium Vibrational Dynamics on Spin Selectivity in Chiral Molecular Junctions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16082v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the role of molecular vibrations in the chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect in the context of charge transport through a molecular nanojunction. We employ a mixed quantum-classical approach that combines Ehrenfest dynamics for molecular vibrations with the hierarchical equations of motion method for the electronic degrees of freedom. This approach treats the molecular vibrations in a nonequilibrium manner, which is crucial for the dynamics of molecular nanojunctions. To explore the effect of vibrational dynamics on spin selectivity, we also introduce a new figure of merit, the displacement polarization, which quantifies the difference in vibrational displacements for opposing lead magnetizations. We analyze the dynamics of single trajectories, investigating how the spin selectivity depends on voltage and electronic-vibrational coupling. Furthermore, we investigate the dynamics and temperature dependence of ensemble-averaged observables. We demonstrate that spin selectivity is correlated in time with the vibrational polarization, indicating that dynamics of the molecular vibrations is the driving force of CISS in this model within the Ehrenfest approach.</description>

      <title>Modeling magnetization reversal in multilayers with interlayer exchange coupling</title>

Abstract: Spin spirals form inside the magnetic layers of antiferromagnetic and noncollinearly-coupled magnetic multilayers in the presence of an external magnetic field. This spin structure can be modeled to extract the direct exchange stiffness of the magnetic layers and the strength of the interlayer exchange coupling across the spacer layer. In this article, we discuss three models to describe the evolution of the spin spiral with the strength of the external magnetic field in these coupled structures: discrete energy, discrete torque, and continuous torque. These models are expanded to accommodate multilayers with any number of ferromagnetic layers, any combination of material parameters, and asymmetry. We compare their performance when fitting to the measured magnetization data of a range of sputtered samples with one or multiple ferromagnetic layers on either side of the spacer. We find that the discrete models produce better fits than the continuous for asymmetric and multi-ferromagnetic structures and exhibit much better computational scaling with high numbers of atomic layers than the continuous model. For symmetric, single-layered structures, the continuous model produces the same fit statistics and outperforms the discrete models. Lastly, we demonstrate the methods by which one can use interfacial layers to measure the exchange stiffness of magnetic layers with low interlayer exchange coupling. An open-access website has been provided to allow the fitting of magnetization as a function of field in arbitrary coupled structures using the discrete energy model.</description>

      <title>Highly tunable NbTiN Josephson junctions fabricated with focused helium ion beam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.17348v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a direct writing method for the fabrication of planar Josephson junctions from high quality superconducting niobium titanium nitride (NbTiN) thin films, by creating local disorder using focused He-ion beam irradiation in a helium ion microscope. We show that we can control the suppression of superconductivity in NbTiN as a function of the helium ion beam fluence, enabling us to successfully fabricate Josephson junctions with highly tunable weak links ranging from metallic to insulating phase, due to the continuous nature of the disorder-induced superconductor-insulator transition. We demonstrate the successful fabrication of both SNS and SIS type of devices, and show that we can achieve exceptionally wide range ($\sim$5 orders of magnitude) of critical current densities and junction resistances. The SNS type junctions follow closely the ideal resistively and capacitively shunted junction behavior, have high characteristic voltages up to $\sim$ 1.5\,mV and show Shapiro steps up to very high orders, while the SIS junctions also follow established theories well. The results suggest that junctions fabricated with this method from NbTiN are suitable for a wide range of applications in superconducting electronics because of the excellent mechanical, electrical and microwave properties of NbTiN. In particular, as NbTiN has previously been used to fabricate high quality factor microwave resonators, we see the method as a promising and simple way to realize superconducting qubits and other quantum devices using only a single superconducting film.</description>

      <title>Geometrical description and Faddeev-Jackiw quantization of electrical networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.12252v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In lumped-element electrical circuit theory, the problem of solving Maxwell's equations in the presence of media is reduced to two sets of equations, the constitutive equations encapsulating local geometry and dynamics of a confined energy density, and the Kirchhoff equations enforcing conservation of charge and energy in a larger, topological, scale. We develop a new geometric and systematic description of the dynamics of general lumped-element electrical circuits as first order differential equations, derivable from a Lagrangian and a Rayleigh dissipation function. Through the Faddeev-Jackiw method we identify and classify the singularities that arise in the search for Hamiltonian descriptions of general networks. The core of our solution relies on the correct identification of the reduced manifold in which the circuit state is expressible, e.g., a mix of flux and charge degrees of freedom, including the presence of compact ones. We apply our fully programmable method to obtain (canonically quantizable) Hamiltonian descriptions of nonlinear and nonreciprocal circuits which would be cumbersome/singular if pure node-flux or loop-charge variables were used as a starting configuration space. We also propose a specific assignment of topology for the branch variables of energetic elements, that when used as input to the procedure gives results consistent with classical descriptions as well as with spectra of more involved quantum circuits. This work unifies diverse existent geometrical pictures of electrical network theory, and will prove useful, for instance, to automatize the computation of exact Hamiltonian descriptions of superconducting quantum chips.</description>

      <title>Josephson effect in a fractal geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01373v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Josephson effect is a hallmark signature of the superconducting state, which, however, has been sparsely explored in non-crystalline superconducting materials. Motivated by this, we consider a Josephson junction consisting of two superconductors with a fractal metallic interlayer, which is patterned as a Sierpi\'nski carpet by removing atomic sites in a self-similar and scale-invariant manner. We here show that the fractal geometry has direct observable consequences on the Josephson effect. In particular, we demonstrate that the form of the supercurrent-magnetic field relation as the fractal generation number increases can be directly related to the self-similar fractal geometry of the normal metallic layer. Furthermore, the maxima of the corresponding diffraction pattern directly encode the self-repeating fractal structure in the course of fractal generation, implying that the corresponding magnetic length directly probes the shortest length scale in the given fractal generation. Our results should motivate future experimental efforts to verify these predictions in designer quantum materials and motivate future pursuits regarding fractal-based SQUID devices.</description>

      <title>Reduction of Joule Losses in Memristive Switching Using Optimal Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01507v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study investigates strategies for minimizing Joule losses in resistive random access memory (ReRAM) cells, which are also referred to as memristive devices. Typically, the structure of ReRAM cells involves a nanoscale layer of resistance-switching material sandwiched between two metal electrodes. The basic question that we ask is what is the optimal driving protocol to switch a memristive device from one state to another. In the case of ideal memristors, in the most basic scenario, the optimal protocol is determined by solving a variational problem without constraints with the help of the Euler-Lagrange equation. In the case of memristive systems, for the same situation, the optimal protocol is found using the method of Lagrange multipliers. We demonstrate the advantages of our approaches through specific examples and compare our results with those of switching with constant voltage or current. Our findings suggest that voltage or current control can be used to reduce Joule losses in emerging memory devices.</description>

      <title>Entropic pulling and diffusion diode in an It\^o process</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02667v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Biological environments at micrometer scales and below are often crowded, and experience incessant stochastic thermal fluctuations. The presence of membranes/pores, and multiple biological entities in a constricted space can make the damping/diffusion inhomogeneous. This effect of inhomogeneity is presented by the diffusion becoming coordinate-dependent. In this paper, we analyze the consequence of inhomogeneity-induced coordinate-dependent diffusion on Brownian systems in thermal equilibrium under the It\^o's interpretation. We argue that the presence of coordinate-dependent diffusion under It\^o's formulation gives rise to an effective diffusion potential (and, equivalently an entropy) that can have substantial contribution to system's transport. This emergent force when looked at as of entropic origin it provides a physical basis of the notion of the entropic pulling postulated in the context of working of some biological systems.</description>

      <title>Weak $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Supertopology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00042v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Crystal symmetries can enforce all bands of a material to be topological, a property that is commonly referred to as ``supertopology". Here, we determine the symmetry-enforced $\mathbb{Z}_2$ supertopologies of non-magnetic centrosymmetric materials with weak and strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC). For weak (i.e., negligible) SOC, crystal symmetries can enforce Dirac nodal lines protected by a $\pi$-Berry phase, while for strong SOC, crystal symmetries can give rise to nontrival weak $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topologies in 2D subplanes of the 3D Brillouin zone. We catalogue all centrosymmetric space groups whose symmetries enforce these $\mathbb{Z}_2$ supertopologies. Suitable material realizations are identified and experimental signatures of the supertopologies, such as quantum spin Hall states, are being discussed.</description>

      <title>Understanding the Optoelectronic Processes in Colloidal 2D Multi-Layered MAPbBr3 Perovskite Nanosheets: Funneling, Recombination and Self-Trapped Excitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04571v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quasi two-dimensional (2D) colloidal synthesis made quantum confinement readily accessible in perovskites, generating additional momentum in perovskite LED research and lasing. Ultrathin perovskite layers exhibit high exciton binding energies and beneficial charge transport properties interesting for solar cells. In 2D perovskites, the combination of layers with different thickness helps to direct charge carriers in a targeted manner toward thicker layers with a smaller bandgap. However, detailed knowledge about the mechanisms by which excitons and charge carriers funnel and recombine in these structures is lacking. Here, we characterize colloidal 2D methylammonium lead bromide (MAPbBr3) Ruddlesden-Popper perovskites with a broad combination of layers (n = 3 to 10, and bulk fractions with n &gt; 10) in one stack by femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy and time-resolved photoluminescence, which gives comprehensive insights into the complexity of funneling and recombination processes. We find that after photoexcitation second- and third-order processes dominate in MAPbBr3 nanosheets, which indicates exciton-exciton annihilation (EEA) and Auger recombination. Long-lived excitons in thin layers (e.g., n = 5, Eb = 136 meV) funnel into high n with t = 10-50 ps, which decreases their exciton binding energy below kB T = 26 meV ( T = 300K) and leads to radiative recombination. Parallel and consecutive funneling compete with exciton trapping processes, making funneling an excellent tool to overcome exciton self-trapping when high-quality n-n interfaces are present. Free charge carriers in high n regions on the other hand facilitate radiative recombination and EEA is bypassed, which is desirable for LED and lasing applications.</description>
