      <title>Enzyme-free in situ polymerization of conductive polymers catalyzed by porous Au@Ag nanowires for stretchable neural electrodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In situ polymerization of conductive polymers (CPs) represents a transformative approach in bioelectronics, by enabling the controlled growth of electrically active materials right at the tissue or device surface to create seamless biotic-abiotic interfaces. Traditional CP deposition techniques often use high anodic potentials, non-physiological electrolytes, or strong oxidants, making them harmful to adjacent tissues. A possible solution is enzymatic polymerization which operates under milder conditions, but it is limited by the stability and activity window of the enzyme catalysts, low throughput, and challenges in spatially confining polymer growth. To resolve these issues, here we developed one-dimensional porous Au-coated Ag nanowires with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-like catalytic properties, thereby for the first time enabling mild in situ enzyme-free polymerization of conductive polymers near neutral pH. The enzyme-free polymerization is demonstrated both in aqueous dispersions at pH=6 and in situ onto porous Au coated Ag nanowire based stretchable electrodes. Following enzyme-free catalytic polymerization, the electrically conducting polymer coating on the electrode greatly improves the impedance and achieves an impedance of 2.6 kOhm at 1 kHz for 50x50 um large electrodes.</description>

      <title>Reweighting scheme for the calculation of grand-canonical expectation values in quantum Monte Carlo simulations with a fermion sign problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ab initio path integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) simulations constitute the gold standard for the estimation of a broad range of equilibrium properties of a host of interacting quantum many-body systems spanning conditions from ultracold atoms to warm dense quantum plasmas. A key practical limitation is given by the notorious fermion sign problem, which manifests as an exponential computational bottleneck with respect to system size and inverse temperature. In practice, the sign problem is particularly severe in the grandcanonical ensemble, where the bosonic and fermionic configuration spaces differ not only with respect to the symmetry of the thermal density matrix but, crucially, also with respect to the particle number distribution for a given chemical potential $\mu$ [T. Dornheim, J. Phys. A 54, 335001 (2021)]. Here, we present a simple reweighting scheme that basically allows one to retain access to grandcanonical expectation values at the cost of fermionic PIMC simulations in the canonical ensemble for the largest significant particle number in the fermionic sector. As a practical example, we consider the warm dense electron gas, which has attracted considerable recent attention due to its relevance, e.g., for the modeling of compact astrophysical objects and inertial fusion energy applications</description>

      <title>On the Slipperiness of Surfactants: Charge-Mediated Friction Control at the Molecular Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: From soap-covered dishes to freshly cleaned floors, surfactants can make surfaces slippery; yet, the underlying mechanism remains poorly understood. Here, we identify the molecular origin behind this ubiquitous phenomenon using macroscopic tribology and surface molecular spectroscopy. We demonstrate that reducing friction through surfactants hinges on charge complementarity: surfactants of opposite charge to the solid surface reduce friction even at extreme contact pressures, whereas like-charged or neutral surfactants are ineffective. Oppositely charged surfactants self-assemble into dense and robust molecular brushes, creating a persistent lubrication beyond the limits of conventional mechanisms. This charge-mediated approach offers a universal and scalable framework for friction control across length scales without significant surface modification.</description>

      <title>Efficient and reliable modeling of large $\pi$-electron systems with the Pariser--Parr--Pople Hamiltonian and pCCD-based methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model Hamiltonians offer a cost-effective way to capture the key physics of large $\pi$-conjugated systems. In this work, we combine the Pariser--Parr--Pople (PPP) model Hamiltonian with pair Coupled Cluster Doubles (pCCD)-based methods to study the ground- and excited-state electronic structures of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). The model Hamiltonian implementation is done in the open-source PyBEST software package, where numerous pCCD-type models are available. We investigate canonical Hartree--Fock and natural pCCD-optimized orbitals to compute ground- and excited-state properties using pCCD and its linear response extension. Their performance is compared with configuration-interaction-based methods. Finally, we introduce a generalized parameterization of the long-range Coulomb interaction using a rescaled interaction prefactor to adopt the PPP parameters to the pCCD approach and the localized nature of the pCCD orbitals. Our results demonstrate that pCCD-based methods, combined with a suitably parametrized PPP model, provide a reliable and scalable framework for studying the optoelectronic properties of large $\pi$-extended systems relevant to organic electronics.</description>

      <title>A Third-Order Relativistic Algebraic Diagrammatic Construction Method for Double Ionization Potentials: Theory, Implementation, and Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a relativistic third-order algebraic diagrammatic construction (ADC(3)) approach for calculating double ionization potentials (DIPs). By employing the exact two-component atomic mean-field (X2CAMF) Hamiltonian in combination with a Cholesky decomposition (CD) representation of two-electron integrals and the frozen natural spinor (FNS) framework for virtual space truncation, we achieve a significant reduction in both memory requirements and computational cost. The DIPs obtained using the X2CAMF Hamiltonian show excellent agreement with results from fully relativistic four-component calculations. We have validated the accuracy of our implementation through comparisons with available experimental and theoretical data for inert gas atoms and diatomic species. The effect of higher-order relativistic corrections is also explored.</description>

      <title>MACE4IR: A foundation model for molecular infrared spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine-learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have shown significant promise in predicting infrared spectra with high fidelity. However, the absence of general-purpose MLIPs capable of handling a wide range of elements and their combinations has limited their broader applicability. In this work, we introduce MACE4IR, a machine learning foundation model built on the MACE architecture and trained on 10 million geometries and corresponding density-functional theory (DFT) energies, forces and dipole moments from the QCML dataset. The training data encompasses approximately 80 elements and a diverse set of molecules, including organic compounds, inorganic species, and metal complexes. MACE4IR accurately predicts energies, forces, dipole moments, and infrared spectra at significantly reduced computational cost compared to DFT. By combining generality, accuracy, and efficiency, MACE4IR opens the door to rapid and reliable infrared spectra prediction for complex systems across chemistry, biology, and materials science.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Hartree-Fock and Density Functional Theory Calculations using Tensor Hypercontraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the widespread use of self-consistent field methods, including Hartree-Fock and Density Functional Theory, the implications of accelerating these methods are immense. To this end, we develop a tensor hypercontraction construction with $O(N^3)$ formal scaling that can accelerate self-consistent field calculations. Using tensor hypercontraction, we implement an empirically $O(N^2)$ scaling Fock matrix construction that is 2-4$\times$ faster than existing integral-direct methods, as it avoids the repeated recalculation of two-electron repulsion integrals. In combination with a density-difference ansatz, our tensor hypercontraction self-consistent field implementation tests show errors below $7.0 x 10^{-3} E_h$ for relative energies on protein systems containing up to 3000 basis functions.</description>

      <title>Designing Antiferromagnetic Spin-1/2 Chains in Janus Fullerene Nanoribbons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We computationally design antiferromagnetic spin-1/2 chains in fullerene nanoribbons by introducing extra C$_{60}$ cages at one of their edges. The resulting odd number of intermolecular bonds induces an unpaired $\pi$-electron and hence a quantised magnetic moment in otherwise non-magnetic nanoribbons. We further reveal the formation of an antiferromagnetic ground state upon the linear arrangement of spin-$1/2$ C$_{60}$ cages that is insensitive to the specific structural motifs. Compared with graphene nanoribbons, Janus fullerene nanoribbons may offer an experimentally more accessible route to magnetic edge states with atomic precision in low-dimensional carbon nanostructures, possibly serving as a versatile nanoarchitecture for scalable spin-based devices and the exploration of many-body quantum phases.</description>

      <title>Alloyed cementite (Fe-Ni-Cr)$_3$C: structure and hyperfine field from DFT calculations and experimental comparison</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The alloying elements introduced into carbon steel to enhance its mechanical properties also diffuse into cementite (Fe$_3$C) particles, modifying their characteristics and thereby influencing the overall performance of the steel. This study employs density functional theory (DFT) calculations to investigate cementite doped with Ni and Cr which exhibit contrasting effects. The preferred lattice sites of impurity atoms were determined through a comparison of calculated and experimental structural parameters. The formation mechanism of the hyperfine magnetic field (HFF) and its correlation with atomic magnetic moments were systematically investigated. The validity of common approximations in M\"ossbauer spectroscopy analysis was evaluated for the cementite system. HFF distribution functions were modeled using calculated values and compared with experiments.</description>

      <title>Computational Study of Li+ Solvation Structures in Fluorinated Ether, Non-Fluorinated Ether, and Organic Carbonate-Based Electrolytes at Low and High Salt Concentrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11932v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the solvation structure of electrolytes is crucial for optimizing the performance and stability of lithium-ion batteries. Novel electrolytes are essential for enhancing electrolyte structure and ensuring better integration with modern electrode systems. Herein, we report a novel weakly solvated ether electrolyte (WSEE) composed of a pure fluorinated ether solvent, which results in an anion-rich solvation structure even at a low salt concentration of 1 M. To explore this, we selected the advanced fluorinated solvent 2,2-difluoroethyl methyl ether (FEME) and compared it with dipropyl ether (DPE), ethylene carbonate (EC), and diethyl carbonate (DEC). The prepared electrolyte systems include DPE with 1 M, 1.8 M, and 4 M LiFSI; FEME with 1 M, 1.8 M, and 4 M LiFSI; and a 1:1 vol% EC/DEC mixture containing 1 M LiPF6. In this work, we comprehensively investigate the Li+ solvation structures using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Our computational findings indicate the presence of large ion aggregates (AGGs) in each DPE- and FEME-based electrolyte, while SSIPs (68%) are the dominant species in the mixed EC/DEC electrolyte. Notably, the formation of large ion aggregates is more pronounced in FEME-based electrolytes. We find that, similar to DPE, the FEME solvent also exhibits weak solvating power across all examined salt concentrations. More specifically, we find that FEME has weaker solvating power than DPE. This behavior is predicted by MD simulations, which indicate a strong preference for Li+ ions to coordinate with FSI- anions within the primary solvation shell. Furthermore, the quantum mechanical features of the Li+ solvation structures in these electrolytes are analyzed in detail using DFT. We anticipate that this study will provide valuable insights into the Li+ solvation structures in DPE, FEME, and EC/DEC electrolytes.</description>

      <title>Multi-timescale time encoding for CNN prediction of Fenna-Matthews-Olson energy-transfer dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17430v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning simulations of open quantum dynamics often rely on recursive predictors that accumulate error. We develop a non-recursive convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that maps system parameters and a redundant time encoding directly to excitation-energy-transfer populations in the Fenna-Matthews-Olson complex. The encoding-modified logistic plus $\tanh$ functions-normalizes time and resolves fast, transitional, and quasi-steady regimes, while physics-informed labels enforce population conservation and inter-site consistency. Trained only on $0\sim 7 ps$ reference trajectories generated with a Lindblad model in QuTiP, the network accurately predicts $0\sim100 ps$ dynamics across a range of reorganization energies, bath rates, and temperatures. Beyond $20 ps$, the absolute relative error remains below 0.05, demonstrating stable long-time extrapolation. By avoiding step-by-step recursion, the method suppresses error accumulation and generalizes across timescales. These results show that redundant time encoding enables data-efficient inference of long-time quantum dissipative dynamics in realistic pigment-protein complexes, and may aid the data-driven design of light-harvesting materials.</description>

      <title>Quantum propagation scheme using Hagedorn wave packets : generalized scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17541v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we provide a novel wave packet propagation method that generalizes the Hagedorn approach by introducing alternative primitive basis sets that are better suited to describe different physical processes. More precisely, in our propagation scheme, we can mix basis sets with time-dependent parameters (the Hagedorn basis set) and time-independent ones, such as Fourier series, particle-in-a-box, or harmonic oscillator basis sets. Furthermore, our implementation can handle models with several electronic states, so that non-adiabatic processes can be studied. Instead of the time-dependent variational principle, our propagation scheme uses a three-step procedure (standard propagation, time-dependent parameter evaluation, and projection). It relies on multidimensional integrations, which are performed numerically with Gaussian quadrature, so that we have no constraints on the for of the Hamiltonian operator. This numerical algorithm has been implemented in a modern Fortran code available on GitHub (https://github.com/asodoga/TD_Schrod_Rabiou).
  The code has been tested and validated by comparisons with standard propagation schemes on 2D-models with harmonic and anharmonic potentials (modified H\'enon-Heiles). More precisely, our benchmark tests show that the wave packets obtained with our propagation scheme are able to converge to exact wave packets (obtained from standard propagation techniques). Finally, we have applied our method to compute the vibrational spectrum of the 6D-modified H\'enon-Heiles model and we show that our scheme reproduces well the results obtained with the standard approach and with smaller basis functions. As a perspective, we show that with the generalized Hagedorn wave packet method, we are able to study the non-adiabtic dynamics of the cis-trans retinal isomerization in a reduced 2D-model with two coupled electronic surfaces.</description>

      <title>Instruction-Based Molecular Graph Generation with Unified Text-Graph Diffusion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09896v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in computational chemistry have increasingly focused on synthesizing molecules based on textual instructions. Integrating graph generation with these instructions is complex, leading most current methods to use molecular sequences with pre-trained large language models. In response to this challenge, we propose a novel framework, named $\textbf{UTGDiff (Unified Text-Graph Diffusion Model)}$, which utilizes language models for discrete graph diffusion to generate molecular graphs from instructions. UTGDiff features a unified text-graph transformer as the denoising network, derived from pre-trained language models and minimally modified to process graph data through attention bias. Our experimental results demonstrate that UTGDiff consistently outperforms sequence-based baselines in tasks involving instruction-based molecule generation and editing, achieving superior performance with fewer parameters given an equivalent level of pretraining corpus. Our code is availble at https://github.com/ran1812/UTGDiff.</description>

      <title>UniGenX: a unified generative foundation model that couples sequence, structure and function to accelerate scientific design across proteins, molecules and materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06687v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Function in natural systems arises from one-dimensional sequences forming three-dimensional structures with specific properties. However, current generative models suffer from critical limitations: training objectives seldom target function directly, discrete sequences and continuous coordinates are optimized in isolation, and conformational ensembles are under-modeled. We present UniGenX, a unified generative foundation model that addresses these gaps by co-generating sequences and coordinates under direct functional and property objectives across proteins, molecules, and materials. UniGenX represents heterogeneous inputs as a mixed stream of symbolic and numeric tokens, where a decoder-only autoregressive transformer provides global context and a conditional diffusion head generates numeric fields steered by task-specific tokens. Besides the new high SOTAs on structure prediction tasks, the model demonstrates state-of-the-art or competitive performance for the function-aware generation across domains: in materials, it achieves "conflicted" multi-property conditional generation, yielding 436 crystal candidates meeting triple constraints, including 11 with novel compositions; in chemistry, it sets new benchmarks on five property targets and conformer ensemble generation on GEOM; and in biology, it improves success in modeling protein induced fit (RMSD &lt; 2 {\AA}) by over 23-fold and enhances EC-conditioned enzyme design. Ablation studies and cross-domain transfer substantiate the benefits of joint discrete-continuous training, establishing UniGenX as a significant advance from prediction to controllable, function-aware generation.</description>

Abstract: Efficient chemical kinetic model inference and application in combustion are challenging due to large ODE systems and widely separated time scales. Machine learning techniques have been proposed to streamline these models, though strong nonlinearity and numerical stiffness combined with noisy data sources make their application challenging. Here, we introduce ChemKANs, a novel neural network framework with applications both in model inference and simulation acceleration for combustion chemistry. ChemKAN's novel structure augments the generic Kolmogorov Arnold Network Ordinary Differential Equations (KAN-ODEs) with knowledge of the information flow through the relevant kinetic and thermodynamic laws. This chemistry-specific structure combined with the expressivity and rapid neural scaling of the underlying KAN-ODE algorithm instills in ChemKANs a strong inductive bias, streamlined training, and higher accuracy predictions compared to standard benchmarks, while facilitating parameter sparsity through shared information across all inputs and outputs. In a model inference investigation, we benchmark the robustness of ChemKANs to sparse data containing up to 15% added noise, and superfluously large network parameterizations. We find that ChemKANs exhibit no overfitting or model degradation in any of these training cases, demonstrating significant resilience to common deep learning failure modes. Next, we find that a remarkably parameter-lean ChemKAN (344 parameters) can accurately represent hydrogen combustion chemistry, providing a 2x acceleration over the detailed chemistry in a solver that is generalizable to larger-scale turbulent flow simulations. These demonstrations indicate the potential for ChemKANs as robust, expressive, and efficient tools for model inference and simulation acceleration for combustion physics and chemical kinetics.</description>
