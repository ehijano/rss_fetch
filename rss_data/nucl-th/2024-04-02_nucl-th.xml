      <title>Transport Coefficients of relativistic matter: A detailed formalism with a gross knowledge of their magnitude</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present review article has attempted a compact formalism description of transport coefficient calculations for relativistic fluid, which is expected in heavy ion collision experiments. Here, we first address the macroscopic description of relativistic fluid dynamics and then its microscopic description based on the kinetic theory framework. We also address different relaxation time approximation-based models in Boltzmann transport equations, which make a sandwich between Macro and Micro frameworks of relativistic fluid dynamics and finally provide different microscopic expressions of transport coefficients like the fluid's shear viscosity and bulk viscosity. In the numeric part of this review article, we put stress on the two gross components of transport coefficient expressions: relaxation time and thermodynamic phase-space part. Then, we try to tune the relaxation time component to cover earlier theoretical estimations and experimental data-driven estimations for RHIC and LHC matter. By this way of numerical understanding, we provide the final comments on the values of transport coefficients and relaxation time in the context of the (nearly) perfect fluid nature of the RHIC or LHC matter.</description>

      <title>Accurate and precise quantum computation of valence two-neutron systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developing methods to solve nuclear many-body problems with quantum computers is an imperative pursuit within the nuclear physics community. Here, we introduce a quantum algorithm to accurately and precisely compute the ground state of valence two-neutron systems leveraging presently available Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum devices. Our focus lies on the nuclei having a doubly-magic core plus two valence neutrons in the $ p $, $ sd $, and $ pf $ shells, i.e. ${}^6$He, ${}^{18}$O, and ${}^{42}$Ca, respectively. Our ansatz, quantum circuit, is constructed in the pair-wise form, taking into account the symmetries of the system in an explicit manner, and enables us to reduce the number of qubits and the number of CNOT gates required. The results on a real quantum hardware by IBM Quantum Platform show that the proposed method gives very accurate results of the ground-state energies, which are typically within $ 0.1 \, \% $ error in the energy for ${}^6$He and ${}^{18}$O and at most $ 1 \, \% $ error for ${}^{42}$Ca. Furthermore, our experiments using real quantum devices also show the pivotal role of the circuit layout design, attuned to the connectivity of the qubits, in mitigating errors.</description>

      <title>Uncovering the Mechanism of Chiral Three-Nucleon Force in Driving Spin-Orbit Splitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The three-nucleon force (3NF) is crucial in shaping the shell structure of atomic nuclei, particularly impacting the enhancement of spin-orbit (SO) splitting, especially in nuclei with significant deviations from stability. Despite its importance, the specific mechanisms driving this enhancement remain unclear. In this study, we introduce a decomposition scheme based on the rank of irreducible tensors forming the 3NF, derived from chiral effective field theory at next-to-next-to-leading order, to elucidate their influence on SO splitting. Within the shell-model framework, our analysis reveals that the rank-1 component of the 3NF is the primary factor enlarging the energy gap between the $0p_{3/2}$ and $0p_{1/2}$ single-particle levels in $p$-shell nuclei, while the rank-2 component makes a subdominant contribution. We also remark on the antisymmetry of the rank-1 3NF, as a means to clarify the disentanglement of quantum spin states. This study lays the groundwork for further exploration into this field toward a microscopic understanding of the 3NF impact on the nuclear shell structure.</description>

      <title>Exploring Spin Polarization of Heavy Quarks in Magnetic Fields and Hot Medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relativistic heavy-ion collisions give rise to the formation of both deconfined QCD matter and a strong magnetic field. The spin of heavy quarks is influenced by interactions with the external magnetic field as well as by random scatterings with thermal light partons. The presence of QCD matter comprising charged quarks can extend the lifetime and strength of the magnetic field, thereby enhancing the degree of heavy quark polarization. However, the random scatterings with QCD matter tend to diminish heavy quark polarization. In this study, we utilize the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation to investigate both these contributions. Taking into account the realistic evolutions of medium temperatures and the in-medium magnetic fields at the Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider (RHIC) and the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), we observe that heavy quark polarization is limited by the short lifetime of the magnetic field and the high temperatures of the medium. Furthermore, we explore the mass dependence of quark polarization, revealing that the polarization degree of strange quarks is much larger than that of charm quarks.</description>

      <title>Electrical conductivity of hot relativistic plasma in a strong magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We employ first-principles quantum field theoretical methods to investigate the longitudinal and transverse electrical conductivities of a strongly magnetized hot QED plasma at the leading order in coupling. The analysis utilized the fermion damping rate in the Landau-level representation obtained recently. In the relativistic regime, both conductivities exhibit a scaling behavior given by $\sigma_{\parallel,\perp} = T \tilde{\sigma}_{\parallel,\perp}$, where $\tilde{\sigma}_{\parallel,\perp}$ are functions of the dimensionless ratio $|eB|/T^2$ (here $T$ denotes the temperature and $B$ the magnetic field). As $|eB|/T^2$ increases, both conductivities initially decrease, reach minima, and then exhibit growths when the lowest Landau level dominates. However, the mechanisms for the transverse and longitudinal conductivities differ significantly, leading to a strong suppression of the former in comparison to the latter. Additionally, we extend our analysis to a magnetized quark-gluon plasma, although the approximation's validity breaks down in QCD at strong coupling.</description>

      <title>Investigation of reaction and $\alpha$ production cross sections with $^9$Be projectile</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In order to investigate the contribution of $\alpha$ production in the reaction cross sections, measurements of elastic scattering and inclusive $\alpha$ particle angular distributions have been carried out with the $^9$Be projectile on $^{89}$Y, $^{124}$Sn, $^{159}$Tb, $^{198}$Pt, and $^{209}$Bi targets over a wide angular range at energies near the Coulomb barrier. The measured elastic scattering angular distributions were fitted with optical model calculations, and reaction cross sections were extracted. The same data were also analysed using both global optical model potentials (Global OMP) and microscopic S$\tilde{a}$o Paulo potentials (SPP), to obtain the reaction cross sections. The data available in the literature for $^9$Be projectile includes the elastic scattering angular distributions, $\alpha$ production cross sections, and complete fusion cross sections on these and other targets at several energies are also utilised for comparative studies. The reaction cross section extracted from the three potentials (Best Fit, Global OMP and SPP) are in reasonable agreement for all the targets except for the energies below the barrier where the results from SPP deviate by 30-50 \%. Inclusive $\alpha$ particle production cross sections were also extracted by integrating the $\alpha$ particle angular distributions. The present data and data available from literature of reaction and $\alpha$-particle production cross sections were utilised to make systematic studies. Systematics of reaction and $\alpha$-particle production cross sections revealed their universal behaviour.</description>

      <title>Finite-temperature expansion of the dense-matter equation of state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we provide a new, well-controlled expansion of the equation of state of dense matter from zero to finite temperatures ($T$), while covering a wide range of charge fractions ($Y_Q$), from pure neutron to isospin symmetric nuclear matter. Our expansion can be used to describe neutron star mergers and core-collapse supernova explosions using as a starting point neutron star observations, while maintaining agreement with laboratory data, in a model independent way. We suggest new thermodynamic quantities of interest that can be calculated from theoretical models or directly inferred by experimental data that can help constrain the finite $T$ equation of state. With our new method, we can quantify the uncertainty in our finite $T$ and $Y_Q$ expansions in a well-controlled manner without making assumptions about the underlying degrees of freedom. We can reproduce results from a microscopic equation of state up to $T=100$ MeV for baryon chemical potential $\mu_B\gtrsim 1100$ MeV ($\sim1-2 \ n_{\rm sat}$) within $5\%$ error, with even better results for larger $\mu_B$ and/or lower $T$. We investigate the sources of numerical and theoretical uncertainty and discuss future directions of study.</description>

      <title>Measurement of the mesonic decay branch of the $\bar{K}\!N\!N$ quasi-bound state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We conducted measurements of $K^- + {^3{\rm He}} \to \pi \!Y \!N + N'$ reactions using $1~{\rm GeV}/c$ $K^-$-beam, aiming to understand the broad decay width of $\bar{K} \!N \!N$ ($\approx$ twice as broad as that of $\Lambda(1405)$ considered to be the $\bar{K} \!N$ quasi-bound state). We successfully reproduced distributions of the $\pi \! Y \! N$ invariant mass and momentum transfer of $\pi \! Y \! N$ by employing model fitting functions for $\bar{K} \! N \! N$ formation and quasi-free $\bar{K}$ absorption (${\rm QF}_{\bar{K}-{\rm abs}}$) processes. The model can describe the experimental data quite well, and four $\bar{K} \! N \! N \to \pi \! Y \! N $ cross-sections were obtained. The result suggests that the mesonic decay is the dominant decay branch of $\bar{K} \! N \! N$. It was also suggested that $\Gamma_{\pi \Lambda N} \sim \Gamma_{\pi \Sigma N}$, which indicates a significant contribution of the $I_{\bar{K} \! N}=1$ absorption channel to the $\bar{K} \! N \! N$ decay as well as the $I_{\bar{K} \! N}=0$ makes the $\bar{K} \! N \! N$ state $\approx$ twice as unstable as $\Lambda$(1405).</description>

      <title>Impact of The Newly Revised Gravitational Redshift of X-ray Burster GS 1826-24 on The Equation of State of Supradense Neutron-Rich Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thanks to the recent advancement in producing rare isotopes and measuring their masses with unprecedented precision, the updated nuclear masses around the waiting-point nucleus $^{64}$Ge in the rapid-proton capture process have led to a significant revision of the surface gravitational redshift of the neutron star (NS) in GS 1826-24 by re-fitting its X-ray burst light curve ({\it X. Zhou et al., Nature Physics {\bf 19}, 1091 (2023)}) using Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA). The resulting NS compactness $\xi$ is between 0.244 and 0.342 at 95\% confidence level and its upper boundary is significantly smaller than the maximum $\xi$ previously known. Incorporating this new data within a comprehensive Bayesian statistical framework, we investigate its impact on the Equation of State (EOS) of supradense neutron-rich matter and the required spin frequency for GW190814's minor $m_2$ with mass $2.59\pm 0.05$M$_{\odot}$ to be a rotationally stable pulsar. We found that the EOS of high-density symmetric nuclear matter (SNM) has to be softened significantly while the symmetry energy at supersaturation densities stiffened compared to our prior knowledge from earlier analyses using data from both astrophysical observations and terrestrial nuclear experiments. In particular, the skewness $J_0$ characterizing the stiffness of high-density SNM decreases significantly, while the slope $L$, curvature $K_{\rm{sym}}$, and skewness $J_{\rm{sym}}$ of nuclear symmetry energy all increase appreciably compared to their fiducial values. We also found that the most probable spin rate for the $m_2$ to be a stable pulsar is very close to its mass-shedding limit once the revised redshift data from GS 1826-24 is considered, making the $m_2$ unlikely the most massive NS observed so far.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic emission of direct photons from Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt {s_{\rm NN}}=200~{\rm GeV}$ with EPOS3 and IP-Glasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.08833</link>
      <description>arXiv:1512.08833v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The observed large elliptic flow ($v_2$) of direct photons in relativistic heavy ion collisions challenges us to explain. In this paper we consider only two sources of direct photons, prompt photons and thermal photons. Prompt photons are calculated with QCD to next leading order, which fits well the spectra at high transverse momentum ($p_{\rm t}$) region. Thermal photons are calculated with AMY rate in a 3+1D viscous hydrodynamical evolution of the collision systems. Two types of initial conditions, EPOS3 and IP-Glasma, are employed. Our results with IP-Glasma initial condition agree with results in published work in most cases, and the difference tells the regions effected by the absence of viscous correction in photon emission rate. Because both models are well constrained with hadron data, the hydrodynamic evolution of collision systems in the two models have many common. However, the transverse velocity of the collective motion are quite different. This makes a big difference in the anisotropic emission of direct photon emission. The observed large elliptic flow of direct photons is reproduced with EPOS3 hydrodynamic evolution.</description>

      <title>$g_{\rm A}$-sensitive $\beta$ spectral shapes in the mass $A=86-99$ region assessed by the nuclear shell model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07111v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent years have witnessed an expanding interest in experimental studies of $\beta$ electrons (electrons emitted in $\beta^-$ decay transitions) and their energy distributions, the so-called $\beta$-electron spectra. These experiments are interested mainly in $\beta$ transitions with electron spectra sensitive to the effective value of the weak axial coupling $g_{\rm A}$. In the present paper we make an extensive search for $g_{\rm A}$ sensitive $\beta$ spectral shapes in the $A=86-99$ region using the nuclear shell model with the well established Hamiltonians $\textit{glekpn}$ and $\textit{jj45pnb}$, designed to render a good description of the spectroscopic properties of nuclei in this mass region. We have found eight $\beta^-$ decay transitions with various degrees of $g_{\rm A}$ sensitivity. Moreover, these transitions are also important in pinning down the value of the so-called small relativistic vector nuclear matrix element, sNME. In addition, some of the corresponding mother nuclei are important contributors to the antineutrino flux from nuclear reactors. All this means that the found $\beta$ transitions are potentially of great interest for future rare-events experiments.</description>

      <title>Evidence for 3XMM J185246.6+003317 as a massive magnetar with a low magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.06648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.06648v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: 3XMM J185246.6+003317 is a transient magnetar located in the vicinity of the supernova remnant Kes\,79. So far, observations have only set upper limits to its surface magnetic field and spindown, and there is no estimate for its mass and radius. Using ray-tracing modelling and Bayesian inference for the analysis of several light curves spanning a period of around three weeks, we have found that it may be one of the most massive neutron stars to date. In addition, our analysis suggests a multipolar magnetic field structure with a subcritical field strength and a carbon atmosphere composition. Due to the time-resolution limitation of the available light curves, we estimate the surface magnetic field and the mass to be $\log_{10} (B/{\rm G}) = 11.89^{+0.19}_{-0.93}$ and $M=2.09^{+0.16}_{-0.09}$~$M_{\odot}$ at $1\sigma$ confidence level, while the radius is estimated to be $R=12.02^{+1.44}_{-1.42}$ km at $2\sigma$ confidence level. They were verified by simulations, i.e., data injections with known model parameters, and their subsequent recovery. The best-fitting model has three small hot spots, two of them in the southern hemisphere. These are, however, just first estimates and conclusions, based on a simple ray-tracing model with anisotropic emission; we also estimate the impact of modelling on the parameter uncertainties and the relevant phenomena on which to focus in more precise analyses. We interpret the above best-fitting results as due to accretion of supernova layers/interstellar medium onto 3XMM J185246.6+003317 leading to burying and a subsequent re-emergence of the magnetic field, and a carbon atmosphere being formed possibly due to hydrogen/helium diffusive nuclear burning. Finally, we briefly discuss some consequences of our findings for superdense matter constraints.</description>

      <title>Doubly heavy tetraquark states in the constituent quark model using diffusion Monte Carlo method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.17068v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use the diffusion Monte Carlo method to calculate the doubly heavy tetraquark $T_{cc}$ system in two kinds of constituent quark models, the pure constituent quark model AL1/AP1 and the chiral constituent quark model. When the discrete configurations are complete and no spatial clustering is preseted, the AL1/AP1 model gives an energy of $T_{cc}$ close to the $DD^*$ threshold, and the chiral constituent quark model yields a deeply bound state. We further calculate all doubly heavy tetraquark systems with $J^P=0^+,1^+,2^+$, and provide the binding energies of systems with bound states. The $I(J^P)=0(0^+)$ $bc\bar{n}\bar{n}$, $0(1^+)$ $bb\bar{n}\bar{n}$, $0(1^+)$ $bc\bar{n}\bar{n}$, $\frac{1}{2}(1^+)$ $bb\bar{s}\bar{n}$ systems have bound states in all three models. Since the DMC method has almost no restriction on the spatial part, the resulting bound states have greater binding energies than those obtained in previous works.</description>

      <title>The Four-Boson First-Excited State Near Two-Body Unitarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17079v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Near two-body unitarity, the three-boson system is characterized by an approximate discrete scale invariance manifest in a geometric tower of bound states (the Efimov effect). In the absence of a strong four-body force, the four-boson system has two states associated with each Efimov state, one very nearly unstable, the other several times deeper. We study correlations between the excited- and ground-state properties, such as binding energies and radii, up to next-to-leading order in an effective field theory for short-range forces. We obtain the parameters in these correlations from similar correlations arising from existing precise calculations based on short-range potentials. We also derive correlations among excited-state properties that emerge from the proximity of the state to the break-up threshold into a boson and a three-boson bound state, using an effective field theory for "halo" states.</description>

      <title>Correlation between the symmetry energy slope and the deconfinement phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.00125v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study how the nuclear symmetry energy slope ($L$) can affect the hadron-quark phase transition and neutron star properties. We show that the main physical quantities as the critical chemical potential and pressure are strongly influenced by the symmetry energy slope. In extreme cases, the total amount of deconfined quarks can reach up to 99$\%$ of the hybrid star mass.</description>

      <title>Nuclear density dependence of polarization transfer in quasi-elastic ${\rm A}(\vec{e},e' \vec{p})$ reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01935v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ratio of the transverse and longitudinal component of polarization transfer to protons in quasi-elastic $(\vec{e}, e^{\prime} \vec{p}\,)$ reaction, $P^{\prime}_x/P^{\prime}_z$, is sensitive to the proton's electromagnetic form factor ratio, $G_E/G_M$. To explore density-dependent in-medium modifications, a comparison of polarization transfer ratios involving protons from distinct nuclear shells, each with different local nuclear densities, has been proposed. In this study, we present such comparisons between four shells, $1s_{1/2}$, $1p_{3/2}$ in $^{12}\mathrm{C}$ and $1d_{3/2}$, $2s_{1/2}$ in $^{40}\mathrm{Ca}$. In an effort to account for other many-body effects that may differ between shells, we use state-of-the-art relativistic distorted-wave impulse-approximation (RDWIA) calculation and present the double ratios, $(P^{\prime}_x/P^{\prime}_z)_{\rm Data}/(P^{\prime}_x/P^{\prime}_z)_{\rm RDWIA}$ as well as the super ratios, $\left[(P^{\prime}_x/P^{\prime}_z)_{\rm A}/(P^{\prime}_x/P^{\prime}_z)_{\rm B}\right]_{\rm Data}/\left[(P^{\prime}_x/P^{\prime}_z)_{\rm A}/(P^{\prime}_x/P^{\prime}_z)_{\rm B}\right]_{\rm RDWIA}$, for chosen shells A and B, as a function of effective local nuclear densities. We find that double ratios for individual shells show a dependence on the probed effective nuclear densities. Studying the ratios, we observed a systematic variation between pairs of higher- and lower-density shells.</description>

      <title>Accelerated quantum circuit Monte-Carlo simulation for heavy quark thermalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16294v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Thermalization of heavy quarks in the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) is one of the most promising phenomena for understanding the strong interaction. The energy loss and momentum broadening at low momentum can be well described by a stochastic process with drag and diffusion terms. Recent advances in quantum computing, in particular quantum amplitude estimation (QAE), promise to provide a quadratic speed-up in simulating stochastic processes. We introduce and formalize an accelerated quantum circuit Monte-Carlo (aQCMC) framework to simulate heavy quark thermalization. With simplified drag and diffusion coefficients connected by Einstein's relation, we simulate the thermalization of a heavy quark in isotropic and anisotropic mediums using an ideal quantum simulator and compare that to thermal expectations. With Grover-like QAE, we calculate physical observables with quadratically fewer resources, which is a boost over the classical MC simulation that usually requires a large sampling number at the same estimation accuracy.</description>

      <title>SIDIS at small $x$ at next-to-leading order: gluon contribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06259v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We calculate the contribution of gluons to single inclusive hadron production at next-to-leading order (NLO) accuracy in Deep Inelastic Scattering (DIS) at small $x$ using the Color Glass Condensate formalism. It is shown that the only divergence present is the standard collinear divergence which is absorbed into evolution of gluon-hadron fragmentation function. Our calculations are performed at finite $N_c$ and we provide general finite $N_c$ expressions for the structure of Wilson lines appearing in inclusive dihadron and single hadron production cross sections. We also comment on how one can obtain rapidity distribution of hadron multiplicities from our results.</description>

      <title>Global Fit of Electron and Neutrino Elastic Scattering Data to Determine the Strange Quark Contribution to the Vector and Axial Form Factors of the Nucleon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10854v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a global fit of neutral-current elastic (NCE) neutrino-scattering data and parity-violating electron-scattering (PVES) data with the goal of determining the strange quark contribution to the vector and axial form factors of the proton. Previous fits of this form included data from a variety of PVES experiments (PVA4, HAPPEx, G0, SAMPLE) and the NCE neutrino and anti-neutrino data from BNL E734. These fits did not constrain the strangeness contribution to the axial form factor $G_A^s(Q^2)$ at low $Q^2$ very well because there was no NCE data for $Q^2&lt;0.45$ GeV$^2$. Our new fit includes for the first time MiniBooNE NCE data from both neutrino and anti-neutrino scattering; this experiment used a hydrocarbon target and so a model of the neutrino interaction with the carbon nucleus was required. Three different nuclear models have been employed: a relativistic Fermi gas model, the SuperScaling Approximation model, and a spectral function model. We find a tremendous improvement in the constraint of $G_A^s(Q^2)$ at low $Q^2$ compared to previous work, although more data is needed from NCE measurements that focus on exclusive single-proton final states, for example from MicroBooNE.</description>

      <title>A Deep Learning Framework for Disentangling Triangle Singularity and Pole-Based Enhancements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18265v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Enhancements in the invariant mass distribution or scattering cross-section are usually associated with resonances. However, the nature of exotic signals found near hadron-hadron thresholds remain a puzzle today. In fact, a purely kinematic triangle mechanism is also capable of producing similar structures, but do not correspond to any unstable quantum state. In this paper, we report for the first time, that a deep neural network can be trained to distinguish triangle singularity from pole-based enhancements. We also identify the type of dynamic pole structure that can be misidentified as triangle enhancement. We apply our method to confirm that the $P_\psi^N(4312)^+$ state is not due to a single triangle singularity, and is more favored towards a pole-based interpretation based solely on pure line-shape analysis. Lastly, we argue how our method can be used as a model-selection framework to help in classifying other exotic hadron candidates.</description>
