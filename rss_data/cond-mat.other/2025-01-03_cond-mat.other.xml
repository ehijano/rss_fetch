      <title>Spin waves in magnetic nanodisks, nanorings, and 3D nanovolcanoes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Patterned magnetic nanostructures are advanced materials characterized by their unique magnetic properties at the nanoscale, which are the result of tailored geometric configurations and compositional engineering. As interest in nanotechnology continues to grow exponentially, the exploration of patterned magnetic nanostructures turns into a vibrant and critical area of study for both industry professionals and academic researchers. Here, we review investigations of standing spin waves (collective spin precessions) in magnetic elements by the technique of ferromagnetic resonance (FMR). The presentation encompasses earlier studies of arrays of magnetic nanodisks and nanoringes by cavity-based FMR as well as more recent studies of individual nanodisks and 3D nanovolcanoes by a broadband FMR method which implies the use of a coplanar waveguide. Overall, the manuscript outlines the development of FMR studies along the two major lines: (i) downscaling from multiple to individual magnetic nanoelements and (ii) extending planar nanomagnets into the third dimension.</description>

      <title>Analysis of memory effects in the dynamic evolution of the spin-boson model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum information processing relies on how dynamics unfold in open quantum systems. In this work, we study the non-Markovian dynamics in the single mode spin-boson model at strong couplings. In order to apply perturbation theory, we transform our Hamiltonian to polaron frame, so that the effective system-bath coupling gets reduced. We employ coherence defined by l1-norm to analyze the non-Markovian effects in the spin-boson model. In the transformed frame of reference, the correlation timescales for the bath are significantly shorter than the system's relaxation timescale-a key assumption for Markovian dynamics. However, intriguingly, we demonstrate that under the large polaron theory, the reduced dynamics exhibit effective non-Markovian behaviour within a specific range of couplings, while remaining Markovian beyond this range.</description>

      <title>Decoherence dynamics in a polaron system with collective dephasing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Within quantum information frameworks, managing decoherence stands as a pivotal task. The present work delves into decoherence dynamics of a dressed qubit, represented by a spinless fermion hopping between two lattice sites that are strongly coupled to a collective bosonic bath. To simplify calculations under strong coupling, we adopt the Lang-Firsov transformation, effectively minimizing system-bath interactions. Within the polaron perspective using Ohmic bath spectral density with a Gaussian cutoff, we identify a fundamental timescale $s$ (equivalently a length scale $l$), dictating coherence decay. Utilizing a quantum master equation in the energy eigen basis while maintaining fixed particle number, we demonstrate that coherence persists for small $s$ values but diminishes for larger ones. Additionally, we explore the utilization of $\pi$-pulses to manipulate decoherence within the system.</description>

      <title>Macroscopic stress, couple stress and flux tensors derived through energetic equivalence from microscopic continuous and discrete heterogeneous finite representative volumes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12616v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a rigorous derivation of equations to evaluate the macroscopic stress tensor, the couple stress tensor, and the flux vector equivalent to underlying microscopic fields in continuous and discrete heterogeneous systems with independent displacements and rotations. Contrary to the classical asymptotic expansion homogenization, finite size representative volume is considered. First, the macroscopic quantities are derived for a heterogeneous Cosserat continuum. The resulting continuum equations are discretized to provide macroscopic quantities in discrete heterogeneous systems. Finally, the expressions for discrete system are derived once again, this time considering the discrete nature directly.
  The formulations are presented in two variants, considering either internal or external forces, couples, and fluxes. The derivation is based on the virtual work equivalence and elucidates the fundamental significance of the couple stress tensor in the context of balance equations and admissible virtual deformation modes. Notably, an additional term in the couple stress tensor formula emerges, explaining its dependence on the reference system and position of the macroscopic point. The resulting equations are verified by comparing their predictions with known analytical solutions and results of other numerical models under both steady state and transient conditions.</description>

      <title>On the construction of explicit analytical driving forces for crack nucleation in the phase field approach to brittle fracture with application to Mohr-Coulomb and Drucker-Prager strength surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13700v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A series of recent papers have modified the classical variational phase-field fracture models to successfully predict both the nucleation and propagation of cracks in brittle fracture under general loading conditions. This is done through the introduction of a consistent crack nucleation driving force in the phase field governing equations, which results in the model being able to capture both the strength surface and fracture toughness of the material. This driving force has been presented in the literature for the case of Drucker-Prager strength surface and specific choice of stress states on the strength surface that are captured exactly for finite values of the phase field regularization length parameter $\varepsilon$. Here we present an explicit analytical expression for this driving force given a general material strength surface when the functional form of the strength locus is linear in the material parameter coefficients. In the limit $\varepsilon \to 0$, the formulation reproduces the exact material strength surface and for finite $\varepsilon$ the strength surface is captured at any n 'distinct' points on the strength surface where n is the minimum number of material coefficients required to describe it. The presentation of the driving force in the current work facilitates the easy demonstration of its consistent nature. Further, in the equation governing crack nucleation, the toughness in the classical models is shown to be replaced by an effective toughness in the modified theory, that is dependent on the stress. The derived analytical expressions are verified via application to the widely employed Mohr-Coulomb and Drucker-Prager strength surfaces.</description>

      <title>Robust phase correction techniques for terahertz time-domain reflection spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18662v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a systematic approach that enables two robust methods for performing terahertz time-domain spectroscopy in reflection geometry. Using the Kramers-Kronig relations in connection to accurate experimental measurements of the amplitude of the terahertz electric field, we show how the correct phase of the same field can be retrieved, even in the case of partly misaligned measurements. Our technique allows to accurately estimate the optical properties of in principle any material that reflects terahertz radiation. We demonstrate the accuracy of our approach by extracting the complex refractive index of InSb, a material with a strong plasma resonance in the low-terahertz range. Our technique applies to arbitrary incidence angles and polarization states.</description>
