      <title>Privacy-Aware Sharing of Raw Spatial Sensor Data for Cooperative Perception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cooperative perception between vehicles is poised to offer robust and reliable scene understanding. Recently, we are witnessing experimental systems research building testbeds that share raw spatial sensor data for cooperative perception. While there has been a marked improvement in accuracies and is the natural way forward, we take a moment to consider the problems with such an approach for eventual adoption by automakers. In this paper, we first argue that new forms of privacy concerns arise and discourage stakeholders to share raw sensor data. Next, we present SHARP, a research framework to minimize privacy leakage and drive stakeholders towards the ambitious goal of raw data based cooperative perception. Finally, we discuss open questions for networked systems, mobile computing, perception researchers, industry and government in realizing our proposed framework.</description>

      <title>A Network Arena for Benchmarking AI Agents on Network Troubleshooting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Agentic systems, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), assist network engineers with network configuration synthesis and network troubleshooting tasks. For network troubleshooting, progress is hindered by the absence of standardized and accessible benchmarks for evaluating LLM agents in dynamic network settings at low operational effort. We present NIKA, the largest public benchmark to date for LLM-driven network incident diagnosis and troubleshooting. NIKA targets both domain experts and especially AI researchers alike, providing zero-effort replay of real-world network scenarios, and establishing well-defined agent-network interfaces for quick agent prototyping. NIKA comprises hundreds of curated network incidents, spanning five network scenarios, from data centers to ISP networks, and covers 54 representative network issues. Lastly, NIKA is modular and extensible by design, offering APIs to facilitate the integration of new network scenarios and failure cases. We evaluate state-of-the-art LLM agents on NIKA and find that while larger models succeed more often in detecting network issues, they still struggle to localize faults and identify root causes. NIKA is open-source and available to the community: https://github.com/sands-lab/nika.</description>

      <title>Acoustic RIS for Massive Spatial Multiplexing: Unleashing Degrees of Freedom and Capacity in Underwater Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Underwater acoustic (UWA) communications are essential for high-speed marine data transmission but remain severely constrained by limited bandwidth, significant propagation loss, and sparse multipath structures. Conventional underwater acoustic multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems primarily utilize spatial diversity but suffer from limited array resolution, causing angular ambiguity and insufficient spatial degrees of freedom (DoFs). This paper addresses these limitations through acoustic Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (aRIS) to actively generate orthogonally distinguishable virtual paths, significantly enhancing spatial DoFs and channel capacity. An ocean-specific DoF-channel coupling model is established, explicitly deriving conditions for spatial rank enhancement. Subsequently, the optimal geometric locus, termed the Light-Point, is analytically identified, where deploying a single aRIS maximizes DoFs by introducing two and three additional resolvable paths in deep-sea and shallow-sea environments, respectively. Furthermore, an active simultaneous transmitting and reflecting (ASTAR) aRIS architecture with independent beam control and adaptive beam-tracking mechanism integrating unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs) and acoustic intensity gradient sensing is proposed. Extensive simulations validate the proposed joint aRIS deployment and beamforming framework, demonstrating substantial UWA channel capacity improvements-up to 265% and 170% in shallow-sea and deep-sea scenarios, respectively.</description>

      <title>Coordinated Anti-Jamming Resilience in Swarm Networks via Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reactive jammers pose a severe security threat to robotic-swarm networks by selectively disrupting inter-agent communications and undermining formation integrity and mission success. Conventional countermeasures such as fixed power control or static channel hopping are largely ineffective against such adaptive adversaries. This paper presents a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework based on the QMIX algorithm to improve the resilience of swarm communications under reactive jamming. We consider a network of multiple transmitter-receiver pairs sharing channels while a reactive jammer with Markovian threshold dynamics senses aggregate power and reacts accordingly. Each agent jointly selects transmit frequency (channel) and power, and QMIX learns a centralized but factorizable action-value function that enables coordinated yet decentralized execution. We benchmark QMIX against a genie-aided optimal policy in a no-channel-reuse setting, and against local Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) and a stateless reactive policy in a more general fading regime with channel reuse enabled. Simulation results show that QMIX rapidly converges to cooperative policies that nearly match the genie-aided bound, while achieving higher throughput and lower jamming incidence than the baselines, thereby demonstrating MARL's effectiveness for securing autonomous swarms in contested environments.</description>

      <title>Reexamining Paradigms of End-to-End Data Movement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The pursuit of high-performance data transfer often focuses on raw network bandwidth, and international links of 100 Gbps or higher are frequently considered the primary enabler. While necessary, this network-centric view is incomplete, equating provisioned link speeds with practical, sustainable data movement capabilities across the entire edge-to-core spectrum. This paper investigates six common paradigms, from the often-cited constraints of network latency and TCP congestion control algorithms to host-side factors such as CPU performance and virtualization that critically impact data movement workflows. We validated our findings using a latency-emulation-capable testbed for high-speed WAN performance prediction and through extensive production measurements from resource-constrained edge environments to a 100 Gbps operational link connecting Switzerland and California, U.S. These results show that the principal bottlenecks often reside outside the network core, and that a holistic hardware-software co-design ensures consistent performance, whether moving data at 1 Gbps or 100 Gbps and faster. This approach effectively closes the fidelity gap between benchmark results and diverse and complex production environments.</description>

      <title>A Survey on Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces in Practical Systems: Security and Privacy Perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) have emerged as a transformative technology capable of reshaping wireless environments through dynamic manipulation of electromagnetic waves. While extensive research has explored their theoretical benefits for communication and sensing, practical deployments in smart environments such as homes, vehicles, and industrial settings remain limited and under-examined, particularly from security and privacy perspectives. This survey provides a comprehensive examination of RIS applications in real-world systems, with a focus on the security and privacy threats, vulnerabilities, and defensive strategies relevant to practical use. We analyze scenarios with two types of systems (with and without legitimate RIS) and two types of attackers (with and without malicious RIS), and demonstrate how RIS may introduce new attacks to practical systems, including eavesdropping, jamming, and spoofing attacks. In response, we review defenses against RIS-related attacks in these systems, such as applying additional security algorithms, disrupting attackers, and early detection of unauthorized RIS. We also discuss scenarios in which the legitimate user applies an additional RIS to defend against attacks. To support future research, we also provide a collection of open-source tools, datasets, demos, and papers at: https://awesome-ris-security.github.io/. By highlighting RIS's functionality and its security/privacy challenges and opportunities, this survey aims to guide researchers and engineers toward the development of secure, resilient, and privacy-preserving RIS-enabled practical wireless systems and environments.</description>

      <title>Hyperparameter Tuning-Based Optimized Performance Analysis of Machine Learning Algorithms for Network Intrusion Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) are essential for securing networks by identifying and mitigating unauthorized activities indicative of cyberattacks. As cyber threats grow increasingly sophisticated, NIDS must evolve to detect both emerging threats and deviations from normal behavior. This study explores the application of machine learning (ML) methods to improve the NIDS accuracy through analyzing intricate structures in deep-featured network traffic records. Leveraging the 1999 KDD CUP intrusion dataset as a benchmark, this research evaluates and optimizes several ML algorithms, including Support Vector Machines (SVM), Na\"ive Bayes variants (MNB, BNB), Random Forest (RF), k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), Decision Trees (DT), AdaBoost, XGBoost, Logistic Regression (LR), Ridge Classifier, Passive-Aggressive (PA) Classifier, Rocchio Classifier, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), and Perceptron (PPN). Initial evaluations without hyper-parameter optimization demonstrated suboptimal performance, highlighting the importance of tuning to enhance classification accuracy. After hyper-parameter optimization using grid and random search techniques, the SVM classifier achieved 99.12% accuracy with a 0.0091 False Alarm Rate (FAR), outperforming its default configuration (98.08% accuracy, 0.0123 FAR) and all other classifiers. This result confirms that SVM accomplishes the highest accuracy among the evaluated classifiers. We validated the effectiveness of all classifiers using a tenfold cross-validation approach, incorporating Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) for feature selection to enhance the classifiers accuracy and efficiency. Our outcomes indicate that ML classifiers are both adaptable and reliable, contributing to enhanced accuracy in systems for detecting network intrusions.</description>

      <title>MultiPath Transfer Engine: Breaking GPU and Host-Memory Bandwidth Bottlenecks in LLM Services</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The limited bandwidth of PCIe has emerged as the critical bottleneck for large language model (LLM) performance, such as prefix cache fetching and model switching. Although intra-server multipath data transfer between GPU and host memory is theoretically possible, heterogeneous protocols such as PCIe and NVLink currently limit the bandwidth between host memory and GPUs to that of a single PICe link. This limitation resuals in underutilized intra-server bandwidth. To address this issue, we propose Multipath Memory Access (MMA), a scheme that, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to enalbe efficient multipath data transfer between GPU and host memory. MMA supports seamless deployment via dynamic library injection, enabling LLM applications to benefit from MMA without requiring any code modification. In our testbed, MMA significantly improves the data transfer bandwidth between the GPU and memory, achieving a peak bandwidth of 245 GB/s-representing a 4.62x speedup compared to the natice single-path bandwidth. End-to-end evaluations demonstrate that MMA reduces the time-to-first-token (TTFT) for LLM serving by 1.14x to 2.38x and decreases model-switching latency in vLLM's sleep mode by 1.12x to 2.48x.</description>

      <title>AutoRAN: Automated and Zero-Touch Open RAN Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11233v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: [...] This paper presents AutoRAN, an automated, intent-driven framework for zero-touch provisioning of open, programmable cellular networks. Leveraging cloud-native principles, AutoRAN employs virtualization, declarative infrastructure-as-code templates, and disaggregated micro-services to abstract physical resources and protocol stacks. Its orchestration engine integrates Language Models (LLMs) to translate high-level intents into machine-readable configurations, enabling closed-loop control via telemetry-driven observability. Implemented on a multi-architecture OpenShift cluster with heterogeneous compute (x86/ARM CPUs, NVIDIA GPUs) and multi-vendor Radio Access Network (RAN) hardware (Foxconn, NI), AutoRAN automates deployment of O-RAN-compliant stacks-including OpenAirInterface, NVIDIA ARC RAN, Open5GS core, and O-RAN Software Community (OSC) RIC components-using CI/CD pipelines. Experimental results demonstrate that AutoRAN is capable of deploying an end-to-end Private 5G network in less than 60 seconds with 1.6 Gbps throughput, validating its ability to streamline configuration, accelerate testing, and reduce manual intervention with similar performance than non cloud-based implementations. With its novel LLM-assisted intent translation mechanism, and performance-optimized automation workflow for multi-vendor environments, AutoRAN has the potential of advancing the robustness of next-generation cellular supply chains through reproducible, intent-based provisioning across public and private deployments.</description>

      <title>Quantum Data Centers: Why Entanglement Changes Everything</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02920v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Quantum Internet is key for distributed quantum computing, by interconnecting multiple quantum processors into a virtual quantum computation system. This allows to scale the number of qubits, by overcoming the inherent limitations of noisy-intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. Thus, the Quantum Internet is the foundation for large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computation. Among the distributed architectures, Quantum Data Centers emerge as the most viable in the medium-term, since they integrate multiple quantum processors within a localized network infrastructure, by allowing modular design of quantum networking. We analyze the physical and topological constraints of Quantum Data Centers, by emphasizing the role of entanglement orchestrators in dynamically reconfiguring network topologies through local operations. We examine the major hardware challenge of quantum transduction, essential for interfacing heterogeneous quantum systems. Furthermore, we explore how interconnecting multiple Quantum Data Centers could enable large-scale quantum networks. We discuss the topological constraints of such a scaling and identify open challenges, including entanglement routing and synchronization. The carried analysis positions Quantum Data Centers as both a practical implementation platform and strategic framework for the future Quantum Internet.</description>

      <title>Network-Optimised Spiking Neural Network for Event-Driven Networking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23516v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time-critical networking requires low-latency decisions from sparse and bursty telemetry, where fixed-step neural inference waste computation. We introduce Network-Optimised Spiking (NOS), a two-state neuron whose variables correspond to normalised queue occupancy and a recovery resource. NOS combines a saturating excitability nonlinearity for finite buffers, service and damping leaks, graph-local inputs with per-link gates and delays, and differentiable resets compatible with surrogate gradients and neuromorphic deployment. We establish existence and uniqueness of subthreshold equilibria, derive Jacobian-based local stability tests, and obtain a scalar network stability threshold that separates topology from node physics through a Perron-mode spectral condition. A stochastic arrival model aligned with telemetry smoothing links NOS responses to classical queueing behaviour while explaining increased variability near stability margins. Across chain, star, and scale-free graphs, NOS improves early-warning F1 and detection latency over MLP, RNN, GRU, and temporal-GNN baselines under a common residual-based protocol, while providing practical calibration and stability rules suited to resource-constrained networking deployments.
