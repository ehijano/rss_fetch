      <title>Towards an Improved Taxonomy of Attacks related to Digital Identities and Identity Management Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digital transformation with the adoption of cloud technologies, outsourcing, and working-from-home possibilities permits flexibility for organizations and persons. At the same time, it makes it more difficult to secure the IT infrastructure as the IT team needs to keep track of who is accessing what data from where and when on which device. With these changes, identity management as a key element of security becomes more important. Identity management relates to the technologies and policies for the identification, authentication, and authorization of users (humans, devices) in computer networks. Due to the diversity of identity management (i.e., models, protocols, and implementations), different requirements, problems, and attack vectors need to be taken into account. In order to secure identity management systems with their identities, a systematic approach is required. In this article, we propose the improved framework Taxonomy for Identity Management related to Attacks (TaxIdMA). The purpose of TaxIdMA is to classify existing attacks, attack vectors, and vulnerabilities associated with system identities, identity management systems, and end-user identities. In addition, the background of these attacks can be described in a structured and systematic way. The taxonomy is applied to the Internet of Things and self-sovereign identities. It is enhanced by a description language for threat intelligence sharing. Last but not least, TaxIdMA is evaluated and improved based on expert interviews, statistics, and discussions. This step enables broader applicability and level of detail at the same time. The combination of TaxIdMA, which allows a structured way to outline attacks and is applicable to different scenarios, and a description language for threat intelligence help to improve the security identity management systems and processes.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Analysis of Privacy Leakage in Trustworthy Federated Learning: A Perspective from Linear Algebra and Optimization Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated learning has emerged as a promising paradigm for collaborative model training while preserving data privacy. However, recent studies have shown that it is vulnerable to various privacy attacks, such as data reconstruction attacks. In this paper, we provide a theoretical analysis of privacy leakage in federated learning from two perspectives: linear algebra and optimization theory. From the linear algebra perspective, we prove that when the Jacobian matrix of the batch data is not full rank, there exist different batches of data that produce the same model update, thereby ensuring a level of privacy. We derive a sufficient condition on the batch size to prevent data reconstruction attacks. From the optimization theory perspective, we establish an upper bound on the privacy leakage in terms of the batch size, the distortion extent, and several other factors. Our analysis provides insights into the relationship between privacy leakage and various aspects of federated learning, offering a theoretical foundation for designing privacy-preserving federated learning algorithms.</description>

      <title>Blockchain security for ransomware detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Blockchain networks are critical for safeguarding digital transactions and assets, but they are increasingly targeted by ransomware attacks exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities. Traditional detection techniques struggle due to the complexity of these exploits and the lack of comprehensive datasets. The UGRansome dataset addresses this gap by offering detailed features for analysing ransomware and zero-day attacks, including timestamps, attack types, protocols, network flows, and financial impacts in bitcoins (BTC). This study uses the Lazy Predict library to automate machine learning (ML) on the UGRansome dataset. The study aims to enhance blockchain security through ransomware detection based on zero-day exploit recognition using the UGRansome dataset. Lazy Predict streamlines different ML model comparisons and identifies effective algorithms for threat detection. Key features such as timestamps, protocols, and financial data are used to predict anomalies as zero-day threats and to classify known signatures as ransomware. Results demonstrate that ML can significantly improve cybersecurity in blockchain environments. The DecisionTreeClassifier and ExtraTreeClassifier, with their high performance and low training times, are ideal candidates for deployment in real-time threat detection systems.</description>

      <title>From Sands to Mansions: Enabling Automatic Full-Life-Cycle Cyberattack Construction with LLM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The escalating battles between attackers and defenders in cybersecurity make it imperative to test and evaluate defense capabilities from the attackers' perspective. However, constructing full-life-cycle cyberattacks and performing red team emulations requires significant time and domain knowledge from security experts. Existing cyberattack simulation frameworks face challenges such as limited technical coverage, inability to conduct full-life-cycle attacks, and the need for manual infrastructure building. These limitations hinder the quality and diversity of the constructed attacks. In this paper, we leveraged the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in summarizing knowledge from existing attack intelligence and generating executable machine code based on human knowledge. we proposed AURORA, an automatic end-to-end cyberattack construction and emulation framework. AURORA can autonomously build multi-stage cyberattack plans based on Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) reports, construct the emulation infrastructures, and execute the attack procedures. We also developed an attack procedure knowledge graph to integrate knowledge about attack techniques throughout the full life cycle of advanced cyberattacks from various sources. We constructed and evaluated more than 20 full-life-cycle cyberattacks based on existing CTI reports. Compared to previous attack simulation frameworks, AURORA can construct multi-step attacks and the infrastructures in several minutes without human intervention. Furthermore, AURORA incorporates a wider range (40% more) of attack techniques into the constructed attacks in a more efficient way than the professional red teams. To benefit further research, we open-sourced the dataset containing the execution files and infrastructures of 20 emulated cyberattacks.</description>

      <title>Synthetic Data, Similarity-based Privacy Metrics, and Regulatory (Non-)Compliance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we argue that similarity-based privacy metrics cannot ensure regulatory compliance of synthetic data. Our analysis and counter-examples show that they do not protect against singling out and linkability and, among other fundamental issues, completely ignore the motivated intruder test.</description>

      <title>Synthetic Trajectory Generation Through Convolutional Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Location trajectories provide valuable insights for applications from urban planning to pandemic control. However, mobility data can also reveal sensitive information about individuals, such as political opinions, religious beliefs, or sexual orientations. Existing privacy-preserving approaches for publishing this data face a significant utility-privacy trade-off. Releasing synthetic trajectory data generated through deep learning offers a promising solution. Due to the trajectories' sequential nature, most existing models are based on recurrent neural networks (RNNs). However, research in generative adversarial networks (GANs) largely employs convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image generation. This discrepancy raises the question of whether advances in computer vision can be applied to trajectory generation. In this work, we introduce a Reversible Trajectory-to-CNN Transformation (RTCT) that adapts trajectories into a format suitable for CNN-based models. We integrated this transformation with the well-known DCGAN in a proof-of-concept (PoC) and evaluated its performance against an RNN-based trajectory GAN using four metrics across two datasets. The PoC was superior in capturing spatial distributions compared to the RNN model but had difficulty replicating sequential and temporal properties. Although the PoC's utility is not sufficient for practical applications, the results demonstrate the transformation's potential to facilitate the use of CNNs for trajectory generation, opening up avenues for future research.

      <title>When AI Defeats Password Deception! A Deep Learning Framework to Distinguish Passwords and Honeywords</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: "Honeywords" have emerged as a promising defense mechanism for detecting data breaches and foiling offline dictionary attacks (ODA) by deceiving attackers with false passwords. In this paper, we propose PassFilter, a novel deep learning (DL) based attack framework, fundamental in its ability to identify passwords from a set of sweetwords associated with a user account, effectively challenging a variety of honeywords generation techniques (HGTs). The DL model in PassFilter is trained with a set of previously collected or adversarially generated passwords and honeywords, and carefully orchestrated to predict whether a sweetword is the password or a honeyword. Our model can compromise the security of state-of-the-art, heuristics-based, and representation learning-based HGTs proposed by Dionysiou et al. Specifically, our analysis with nine publicly available password datasets shows that PassFilter significantly outperforms the baseline random guessing success rate of 5%, achieving 6.10% to 52.78% on the 1st guessing attempt, considering 20 sweetwords per account. This success rate rapidly increases with additional login attempts before account lock-outs, often allowed on many real-world online services to maintain reasonable usability. For example, it ranges from 41.78% to 96.80% for five attempts, and from 72.87% to 99.00% for ten attempts, compared to 25% and 50% random guessing, respectively. We also examined PassFilter against general-purpose language models used for honeyword generation, like those proposed by Yu et al. These honeywords also proved vulnerable to our attack, with success rates of 14.19% for 1st guessing attempt, increasing to 30.23%, 41.70%, and 63.10% after 3rd, 5th, and 10th guessing attempts, respectively. Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of DL model deployed in PassFilter in breaching state-of-the-art HGTs and compromising password security based on ODA.</description>

      <title>Critical Infrastructure Security: Penetration Testing and Exploit Development Perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Critical infrastructure refers to essential physical and cyber systems vital to the functioning and stability of societies and economies. These systems include key sectors such as healthcare, energy, and water supply, which are crucial for societal and economic stability and are increasingly becoming prime targets for malicious actors, including state-sponsored hackers, seeking to disrupt national security and economic stability. This paper reviews literature on critical infrastructure security, focusing on penetration testing and exploit development. It explores four main questions: the characteristics of critical infrastructure, the role and challenges of penetration testing, methodologies of exploit development, and the contribution of these practices to security and resilience. The findings of this paper reveal inherent vulnerabilities in critical infrastructure and sophisticated threats posed by cyber adversaries. Penetration testing is highlighted as a vital tool for identifying and addressing security weaknesses, allowing organizations to fortify their defenses. Additionally, understanding exploit development helps anticipate and mitigate potential threats, leading to more robust security measures. The review underscores the necessity of continuous and proactive security assessments, advocating for integrating penetration testing and exploit development into regular security protocols. By doing so, organizations can preemptively identify and mitigate risks, enhancing the overall resilience of critical infrastructure. The paper concludes by emphasizing the need for ongoing research and collaboration between the public and private sectors to develop innovative solutions for the evolving cyber threat landscape. This comprehensive review aims to provide a foundational understanding of critical infrastructure security and guide future research and practices.</description>

      <title>Advanced Penetration Testing for Enhancing 5G Security</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advances in fifth-generation (5G) networks enable unprecedented reliability, speed, and connectivity compared to previous mobile networks. These advancements can revolutionize various sectors by supporting applications requiring real-time data processing. However, the rapid deployment and integration of 5G networks bring security concerns that must be addressed to operate these infrastructures safely. This paper reviews penetration testing approaches for identifying security vulnerabilities in 5G networks. Penetration testing is an ethical hacking technique used to simulate a network's security posture in the event of cyberattacks. This review highlights the capabilities, advantages, and limitations of recent 5G-targeting security tools for penetration testing. It examines ways adversaries exploit vulnerabilities in 5G networks, covering tactics and strategies targeted at 5G features. A key topic explored is the comparison of penetration testing methods for 5G and earlier generations. The article delves into the unique characteristics of 5G, including massive MIMO, edge computing, and network slicing, and how these aspects require new penetration testing methods. Understanding these differences helps develop more effective security solutions tailored to 5G networks. Our research also indicates that 5G penetration testing should use a multithreaded approach for addressing current security challenges. Furthermore, this paper includes case studies illustrating practical challenges and limitations in real-world applications of penetration testing in 5G networks. A comparative analysis of penetration testing tools for 5G networks highlights their effectiveness in mitigating vulnerabilities, emphasizing the need for advanced security measures against evolving cyber threats in 5G deployment.</description>

      <title>SoK: Bridging Trust into the Blockchain. A Systematic Review on On-Chain Identity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17276v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ongoing regulation of blockchain-based services and applications requires the identification of users who are issuing transactions on the blockchain. This systematic review explores the current status, identifies research gaps, and outlines future research directions for establishing trusted and privacy-compliant identities on the blockchain (on-chain identity). A systematic search term was applied across various scientific databases, collecting 2232 potentially relevant research papers. These papers were narrowed down in two methodologically executed steps to 98 and finally to 13 relevant sources. The relevant articles were then systematically analyzed based on a set of screening questions. The results of the selected studies have provided insightful findings on the mechanisms of on-chain identities. On-chain identities are established using zero-knowledge proofs, public key infrastructure/certificates, and web of trust approaches. The technologies and architectures used by the authors are also highlighted. Trust has emerged as a key research gap, manifesting in two ways: firstly, a gap in how to trust the digital identity representation of a physical human; secondly, a gap in how to trust identity providers that issue identity confirmations on-chain. Potential future research avenues are suggested to help fill the current gaps in establishing trust and on-chain identities.</description>

      <title>Insider Threats Mitigation: Role of Penetration Testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional security solutions are insufficient to address the urgent cybersecurity challenge posed by insider attacks. While a great deal of research has been done in this area, our systematic literature analysis attempts to give readers a thorough grasp of penetration testing's role in reducing insider risks. We aim to arrange and integrate the body of knowledge on insider threat prevention by using a grounded theory approach for a thorough literature review. This analysis classifies and evaluates the approaches used in penetration testing today, including how well they uncover and mitigate insider threats and how well they work in tandem with other security procedures. Additionally, we look at how penetration testing is used in different industries, present case studies with real-world implementations, and discuss the obstacles and constraints that businesses must overcome. This study aims to improve the knowledge of penetration testing as a critical part of insider threat defense, helping to create more comprehensive and successful security policies.</description>

      <title>An FPGA-Based Open-Source Hardware-Software Framework for Side-Channel Security Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Attacks based on side-channel analysis (SCA) pose a severe security threat to modern computing platforms, further exacerbated on IoT devices by their pervasiveness and handling of private and critical data. Designing SCA-resistant computing platforms requires a significant additional effort in the early stages of the IoT devices' life cycle, which is severely constrained by strict time-to-market deadlines and tight budgets. This manuscript introduces a hardware-software framework meant for SCA research on FPGA targets. It delivers an IoT-class system-on-chip (SoC) that includes a RISC-V CPU, provides observability and controllability through an ad-hoc debug infrastructure to facilitate SCA attacks and evaluate the platform's security, and streamlines the deployment of SCA countermeasures through dedicated hardware and software features such as a DFS actuator and FreeRTOS support. The open-source release of the framework includes the SoC, the scripts to configure the computing platform, compile a target application, and assess the SCA security, as well as a suite of state-of-the-art SCA attacks and countermeasures. The goal is to foster its adoption and novel developments in the field, empowering designers and researchers to focus on studying SCA countermeasures and attacks while relying on a sound and stable hardware-software platform as the foundation for their research.</description>

      <title>Profitable Manipulations of Cryptographic Self-Selection are Statistically Detectable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cryptographic Self-Selection is a common primitive underlying leader-selection for Proof-of-Stake blockchain protocols. The concept was first popularized in Algorand [CM19], who also observed that the protocol might be manipulable. [FHWY22] provide a concrete manipulation that is strictly profitable for a staker of any size (and also prove upper bounds on the gains from manipulation).
  Separately, [YSZ23, BM24] initiate the study of undetectable profitable manipulations of consensus protocols with a focus on the seminal Selfish Mining strategy [ES14] for Bitcoin's Proof-of-Work longest-chain protocol. They design a Selfish Mining variant that, for sufficiently large miners, is strictly profitable yet also indistinguishable to an onlooker from routine latency (that is, a sufficiently large profit-maximizing miner could use their strategy to strictly profit over being honest in a way that still appears to the rest of the network as though everyone is honest but experiencing mildly higher latency. This avoids any risk of negatively impacting the value of the underlying cryptocurrency due to attack detection).
  We investigate the detectability of profitable manipulations of the canonical cryptographic self-selection leader selection protocol introduced in [CM19] and studied in [FHWY22], and establish that for any player with $\alpha &lt; \frac{3-\sqrt{5}}{2} \approx 0.38$ fraction of the total stake, every strictly profitable manipulation is statistically detectable. Specifically, we consider an onlooker who sees only the random seed of each round (and does not need to see any other broadcasts by any other players). We show that the distribution of the sequence of random seeds when any player is profitably manipulating the protocol is inconsistent with any distribution that could arise by honest stakers being offline or timing out (for a natural stylized model of honest timeouts).</description>

      <title>Preliminary study on artificial intelligence methods for cybersecurity threat detection in computer networks based on raw data packets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most of the intrusion detection methods in computer networks are based on traffic flow characteristics. However, this approach may not fully exploit the potential of deep learning algorithms to directly extract features and patterns from raw packets. Moreover, it impedes real-time monitoring due to the necessity of waiting for the processing pipeline to complete and introduces dependencies on additional software components.
  In this paper, we investigate deep learning methodologies capable of detecting attacks in real-time directly from raw packet data within network traffic. We propose a novel approach where packets are stacked into windows and separately recognised, with a 2D image representation suitable for processing with computer vision models. Our investigation utilizes the CIC IDS-2017 dataset, which includes both benign traffic and prevalent real-world attacks, providing a comprehensive foundation for our research.</description>

Abstract: This study addresses the use of Reed-Solomon error correction codes in QR codes to enhance resilience against failures. To fully grasp this approach, a basic cryptographic context is provided, necessary for understanding Reed-Solomon codes. The study begins by defining a code and explores key outcomes for codes with additional properties, such as linearity. The theoretical framework is further developed with specific definitions and examples of Reed-Solomon codes, presented as a particular variant of BCH codes. Additionally, the structure of QR codes is analyzed, encompassing different versions and how data is represented in the form of black and white pixels within an image. Finally, an inherent vulnerability of Reed-Solomon Codes, and particularly of QR codes, related to selective manipulation of modules is examined. This vulnerability leverages the error correction mechanisms present in Reed-Solomon codes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2202.12319v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tensor networks, widely used for providing efficient representations of low-energy states of local quantum many-body systems, have been recently proposed as machine learning architectures which could present advantages with respect to traditional ones. In this work we show that tensor network architectures have especially prospective properties for privacy-preserving machine learning, which is important in tasks such as the processing of medical records. First, we describe a new privacy vulnerability that is present in feedforward neural networks, illustrating it in synthetic and real-world datasets. Then, we develop well-defined conditions to guarantee robustness to such vulnerability, which involve the characterization of models equivalent under gauge symmetry. We rigorously prove that such conditions are satisfied by tensor-network architectures. In doing so, we define a novel canonical form for matrix product states, which has a high degree of regularity and fixes the residual gauge that is left in the canonical forms based on singular value decompositions. We supplement the analytical findings with practical examples where matrix product states are trained on datasets of medical records, which show large reductions on the probability of an attacker extracting information about the training dataset from the model's parameters. Given the growing expertise in training tensor-network architectures, these results imply that one may not have to be forced to make a choice between accuracy in prediction and ensuring the privacy of the information processed.</description>

Abstract: We study security-latency bounds for Nakamoto consensus, i.e., how secure a block is after it becomes $k$-deep in the chain. We improve the state-of-the-art bounds by analyzing the race between adversarial and honest chains in three different phases. We find the probability distribution of the growth of the adversarial chains under models similar to those in [Guo, Ren; AFT 2022] when a target block becomes $k$-deep in the chain. We analyze certain properties of this race to model each phase with random walks that provide tighter bounds than the existing results. Combining all three phases provides novel upper and lower bounds for blockchains with small $\lambda\Delta$.</description>

      <title>Turning Your Strength into Watermark: Watermarking Large Language Model via Knowledge Injection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09535v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated outstanding performance, making them valuable digital assets with significant commercial potential. Unfortunately, the LLM and its API are susceptible to intellectual property theft. Watermarking is a classic solution for copyright verification. However, most recent emerging LLM watermarking methods focus on identifying AI-generated texts rather than watermarking LLM itself. Only a few attempts are based on weight quantification and backdoor watermarking, which are not robust or covert enough, limiting their applicability in practice.
  To address this issue, we propose a novel watermarking method for LLMs based on knowledge injection and innovatively use knowledge as the watermark carrier. Specifically, in the watermark embedding stage, we first embed the watermarks into the selected knowledge to obtain the watermarked knowledge, subsequently injected into the to-be-protected LLM. In the watermark extraction stage, questions related to the watermarked knowledge are designed, for querying the suspect LLM and extracting the watermarks from its response. The experiments show that the watermark extraction success rate is close to 100% and demonstrate the effectiveness, fidelity, stealthiness, and robustness of our proposed method.</description>

      <title>LLMs Cannot Reliably Identify and Reason About Security Vulnerabilities (Yet?): A Comprehensive Evaluation, Framework, and Benchmarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12575v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been suggested for use in automated vulnerability repair, but benchmarks showing they can consistently identify security-related bugs are lacking. We thus develop SecLLMHolmes, a fully automated evaluation framework that performs the most detailed investigation to date on whether LLMs can reliably identify and reason about security-related bugs. We construct a set of 228 code scenarios and analyze eight of the most capable LLMs across eight different investigative dimensions using our framework. Our evaluation shows LLMs provide non-deterministic responses, incorrect and unfaithful reasoning, and perform poorly in real-world scenarios. Most importantly, our findings reveal significant non-robustness in even the most advanced models like `PaLM2' and `GPT-4': by merely changing function or variable names, or by the addition of library functions in the source code, these models can yield incorrect answers in 26% and 17% of cases, respectively. These findings demonstrate that further LLM advances are needed before LLMs can be used as general purpose security assistants.</description>

      <title>Copyright Protection in Generative AI: A Technical Perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02333v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generative AI has witnessed rapid advancement in recent years, expanding their capabilities to create synthesized content such as text, images, audio, and code. The high fidelity and authenticity of contents generated by these Deep Generative Models (DGMs) have sparked significant copyright concerns. There have been various legal debates on how to effectively safeguard copyrights in DGMs. This work delves into this issue by providing a comprehensive overview of copyright protection from a technical perspective. We examine from two distinct viewpoints: the copyrights pertaining to the source data held by the data owners and those of the generative models maintained by the model builders. For data copyright, we delve into methods data owners can protect their content and DGMs can be utilized without infringing upon these rights. For model copyright, our discussion extends to strategies for preventing model theft and identifying outputs generated by specific models. Finally, we highlight the limitations of existing techniques and identify areas that remain unexplored. Furthermore, we discuss prospective directions for the future of copyright protection, underscoring its importance for the sustainable and ethical development of Generative AI.</description>

      <title>Proof of Diligence: Cryptoeconomic Security for Rollups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07241v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Layer 1 (L1) blockchains such as Ethereum are secured under an "honest supermajority of stake" assumption for a large pool of validators who verify each and every transaction on it. This high security comes at a scalability cost which not only effects the throughput of the blockchain but also results in high gas fees for executing transactions on chain. The most successful solution for this problem is provided by optimistic rollups, Layer 2 (L2) blockchains that execute transactions outside L1 but post the transaction data on L1.
  The security for such L2 chains is argued, informally, under the assumption that a set of nodes will check the transaction data posted on L1 and raise an alarm (a fraud proof) if faulty transactions are detected. However, all current deployments lack a proper incentive mechanism for ensuring that these nodes will do their job ``diligently'', and simply rely on a cursory incentive alignment argument for security.
  We solve this problem by introducing an incentivized watchtower network designed to serve as the first line of defense for rollups. Our main contribution is a ``Proof of Diligence'' protocol that requires watchtowers to continuously provide a proof that they have verified L2 assertions and get rewarded for the same. Proof of Diligence protocol includes a carefully-designed incentive mechanism that is provably secure when watchtowers are rational actors, under a mild rational independence assumption.</description>

      <title>RigorLLM: Resilient Guardrails for Large Language Models against Undesired Content</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13031v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have showcased remarkable capabilities across various tasks in different domains. However, the emergence of biases and the potential for generating harmful content in LLMs, particularly under malicious inputs, pose significant challenges. Current mitigation strategies, while effective, are not resilient under adversarial attacks. This paper introduces Resilient Guardrails for Large Language Models (RigorLLM), a novel framework designed to efficiently and effectively moderate harmful and unsafe inputs and outputs for LLMs. By employing a multi-faceted approach that includes energy-based training data augmentation through Langevin dynamics, optimizing a safe suffix for inputs via minimax optimization, and integrating a fusion-based model combining robust KNN with LLMs based on our data augmentation, RigorLLM offers a robust solution to harmful content moderation. Our experimental evaluations demonstrate that RigorLLM not only outperforms existing baselines like OpenAI API and Perspective API in detecting harmful content but also exhibits unparalleled resilience to jailbreaking attacks. The innovative use of constrained optimization and a fusion-based guardrail approach represents a significant step forward in developing more secure and reliable LLMs, setting a new standard for content moderation frameworks in the face of evolving digital threats.</description>

      <title>What Do Privacy Advertisements Communicate to Consumers?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13857v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When companies release marketing materials aimed at promoting their privacy practices or highlighting specific privacy features, what do they actually communicate to consumers? In this paper, we explore the impact of privacy marketing on: (1) consumers' attitudes toward the organizations providing the campaigns, (2) overall privacy awareness, and (3) the actionability of suggested privacy advice. To this end, we investigated the impact of four privacy advertising videos and one privacy game published by five different technology companies. We conducted 24 semi-structured interviews with participants randomly assigned to view one or two of the videos or play the game. Our findings suggest that awareness of privacy features can contribute to positive perceptions of a company or its products. The ads we tested were more successful in communicating the advertised privacy features than the game we tested. We observed that advertising a single privacy feature using a single metaphor in a short ad increased awareness of the advertised feature. The game failed to communicate privacy features or motivate study participants to use the features. Our results also suggest that privacy campaigns can be useful for raising awareness about privacy features and improving brand image, but may not be the most effective way to teach viewers how to use privacy features.</description>

      <title>GothX: a generator of customizable, legitimate and malicious IoT network traffic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07456v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, machine learning-based anomaly detection (AD) has become an important measure against security threats from Internet of Things (IoT) networks. Machine learning (ML) models for network traffic AD require datasets to be trained, evaluated and compared. Due to the necessity of realistic and up-to-date representation of IoT security threats, new datasets need to be constantly generated to train relevant AD models. Since most traffic generation setups are developed considering only the author's use, replication of traffic generation becomes an additional challenge to the creation and maintenance of useful datasets. In this work, we propose GothX, a flexible traffic generator to create both legitimate and malicious traffic for IoT datasets. As a fork of Gotham Testbed, GothX is developed with five requirements: 1)easy configuration of network topology, 2) customization of traffic parameters, 3) automatic execution of legitimate and attack scenarios, 4) IoT network heterogeneity (the current iteration supports MQTT, Kafka and SINETStream services), and 5) automatic labeling of generated datasets. GothX is validated by two use cases: a) re-generation and enrichment of traffic from the IoT dataset MQTTset,and b) automatic execution of a new realistic scenario including the exploitation of a CVE specific to the Kafka-MQTT network topology and leading to a DDoS attack. We also contribute with two datasets containing mixed traffic, one made from the enriched MQTTset traffic and another from the attack scenario. We evaluated the scalability of GothX (450 IoT sensors in a single machine), the replication of the use cases and the validity of the generated datasets, confirming the ability of GothX to improve the current state-of-the-art of network traffic generation.</description>

      <title>Building Intelligence Identification System via Large Language Model Watermarking: A Survey and Beyond</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11100v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into diverse industries, posing substantial security risks due to unauthorized replication and misuse. To mitigate these concerns, robust identification mechanisms are widely acknowledged as an effective strategy. Identification systems for LLMs now rely heavily on watermarking technology to manage and protect intellectual property and ensure data security. However, previous studies have primarily concentrated on the basic principles of algorithms and lacked a comprehensive analysis of watermarking theory and practice from the perspective of intelligent identification. To bridge this gap, firstly, we explore how a robust identity recognition system can be effectively implemented and managed within LLMs by various participants using watermarking technology. Secondly, we propose a mathematical framework based on mutual information theory, which systematizes the identification process to achieve more precise and customized watermarking. Additionally, we present a comprehensive evaluation of performance metrics for LLM watermarking, reflecting participant preferences and advancing discussions on its identification applications. Lastly, we outline the existing challenges in current watermarking technologies and theoretical frameworks, and provide directional guidance to address these challenges. Our systematic classification and detailed exposition aim to enhance the comparison and evaluation of various methods, fostering further research and development toward a transparent, secure, and equitable LLM ecosystem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15740v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new distinguisher for alternant and Goppa codes, whose complexity is subexponential in the error-correcting capability, hence better than that of generic decoding algorithms. Moreover it does not suffer from the strong regime limitations of the previous distinguishers or structure recovery algorithms: in particular, it applies to the codes used in the Classic McEliece candidate for postquantum cryptography standardization. The invariants that allow us to distinguish are graded Betti numbers of the homogeneous coordinate ring of a shortening of the dual code.
  Since its introduction in 1978, this is the first time an analysis of the McEliece cryptosystem breaks the exponential barrier.</description>

Abstract: We introduce LLMmap, a first-generation fingerprinting attack targeted at LLM-integrated applications. LLMmap employs an active fingerprinting approach, sending carefully crafted queries to the application and analyzing the responses to identify the specific LLM model in use. With as few as 8 interactions, LLMmap can accurately identify LLMs with over 95% accuracy. More importantly, LLMmap is designed to be robust across different application layers, allowing it to identify LLMs operating under various system prompts, stochastic sampling hyperparameters, and even complex generation frameworks such as RAG or Chain-of-Thought.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.10148v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While privacy perceptions and behaviors have been investigated in Western societies, little is known about these issues in non-Western societies. To bridge this gap, we interviewed 30 Google personal account holders in Saudi Arabia about their privacy perceptions and behaviors regarding the activity data that Google saves about them. Our study focuses on Google's Activity Controls, which enable users to control whether, and how, Google saves their Web \&amp; App Activity, Location History, and YouTube History. Our results show that although most participants have some level of awareness about Google's data practices and the Activity Controls, many have only vague awareness, and the majority have not used the available controls. When participants viewed their saved activity data, many were surprised by what had been saved. While many participants find Google's use of their data to improve the services provided to them acceptable, the majority find the use of their data for ad purposes unacceptable. We observe that our Saudi participants exhibit similar trends and patterns in privacy awareness, attitudes, preferences, concerns, and behaviors to what has been found in studies in the US. Our results emphasize the need for: 1) improved techniques to inform users about privacy settings during account sign-up, to remind users about their settings, and to raise awareness about privacy settings; 2) improved privacy setting interfaces to reduce the costs that deter many users from changing the settings; and 3) further research to explore privacy concerns in non-Western cultures.</description>

      <title>Watermarks in the Sand: Impossibility of Strong Watermarking for Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.04378v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Watermarking generative models consists of planting a statistical signal (watermark) in a model's output so that it can be later verified that the output was generated by the given model. A strong watermarking scheme satisfies the property that a computationally bounded attacker cannot erase the watermark without causing significant quality degradation. In this paper, we study the (im)possibility of strong watermarking schemes. We prove that, under well-specified and natural assumptions, strong watermarking is impossible to achieve. This holds even in the private detection algorithm setting, where the watermark insertion and detection algorithms share a secret key, unknown to the attacker. To prove this result, we introduce a generic efficient watermark attack; the attacker is not required to know the private key of the scheme or even which scheme is used. Our attack is based on two assumptions: (1) The attacker has access to a "quality oracle" that can evaluate whether a candidate output is a high-quality response to a prompt, and (2) The attacker has access to a "perturbation oracle" which can modify an output with a nontrivial probability of maintaining quality, and which induces an efficiently mixing random walk on high-quality outputs. We argue that both assumptions can be satisfied in practice by an attacker with weaker computational capabilities than the watermarked model itself, to which the attacker has only black-box access. Furthermore, our assumptions will likely only be easier to satisfy over time as models grow in capabilities and modalities. We demonstrate the feasibility of our attack by instantiating it to attack three existing watermarking schemes for large language models: Kirchenbauer et al. (2023), Kuditipudi et al. (2023), and Zhao et al. (2023). The same attack successfully removes the watermarks planted by all three schemes, with only minor quality degradation.</description>

Abstract: Security operation centers contend with a constant stream of security incidents, ranging from straightforward to highly complex. To address this, we developed Copilot Guided Response (CGR), an industry-scale ML architecture that guides security analysts across three key tasks -- (1) investigation, providing essential historical context by identifying similar incidents; (2) triaging to ascertain the nature of the incident -- whether it is a true positive, false positive, or benign positive; and (3) remediation, recommending tailored containment actions. CGR is integrated into the Microsoft Defender XDR product and deployed worldwide, generating millions of recommendations across thousands of customers. Our extensive evaluation, incorporating internal evaluation, collaboration with security experts, and customer feedback, demonstrates that CGR delivers high-quality recommendations across all three tasks. We provide a comprehensive overview of the CGR architecture, setting a precedent as the first cybersecurity company to openly discuss these capabilities in such depth. Additionally, we GUIDE, the largest public collection of real-world security incidents, spanning 13M evidences across 1M annotated incidents. By enabling researchers and practitioners to conduct research on real-world data, GUIDE advances the state of cybersecurity and supports the development of next-generation machine learning systems.</description>

Abstract: Differentially private federated learning (DP-FL) is a promising technique for collaborative model training while ensuring provable privacy for clients. However, optimizing the tradeoff between privacy and accuracy remains a critical challenge. To our best knowledge, we propose the first DP-FL framework (namely UDP-FL), which universally harmonizes any randomization mechanism (e.g., an optimal one) with the Gaussian Moments Accountant (viz. DP-SGD) to significantly boost accuracy and convergence. Specifically, UDP-FL demonstrates enhanced model performance by mitigating the reliance on Gaussian noise. The key mediator variable in this transformation is the R\'enyi Differential Privacy notion, which is carefully used to harmonize privacy budgets. We also propose an innovative method to theoretically analyze the convergence for DP-FL (including our UDP-FL ) based on mode connectivity analysis. Moreover, we evaluate our UDP-FL through extensive experiments benchmarked against state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, demonstrating superior performance on both privacy guarantees and model performance. Notably, UDP-FL exhibits substantial resilience against different inference attacks, indicating a significant advance in safeguarding sensitive data in federated learning environments.</description>
