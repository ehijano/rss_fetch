      <title>Learning the Contact Manifold for Accurate Pose Estimation During Peg-in-Hole Insertion of Complex Geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Contact-rich assembly of complex, non-convex parts with tight tolerances remains a formidable challenge. Purely model-based methods struggle with discontinuous contact dynamics, while model-free methods require vast data and often lack precision. In this work, we introduce a hybrid framework that uses only contact-state information between a complex peg and its mating hole to recover the full SE(3) pose during assembly. In under 10 seconds of online execution, a sequence of primitive probing motions constructs a local contact submanifold, which is then aligned to a precomputed offline contact manifold to yield sub-mm and sub-degree pose estimates. To eliminate costly k-NN searches, we train a lightweight network that projects sparse contact observations onto the contact manifold and is 95x faster and 18% more accurate. Our method, evaluated on three industrially relevant geometries with clearances of 0.1-1.0 mm, achieves a success rate of 93.3%, a 4.1x improvement compared to primitive-only strategies without state estimation.</description>

      <title>Approximation Algorithms for Smallest Intersecting Balls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11369v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a general smallest intersecting ball problem and its soft-margin variant in high-dimensional Euclidean spaces for input objects that are compact and convex. These two problems link and unify a series of fundamental problems in computational geometry and machine learning, including smallest enclosing ball, polytope distance, intersection radius, $\ell_1$-loss support vector machine, $\ell_1$-loss support vector data description, and so on. Leveraging our novel framework for solving zero-sum games over symmetric cones, we propose general approximation algorithms for the two problems, where implementation details are presented for specific inputs of convex polytopes, reduced polytopes, axis-aligned bounding boxes, balls, and ellipsoids. For most of these inputs, our algorithms are the first results in high-dimensional spaces, and also the first approximation methods. Experimental results show that our algorithms can solve large-scale input instances efficiently.</description>

      <title>Efficient computations of discrete cubical homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09939v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a fast algorithm for computing discrete cubical homology of graphs over finite fields with an appropriate characteristic. This algorithm improves on several computational steps compared to constructions in the existing literature, with the key insights including: a faster way to generate all singular cubes, reducing the dimensions of vector spaces in the chain complex by taking a quotient over automorphisms of the cube, and preprocessing graphs using the axiomatic treatment of discrete cubical homology.</description>

      <title>Polycubes via Dual Loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16865v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study polycubes: orthogonal polyhedra with axis-aligned quadrilateral faces. We present a complete characterization of polycubes of any genus based on their dual structure: a collection of oriented loops which run in each of the axis directions and capture polycubes via their intersection patterns. A polycube loop structure uniquely corresponds to a polycube. We also describe all combinatorially different ways to add a loop to a loop structure while maintaining its validity. Similarly, we show how to identify loops that can be removed from a polycube loop structure without invalidating it. Our characterization gives rise to an iterative algorithm to construct provably valid polycube maps for a given input surface.</description>

      <title>Topological Stability and Latschev-type Reconstruction Theorems for Spaces of Curvature Bounded Above</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04259v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of homotopy-type reconstruction of compact subsets $X\subset\R^N$ that have the Alexandrov curvature bounded above ($\leq$ $\kappa$) in the intrinsic length metric. The reconstructed spaces are in the form of Vietoris--Rips complexes computed from a compact sample $S$, Hausdorff--close to the unknown shape $X$. Instead of the Euclidean metric on the sample, our reconstruction technique leverages a path-based metric to compute these complexes. As naturally emerging in the framework of reconstruction, we also study the Gromov--Hausdorff topological stability and finiteness problem for general compact for subspaces of curvature bounded above. Our techniques provide novel sampling conditions as an alternative to the existing and commonly used techniques using weak feature size and $\mu$--reach. In particular, we leverage the concept of the {\em large scale distortion}, and show examples of Euclidean subspaces, for which the known parameters such as the reach, $\mu$--reach and weak features size vanish, whereas the large scale distortion is finite, making our reconstruction results applicable for such cases.</description>
