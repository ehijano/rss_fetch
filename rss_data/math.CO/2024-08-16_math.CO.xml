      <title>Average Degree of Graphs Derived From Aperiodic Tilings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider graphs derived from aperiodically ordered tilings of the plane, by treating each corner of each tile as a vertex and each side of each tile as an edge. We calculate the average degree of these graphs. For the Ammann A2 tiling, we present a closed-form formula for the average degree. For the Kite and Dart Penrose tiling, the Rhomb Penrose Tiling, and the Ammann-Beenker tiling we present numerical calculations for the average degree.</description>

      <title>The $\mathfrak{sl}_2$-actions on the symmetric polynomials and on Young diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the article, two implementations of the representation of the complex Lie algebra $\mathfrak{sl}_2$ on the algebra of symmetric polynomials $\Lambda_n$ by differential operators are proposed. The realizations of irreducible subrepresentations, both finite-dimensional and infinite-dimensional, are described, and the decomposition of $\Lambda_n$ is found. The actions on the Schur polynomials is also determined. By using an isomorphism between $\Lambda_n$ and the vector space of Young diagrams $\mathbb{Q}\mathcal{Y}_n$ with no more than $n$ rows, these representations are transferred to $\mathbb{Q}\mathcal{Y}_n$.</description>

      <title>Shifted and Threshold Matroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterize the class of threshold matroids by the structure of their defining bases. We also give an example of a shifted matroid which is not threshold, answering a question of Deza and Onn. We conclude by exploring consequences of our characterization of threshold matroids: We give a formula for the number of isomorphism classes of threshold matroids on a groundset of size $n$. This enumeration shows that almost all shifted matroids are not threshold. We also present a polynomial time algorithm to check if a matroid is threshold and provide alternative and simplified proofs of some of the main results of Deza and Onn.</description>

      <title>Interlacing triangles, Schubert puzzles, and graph colorings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that interlacing triangular arrays, introduced by Aggarwal-Borodin-Wheeler to study certain probability measures, can be used to compute structure constants for multiplying Schubert classes in the $K$-theory of Grassmannians, in the cohomology of their cotangent bundles, and in the cohomology of partial flag varieties. Our results are achieved by establishing a splitting lemma, allowing for interlacing triangular arrays of high rank to be decomposed into arrays of lower rank, and by constructing a bijection between interlacing triangular arrays of rank 3 with certain proper vertex colorings of the triangular grid graph that factors through generalizations of Knutson-Tao puzzles. Along the way, we prove one enumerative conjecture of Aggarwal-Borodin-Wheeler and disprove another.</description>

      <title>Congruence Classes of Simplex Structures in Finite Field Vector Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a generalization of the Erd\H{o}s-Falconer distance problem over finite fields. For a graph $G$, two embeddings $p, p': V(G) \to \mathbb{F}_q^d$ of a graph $G$ are congruent if for all edges $(v_i, v_j)$ of $G$ we have that $||p(v_i) - p(v_j)|| = ||p'(v_i) - p'(v_j)||$. What is the infimum of $s$ such that for any subset $E\subset \mathbb{F}_q^d$ with $|E| \gtrsim q^s$, $E$ contains a positive proportion of congruence classes of $G$ in $\mathbb{F}_q^d$? Bennett et al. and McDonald used group action methods to prove results in the case of $k$-simplices. The work of Iosevich, Jardine, and McDonald as well as that of Bright et al. have proved results in the case of trees and trees of simplices, utilizing the inductive nature of these graphs.
  Recently, Aksoy, Iosevich, and McDonald combined these two approaches to obtain nontrivial bounds on the "bowtie" graph, two triangles joined at a vertex. Their proof relies on an application of the Hadamard three-lines theorem to pass to a different graph. We develop novel geometric techniques called branch shifting and simplex unbalancing to reduce our analysis of trees of simplices to a much smaller class of simplex structures. This allows us to establish a framework that handles a wide class of graphs exhibiting a combination of rigid and loose behavior. In $\mathbb{F}_q^2$, this approach gives new nontrivial bounds on chains and trees of simplices. In $\mathbb{F}_q^d$, we improve on the results of Bright et al. in many cases and generalize their work to a wider class of simplex trees. We discuss partial progress on how this framework can be extended to more general simplex structures, such as cycles of simplices and structures of simplices glued together along an edge or a face.</description>

      <title>Domination Polynomials of the Grid, the Cylinder, the Torus, and the King Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an algorithm to compute the domination polynomial of the $m \times n$ grid, cylinder, and torus graphs and the king graph. The time complexity of the algorithm is $O(m^2n^2 \lambda^{2m})$ for the torus and $O(m^3n^2\lambda^m)$ for the other graphs, where $\lambda = 1+\sqrt{2}$. The space complexity is $O(mn\lambda^m)$ for all of these graphs. We use this algorithm to compute domination polynomials for graphs up to size $24\times 24$ and the total number of dominating sets for even larger graphs. This allows us to give precise estimates of the asymptotic growth rates of the number of dominating sets. We also extend several sequences in the Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences.</description>

      <title>A note on the 2-Factor Hamiltonicity Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 2-factor Hamiltonicity Conjecture by Funk, Jackson, Labbate, and Sheehan [JCTB, 2003] asserts that all cubic, bipartite graphs in which all 2-factors are Hamiltonian cycles can be built using a simple operation starting from $K_{3,3}$ and the Heawood graph.
  We discuss the link between this conjecture and matching theory, in particular by showing that this conjecture is equivalent to the statement that the two exceptional graphs in the conjecture are the only 2-factor Hamiltonian, cubic braces, where braces are connected, bipartite graphs in which every matching of size at most two is contained in a perfect matching. In the context of matching theory this conjecture is especially noteworthy as $K_{3,3}$ and the Heawood graph are both strongly tied to the important class of Pfaffian graphs, with $K_{3,3}$ being the canonical non-Pfaffian graph and the Heawood graph being one of the most noteworthy Pfaffian graphs.
  Our main contribution is a proof that the Heawood graph is the only 2-factor Hamiltonian, Pfaffian, cubic brace. This is shown by establishing that, aside from the Heawood graph, all Pfaffian braces contain a cycle of length four, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let us consider a collection $\mathcal G$ of codewords of length $n$ over an alphabet of size $s$. Let $t_1,\ldots, t_s$ be nonnegative integers. What is the maximum of $|\mathcal G|$ subject to the condition that any two codewords should have at least $t_i$ positions where both have letter $i$ ($1\le i\le s$). In the case $s=2$ it is a longstanding open question. Quite surprisingly, we obtain an almost complete answer for $s\ge 3$. The main tool is a correlation inequality.</description>

      <title>Combinatorics of the irreducible components of $\mathcal{H}_n^{\Gamma}$ in type $D$ and $E$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we give a combinatorial model in terms of symmetric cores of the indexing set of the irreducible components of $\mathcal{H}_n^{\Gamma}$, the $\Gamma$-fixed points of the Hilbert scheme of $n$ points in $\mathbb{C}^2$, when $\Gamma$ is a finite subgroup of $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{C})$ isomorphic to the binary dihedral group. Moreover, we show that if $\Gamma$ is a subgroup of $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{C})$ isomorphic to the binary tetrahedral group, to the binary octahedral group or to the binary icosahedral group, then the $\Gamma$-fixed points of $\mathcal{H}_n$ which are also fixed under $\mathbb{T}_1$, the maximal diagonal torus of $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{C})$, are in fact $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{C})$-fixed points. Finally, we prove that in that case, the irreducible components of $\mathcal{H}_n^{\Gamma}$ containing a $\mathbb{T}_1$-fixed point are of dimension $0$.</description>

      <title>About the Hardy-Ramanujan partition function asymptotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hardy-Ramanujan partition function asymptotics is a famous result in the asymptotics of combinatorial sequences. It was originally derived using complex analysis and number-theoretic ideas by Hardy and Ramanujan. It was later re-derived by Paul Erd\H{o}s using real analytic methods. Later still, D.J.~Newman used just the usual Hayman saddle-point approach, ubiquitous in asymptotic analysis. Fristedt introduced a probabilistic approach, which was further extended by Dan Romik, for restricted partition functions. Our perspective is that the Laplace transform changes the essentially algebraic generating function into an exponential form. Using this, we carry out the exercise of deriving the leading order asymptotics, following the Fristedt-Romik approach. We also give additional examples of the Laplace transform method.</description>

      <title>On a generalization of corner trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Corner trees, introduced in "Even-Zohar and Leng, 2021, Proceedings of the 2021 ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms", allow for the efficient counting of certain permutation patterns.
  Here we identify corner trees as a subset of finite (strict) double posets, which we term twin-tree double posets. They are contained in both twin double posets and tree double posets, giving candidate sets for generalizations of corner tree countings. We provide the generalization of an algorithm proposed by Even-Zohar/Leng to a class of tree double posets, thereby enlarging the space of permutations that can be counted in O(n^{5/3}).</description>

      <title>Monotonicity in Quadratically Regularized Linear Programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In optimal transport, quadratic regularization is a sparse alternative to entropic regularization: the solution measure tends to have small support. Computational experience suggests that the support decreases monotonically to the unregularized counterpart as the regularization parameter is relaxed. We find it useful to investigate this monotonicity more abstractly for linear programs over polytopes, regularized with the squared norm. Here, monotonicity can be stated as an invariance property of the curve mapping the regularization parameter to the solution: once the curve enters a face of the polytope, does it remain in that face forever? We show that this invariance is equivalent to a geometric property of the polytope, namely that each face contains the minimum norm point of its affine hull. Returning to the optimal transport problem and its associated Birkhoff polytope, we verify this property for low dimensions, but show that it fails for dimension $d\geq25$. As a consequence, the conjectured monotonicity of the support fails in general, even if experiments suggest that monotonicity holds for many cost matrices.</description>

      <title>Chern-Simons theories with defects, Rogers-Ramanujan type functions and eta-products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07893v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the line defect half-indices of 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric Chern-Simons (CS) theories with (special)unitary, symplectic, orthogonal and exceptional gauge groups. We find that they have several beautiful infinite product $q$-series expressions in terms of Ramanujan's general theta function. For the theories with fundamental chiral multiplets, the pairs of the Neumann half-indices and one-point functions of the fundamental Wilson lines form a basis for the line defect indices in terms of the Rogers-Ramanujan type functions. Furthermore, the theories with an adjoint chiral admit the expressions as the eta-products. In particular, for the $SU(N)_{-2N}$ CS theory, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the BPS boundary local operators and the $N$-core partitions.</description>

      <title>Minimum Synthesis Cost of CNOT Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optimizing the size and depth of CNOT circuits is an active area of research in quantum computing and is particularly relevant for circuits synthesized from the Clifford + T universal gate set. Although many techniques exist for finding short syntheses, it is difficult to assess how close to optimal these syntheses are without an exponential brute-force search. We use a novel method of categorizing CNOT gates in a synthesis to obtain a strict lower bound computable in $O(n^{\omega})$ time on the minimum number of gates needed to synthesize a given CNOT circuit, where $\omega$ denotes the matrix multiplication constant and $n$ is the number of qubits involved. Applying our framework, we prove that $3(n-1)$ gate syntheses of the $n$-cycle circuit are optimal and provide insight into their structure. We also generalize this result to permutation circuits. For linear reversible circuits with $ n = 3, 4, 5$ qubits, our lower bound is optimal for 100%, 67.7%, and 23.1% of circuits and is accurate to within one CNOT gate in 100%, 99.5%, and 83.0% of circuits respectively. We also introduce an algorithm that efficiently determines whether certain circuits can be synthesized with fewer than $n$ CNOT gates.</description>

      <title>Prescribed duality dynamics in comodule categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that there exist Hopf algebras with surjective, non-bijective antipode which admit no non-trivial morphisms from Hopf algebras with bijective antipode; in particular, they are not quotients of such. This answers a question left open in prior work, and contrasts with the dual setup whereby a Hopf algebra has injective antipode precisely when it embeds into one with bijective antipode. The examples rely on the broader phenomenon of realizing pre-specified subspace lattices as comodule lattices: for a finite-dimensional vector space $V$ and a sequence $(\mathcal{L}_r)_r$ of successively finer lattices of subspaces thereof, assuming the minimal subquotients of the supremum $\bigvee_r \mathcal{L}_r$ are all at least 2-dimensional, there is a Hopf algebra equipping $V$ with a comodule structure in such a fashion that the lattice of comodules of the $r^{th}$ dual comodule $V^{r*}$ is precisely the given $\mathcal{L}_r$.</description>

      <title>Palette Sparsification for Graphs with Sparse Neighborhoods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A celebrated palette sparsification result of Assadi, Chen, and Khanna states that in every $n$-vertex graph of maximum degree $\Delta$, sampling $\Theta(\log n)$ colors per vertex from $\{1,\ldots,\Delta+1\}$ almost certainly allows for a proper coloring from the sampled colors. Alon and Assadi extended this work proving a similar result for $O(\Delta/\log \Delta)$-coloring triangle-free graphs. Apart from being interesting results from a combinatorial standpoint, their results have various applications to the design of graph coloring algorithms in different models of computation.
  In this work, we focus on graphs with sparse neighborhoods. We say a graph $G = (V,E)$ is $k$-locally-sparse if for each vertex $v \in V$, the subgraph $G[N(v)]$ contains at most $k$ edges. A celebrated result of Alon, Krivelevich, and Sudakov shows that such graphs are $O(\Delta/\log (\Delta/\sqrt{k}))$-colorable. For any $\alpha\in(0,1)$ and $k\ll\Delta^{2\alpha}$, let $G$ be a $k$-locally-sparse graph. We show the following for $q=\Theta\left(\Delta/\log\left(\Delta^\alpha/\sqrt{k}\right)\right)$:
  1. Sampling $O(\Delta^\alpha+\sqrt{\log n})$ colors per vertex is sufficient to obtain a proper $q$-coloring of $G$ from the sampled colors.
  2. There exists a single-pass streaming algorithm which computes a proper $q$-coloring of $G$ with high probability using $\tilde O(n\Delta^{2\alpha})$ space.
  3. There exists a randomized non-adaptive sublinear-time algorithm which computes a proper $q$-coloring of $G$ with high probability using at most $\tilde O\left(n^{\frac32+\frac{\alpha}{2-2\alpha}}\right)$ queries.
  Our results recover and improve upon earlier work of Alon and Assadi. A key element in our proof is a proposition regarding correspondence coloring in the so-called color-degree setting, which improves upon recent work of Anderson, Kuchukova, and the author and is of independent interest.</description>

      <title>The $e$-vector of a simplicial complex</title>

      <description>arXiv:1806.05239v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the exponential Hilbert series (both coarsely- and finely-graded) of the Stanley-Reisner ring of an abstract simplicial complex, $\Delta$, and we introduce the $e$-vector of $\Delta$, which relates to the coefficients of the exponential Hilbert series. We explore the relationship of the $e$-vector with the classical $f$-vector and $h$-vector of $\Delta$ while simultaneously investigating the geometric information that the $e$-vector encodes about $\Delta$. We then prove a simple combinatorial identity for the $e$-vector in the case where $\Delta$ is an Eulerian manifold.</description>

      <title>An efficient asymmetric removal lemma and its limitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.07693v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The triangle removal states that if $G$ contains $\varepsilon n^2$ edge-disjoint triangles, then $G$ contains $\delta(\varepsilon)n^3$ triangles. Unfortunately, there are no sensible bounds on the order of growth of $\delta(\varepsilon)$, and at any rate, it is known that $\delta(\varepsilon)$ is not polynomial in $\varepsilon$. Csaba recently obtained an asymmetric variant of the triangle removal, stating that if $G$ contains $\varepsilon n^2$ edge-disjoint triangles, then $G$ contains $2^{-\mathrm{poly}(1/\varepsilon)}\cdot n^5$ copies of $C_5$. To this end, he devised a new variant of Szemer\'edi's regularity lemma. We obtain the following results:
  - We first give a regularity-free proof of Csaba's theorem, which improves the number of copies of $C_5$ to the optimal number $\mathrm{poly}(\varepsilon)\cdot n^5$.
  - We say that $H$ is $K_3$-abundant if every graph containing $\varepsilon n^2$ edge-disjoint triangles has $\mathrm{poly}(\varepsilon)\cdot n^{|V(H)|}$ copies of $H$. It is easy to see that a $K_3$-abundant graph must be triangle-free and tripartite. Given our first result, it is natural to ask if all triangle-free tripartite graphs are $K_3$-abundant. Our second result is that assuming a well-known conjecture of Ruzsa in additive number theory, the answer to this question is negative.
  Our proofs use a mix of combinatorial, number-theoretic, probabilistic, and Ramsey-type arguments.</description>

      <title>The two-variable hypergraph Tutte polynomial via embedding activities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.20639v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the two-variable Tutte polynomial of hypergraphs can be defined via embedding activities. We also prove that embedding activities of hypergraphs yield a Crapo-style decomposition of $\mathbb{Z}^E$, thus generalizing Bernardi's results from graphs to hypergraphs.
  We also show that hypergraph embedding activities do not fit into the $\Delta$-activity framework of Courtiel. Based on this observation, we construct a graph with an activity notion that yields a Crapo decomposition, but cannot be obtained as a $\Delta$-activity.</description>

      <title>A Conditional Extension of the Park-Pham Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17872v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neglecting many motivating details for the Park-Pham theorem (previously known as the Kahn-Kalai conjecture), the result starts with a finite set $X$, a non-trivial upper set $\mathcal{F} \subseteq 2^X$, and a particular parameterized family of random variables $X_p$, then proceeds to provide an upper bound on the value $p_c(\mathcal{F})$ such that $\mathbb{P}(X_{p_c(\mathcal{F})} \in \mathcal{F}) = 1/2$. A natural question to ask is if there is an analog to the Park-Pham theorem for upper sets in finite posets other than $2^X$ and other parameterized families of random variables taking values in them. In this short note, we show that there is, with minor adjustments, in at least one circumstance. This is done by producing a conditional version of the $\epsilon$-dependent form of the Park-Pham theorem, which has practical implications for the study of large neural networks and may also be interesting in its own right.</description>

      <title>On the distance problem over finite p-adic rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07325v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the distance problem in the setting of finite p-adic rings. In odd dimensions, our results are essentially sharp. In even dimensions, we clarify the conjecture and provide examples to support it. Surprisingly, compared to the finite field case, in this setting, we are able to provide a large family of sets such that the distance conjecture holds. By developing new restriction type estimates associated to circles and orbits, with a group theoretic argument, we will prove the $4/3$-parallel result in the two dimensions. This answers a question raised by Alex Iosevich. In a more general scenario, the existence/distribution of geometric/graph configurations will be also considered in this paper. Our results present improvements and extensions of recent results due to Ben Lichtin (2019, 2023). In comparison with Lichtin's method, our approach is much simpler and flexible, which is also one of the novelties in this paper.</description>

      <title>Characterization of geodesic distance on infinite graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02385v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a connected graph and let $d_G$ be the geodesic distance on $V(G)$. The metric spaces $(V(G), d_{G})$ are characterized up to isometry for all finite connected $G$ by David C. Kay and Gary Chartrand in 1964. The main result of the paper expands this characterization on the infinite connected graphs. We also prove that every metric space with integer distances between its points admits an isometric embedding into $(V(G), d_G)$ for suitable $G$.</description>

      <title>When do the Kahn-Kalai Bounds Provide New Information?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02822v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Park-Pham theorem (previously known as the Kahn-Kalai conjecture), bounds the critical probability, $p_c(\mathcal{F})$, of the a non-trivial property $\mathcal{F}\subseteq 2^X$ that is closed under supersets by the product of a universal constant $K$, the expectation threshold of the property, $q(\mathcal{F})$, and the logarithm of the size of the property's largest minimal element, $\log\ell(\mathcal{F})$. That is, the Park-Pham theorem asserts that $p_c(\mathcal{F})\leq Kq(\mathcal{F})\log\ell(\mathcal{F})$. Since the critical probability $p_c(\mathcal{F})$ always satisfies $p_c(\mathcal{F})&lt;1$, one may ask when the upper bound posed by Kahn and Kalai gives us more information than this--that is, when is it true that $Kq(\mathcal{F})\log\ell(\mathcal{F}) &lt; 1$? There are many situations where this occurs, as well as many situations where this is not the case. In this short note, we provide a number of necessary conditions for this to happen together with some easy-to-compute conditions that are sufficient to ensure it.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.11369v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate higher dimensional chain conditions, where the largeness notion is given by Fubini products of a given ideal. From strong saturation properties of an ideal, we derive abstractly versions of higher dimensional $\Delta$-system lemma, which imply many posets, including any finite support iteration of $\sigma$-centered posets and measure algebras, satisfy the higher dimensional chain conditions. We then show that if a poset satisfies a strengthening of the $\sigma$-finite chain condition by Horn and Tarski, then it satisfies higher dimensional chain conditions. As an application, we derive Ramsey-theoretic consequences, namely various partition hypotheses as studied by Bannister, Bergfalk, Moore and Todorcevic, from the existence of ideals satisfying strong chain conditions.</description>

      <title>Minimal triangulations of circle bundles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.04214v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A triangulation of a circle bundle $ E \xrightarrow[\text{}]{\pi} B$ is a triangulation of the total space $E$ and the base $B$ such that the projection $\pi$ is a simplicial map. In the paper we address the following questions: Which circle bundles can be triangulated over a given triangulation of the base? What are the minimal triangulations of a bundle? A complete solution for semisimplicial triangulations was given by N. Mn\"{e}v. Our results deal with classical triangulations, that is, simplicial complexes. We give an exact answer for an infinite family of triangulated spheres (including the boundary of the $3$-simplex, the boundary of the octahedron, the suspension over an $n$-gon, the icosahedron). For the general case we present a sufficient criterion for existence of a triangulation. Some minimality results follow straightforwadly.</description>

      <title>Computing the $q$-Multiplicity of the Positive Roots of $\mathfrak{sl}_{r+1}(\mathbb{C})$ and Products of Fibonacci Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09986v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using Kostant's weight multiplicity formula, we describe and enumerate the terms contributing a nonzero value to the multiplicity of a positive root $\mu$ in the adjoint representation of $\mathfrak{sl}_{r+1}(\mathbb{C})$, which we denote $L(\tilde{\alpha})$, where $\tilde{\alpha}$ is the highest root of $\mathfrak{sl}_{r+1}(\mathbb{C})$. We prove that the number of terms contributing a nonzero value in the multiplicity of the positive root $\mu=\alpha_i+\alpha_{i+1}+\cdots+\alpha_j$ with $1\leq i\leq j\leq r$ in $L(\tilde{\alpha})$ is given by the product $F_{i}\cdot F_{r-j+1}$, where $F_n$ is the $n^{\text{th}}$ Fibonacci number. Using this result, we show that the $q$-multiplicity of the positive root $\mu=\alpha_i+\alpha_{i+1}+\cdots+\alpha_j$ with $1\leq i\leq j\leq r$ in the representation $L(\tilde{\alpha})$ is precisely $q^{r-h(\mu)}$, where $h(\mu)=j-i+1$ is the height of the positive root $\mu$. Setting $q=1$ recovers the known result that the multiplicity of a positive root in the adjoint representation of $\mathfrak{sl}_{r+1}(\mathbb{C})$ is one.</description>
