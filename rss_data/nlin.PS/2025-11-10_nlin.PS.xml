      <title>Stability of parametrically driven, damped nonlinear Dirac solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The linear stability of two exact stationary solutions of the parametrically driven, damped nonlinear Dirac equation is investigated. Stability is ascertained through the resolution of the eigenvalue problem, which stems from the linearization of this equation around the exact solutions. On the one hand, it is proven that one of these solutions is always unstable, which confirms previous analysis based on a variational method. On the other hand, it is shown that sufficiently large dissipation guarantees the stability of the second solution. Specifically, we determine the stability curve that separates stable and unstable regions in the parameter space. The dependence of the stability diagram on the driven frequency is also studied, and it is shown that low-frequency solitons are stable across the entire parameter space. These results have been corroborated with extensive simulations of the parametrically driven and damped nonlinear Dirac equation by employing a novel and recently proposed numerical algorithm that minimizes discretization errors.</description>

      <title>Soliton dynamics and stability in the ABS spinor model with a PT-symmetric periodic potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the effects on solitons dynamics of introducing a
  PT-symmetric complex potential in a specific family of the cubic Dirac equation in (1+1)-dimensions, called the ABS model. The potential is introduced taking advantage of the fact that the nonlinear Dirac equation admits a Lagrangian formalism. As a consequence, the imaginary part of the potential, associated with gains and losses, behaves as a spatially periodic damping (changing from positive to negative, and back) that acts at the same time on the two spinor components. A collective coordinates theory is developed by making an ansatz for a moving soliton where the position, rapidity, momentum, frequency, and phase are all functions of time. We consider the complex potential as a perturbation and verify that numerical solutions of the equation of motions for the collective coordinates are in agreement with simulations of the nonlinear Dirac equation. The main effect of the imaginary part of the potencial is to induce oscillations in the charge and energy (they are conserved for real potentials) with the same frequency and phase as the momentum. We find long-lived solitons even with very large charge and energy oscillations. Additionally, we extend to the nonlinear Dirac equation an empirical stability criterion, previously employed successfully in the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation.</description>
