      <title>BSM: Small but Powerful Biological Sequence Model for Genes and Proteins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling biological sequences such as DNA, RNA, and proteins is crucial for understanding complex processes like gene regulation and protein synthesis. However, most current models either focus on a single type or treat multiple types of data separately, limiting their ability to capture cross-modal relationships. We propose that by learning the relationships between these modalities, the model can enhance its understanding of each type. To address this, we introduce BSM, a small but powerful mixed-modal biological sequence foundation model, trained on three types of data: RefSeq, Gene Related Sequences, and interleaved biological sequences from the web. These datasets capture the genetic flow, gene-protein relationships, and the natural co-occurrence of diverse biological data, respectively. By training on mixed-modal data, BSM significantly enhances learning efficiency and cross-modal representation, outperforming models trained solely on unimodal data. With only 110M parameters, BSM achieves performance comparable to much larger models across both single-modal and mixed-modal tasks, and uniquely demonstrates in-context learning capability for mixed-modal tasks, which is absent in existing models. Further scaling to 270M parameters demonstrates even greater performance gains, highlighting the potential of BSM as a significant advancement in multimodal biological sequence modeling.</description>

      <title>Fine-tuning the ESM2 protein language model to understand the functional impact of missense variants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Elucidating the functional effect of missense variants is of crucial importance, yet challenging. To understand the impact of such variants, we fine-tuned the ESM2 protein language model to classify 20 protein features at amino acid resolution. We used the resulting models to: 1) identify protein features that are enriched in either pathogenic or benign missense variants, 2) compare the characteristics of proteins with reference or alternate alleles to understand how missense variants affect protein functionality. We show that our model can be used to reclassify some variants of unknown significance. We also demonstrate the usage of our models for understanding the potential effect of variants on protein features.</description>
