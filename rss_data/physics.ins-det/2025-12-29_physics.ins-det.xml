      <title>SiPM-based photodetectors for spectroscopic measurements in wide dynamic range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The results of measurements of the characteristics of photodetectors based on large-area SiPM matrices with a wide dynamic range are presented. The potential application of SiPM-based photodetectors for electromagnetic calorimetry in the energy range from hundreds of keV to tens of GeV is explored. The potential application of SiPM in gamma-spectroscopy is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Probing Internal Conversion and Dark-Matter-Induced De-excitation of 180mTa with a gamma-ray TES Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose and evaluate a source-as-detector search for the de-excitation of the long-lived isomer $^{180\mathrm{m}}\mathrm{Ta}$ in natural tantalum (Ta), using a $\gamma$-ray transition-edge-sensor (TES) array. We exploit two capabilities not available in conventional high-purity germanium (HPGe) searches: (i) near-unity containment of low-energy secondaries (internal-conversion electrons and characteristic X rays), as well as the nuclear recoil, enabling a calorimetric, event-by-event measurement of the total energy deposited in the absorber; and (ii) a delayed-coincidence tag based on the subsequent ${}^{180}$Ta electron-capture (EC) decay to ${}^{180}$Hf. We evaluate the $3\sigma$ discovery reach for internal conversion (IC) and for dark-matter-induced de-excitation in two benchmark scenarios: a strongly interacting dark-matter (DM) subcomponent and inelastic DM with off-diagonal couplings. Using a background model based on intrinsic radioactivity in the Ta absorber and realistic detector performance, we show that arrays with $N_{\mathrm{TES}}=256$ and $1{,}000$ pixels can reach the theoretically expected IC half-life within $2.6$~yr and $0.66$~yr, respectively. For an array with $N_{\mathrm{TES}}=10^4$ and a five-year exposure, the projected sensitivity to DM-induced de-excitation surpasses limits inferred from HPGe non-observations of ${}^{180\mathrm{m}}$Ta and probes regions of parameter space not covered by current direct-detection experiments.</description>

      <title>WST spectroscopic variability alerts: discovery space, data flow system requirements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The enormous multiplexity of the WST opens up the possibility to trigger alerts for variable objects - an option that has been reserved so far only for imaging surveys. WST can go further by detecting spectroscopic line profile and line strength variations. I review previous alert-issuing surveys that are limited to imaging, and describe some of the new research possibilities that this feature of the data flow system (DFS) would open up. The latter range from variability of emission line stars, such as Bes, WRs and LBVs to variability of active galaxies and quasars, including the so-called changing look objects that shift between Type 1 and Type 2. Furthermore, I describe the requirements that the WST DFS must meet to make this feasible. The most critical aspect is the rapid data processing for timely follow-up. Next, the alert system is tightly connected with the data reduction and archive, because it will need an extensive and continuously updated spectral reference database. The new spectra will have to be compared against these reference spectra to identify variations. The reference spectra can either be "native" from the WST itself or they can originate from other spectroscopic surveys. Two options for the DFS are considered: one is to conduct an automated search of the WST's own archive, and potentially of other spectroscopic archives and a second option is to allow the users to submit reference spectra on their own. The spectroscopic alert system will open up a completely new discovery space that is not accessible to the existing or planned near-future surveys. Finally, I discuss the advantages of moving the variability detection to physical parameters by modeling the observed and reference spectra and comparing the derived fitting parameters. This strategy offers a robust method for alert ranking.</description>

      <title>AI-Enhanced Real-Time Wi-Fi Sensing Through Single Transceiver Pair</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02845v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The advancement of next-generation Wi-Fi technology heavily relies on sensing capabilities, which play a pivotal role in enabling sophisticated applications. In response to the growing demand for large-scale deployments, contemporary Wi-Fi sensing systems strive to achieve high-precision perception while maintaining minimal bandwidth consumption and antenna count requirements. Remarkably, various AI-driven perception technologies have demonstrated the ability to surpass the traditional resolution limitations imposed by radar theory. However, the theoretical underpinnings of this phenomenon have not been thoroughly investigated in existing research. In this study, we found that under hardware-constrained conditions, the performance gains brought by AI to Wi-Fi sensing systems primarily originate from two aspects: prior information and temporal correlation. Prior information enables the AI to generate plausible details based on vague input, while temporal correlation helps reduce the upper bound of sensing error. Building on these insights, we developed a real-time, AI-based Wi-Fi sensing and visualization system using a single transceiver pair, and designed experiments focusing on human pose estimation and indoor localization. The system operates in real time on commodity hardware, and experimental results confirm our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>A Capacitor Model of the Helical Deflector: Revisiting Shamaev's Proposal and the Textbook Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06651v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An RF helical deflector is a type of electron and ion optics device that applies a time-dependent rotating transverse electric or magnetic field by means of time-dependent RF voltage applied on two opposite conducting helical structures (wires, ribbons or other) to deflect charged particles (a single, bunch or beam) in a circular or spiral path. It is a perspective indirect timing system being concurrent for reaching picosecond time resolution, and have promise being excellent candidate for high precision time-of-flight detection. As a timing system, it converts the temporal structure of an electron beam into a spatial pattern -- particularly, an ellipse in the case of a single-frequency RF voltage and continuous electron pencil beam.
  I propose a capacitor model of an RF helical deflector and compare it with the existing textbook model \cite{ZhigarevBook, Gevorgian2015}, interpret them and provide understanding of them. Furthermore, I analyze the latter, finding analytical formulas for the applied electric field, ellipse sizes (semi-axes) and rotation angle, lengths of the ellipse line, corresponding to the duration of electron pencil bunches or beams. The present article touches the topics of getting circle on resonance limit and of deflection sensitivity.</description>
