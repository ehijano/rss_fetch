      <title>Resampled Mutual Information for Clustering and Community Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce resampled mutual information (ResMI), a novel measure of clustering similarity that combines insights from information theoretic and pair counting approaches to clustering and community detection. Similar to chance-corrected measures, ResMI satisfies the constant baseline property, but it has the advantages of not requiring adjustment terms and being fully interpretable in the language of information theory. Experiments on synthetic datasets demonstrate that ResMI is robust to common biases exhibited by existing measures, particularly in settings with high cluster counts and asymmetric cluster distributions. Additionally, we show that ResMI identifies meaningful community structures in two real contact tracing networks.</description>

      <title>Synthetic graphs for link prediction benchmarking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting missing links in complex networks requires algorithms that are able to explore statistical regularities in the existing data. Here we investigate the interplay between algorithm efficiency and network structures through the introduction of suitably-designed synthetic graphs. We propose a family of random graphs that incorporates both micro-scale motifs and meso-scale communities, two ubiquitous structures in complex networks. A key contribution is the derivation of theoretical upper bounds for link prediction performance in our synthetic graphs, allowing us to estimate the predictability of the task and obtain an improved assessment of the performance of any method. Our results on the performance of classical methods (e.g., Stochastic Block Models, Node2Vec,GraphSage) show that the performance of all methods correlate with the theoretical predictability, that no single method is universally superior, and that each of the methods exploit different characteristics known to exist in large classes of networks. Our findings underline the need for careful consideration of graph structure when selecting a link prediction method and emphasize the value of comparing performance against synthetic benchmarks. We provide open-source code for generating these synthetic graphs, enabling further research on link prediction methods.</description>

      <title>Beyond Asymptotics: Practical Insights into Community Detection in Complex Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stochastic block model (SBM) is a fundamental tool for community detection in networks, yet the finite-sample performance of inference methods remains underexplored. We evaluate key algorithms-spectral methods, variational inference, and Gibbs sampling-under varying conditions, including signal-to-noise ratios, heterogeneous community sizes, and multimodality. Our results highlight significant performance variations: spectral methods, especially SCORE, excel in computational efficiency and scalability, while Gibbs sampling dominates in small, well-separated networks. Variational Expectation-Maximization strikes a balance between accuracy and cost in larger networks but struggles with optimization in highly imbalanced settings. These findings underscore the practical trade-offs among methods and provide actionable guidance for algorithm selection in real-world applications. Our results also call for further theoretical investigation in SBMs with complex structures. The code can be found at https://github.com/Toby-X/SBM_computation.</description>

      <title>Training MLPs on Graphs without Supervision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated their effectiveness in various graph learning tasks, yet their reliance on neighborhood aggregation during inference poses challenges for deployment in latency-sensitive applications, such as real-time financial fraud detection. To address this limitation, recent studies have proposed distilling knowledge from teacher GNNs into student Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) trained on node content, aiming to accelerate inference. However, these approaches often inadequately explore structural information when inferring unseen nodes. To this end, we introduce SimMLP, a Self-supervised framework for learning MLPs on graphs, designed to fully integrate rich structural information into MLPs. Notably, SimMLP is the first MLP-learning method that can achieve equivalence to GNNs in the optimal case. The key idea is to employ self-supervised learning to align the representations encoded by graph context-aware GNNs and neighborhood dependency-free MLPs, thereby fully integrating the structural information into MLPs. We provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis, demonstrating the equivalence between SimMLP and GNNs based on mutual information and inductive bias, highlighting SimMLP's advanced structural learning capabilities. Additionally, we conduct extensive experiments on 20 benchmark datasets, covering node classification, link prediction, and graph classification, to showcase SimMLP's superiority over state-of-the-art baselines, particularly in scenarios involving unseen nodes (e.g., inductive and cold-start node classification) where structural insights are crucial. Our codes are available at: https://github.com/Zehong-Wang/SimMLP.</description>

      <title>Enabling Sustainable Urban Mobility: The Role of 5G Communication in the Mobilities for EU Project</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper examines the role of 5G communication in the Mobilities for EU project, a collaborative initiative involving 29 partners and 11 pilots aimed at revolutionizing urban mobility through electrification, automation, and connectivity. Focusing on Dresden as a Lead City, we explore the integration of 27 innovative solutions, including autonomous freight transport, eBuses, and charging robots, using a 5G communication network as the central framework. We analyze how 5G enables seamless connectivity and real-time data processing across diverse technologies, fostering interdependencies and synergies. This approach not only provides a cohesive understanding of the project's scope but also demonstrates 5G's critical role in smart city infrastructure. We evaluate the anticipated impact on sustainability metrics such as air quality, noise levels, CO2 emissions, and traffic congestion. The paper concludes by discussing challenges and strategies in leveraging 5G for comprehensive urban mobility solutions and its potential impact on future smart city developments.</description>

      <title>Finding polarised communities and tracking information diffusion on Twitter: The Irish Abortion Referendum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09196v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The analysis of social networks enables the understanding of social interactions, polarisation of ideas, and the spread of information and therefore plays an important role in society. We use Twitter data - as it is a popular venue for the expression of opinion and dissemination of information - to identify opposing sides of a debate and, importantly, to observe how information spreads between these groups in our current polarised climate.
  To achieve this, we collected over 688,000 Tweets from the Irish Abortion Referendum of 2018 to build a conversation network from users mentions with sentiment-based homophily. From this network, community detection methods allow us to isolate yes- or no-aligned supporters with high accuracy (90.9%). We supplement this by tracking how information cascades spread via over 31,000 retweet-cascades. We found that very little information spread between polarised communities. This provides a valuable methodology for extracting and studying information diffusion on large networks by isolating ideologically polarised groups and exploring the propagation of information within and between these groups.</description>

      <title>Network Formation and Dynamics Among Multi-LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10659v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Social networks fundamentally shape human opinions, behaviors, and the dissemination of information. As large language models (LLMs) like GPT, Claude, and Llama increasingly integrate into social and professional settings, understanding their behavior in the context of social interactions and network formation becomes essential. This study develops a framework to systematically examine whether the network formation behaviors of multiple LLMs approximate certain aspects of human network dynamics. By simulating interactions among LLM agents across various model families, we observe that these models consistently exhibit key patterns associated with social network principles including preferential attachment, triadic closure, homophily, community structure, and the small-world phenomenon when forming networks. Moreover, LLMs adapt their network formation strategies based on each network's characteristics, reflecting the context-dependent nature of human behavior: in Facebook networks, they prioritize triadic closure and homophily, mirroring close-knit friendships; in phone networks, homophily and preferential attachment dominate, capturing personal and professional connections, while in employment networks, LLMs favor heterophily and high-degree connections, aligning with career advancement dynamics. These results open new avenues for using LLMs in network science research, with potential applications in agent-based modeling and synthetic network generation.</description>

      <title>Influence Minimization via Blocking Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17488v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the influence minimization problem: given a graph $G$ and a seed set $S$, blocking at most $b$ nodes or $b$ edges such that the influence spread of the seed set is minimized. This is a pivotal yet underexplored aspect of network analytics, which can limit the spread of undesirable phenomena in networks, such as misinformation and epidemics. Given the inherent NP-hardness of the problem under the IC and LT models, previous studies have employed greedy algorithms and Monte Carlo Simulations for its resolution. However, existing techniques become cost-prohibitive when applied to large networks due to the necessity of enumerating all the candidate blockers and computing the decrease in expected spread from blocking each of them. This significantly restricts the practicality and effectiveness of existing methods, especially when prompt decision-making is crucial. In this paper, we propose the AdvancedGreedy algorithm, which utilizes a novel graph sampling technique that incorporates the dominator tree structure. We find that AdvancedGreedy can achieve a $(1-1/e-\epsilon)$-approximation in the problem under the LT model. Experimental evaluations on real-life networks reveal that our proposed algorithms exhibit a significant enhancement in efficiency, surpassing the state-of-the-art algorithm by three orders of magnitude, while achieving high effectiveness.</description>
