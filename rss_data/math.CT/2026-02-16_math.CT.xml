      <title>Parametrized equivalence relation on the global class of morphisms of a category and frame-theoretic examples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce an equivalence relation on the global class of morphisms of a category that extends several classical notions of equivalence in mathematics. We show that the standard group-action equivalence is a special case of our framework. A more interesting example is provided by an equivalence relation defined on the class of Bessel families and based on a coarse invariant that is the pointwise norm of the analysis operator of the Bessel family -- this is also a special case of our framework, and the formalism developed here can be seen as a first step toward a categorical invariant theory for Bessel families and continuous frames.</description>

      <title>Coalgebra measurings, cyclic theory and homologies of matrix algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider coalgebra measurings and the maps induced by them between Hochschild and cyclic homology of algebras. We show that these induced maps are well behaved with respect to the various structures appearing on Hochschild and cyclic homology, such as the $\lambda$-decomposition, the product structure, as well as the module structure of Hochschild homology over cyclic homology. Thereafter, we relate the maps between homology theories of algebras induced by a coalgebra measuring to those induced between homologies of matrix algebras. This is done in the following contexts: (a) cyclic homology and the primitive part of Lie algebra homology of the matrix algebra, (b) Hochschild homology and the primitive part of Leibniz homology of the matrix algebra, and (c) Dihedral homology of an involutive algebra and the primitive part of Lie algebra homology of symplectic or skew symmetric matrices.</description>

      <title>On the Kelly monoidal structure of $\Lambda$-sequences and unital operads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\Lambda$ be the category of based finite sets $\mathbf{n}$ and based injections. We study properties of monoids and modules in $\Lambda$-sequences under the Kelly monoidal structure. In particular, we show that the forgetful functor from right modules in $\Lambda$-sequences to right modules in symmetric sequences is an isomorphism. We show that any compatible lower data extends to a normal oplax monoidal structure and use this to establish a universal normal oplax monoidal structure on $\Lambda$-sequences extending the Kelly product, identifying unital operads to monoids in unital $\Lambda$-sequences for a general symmetric monoidal category $\mathscr{V}$. We also establish a closed monoidal localization theorem.</description>

      <title>The monoidal structure of the category of partial representations of finite groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we analyze the structure of the category of partial representations of a finite group $G$ as a multifusion category, providing an alternative way to describe simple objects and their tensor products. We describe the interconnection between the category of partial representations of a finite group and the category of global representations of its subgroups (the Christmas Tree's Theorem). Also, for a finite abelian group $G$, we prove that the category of partial representations of any of its subgroups can be embedded into the category of partial representations of $G$ (the Matryoshka's Theorem).</description>

      <title>Relativized universal algebra via partial Horn logic</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19661v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Algebraic theories, sometimes called equational theories, are syntactic notions given by finitary operations and equations, such as monoids, groups, and rings. There is a well-known category-theoretic treatment of them that algebraic theories are equivalent to finitary monads on $\mathbf{Set}$. In this paper, using partial Horn theories, we syntactically generalize such an equivalence to arbitrary locally presentable categories from $\mathbf{Set}$; the corresponding algebraic concepts relative to locally presentable categories are called relative algebraic theories. Finally, we give a framework for universal algebra relative to locally presentable categories by generalizing Birkhoff's variety theorem.</description>

      <title>Convergence of martingales via enriched dagger categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15191v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a categorical proof of convergence for martingales and backward martingales in mean, using enriched category theory. The enrichment we use is in topological spaces, with their canonical closed monoidal structure, which encodes a version of pointwise convergence.
  We work in a topologically enriched dagger category of probability spaces and Markov kernels up to almost sure equality. In this category we can describe conditional expectations exactly as dagger-split idempotent morphisms, and filtrations can be encoded as directed nets of split idempotents, with their canonical partial order structure. As we show, every increasing (or decreasing) net of idempotents tends topologically to its supremum (or infimum).
  Random variables on a probability space form contravariant functors into categories of Hilbert and Banach spaces, which we can enrich topologically using the L^p norms. Martingales and backward martingales can be defined in terms of these functors. Since enriched functors preserve convergence of nets, we obtain convergence in the L^p norms. The convergence result for backward martingales indexed by an arbitrary net, in particular, seems to be new.
  By changing the functor, one can describe more general notions of conditional expectations and martingales, and if the functor is enriched, one automatically obtains a convergence result. For instance, one can recover the Bochner-based notion of vector-valued conditional expectation, and the convergence of martingales with values in an arbitrary Banach space.
  This work seems to be the first application of topologically enriched categories to analysis and probability in the literature. We hope that this enrichment, so often overlooked in the past, will be used in the future to obtain further convergence results categorically.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic tensor products and a Ganea-type extension of the five-term exact sequence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03951v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish a right-exactness theorem for the cross-effects of bifunctors, and consequently for cosmash products, in Janelidze-M\'arki-Tholen semi-abelian categories. This result motivates an intrinsic definition of a symmetric bilinear, actually bi-right exact and for varieties even bi-cocontinuous product, a tensor-like operation on objects of a category, constructed in terms of limits and colimits. Given two objects in the category, their bilinear product is the abelian object obtained as the cosmash product in the category of two-nilpotent objects of the reflections of these objects. In many concrete cases, this operation, applied to a pair of abelian objects, captures a classical tensor product. We explain this by proving a recognition theorem, which states that any symmetric, bi-cocontinuous bifunctor on an abelian variety of algebras can be recovered as the bilinear product within a suitable semi-abelian variety, namely of algebras over a certain 2-nilpotent symmetric operad. In other words, the extra structure carried by such a bifunctor on the abelian variety (for instance, a tensor product, known in the literature) is encoded by means of a surrounding semi-abelian variety whose abelian core is the original variety.
  We illustrate the construction with several examples, develop its basic properties, and compare it to the semi-abelian analogue of the Brown-Loday non-abelian tensor product. As an application, we present a categorical version of Ganea's six-term exact homology sequence. Finally, we characterise abelian extensions via internal action cores, yielding explicit descriptions of cosmash products and bilinear products in certain categories of representations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.09780v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of 'centre' for pomonoid-graded strong monads which generalizes some previous work that describes the centre of (not graded) strong monads. We show that, whenever the centre exists, this determines a pomonoid-graded commutative submonad of the original one. We also discuss how this relates to duoidally-graded strong monads.</description>

      <title>A category of quantum posets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2101.11184v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a category of quantum posets that generalizes the category of posets and monotone functions. Up to equivalence, its objects are hereditarily atomic von Neumann algebras equipped with quantum partial orders in Weaver's sense. We show that this category is complete, cocomplete and symmetric monoidal closed. As a consequence, any discrete quantum family of maps in So{\l}tan's sense from a discrete quantum space to a partially ordered set is canonically equipped with quantum preorder in Weaver's sense. In particular, the quantum power set of a quantum set is so ordered. As an application, we show that each quantum poset embeds into its quantum power set.</description>

      <title>Exact Structures and Purity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19952v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We relate the theory of purity of a locally finitely presented category with products to the study of exact structures on the full subcategory of finitely presented objects. Properties in the context of purity are translated to properties about exact structures. We specialize to the case of a module category over an Artin algebra and show that generic modules are in one to one correspondence with particular maximal exact structures.</description>
