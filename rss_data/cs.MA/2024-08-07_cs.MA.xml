      <title>Combining Diverse Information for Coordinated Action: Stochastic Bandit Algorithms for Heterogeneous Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic multi-agent multi-armed bandits typically assume that the rewards from each arm follow a fixed distribution, regardless of which agent pulls the arm. However, in many real-world settings, rewards can depend on the sensitivity of each agent to their environment. In medical screening, disease detection rates can vary by test type; in preference matching, rewards can depend on user preferences; and in environmental sensing, observation quality can vary across sensors. Since past work does not specify how to allocate agents of heterogeneous but known sensitivity of these types in a stochastic bandit setting, we introduce a UCB-style algorithm, Min-Width, which aggregates information from diverse agents. In doing so, we address the joint challenges of (i) aggregating the rewards, which follow different distributions for each agent-arm pair, and (ii) coordinating the assignments of agents to arms. Min-Width facilitates efficient collaboration among heterogeneous agents, exploiting the known structure in the agents' reward functions to weight their rewards accordingly. We analyze the regret of Min-Width and conduct pseudo-synthetic and fully synthetic experiments to study the performance of different levels of information sharing. Our results confirm that the gains to modeling agent heterogeneity tend to be greater when the sensitivities are more varied across agents, while combining more information does not always improve performance.</description>

      <title>Asynchronous Credit Assignment Framework for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Credit assignment is a core problem that distinguishes agents' marginal contributions for optimizing cooperative strategies in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). Current credit assignment methods usually assume synchronous decision-making among agents. However, a prerequisite for many realistic cooperative tasks is asynchronous decision-making by agents, without waiting for others to avoid disastrous consequences. To address this issue, we propose an asynchronous credit assignment framework with a problem model called ADEX-POMDP and a multiplicative value decomposition (MVD) algorithm. ADEX-POMDP is an asynchronous problem model with extra virtual agents for a decentralized partially observable markov decision process. We prove that ADEX-POMDP preserves both the task equilibrium and the algorithm convergence. MVD utilizes multiplicative interaction to efficiently capture the interactions of asynchronous decisions, and we theoretically demonstrate its advantages in handling asynchronous tasks. Experimental results show that on two asynchronous decision-making benchmarks, Overcooked and POAC, MVD not only consistently outperforms state-of-the-art MARL methods but also provides the interpretability for asynchronous cooperation.</description>

      <title>Quantum Computing and Neuromorphic Computing for Safe, Reliable, and explainable Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning: Optimal Control in Autonomous Robotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03884</link>

Abstract: This paper investigates the utilization of Quantum Computing and Neuromorphic Computing for Safe, Reliable, and Explainable Multi_Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) in the context of optimal control in autonomous robotics. The objective was to address the challenges of optimizing the behavior of autonomous agents while ensuring safety, reliability, and explainability. Quantum Computing techniques, including Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), were employed to efficiently explore large solution spaces and find approximate solutions to complex MARL problems. Neuromorphic Computing, inspired by the architecture of the human brain, provided parallel and distributed processing capabilities, which were leveraged to develop intelligent and adaptive systems. The combination of these technologies held the potential to enhance the safety, reliability, and explainability of MARL in autonomous robotics. This research contributed to the advancement of autonomous robotics by exploring cutting-edge technologies and their applications in multi-agent systems. Codes and data are available.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Moral Behavior in Heterogeneous Populations of Learning Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04202v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Growing concerns about safety and alignment of AI systems highlight the importance of embedding moral capabilities in artificial agents: a promising solution is the use of learning from experience, i.e., Reinforcement Learning. In multi-agent (social) environments, complex population-level phenomena may emerge from interactions between individual learning agents. Many of the existing studies rely on simulated social dilemma environments to study the interactions of independent learning agents; however, they tend to ignore the moral heterogeneity that is likely to be present in societies of agents in practice. For example, at different points in time a single learning agent may face opponents who are consequentialist (i.e., focused on maximizing outcomes over time), norm-based (i.e., conforming to specific norms), or virtue-based (i.e., considering a combination of different virtues). The extent to which agents' co-development may be impacted by such moral heterogeneity in populations is not well understood. In this paper, we present a study of the learning dynamics of morally heterogeneous populations interacting in a social dilemma setting. Using an Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma environment with a partner selection mechanism, we investigate the extent to which the prevalence of diverse moral agents in populations affects individual agents' learning behaviors and emergent population-level outcomes. We observe several types of non-trivial interactions between pro-social and anti-social agents, and find that certain types of moral agents are able to steer selfish agents towards more cooperative behavior.</description>

      <title>A Simulation Environment for the Neuroevolution of Ant Colony Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13147v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a simulation environment to facilitate research into emergent collective behaviour, with a focus on replicating the dynamics of ant colonies. By leveraging real-world data, the environment simulates a target ant trail that a controllable agent must learn to replicate, using sensory data observed by the target ant. This work aims to contribute to the neuroevolution of models for collective behaviour, focusing on evolving neural architectures that encode domain-specific behaviours in the network topology. By evolving models that can be modified and studied in a controlled environment, we can uncover the necessary conditions required for collective behaviours to emerge. We hope this environment will be useful to those studying the role of interactions in emergent behaviour within collective systems.</description>

      <title>Identification of LFT Structured Descriptor Systems with Slow and Non-uniform Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00629v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time domain identification is studied in this paper for parameters of a continuous-time multi-input multi-output descriptor system, with these parameters affecting system matrices through a linear fractional transformation. Sampling is permitted to be slow and non-uniform, and there are no necessities to satisfy the Nyquist frequency restrictions. This model can be used to described the behaviors of a networked dynamic system, and the obtained results can be straightforwardly applied to an ordinary state-space model, as well as a lumped system. An explicit formula is obtained respectively for the transient and steady-state responses of the system stimulated by an arbitrary signal. Some relations have been derived between the system steady-state response and its transfer function matrix (TFM), which reveal that the value of a TFM at any interested point, as well as its derivatives, can in principle be estimated from input-output experimental data. Based on these relations, an estimation algorithm is suggested respectively for the parameters of the descriptor system and the values of its TFM. Their properties like asymptotic unbiasedness, consistency, etc., are analyzed.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning Aided Sequential Optimization for Unsignalized Intersection Management of Robot Traffic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.05082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.05082v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of optimal unsignalized intersection management, wherein we seek to obtain safe and optimal trajectories, for a set of robots that arrive randomly and continually. This problem involves repeatedly solving a mixed integer program (with robot acceleration trajectories as decision variables) with different parameters, for which the computation time using a naive optimization algorithm scales exponentially with the number of robots and lanes. Hence, such an approach is not suitable for real-time implementation. In this paper, we propose a solution framework that combines learning and sequential optimization. In particular, we propose an algorithm for learning a shared policy that given the traffic state information, determines the crossing order of the robots. Then, we optimize the trajectories of the robots sequentially according to that crossing order. This approach inherently guarantees safety at all times. We validate the performance of this approach using extensive simulations and compare our approach against $5$ different heuristics from the literature in $9$ different simulation settings. Our approach, on average, significantly outperforms the heuristics from the literature in various metrics like objective function, weighted average of crossing times and computation time. For example, in some scenarios, we have observed that our approach offers up to $150\%$ improvement in objective value over the first come first serve heuristic. Even on untrained scenarios, our approach shows a consistent improvement (in objective value) of more than $30\%$ over all heuristics under consideration. We also show through simulations that the computation time for our approach scales linearly with the number of robots (assuming all other factors are constant). Learnt policies are implemented on physical robots with slightly modified framework to address real-world challenges.</description>

      <title>Component reusability evaluation and requirement tracing for agent-based simulation-physical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.09565v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the early stages of product development, evaluating design concepts is crucial due to its impact on quality and cost. However, this process is often hindered by vague and uncertain design information. We use the Domain Specification Language (DSL) to improve design analysis and evaluation of systems incorporating simulation and physical parts. '
  Goal: Our method evaluates the integrity between the simulated and physical embodiment of the system. The assessment is done in various scopes, e.g. per pair of Digital Twins (DT) and its physical counterpart- Physical Twin (PT), system-wide, or one of many system setups.
  Method: We propose a DSL based on Systems Modeling Language (SysML). The Simulation-Physical Systems Modeling Language (SPSysML) defines the taxonomy of CPS consisting of at least a physical or simulated part. Based on SPSysML, we define quantitative factors and a requirement-based system structuring method, which enhances requirement analysis and allows DT to perceive exogenous actions in the simulated world.
  Result: SPSysML is used to develop a robotic system for the INCARE project. In subsequent iterations of the system's design process, the simulation-physical integrity of the system is improved, and more system components is shared between its simulated and physical embodiments. The designed system was deployed on the physical robot and two simulators. System setups are based on Robot Operating System (ROS) and ROS2. Therefore, we argue that SPSysML is neither specific for a control system framework nor a robot simulator. SPSysML was used by a third-party developer and was assessed by him and other practitioners in a survey.
  Summary: SPSysML allows the design of systems featuring DTs and evaluation for improved integrity between simulation and physical parts. The requirement-based system structuring enhances the traceability of system requirements allocation.</description>
