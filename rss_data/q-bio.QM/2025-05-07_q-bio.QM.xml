      <title>Leveraging Protein Language Model Embeddings for Catalytic Turnover Prediction of Adenylate Kinase Orthologs in a Low-Data Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of enzymatic activity from amino acid sequences could drastically accelerate enzyme engineering for applications such as bioremediation and therapeutics development. In recent years, Protein Language Model (PLM) embeddings have been increasingly leveraged as the input into sequence-to-function models. Here, we use consistently collected catalytic turnover observations for 175 orthologs of the enzyme Adenylate Kinase (ADK) as a test case to assess the use of PLMs and their embeddings in enzyme kinetic prediction tasks. In this study, we show that nonlinear probing of PLM embeddings outperforms baseline embeddings (one-hot-encoding) and the specialized $k_{cat}$ (catalytic turnover number) prediction models DLKcat and CatPred. We also compared fixed and learnable aggregation of PLM embeddings for $k_{cat}$ prediction and found that transformer-based learnable aggregation of amino-acid PLM embeddings is generally the most performant. Additionally, we found that ESMC 600M embeddings marginally outperform other PLM embeddings for $k_{cat}$ prediction. We explored Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) masked language model fine-tuning and direct fine-tuning for sequence-to-$k_{cat}$ mapping, where we found no difference or a drop in performance compared to zero-shot embeddings, respectively. And we investigated the distinct hidden representations in PLM encoders and found that earlier layer embeddings perform comparable to or worse than the final layer. Overall, this study assesses the state of the field for leveraging PLMs for sequence-to-$k_{cat}$ prediction on a set of diverse ADK orthologs.</description>

      <title>Multiscale Parallel Simulation of Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma via Adaptive Domain Partitioning -- an Efficiency Analysis Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A novel parallel efficiency analysis on a framework for simulating the growth of Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma (MPM) tumours is presented. Proliferation of MPM tumours in the pleural space is simulated using a Cellular Potts Model (CPM) coupled with partial differential equations (PDEs). Using segmented lung data from CT scans, an environment is set up with artificial tumour data in the pleural space, representing the simulation domain, onto which a dynamic bounding box is applied to restrict computations to the region of interest, dramatically reducing memory and CPU overhead. This adaptive partitioning of the domain enables efficient use of computational resources by reducing the three-dimensional (3D) domain over which the PDEs are to be solved. The PDEs, representing oxygen, nutrients, and cytokines, are solved using the finite-volume method with a first-order implicit Euler scheme. Parallelization is realized using the public Python library mpi4py in combination with LinearGMRESSolver and PETSc for efficient convergence. Performance analyses have shown that parallelization achieves a reduced solving time compared to serial computation. Also, optimizations enable efficient use of available memory and improved load balancing amongst the cores.</description>

      <title>Nonparametric learning of covariate-based Markov jump processes using RKHS techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel nonparametric approach for linking covariates to Continuous Time Markov Chains (CTMCs) using the mathematical framework of Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHS). CTMCs provide a robust framework for modeling transitions across clinical or behavioral states, but traditional multistate models often rely on linear relationships. In contrast, we use a generalized Representer Theorem to enable tractable inference in functional space. For the Frequentist version, we apply normed square penalties, while for the Bayesian version, we explore sparsity inducing spike and slab priors. Due to the computational challenges posed by high-dimensional spaces, we successfully adapt the Expectation Maximization Variable Selection (EMVS) algorithm to efficiently identify the posterior mode. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through extensive simulation studies and an application to follicular cell lymphoma data. Our performance metrics include the normalized difference between estimated and true nonlinear transition functions, as well as the difference in the probability of getting absorbed in one the final states, capturing the ability of our approach to predict long-term behaviors.</description>

      <title>A Symbolic and Statistical Learning Framework to Discover Bioprocessing Regulatory Mechanism: Cell Culture Example</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bioprocess mechanistic modeling is essential for advancing intelligent digital twin representation of biomanufacturing, yet challenges persist due to complex intracellular regulation, stochastic system behavior, and limited experimental data. This paper introduces a symbolic and statistical learning framework to identify key regulatory mechanisms and quantify model uncertainty. Bioprocess dynamics is formulated with stochastic differential equations characterizing intrinsic process variability, with a predefined set of candidate regulatory mechanisms constructed from biological knowledge. A Bayesian learning approach is developed, which is based on a joint learning of kinetic parameters and regulatory structure through a formulation of the mixture model. To enhance computational efficiency, a Metropolis-adjusted Langevin algorithm with adjoint sensitivity analysis is developed for posterior exploration. Compared to state-of-the-art Bayesian inference approaches, the proposed framework achieves improved sample efficiency and robust model selection. An empirical study demonstrates its ability to recover missing regulatory mechanisms and improve model fidelity under data-limited conditions.</description>

      <title>The classification of Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment improved by dynamic functional network analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Brain network analysis using functional MRI has advanced our understanding of cortical activity and its changes in neurodegenerative disorders that cause dementia. Recently, research in brain connectivity has focused on dynamic (time-varying) brain networks that capture both spatial and temporal information on cortical, regional co-activity patterns. However, this approach has been largely unexplored within the Alzheimer's spectrum. We analysed age- and sex-matched static and dynamic fMRI brain networks from 315 individuals with Alzheimer's Disease (AD), Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), and cognitively-normal Healthy Elderly (HE), using data from the ADNI-3 protocol. We examined both similarities and differences between these groups, employing the Juelich brain atlas for network nodes, sliding-window correlations for time-varying network links, and non-parametric statistics to assess between-group differences at the link or the node centrality level. While the HE and MCI groups show similar static and dynamic networks at the link level, significant differences emerge compared to AD participants. We found stable (stationary) differences in patterns of functional connections between the white matter regions and the parietal lobe's, and somatosensory cortices, while metastable (temporal) networks' differences were consistently found between the amygdala and hippocampal formation. In addition, our node centrality analysis showed that the white matter connectivity patterns are local in nature. Our results highlight shared and unique functional connectivity patterns in both stationary and dynamic functional networks, emphasising the need to include dynamic information in brain network analysis in studies of Alzheimer's spectrum.</description>

      <title>Mitigating mode collapse in normalizing flows by annealing with an adaptive schedule: Application to parameter estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Normalizing flows (NFs) provide uncorrelated samples from complex distributions, making them an appealing tool for parameter estimation. However, the practical utility of NFs remains limited by their tendency to collapse to a single mode of a multimodal distribution. In this study, we show that annealing with an adaptive schedule based on the effective sample size (ESS) can mitigate mode collapse. We demonstrate that our approach can converge the marginal likelihood for a biochemical oscillator model fit to time-series data in ten-fold less computation time than a widely used ensemble Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. We show that the ESS can also be used to reduce variance by pruning the samples. We expect these developments to be of general use for sampling with NFs and discuss potential opportunities for further improvements.</description>

      <title>MAMMAL -- Molecular Aligned Multi-Modal Architecture and Language</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22367v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models applied to vast biological datasets have the potential to transform biology by uncovering disease mechanisms and accelerating drug development. However, current models are often siloed, trained separately on small-molecules, proteins, or transcriptomic data, limiting their ability to capture complex, multi-modal interactions. Effective drug discovery requires computational tools that integrate multiple biological entities while supporting prediction and generation, a challenge existing models struggle to address. For this purpose, we present MAMMAL - Molecular Aligned Multi-Modal Architecture and Language - a versatile method applied to create a multi-task foundation model that learns from large-scale biological datasets across diverse modalities, including proteins, small-molecules, and omics. MAMMAL's structured prompt syntax supports classification, regression, and generation tasks while handling token and scalar inputs and outputs. Evaluated on eleven diverse downstream tasks, it reaches a new state of the art (SOTA) in nine tasks and is comparable to SOTA in two tasks, all within a unified architecture, unlike prior task-specific models. Additionally, we explored Alphafold 3 binding prediction capabilities on antibody-antigen and nanobody-antigen complexes showing significantly better classification performance of MAMMAL in 3 out of 4 targets.

      <title>Logistic Regression Analysis on the Dietary Behavior and the Risk of Nutritional Deficiency Dermatosis: The Case of Bicol Region, Philippines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00063v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study explores the link between dietary behavior and the risk of nutritional deficiency dermatoses (NDD) in the Bicol region, where malnutrition remains a concern. Using regression analysis on FNRI data, it examines food purchase patterns, particularly riboflavin intake. Findings show an NDD risk prevalence of 15.75%, with Masbate and Camarines Sur contributing over half of cases. While rice (1590.93 g/day) and plant-based diets (523.30 g/day) are not rich in riboflavin, they still reduce NDD odds by 0.3% per gram. Riboflavin-rich foods like meat, eggs, and dairy lower risks by up to 3% per gram. The logistic regression model demonstrated strong performance (Nagelkerke = 0.765, accuracy = 94.1%, precision = 84.5%). Findings highlight the need for nutrition interventions, including enriched rice, better market access, and food diversity education to improve riboflavin intake and mitigate NDD risks.</description>
