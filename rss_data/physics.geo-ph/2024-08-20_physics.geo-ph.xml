      <title>Propagating the prior from shallow to deep with a pre-trained velocity-model Generative Transformer network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building subsurface velocity models is essential to our goals in utilizing seismic data for Earth discovery and exploration, as well as monitoring. With the dawn of machine learning, these velocity models (or, more precisely, their distribution) can be stored accurately and efficiently in a generative model. These stored velocity model distributions can be utilized to regularize or quantify uncertainties in inverse problems, like full waveform inversion. However, most generators, like normalizing flows or diffusion models, treat the image (velocity model) uniformly, disregarding spatial dependencies and resolution changes with respect to the observation locations. To address this weakness, we introduce VelocityGPT, a novel implementation that utilizes Transformer decoders trained autoregressively to generate a velocity model from shallow subsurface to deep. Owing to the fact that seismic data are often recorded on the Earth's surface, a top-down generator can utilize the inverted information in the shallow as guidance (prior) to generating the deep. To facilitate the implementation, we use an additional network to compress the velocity model. We also inject prior information, like well or structure (represented by a migration image) to generate the velocity model. Using synthetic data, we demonstrate the effectiveness of VelocityGPT as a promising approach in generative model applications for seismic velocity model building.</description>

      <title>Conditional Image Prior for Uncertainty Quantification in Full Waveform Inversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Full Waveform Inversion (FWI) is a technique employed to attain a high resolution subsurface velocity model. However, FWI results are effected by the limited illumination of the model domain and the quality of that illumination, which is related to the quality of the data. Additionally, the high computational cost of FWI, compounded by the high dimensional nature of the model space, complicates the evaluation of model uncertainties. Recent work on applying neural networks to represent the velocity model for FWI demonstrated the network's ability to capture the salient features of the velocity model. The question we ask here is how reliable are these features in representing the observed data contribution within the model space (the posterior distribution). To address this question, we propose leveraging a conditional Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) as image prior to quantify the neural network uncertainties. Specifically, we add to the deep image prior concept a conditional channel, enabling the generation of various models corresponding to the specified condition. We initially train the conditional CNN to learn (store) samples from the prior distribution given by Gaussian Random Fields (GRF) based perturbations of the current velocity model. Subsequently, we use FWI to update the CNN model representation of the priors so that it can generate samples from the posterior distribution. These samples can be used to measure the approximate mean and standard deviation of the posterior distribution, as well as draw samples representing the posterior distribution. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on the Marmousi model and in a field data application.</description>

      <title>Optically pumped vector magnetometer using a strong bias magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel approach allowing an optically pumped magnetometer (OPM) to be operated within Earth's magnetic field as a vector magnetometer whose sensitive axis can be freely defined. This approach enables the measurement of any vector component of the Earth's magnetic field with the same sensitivity. The OPM is realized by a microfabricated cesium vapor cell with nitrogen buffer gas, which is immersed into a homogeneous bias field of about 730 $\mathrm{\mu T}$. Since this bias field is about one order of magnitude stronger than Earth's magnetic field, it defines the sensitive axis of the OPM. The bias field is generated by solid-state magnets and was designed to exhibit a very low relative inhomogeneity ($&lt; 10^{-4}$ in relative units) within the vapor cell dimensions as well as a point of vanishing temperature dependence at around 40{\deg}C. The OPM utilizes the light narrowing effect, which enables effective suppression of spin-exchange relaxation even in such large magnetic field amplitude. Based on this implementation, we demonstrate a white noise floor of below 60 $\mathrm{fT/\sqrt{Hz}}$ in the interval between 100 Hz and 600 Hz and a sensor bandwidth of $&gt; 2$ kHz. Our approach enables unshielded ultrasensitive vectorial measurement capabilities relevant in many important applications.</description>

      <title>Three-stage Formation of Cap Carbonates after Marinoan Snowball Glaciation Consistent with Depositional Timescales and Geochemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: At least two global "Snowball Earth" glaciations occurred during the Neoproterozoic Era (1000-538.8 million years ago). Post-glacial surface environments during this time are recorded in cap carbonates: layers of limestone or dolostone that directly overlie glacial deposits. Postulated environmental conditions that created the cap carbonates lack consensus largely because single hypotheses fail to explain the cap carbonates' global mass, depositional timescales, and geochemistry of parent waters. Here, we present a global geologic carbon cycle model before, during, and after the second glaciation (i.e. the Marinoan) that explains cap carbonate characteristics. We find a three-stage process for cap carbonate formation: (1) low-temperature seafloor weathering during glaciation generates deep-sea alkalinity; (2) vigorous post-glacial continental weathering supplies alkalinity to a carbonate-saturated freshwater layer, rapidly precipitating cap carbonates; (3) mixing of post-glacial meltwater with deep-sea alkalinity prolongs cap carbonate deposition. We suggest how future geochemical data and modeling refinements could further assess our hypothesis.</description>

      <title>PRIME-DP: Pre-trained Integrated Model for Earthquake Data Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01919v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel seismic wave representation model, namely PRIME-DP (Pre-trained Integrated Model for Earthquake Data Processing), specifically designed for processing seismic waveforms. Most existing models are designed to solve a singular problem. Unlike these models, PRIME-DP is capable of multi-task single station seismic waveform processing, including Pg/Sg/Pn/Sn phase picking and P polarization classification. Moreover, it can be fine-tunned to various tasks, such as event classification without architecture modifications. PRIME-DP can achieve a recall rate of over 85% for Pg and Sg phases on continuous waveforms and achieves over 80% accuracy in P polarization classification. By fine-tuning classification decoder with NeiMeng dataset, PRIME-DP achieves 95.1% accuracy on event.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional ideal magnetohydrodynamic waves on a rotating sphere under a non-Malkus field: I. Continuous spectrum and its ray-theoretical interpretation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.01341v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional ideal incompressible magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) linear waves at the surface of a rotating sphere are studied as a model to imitate the outermost layer of the Earth's core or the solar tachocline. This thin conducting layer is permeated by a toroidal magnetic field the magnitude of which depends only on the latitude. The Malkus background field, which is proportional to the sine of the colatitude, provides two well-known groups of branches; on one branch, retrograde Alfv\'en waves gradually become fast magnetic Rossby (MR) waves as the field amplitude decreases, and on the other, prograde Alfv\'en waves undergo a gradual transition into slow MR waves. In the case of non-Malkus fields, we demonstrate that the associated eigenvalue problems can yield a continuous spectrum instead of Alfv\'en and slow MR discrete modes. The critical latitudes attributed to the Alfv\'en resonance eliminate these discrete eigenvalues and produce an infinite number of singular eigenmodes. The theory of slowly varying wave trains in an inhomogeneous magnetic field shows that a wave packet related to this continuous spectrum propagates toward a critical latitude corresponding to the wave and is eventually absorbed there. The expected behaviour whereby the retrograde propagating packets pertaining to the continuous spectrum approach the latitudes from the equatorial side and the prograde ones approach from the polar side is consistent with the profiles of their eigenfunctions derived using our numerical calculations. Further in-depth discussions of the Alfv\'en continuum would develop the theory of the ``wave-mean field interaction'' in the MHD system and the understanding of the dynamics in such thin layers.</description>

      <title>Machine learning for climate physics and simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13227v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the emerging advances and opportunities at the intersection of machine learning (ML) and climate physics, highlighting the use of ML techniques, including supervised, unsupervised, and equation discovery, to accelerate climate knowledge discoveries and simulations. We delineate two distinct yet complementary aspects: (1) ML for climate physics and (2) ML for climate simulations. While physics-free ML-based models, such as ML-based weather forecasting, have demonstrated success when data is abundant and stationary, the physics knowledge and interpretability of ML models become crucial in the small-data/non-stationary regime to ensure generalizability. Given the absence of observations, the long-term future climate falls into the small-data regime. Therefore, ML for climate physics holds a critical role in addressing the challenges of ML for climate simulations. We emphasize the need for collaboration among climate physics, ML theory, and numerical analysis to achieve reliable ML-based models for climate applications.</description>

      <title>ORBIT: Oak Ridge Base Foundation Model for Earth System Predictability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14712v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Earth system predictability is challenged by the complexity of environmental dynamics and the multitude of variables involved. Current AI foundation models, although advanced by leveraging large and heterogeneous data, are often constrained by their size and data integration, limiting their effectiveness in addressing the full range of Earth system prediction challenges. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Oak Ridge Base Foundation Model for Earth System Predictability (ORBIT), an advanced vision transformer model that scales up to 113 billion parameters using a novel hybrid tensor-data orthogonal parallelism technique. As the largest model of its kind, ORBIT surpasses the current climate AI foundation model size by a thousandfold. Performance scaling tests conducted on the Frontier supercomputer have demonstrated that ORBIT achieves 684 petaFLOPS to 1.6 exaFLOPS sustained throughput, with scaling efficiency maintained at 41% to 85% across 49,152 AMD GPUs. These breakthroughs establish new advances in AI-driven climate modeling and demonstrate promise to significantly improve the Earth system predictability.</description>
