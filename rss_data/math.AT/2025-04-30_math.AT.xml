      <title>Computation of the Nielsen fixed point number for 2-valued non-split maps on the Klein bottle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study 2-valued non-split maps, focusing on the Klein bottle. We establish a connection between a 2-valued non-split map $\phi:X\multimap Y$ and a pair of classes of maps $([f],[f\circ \delta])\in [\tilde X,Y]\times[\tilde X, Y]$, where $\delta$ is a free involution on $\tilde X$, $X=\tilde X/\delta$ and the class of the lift factor $[f]$ does not satisfy the Borsuk-Ulam Property in respect to $\delta$. We also exhibit a method to compute the Nielsen fixed point number of a 2-valued non-split map on a closed connected manifold in terms of the Nielsen coincidence number between a lift factor and a covering space map, generalizing the formula from only orientable manifolds to also non-orientable manifolds. Finally we display a formula for the Nielsen fixed point number of 2-valued non-split maps on the Klein bottle in terms of two braids of the Klein bottle.</description>

      <title>Pontryagin-Weiss classes and a rational decomposition of spaces of homeomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a rational homotopy pullback decomposition for variants of the classifying space of the group of homeomorphisms for a large class of manifolds. This has various applications, including a rational splitting of the stabilisation map ${\rm Top}(d)\rightarrow {\rm Top}$ of the space of homeomorphisms of ${\bf R}^d$ for $d\ge 6$, or a new method to construct topological bundles and detect characteristic classes thereof. Some steps in the proofs may be of independent interest, such as the construction of a nullhomotopy of the twice-iterated stabilisation map for the space of orientation-preserving derived automorphisms of the rational $E_d$-operad, results on recovering boundaries of manifolds from the interior in the context of embedding calculus, or a treatment of tensor products of truncated $\infty$-operads.</description>

      <title>Monoidal Relative Categories Model Monoidal $\infty$-Categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the homotopy theory of monoidal relative categories is equivalent to that of monoidal $\infty$-categories, as well as its symmetric monoidal version. As an application, we give a concise and complete proof of the fact that every presentably monoidal or presentably symmetric monoidal $\infty$-category is presented by a monoidal or symmetric monoidal model category, which, in the monoidal case, was sketched by Lurie, and in the symmetric monoidal case, was proved by Nikolaus--Sagave.</description>

      <title>Magnitude homology of geodesic space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.07044</link>
      <description>arXiv:1902.07044v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the magnitude homology groups of geodesic metric spaces. We start with a description of the second magnitude homology of a general metric space in terms of the zeroth homology groups of certain simplicial complexes. Then, on a geodesic metric space, we interpret the description by means of geodesics. The third magnitude homology of a geodesic metric space also admits a description in terms of a simplicial complex. Under an assumption on a metric space, the simplicial description allows us to introduce an invariant of third magnitude homology classes as an intersection number. Finally, we provide a complete description of all the magnitude homology groups of a geodesic metric space which fulfils a certain non-branching assumption.</description>

      <title>Sphere bundles over $4$-manifolds are trivial after looping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.17352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.17352v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that except two special cases, the sphere bundle of a vector bundle over a simply connected $4$-manifold splits after looping. In particular, this implies that though there are infinitely many inequivalent sphere bundles of a given rank over a $4$-manifold, the loop spaces of their total manifolds are all homotopy equivalent.</description>

      <title>Boundary framings for locally conformally symplectic four-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05983v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a rational homotopy-theoretic model for a classifying space of locally conformally symplectic structures on four-manifolds, and use it to definition a cobordism category of three-manifolds `anchored' by principal $\Omega^2 S^2$ - bundles ($\S2$, generalizing contact structures). Powerful $sl_2$ - representation-valued Hodge-Lefschetz cohomology (going back to Chern and Weil), taking values in the $\mathbb{Z}$-graded category of bidifferential modules of Angella, Otiman, and Tardini is available for its study.
  This is an extended revision with a detailed introduction replacing the final section. The original concern of the paper was a characteristic two issue which remains unchanged.</description>

      <title>Deconstructing Auslander's formulas, I. Fundamental sequences associated with additive functors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14097v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For any additive functor from modules (or, more generally, from an abelian category with enough projectives or injectives), we construct long sequences tying up together the derived functors, the satellites, and the stabilizations of the functor. For half-exact functors, the obtained sequences are exact. For general functors, nontrivial homology may only appear at the derived functors. Specializing to the familiar Hom and tensor product functors on finitely presented modules, we recover the classical formulas of Auslander. Unlike those formulas, our results hold for arbitrary rings and arbitrary modules, finite or infinite. The same formalism leads to universal coefficient theorems for homology and cohomology of arbitrary complexes. The new results are even more explicit for the cohomology of projective complexes and the homology of flat complexes.</description>

      <title>Grassmannian Persistence Diagrams: Special Properties in the 1-Parameter Setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06077v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the discriminative power of Grassmannian persistence diagrams of 1-parameter filtrations, examine their relationships with other related constructions, and study their computational aspects. Grassmannian persistence diagrams are defined through Orthogonal Inversion, a notion analogous to M\"obius inversion. We focus on the behavior of this inversion for the poset of segments of a linear poset. We demonstrate how Grassmannian persistence diagrams of 1-parameter filtrations are connected to persistent Laplacians via a variant of orthogonal inversion tailored for the reverse-inclusion order on the poset of segments. Additionally, we establish an explicit isomorphism between Grassmannian persistence diagrams and Harmonic Barcodes via a projection. Finally, we show that degree-0 Grassmannian persistence diagrams are equivalent to treegrams, a generalization of dendrograms. Consequently, we conclude that finite ultrametric spaces can be recovered from the degree-0 Grassmannian persistence diagram of their Vietoris-Rips filtrations.</description>
