      <title>Edge Inversions in $(P_k)$-closed Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct $(P_2)$-closed groups acting on $T_3$ in which all edge inversions have infinite order. This provides a negative answer to a question posed by Tornier. We also construct a family of $(P_2)$-closed groups for which the smallest order of an edge inversion is an arbitrarily high finite number.</description>

      <title>Combination of locally quasiconvex hyperbolic TDLC groups and Cannon-Thurston maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we study acylindrical graphs of groups, local quasiconvexity, and Cannon-Thurston maps in the setting of totally disconnected locally compact (TDLC) hyperbolic groups, extending several fundamental notions and results from discrete hyperbolic groups to this broader context. Leveraging Dahmani's technique and a topological characterization of hyperbolic TDLC groups in terms of uniform convergence groups given by Carette-Dreesen, we prove a combination theorem for an acylindrical graph of hyperbolic TDLC groups and give an explicit construction of the Gromov boundary of the fundamental group of the given graph of groups. Using the description of the Gromov boundary, we prove our main result: a combination theorem for an acylindrical graph of locally quasiconvex hyperbolic TDLC groups. Further, we generalise the work of Mosher, proving the existence of quasiisometric sections for a given short exact sequence of hyperbolic TDLC groups. This leads us to prove the existence of a Cannon-Thurston map for a normal hyperbolic subgroup of a hyperbolic TDLC group, generalising a theorem of Mj.</description>

Abstract: We prove that, if $G$ is a finite almost simple group and $H$ is a maximal subgroup of $G$, then the $10$th term of the derived series of $H$ is perfect. The same is true if $G$ is perfect and $H$ is core-free. The constant $10$ is best possible.</description>

      <title>On the Symmetric Normaliser Graph of a Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce the symmetric normaliser graph of a group $G$. The vertex set of this graph consists of elements of the group. Vertices $x$ and $y$ are adjacent if $x$ lies in the normaliser of $\langle y \rangle$ and $y$ lies in the normaliser of $\langle x \rangle$. We investigate the hierarchical position this graph occupies in the hierarchy of graphs defined on groups. We show that the existing hierarchy is further refined by this graph and that the edges of this graph lie between the edges of the commuting graph and the nilpotent graph. For finite groups, we prove a necessary and sufficient condition for the symmetric normaliser graph to be equal to the commuting graph and similarly, for equality with the nilpotent graph. The edge set of the symmetric normaliser graph is also a subset of the edge set of the Engel graph of a group and has connections to the non-generating graph of a group.</description>

      <title>Torsion groups and the Bienvenu--Geroldinger conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $M$ be a monoid (written multiplicatively). Equipped with the operation of setwise multiplication induced by $M$ on its parts, the collection of all finite subsets of $M$ containing the identity element is itself a monoid, denoted by $\mathcal P_{{\rm fin}, 1}(M)$ and called the reduced finitary power monoid of $M$.
  One is naturally led to ask whether, for all $H$ and $K$ in a given class of monoids, $\mathcal P_{\fin,1}(H)$ and $\mathcal P_{\fin,1}(K)$ are isomorphic if and only if $H$ and $K$ are. The problem originates from a conjecture of Bienvenu and Geroldinger [Israel J. Math., 2025] that was recently settled by the authors [Proc. AMS, 2025]. Here, we provide a positive answer to the problem in the case where $H$ and $K$ are cancellative monoids, one of which is torsion. In particular, the answer is in the affirmative when $H$ and $K$ are torsion groups. Whether the conclusion extends to arbitrary groups remains open.</description>

Abstract: We show that the Schur multiplier of a Noetherian group need not be finitely generated. We prove that the non-abelian tensor product of a polycyclic (resp. polycyclic-by-finite) group and a Noetherian group, is a polycyclic (resp. polycyclic-by-finite) group. We also prove new versions of Schur's theorem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.19772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We record a folklore theorem that says a partial group embeds in a group if and only if each word has at most one possible multiplication, regardless of choice of parenthesization. We further investigate the partial groups which are exemplars of non-embeddability. Finally we show that a partial groupoid embeds in a groupoid if and only if its reduction embeds in a group.</description>

      <title>On semigroups which admit only discrete left-continuous Hausdorff topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give the sufficient condition when every left-continuous (right-continuous) Hausdorff topology on a semigroup $S$ is discrete. We construct a submonoid $\mathscr{C}_{+}(a,b)$ (resp., $\mathscr{C}_{-}(a,b)$) of the bicyclic monoid which contains a family $\{S_\alpha\colon \alpha\in\mathfrak{c}\}$ of continuum many subsemigroups with the following properties: $(i)$ every left-continuous (resp., right-continuous) Hausdorff topology on $S_\alpha$ is discrete; $(ii)$ every semigroup $S_\alpha$ admits a non-discrete right-continuous (resp., left-continuous) Hausdorff topology which is not left-continuous (resp., right-continuous); $(iii)$ every semigroup $S_\alpha$ isomorphically embeds into a Hausdorff compact topological semigroup. Also we construct a submonoid $\mathscr{C}_{\mathbb{Z}}^+$ (resp., $\mathscr{C}_{\mathbb{Z}}^-$) of the extended bicyclic semigroup which contains a family $\{S_\alpha\colon \alpha\in\mathfrak{c}\}$ of continuum many subsemigroups with the above described properties.</description>

      <title>Arboreal Galois representations of rational functions: fixed-point proportion and the extension problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give an explicit description of the arithmetic-geometric extension of iterated Galois groups of rational functions. This yields a complete solution to the extension problem when either the arithmetic or the geometric iterated Galois group is branch, answering a question of Adams and Hyde.
  Furthermore, we obtain a sufficient condition for the arithmetic iterated Galois group of a rational function to have positive fixed-point proportion, which further applies in many instances to the specialization to non strictly post-critical points. In particular, this holds for all unicritical polynomials of odd degree, which greatly generalizes a result of Radi for the polynomial $z^d+1$.
  Lastly, we obtain the first family of groups acting on the $d$-adic tree whose fixed-point process becomes eventually $d$ for any $d\ge 2$ with positive probability. What is more, these groups are fractal and branch and thus positive-dimensional; hence they yield the first family of counterexamples to a conjecture of Jones for every $d$-adic tree.</description>

      <title>Concentration inequalities for maximal displacement of random walks on groups of polynomial growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove Gaussian concentration inequalities for maximal displacement of compactly supported random walks on a compactly generated locally compact group with polynomial growth. Concentration inequalities with different exponents hold for non-centred random walks as well, after correction by the drift.
  When the support of the measure generates a virtually nilpotent group, we provide an effective version of this result. These more refined estimates rely on the existence of a ``quantitative splitting'' of a virtually simply connected nilpotent group, a result which may be of independent interest.
  As applications, we deduce that the same concentration inequalities hold for centred random walks on the following classes of groups: amenable connected Lie groups (including non-unimodular ones), polycyclic and more generally finitely generated solvable groups with finite Pr\"ufer rank. This shows in particular that centred random walk are diffusive on such groups. For polycyclic groups, this strengthens and completes partial results previously obtained by Russ Thompson in 2011.</description>

      <title>Pureness and stable rank one for reduced twisted group $\mathrm{C}^\ast$-algebras of certain group extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The purpose of this note is to prove two results. First, we observe that discrete groups with property $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{PHP}}$ in the sense of Ozawa give rise to completely selfless reduced twisted group $\mathrm{C}^\ast$-algebras, thereby extending a theorem of Ozawa from the untwisted to the twisted case. Second, we show that reduced (twisted) $\mathrm{C}^\ast$-algebras of some group extensions of the form finite-by-$G$, with $G$ having the property $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{PHP}}$, have stable rank one and are pure, which implies strict comparison. Our results do not assume rapid decay, and extend a theorem of Raum-Thiel-Vilalta. Examples covered by our results include reduced twisted group $\mathrm{C}^\ast$-algebras of all acylindrically hyperbolic groups and all lattices in ${\rm SL}(n,\mathbb R)$ for $n\geq2$.</description>

      <title>Green geometry, Martin boundary and random walk asymptotics on groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07688v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We identify a single computationally checkable analytic quantity interlacing Martin boundary collapse, Green geometry, and linear escape for transient random walks on finitely generated groups: the Green-variation functional \[ \Delta(S;a,b):=\max_{x\in\partial S}\frac{|G(a,x)-G(b,x)|}{G(a,x)}. \] We prove that $\Delta\to0$ along exhaustions characterises the strong Liouville property (under mild, verifiable hypotheses on the ``strong Liouville $\Rightarrow \Delta\to0$'' direction), turning boundary oscillation estimates for Green kernels into potential-theoretic rigidity.
  We then give two general criteria for $\Delta$-vanishing. The first one derives quantitative bounds on $\Delta$ from coarse heat-kernel envelopes at an intrinsic scale together with a Tauberian comparability, covering Gaussian/sub-Gaussian and stable-like regimes; and the second one is purely elliptic: an ``elliptic H\"older exhaustion'' criterion. Conversely, on groups of exponential growth, $\Delta$ fails to decay along balls already under stretched-exponential on-diagonal upper bounds, yielding a quantitative obstruction to strong Liouville.
  As consequences, trivial Martin boundary forces linear-scale collapse of Green geometry ($d_G(e,x)=o(|x|)$) and vanishing Green speed (in probability), without any entropy hypothesis. On the non-Liouville side we prove an abundance principle: the existence of a single minimal positive harmonic function at a prescribed growth scale forces infinitely many. Finally, we clarify the role of moment assumptions in speed theory: any linear-speed law of large numbers on a set of positive probability forces $\mathbb E|X_1|&lt;\infty$, while on torsion-free nilpotent groups one can have $\mathbb E|X_1|=\infty$ yet $|X_n|/n\to0$ in probability.</description>

      <title>Derangements in intransitive groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16064v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a nontrivial permutation group of degree $n$. If $G$ is transitive, then a theorem of Jordan states that $G$ has a derangement. Equivalently, a finite group is never the union of conjugates of a proper subgroup. If $G$ is intransitive, then $G$ may fail to have a derangement, and this can happen even if $G$ has only two orbits, both of which have size $(1/2+o(1))n$. However, we conjecture that if $G$ has two orbits of size exactly $n/2$ then $G$ does have a derangement, and we prove this conjecture when $G$ acts primitively on at least one of the orbits. Equivalently, we conjecture that a finite group is never the union of conjugates of two proper subgroups of the same order, and we prove this conjecture when at least one of the subgroups is maximal. (Feldman also implicitly raised this conjecture on StackExchange.) We also prove the conjecture for soluble groups, almost simple groups and groups of order at most 50000, and we reduce the conjecture to perfect groups. Along the way, we prove a linear variant on Isbell's conjecture regarding derangements of prime-power order, and we highlight connections with intersecting families of permutations and roots of polynomials modulo primes.</description>

      <title>Random quotients preserve acylindrical and hierarchical hyperbolicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16677v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new model for random quotients of groups using independent random walks. In this model, we show that random quotients of acylindrical hyperbolic groups asymptotically almost surely remain acylindrically hyperbolic. Our main tools relate the theories of spinning families and projection complexes to random walks. In the presence of a hierarchical hyperbolic structure on the group, we leverage the fine control of projections to show that this structure is preserved in the quotient asymptotically almost surely. The same techniques yield that random quotients of a non-elementary hyperbolic group (relative to any finite collection of finitely generated peripheral subgroups) are asymptotically almost surely hyperbolic (relative to commensurable peripheral subgroups). Finally, we also prove that any two groups that are both acylindrically and hierarchically hyperbolic have a common quotients which is itself acylindrically and hierarchically hyperbolic. This produces "exotic" hierarchically hyperbolic groups with strong fixed point properties, such as Kazhdan's property (T).</description>

      <title>Skew brace extensions, second cohomology and complements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12371v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study extensions and second cohomology of skew left braces via the natural semi-direct products associated with the skew left braces. Let $0 \to I \to E \to H \to 0$ be a skew brace extension and $\Lambda_H$ denote the natural semi-direct products associated with the skew left brace $H$. We establish a group homomorphism from ${\rm H}_{Sb}^2(H, I)$ into ${\rm H}_{Gp}^2(\Lambda_H, I \times I)$, which turns out to be an embedding when $I \le {\rm Soc}(E)$. In particular the Schur multiplier of a skew left braces $H$ embeds into the Schur multiplier of the group $\Lambda_H$. Analog of the Schur-Zassenhaus theorem is established for skew left braces in several specific cases. We introduce a concept called minimal extensions (which stay at the extreme end of split extensions) of skew left braces and derive many fundamental results. Several reduction results for split extensions of finite skew left braces by abelian groups (viewed as trivial left braces) are obtained.</description>

Abstract: Jordan schemes generalize association schemes in a similar way as Jordan algebras generalize the associative ones. It is well-known that association schemes of maximal rank are in one-to-one correspondence with groups (so-called thin schemes). In this paper, we classify Jordan schemes of maximal rank-to-order ratio and show that regular Jordan schemes correspond to a special class of Moufang loops, known as Ring Alternative loops.</description>
