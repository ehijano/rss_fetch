      <title>MCPmed: A Call for MCP-Enabled Bioinformatics Web Services for LLM-Driven Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bioinformatics web servers are critical resources in modern biomedical research, facilitating interactive exploration of datasets through custom-built interfaces with rich visualization capabilities. However, this human-centric design limits machine readability for large language models (LLMs) and deep research agents. We address this gap by adapting the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to bioinformatics web server backends - a standardized, machine-actionable layer that explicitly associates webservice endpoints with scientific concepts and detailed metadata. Our implementations across widely-used databases (GEO, STRING, UCSC Cell Browser) demonstrate enhanced exploration capabilities through MCP-enabled LLMs. To accelerate adoption, we propose MCPmed, a community effort supplemented by lightweight breadcrumbs for services not yet fully MCP-enabled and templates for setting up new servers. This structured transition significantly enhances automation, reproducibility, and interoperability, preparing bioinformatics web services for next-generation research agents.</description>

      <title>AI for NONMEM Coding in Pharmacometrics Research and Education: Shortcut or Pitfall?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly being explored as a tool to support pharmacometric modeling, particularly in addressing the coding challenges associated with NONMEM. In this study, we evaluated the ability of seven AI agents to generate NONMEM codes across 13 pharmacometrics tasks, including a range of population pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) models. We further developed a standardized scoring rubric to assess code accuracy and created an optimized prompt to improve AI agent performance. Our results showed that the OpenAI o1 and gpt-4.1 models achieved the best performance, both generating codes with great accuracy for all tasks when using our optimized prompt. Overall, AI agents performed well in writing basic NONMEM model structures, providing a useful foundation for pharmacometrics model coding. However, user review and refinement remain essential, especially for complex models with special dataset alignment or advanced coding techniques. We also discussed the applications of AI in pharmacometrics education, particularly strategies to prevent over-reliance on AI for coding. This work provides a benchmark for current AI agents performance in NONMEM coding and introduces a practical prompt that can facilitate more accurate and efficient use of AI in pharmacometrics research and education.</description>
