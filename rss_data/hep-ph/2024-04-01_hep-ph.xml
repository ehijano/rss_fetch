      <title>Detecting Light Dark Matter with Kinetic Inductance Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconducting detectors are a promising technology for probing dark matter at extremely low masses, where dark matter interactions are currently unconstrained. Realizing the potential of such detectors requires new readout technologies to achieve the lowest possible thresholds for deposited energy. Here we perform a prototype search for dark matter--electron interactions with kinetic inductance detectors (KIDs), a class of superconducting detector originally designed for infrared astronomy applications. We demonstrate that existing KIDs can achieve effective thresholds as low as 0.2 eV, and we use existing data to set new dark matter constraints. The relative maturity of the technology underlying KIDs means that this platform can be scaled significantly with existing tools, enabling powerful new searches in the coming years.</description>

      <title>A computation of two-loop six-point Feynman integrals in dimensional regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute three families of two-loop six-point massless Feynman integrals in dimensional regularization, namely the double-box, the pentagon-triangle, and the hegaxon-bubble family. This constitutes the first analytic computation of two-loop master integrals with eight scales. We use the method of canonical differential equations. We describe the corresponding integral basis with uniform transcendentality, the relevant function alphabet, and analytic boundary values at a particular point in the Euclidean region up to the fourth order in the regularization parameter $\epsilon$. The results are expressed as one-fold integrals over classical polylogarithms suitable for fast and high-precision evaluation.</description>

      <title>Spin asymmetries for $C$-even quarkonium production as a probe of gluon distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the framework of transverse momentum dependent factorization in combination with nonrelativistic QCD, we study charmonium and bottomonium production in hadronic collisions. We focus on quarkonium states with even charge conjugation, for which the color-singlet production mechanism is expected to be also dominant in the small transverse momentum region, $q_T^2 \ll 4 M_{c,b}^2$. It is shown that the distributions of linearly polarized gluons inside unpolarized, longitudinally and transversely polarized protons contribute to the cross sections for scalar and pseudoscalar quarkonia in a very distinctive, parity-dependent way, whereas their effects on higher angular momentum states are strongly suppressed. We derive analytical expressions for single and double spin asymmetries, which would allow for the direct extraction of the gluon transverse momentum dependent distributions, mirroring the phenomenological studies of the Drell-Yan processes aimed at the extraction of their quark counterparts. By adopting Gaussian models for the gluon TMDs, which fulfill without saturating everywhere their positivity bounds, we provide numerical predictions for the transverse single-spin asymmetries. These observables could be measured at LHCSpin, the fixed target experiment planned at the LHC.</description>

      <title>Compton scattering in Bandos-Lechner-Sorokin-Townsend nonlinear electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nonlinear electrodynamics proposed by Bandos, Lechner, Sorokin and Townsend is a remarkable theory that unifies Maxwell, Bialynicki-Birula and ModMax theories, which are known theories invariant under conformal transformations and electromagnetic duality transformations. In the Bandos-Lechner-Sorokin-Townsend nonlinear electrodynamics, we calculate the energy flux density, dispersion relations, refractive indices, phase and group velocities of plane waves as well as the changes of the photon wavelength in the Compton scattering process in the presence of a constant uniform electromagnetic background. Our results are useful for testing and constraining this new theory of nonlinear electrodynamics.</description>

      <title>The status of New Physics in $b \to c \ell\nu$ transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent theoretical and experimental developments in $b \to c \ell\nu$ transitions, the aim of these proceedings is to critically analyse the current situation in this sector. In particular, we will inspect the possibility of explaining the current anomalous pattern by means of New Physics effects coupled with light charged leptons, motivated both by the measurement of the LFUV ratio ${\cal R}(\Lambda_c)$ and by the recent application of the Dispersive Matrix approach to estimate Form Factors in $B \to D^*$ transitions. These proceedings are based on Refs.~\cite{Fedele:2022iib,Fedele:2023ewe}.</description>

      <title>Three-particle formalism for multiple channels: the $\eta \pi \pi + K \overline K \pi$ system in isosymmetric QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalize previous three-particle finite-volume formalisms to allow for multiple three-particle channels. For definiteness, we focus on the two-channel $\eta \pi \pi$ and $K \overline K \pi$ system in isosymmetric QCD, considering the positive $G$ parity sector of the latter channel, and neglecting the coupling to modes with four or more particles. The formalism we obtain is thus appropriate to study the $b_1(1235)$ and $\eta(1295)$ resonances. The derivation is made in the generic relativistic field theory approach using the time-ordered perturbation theory method. We study how the resulting quantization condition reduces to that for a single three-particle channel when one drops below the upper ($K\overline K \pi$) threshold. We also present parametrizations of the three-particle K matrices that enter into the formalism.</description>

      <title>Deriving Neutron Star Equation of State from AdS/QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutron stars are among the main targets for gravitational wave observatories, however, their equation of state is still not well established. Mainly phenomenological models with many parameters are widely used by far, while theoretical models are not so practical. In arXiv:1902.08477, a theoretical equation of state with only one parameter is derived from Sakai-Sugimoto model, as an application of AdS/QCD, where pointlike instanton case is taken into consideration. When the tidal deformability constraint from gravitational wave event is satisfied, the maximum mass is about 1.7 solar masses. Now we upgrade this model to instanton gas, with one more variable, the instanton width. This is not naively a free parameter, but a function of the chemical potential. Thus we end up with a more complicated and accurate model, but still with only one adjustable parameter. In this case, we find the maximum mass becomes 1.85 solar masses. This is an encouraging and exiting result, as a theoretically derived model.</description>

      <title>A realistic theory of $\mathrm{E_{6}}$ unification through novel intermediate symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a non-supersymmetric $\mathrm{E}_{6}$ GUT with the scalar sector consisting of $\mathbf{650}\oplus \mathbf{351'} \oplus \mathbf{27}$. Making use of the first representation for the initial symmetry breaking to an intermediate stage, and the latter two representations for second-stage breaking to the Standard Model and a realistic Yukawa sector, this theory represents the minimal $\mathrm{E}_{6}$ GUT that proceeds through one of the intermediate stages that are novel compared to $\mathrm{SU(5)}$ or $\mathrm{SO}(10)$ GUT: trinification $\mathrm{SU}(3)_C\times \mathrm{SU}(3)_L\times \mathrm{SU}(3)_R$, $\mathrm{SU}(6)\times \mathrm{SU}(2)$ and flipped $\mathrm{SO}(10)\times\mathrm{U}(1)$. We analyze these possibilities under the choice of vacuum that preserves a $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ ``spinorial parity'', which disentangles the chiral and vector-like fermions of $\mathrm{E}_{6}$ and provides a dark matter candidate in the form of a (scalar) inert doublet. Three cases are shown to consistently unify under the extended survival hypothesis (with minimal fine-tuning): trinification symmetry $\mathrm{SU}(3)_C\times \mathrm{SU}(3)_L\times \mathrm{SU}(3)_R$ with either $LR$ or $CR$ parity, and $\mathrm{SU}(6)_{CR}\times\mathrm{SU}(2)_L$. Although the successful cases give a large range for proton lifetime estimates, all of them include regions consistent with current experimental bounds and within reach of forthcoming experiments. The scenario investigated in this paper essentially represents the unique (potentially) viable choice in the class of $\mathrm{E}_{6}$ GUTs proceeding through a novel-symmetry intermediate stage, since non-minimal alternatives seem to be intrinsically non-perturbative.</description>

      <title>Probing Heavy Charged Higgs Boson Using Multivariate Technique at Gamma-Gamma Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The current study explores the production of charged Higgs particles through photon-photon collisions within the Two Higgs Doublet Model context, including one-loop-level scattering amplitude of Electroweak and QED radiation. The cross-section has been scanned for plane ($m_{\phi^{0}}, \sqrt{s}$) investigating the process of $\gamma\gamma \rightarrow H^{+}H^{-}$. Three particular numerical scenarios low-$m_{H}$, non-alignment, and short-cascade are employed. Hence using $h^{0}$ for low-$m_{H^{0}}$ and $H^{0}$ for non-alignment and short-cascade scenario, the new experimental and theoretical constraints are applied.The decay channels for charged Higgs particles are examined in all the scenarios along with the analysis for cross-sections revealing that at low energy it is consistently higher for all scenarios. However as $\sqrt{s}$ increases, it reaches a peak value at 1$~$TeV for all benchmark scenarios. The branching ratio of the decay channels indicates that for non-alignment, the mode of decay $W^{\pm} h^{0}$ takes control %{} when $BR(H^{\pm} \rightarrow W^{\pm} H^{0})$ decreases at larger values of $m_{H^{0}}$.} and for short cascade the prominent decay mode remains $t\bar{b}$, while in the low-$m_{H}$ the dominant decay channel is of $W^{\pm} h^{0}$.
  In our research, we employ contemporary machine-learning methodologies to investigate the production of high-energy Higgs Bosons within a 3$ $TeV Gamma-Gamma collider. We have used multivariate approaches such as Boosted Decision Trees (BDT), LikelihoodD, and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) to show the observability of heavy-charged Higgs Bosons versus the most significant Standard Model backgrounds. The purity of the signal efficiency and background rejection are measured for each cut value.</description>

      <title>Exploring Constraints on Simplified Dark Matter Model Through Flavour and Electroweak Observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study focuses on a combined analysis of various available inputs to constrain the parameter spaces of a simplified dark matter (SDM) model featuring a spin-0 mediator and fermionic dark matter (DM). The spin-0 mediator interacts with standard model (SM) fermions, SM gauge bosons, and DM. We constrain the parameter spaces of different relevant couplings, DM mass, and the mediator mass, using the data from flavour-changing charged and neutral current processes, CKM matrices, $W$ and $Z$-pole observables, DM relic density, direct and indirect detection bounds. We have calculated bounds on the couplings from both separate and simultaneous analyses of the mentioned processes. We identify correlated parameter spaces for all the relevant parameters which include the couplings and the masses. For the DM and mediator masses, we have scanned the region between 100 GeV and 1000 GeV. Using our results, we have obtained bounds on the couplings of possible higher dimensional operators from which we can formulate our SDM.</description>

      <title>Resummation phenomenology and PDF determination for precision QCD at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the ongoing Run 3 of the LHC and its upcoming High-Luminosity upgrade, there is a growing need to study observables with high precision both experimentally and theoretically. To increase precision on the theory side, improvements of fixed-order perturbative predictions, resummation of logarithmic enhancements and accurate determination of proton structure are required. This thesis explores the latter two topics. We discuss high-energy logarithms and their resummation techniques, introducing an extension of the HELL formalism for multi-differential distributions in transverse momentum, rapidity and invariant mass. We apply this framework to heavy-quark pair production at the LHC, studying the kinematics of both a single quark and the final-state pair. An additional discussion is dedicated to a possible extension of the kt-factorisation framework, which underlies high-energy resummation, to capture next-to-leading logarithmic corrections. To test this hypothesis, we delve into the computation of a NLO off-shell coefficient function using Higgs-induced DIS in the infinite top mass limit as a benchmark process and report a partial result. Beside high-energy logarithms, we consider the determination of transverse-momentum distributions from a high mass system with additional QCD radiation and exclusive production cuts. Specifically, we focus on $HW^+$ production with a jet veto and analyse the Higgs transverse momentum spectrum at NNLO, using qt-subtraction. We complement the fixed order study with NNLL resummation of jet-veto logarithms and linear power correction in ptHW using the RadISH formalism. Finally, in the last project pertaining to this thesis we consider the problem of Parton Distribution Function determination. We propose a minimal parametrisation guided by physical arguments and investigate its performance in fitting the HERA dataset with NLO QCD theory predictions.</description>

Abstract: It has long been accepted that the cosmos determine our personalities, relationships, and even our fate. Unlike our condensed matter colleagues - who regularly use quantum mechanics to determine the healing properties of crystals - astrology techniques have been unchanged since the 19th century. In this paper, we discuss how astrophysical messengers beyond starlight can be used to predict the future and excuse an $\mathcal{O}(1)$ fraction of our negative personality traits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The current precision on the CKM angle $\gamma$ is driven by averages of measurements from multiple final states and multiple experiments. As the next generation of experiments targets a total experimental precision on $\gamma$ less than one degree, systematic uncertainties must be well-controlled and correlated uncertainties between different final states and across experiments must be fully understood. These proceedings examine the systematic uncertainties that arise in direct measurements of $\gamma$ and discuss the potential of each class of systematic uncertainties to prevent sub-degree precision.</description>

      <title>Unobserving the Moon: the spurious possibility of orbital decoupling due to solar neutrino Arago spot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Arago spot is an intensity maximum at the center of a shadow created by constructive interference of diffracted waves around a spherical object. While the study of diffraction patterns usually concerns visible light, de Broglie's wave nature of matter makes diffraction theory applicable for particles, such as neutrinos, as well. During a solar eclipse, some of the neutrinos emitted by the Sun are diffracted by the Moon, resulting in a diffraction pattern that can be observed on Earth. In this paper we consider the theoretically emerging solar neutrino Arago spot as a means to measure the location of the Moon with high accuracy and consider its implication on the orbit of the Moon given Heisenberg's uncertainty principle. Our results indicate that the Moon is not at immediate risk of orbital decoupling due to the observation of a solar neutrino Arago spot.</description>

      <title>Echoes from a long time ago: Chewbacca inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation offers a unique avenue for exploring the early Universe's dynamics and evolution. In this paper, we delve into the fascinating realm of slow-roll inflation, contextualizing the primordial acoustic perturbations as the resonant echoes akin to the iconic sound of Chewbacca from the Star Wars universe. By extrapolating polynomial potentials for these primordial sounds, we illuminate their role in shaping the inflationary landscape. Leveraging this framework, we calculate the scalar spectral index ($n_s$) and tensor-to-scalar ratio ($r$), providing insights into the underlying physics governing the inflationary epoch. Employing a rigorous chi-square ($\chi^2$) analysis, we meticulously scrutinize the Planck data combined with that offered by the BICEP/Keck collaboration to identify the Chewbacca sound profile that best aligns with observational constraints. Our findings not only shed light on the intricate interplay between sound and cosmology but also unveil intriguing parallels between the cosmic symphony of the early universe and beloved cultural icons.</description>

Abstract: Thanks to the large cross-section for the production of strange and charm mesons at the Large Hadron Collider, LHCb has recently performed several new explorations of rare transitions that are highly suppressed or forbidden by the Standard Model: mostly flavour changing neutral current decays, but also lepton flavour violating decays. Physics beyond the Standard Model could contribute at tree and loop levels.</description>

Abstract: We show that quantum fluctuations of an expanding phase transition bubble give rise to gravitational wave (GW) emission, even when considering a single bubble, without bubble collisions or plasma effects. The ratio of GW energy to the total bubble energy reservoir increases with time as $\propto t$. If the bubble expands for long enough before percolation destroys it, back-reaction due to the GW emission becomes important after $t_{\rm br}\sim (16\pi^5) m_{\rm pl}^2R_0^3$, where $R_0$ is the bubble nucleation radius and $m_{\rm pl}$ is the reduced Planck mass. As seen by experiments today, the GW energy spectrum would appear blue. However, simple estimates suggest that the signal falls short of detection by even ambitious future experiments.</description>

      <title>Circular reasoning: Solving the Hubble tension with a non-$\pi$ value of $\pi$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.20219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, cosmology has seen a surge in alternative models that purport to solve the discrepancy between the values of the Hubble constant $H_0$ as measured by cosmological microwave background anisotropies and local supernovae, respectively. In particular, many of the most successful approaches have involved varying fundamental constants, such as an alternative value of the fine structure constant and time-varying values of the electron mass, the latter of which showed particular promise as the strongest candidate in several earlier studies. Inspired by these approaches, in this paper, we investigate a cosmological model where the value of the geometric constant $\pi$ is taken to be a free model parameter. Using the latest CMB data from Planck as well as baryon-acoustic oscillation data, we constrain the parameters of the model and find a strong correlation between $\pi$ and $H_0$, with the final constraint $H_0 = 71.3 \pm 1.1 \ \mathrm{ km/s/Mpc}$, equivalent to a mere $1.5\sigma$ discrepancy with the value measured by the SH0ES collaboration. Furthermore, our results show that $\pi = 3.206 \pm 0.038$ at $95 \%$ C.L., which is in good agreement with several external measurements discussed in the paper. Hence, we conclude that the $\pi \Lambda$CDM model presented in this paper, which has only a single extra parameter, currently stands as the perhaps strongest solution to the Hubble tension.</description>

      <title>Probing Dark Matter Particles from Evaporating Primordial Black Holes via Electron Scattering in the CDEX-10 Experiment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.20263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dark matter (DM) is a major constituent of the Universe. However, no definite evidence of DM particles (denoted as ``$\chi$") has been found in DM direct detection (DD) experiments to date. There is a novel concept that detecting $\chi$ from evaporating primordial black holes (PBHs). We search for $\chi$ emitted from PBHs by investigating their interaction with target electrons. The examined PBH masses range from 1$\times$10$^{15}$ to 7$\times$10$^{16}$ g under the current limits of PBH abundance $f_{PBH}$. Using 205.4 kg$\cdot$day data obtained from the CDEX-10 experiment conducted in the China Jinping Underground Laboratory, we exclude the $\chi$--electron ($\chi$--$e$) elastic-scattering cross section $\sigma_{\chi e} \sim 5\times10^{-29}$ cm$^2$ for $\chi$ with a mass $m_{\chi}\lesssim$ 0.1 keV from our results. If ($m_{\chi}$, $\sigma_{\chi e}$) can be determined in the future, DD experiments are expected to impose strong constraints on $f_{PBH}$ for large $M_{PBH}$s.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the Blazar-Boosted Dark Matter from the CDEX-10 Experiment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.20276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report new constraints on light dark matter (DM) boosted by blazars using the 205.4 kg day data from the CDEX-10 experiment located at the China Jinping Underground Laboratory. Two representative blazars, TXS 0506+56 and BL Lacertae are studied. The results derived from TXS 0506+56 exclude DM-nucleon elastic scattering cross sections from $4.6\times 10^{-33}\ \rm cm^2$ to $1\times10^{-26}\ \rm cm^2$ for DM masses between 10 keV and 1 GeV, and the results derived from BL Lacertae exclude DM-nucleon elastic scattering cross sections from $2.4\times 10^{-34}\ \rm cm^2$ to $1\times10^{-26}\ \rm cm^2$ for the same range of DM masses. The constraints correspond to the best sensitivities among solid-state detector experiments in the sub-MeV mass range.</description>

      <title>The Higgs Mass and a Perspective on Broken Autonomy of Scales</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.20282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The hierarchy problem of the Higgs mass, the violation of the autonomy of far-distant energy scales, is identified as a pseudo-problem. The pseudo-problem is based on the dogmatic adherence to the methodology of effective theories, for which there is no justification when dealing with presumably fundamental phenomena such as the Higgs mechanism. In view of further breaches of autonomy of scales in fundamental principles outside particle physics, the hierarchy problem is instead reinterpreted as an indication of the fundamental ontological status of the Higgs boson. Selective Realism justifies this attribution within the effective theories of the standard model of particle physics. Moreover, a model of changes in aesthetic canons provides an explanation for the existing dogmatism regarding effective theories.</description>

Abstract: We discuss the experimental reach of the Frascati PADME experiment in searching for new light bosons via their resonant production in positron annihilation on fixed target atomic electrons. A scan in the mass range around 17 MeV will thoroughly probe the particle physics interpretation of the anomaly observed by the ATOMKI nuclear physics experiment. In particular, for the case of a spin-1 boson, the viable parameter space can be fully covered in a few months of data taking.</description>

      <title>Investigating the elliptic anisotropy of identified particles in p--Pb collisions with a multi-phase transport model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.06577v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The elliptic azimuthal anisotropy coefficient ($v_{2}$) of the identified particles at midrapidity ($|\eta|&lt;0.8$) was investigated in p--Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}=$ 5.02 TeV using a multi-phase transport model (AMPT). The calculations of differential $v_{2}$ based on the advanced flow extraction method of light flavor hadrons (pions, kaons, protons, and $\Lambda$) in small collision systems were extended to a wider transverse momentum ($p_{\mathrm{T}}$) range of up to 8 GeV/$c$ for the first time. The string-melting version of the AMPT model provides a good description of the measured $p_{\mathrm{T}}$-differential $v_{2}$ of the mesons but exhibits a slight deviation from the baryon $v_{2}$. In addition, we observed the features of mass ordering at low $p_{\mathrm{T}}$ and the approximate number of constituent quarks (NCQ) scaled at intermediate $p_{\mathrm{T}}$. Moreover, we demonstrate that hadronic rescattering does not have a significant impact on $v_{2}$ in p--Pb collisions for different centrality selections, whereas partonic scattering dominates in generating the elliptic anisotropy of the final particles. This study provides further insight into the origin of collective-like behavior in small collision systems and has referential value for future measurements of azimuthal anisotropy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.10497v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we complete our CT18qed study with the neutron's photon parton distribution function (PDF), which is essential for the nucleus scattering phenomenology. Two methods, CT18lux and CT18qed, based on the LUXqed formalism and the DGLAP evolution, respectively, to determine the neutron's photon PDF have been presented. Various low-$Q^2$ non-perturbative variations have been carefully examined, which are treated as additional uncertainties on top of those induced by quark and gluon PDFs. The impacts of the momentum sum rule as well as isospin symmetry violation have been explored, and turn out to be negligible. A detailed comparison with other neutron's photon PDF sets has been performed, which shows a great improvement in the precision and a reasonable uncertainty estimation in our results. Finally, two phenomenological implications are demonstrated with photon-initiated processes: neutrino-nucleus $W$-boson production, which is important for the near-future TeV--PeV neutrino observations, and the axion-like particle production at a high-energy muon beam-dump experiment.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the elastic photon-proton and photon-photon scattering in a holographic QCD model, focusing on the Regge regime. Considering contributions of the Pomeron and Reggeon exchange, the total and differential cross sections are calculated. While our model involves several parameters, by virtue of the universality of the Pomeron and Reggeon, for most of them the values determined in the preceding study on the proton-proton and proton-antiproton scattering can be employed. Once the two adjustable parameters, the Pomeron-photon and Reggeon-photon coupling constant, are determined with the experimental data of the total cross sections, predicting the both cross sections in a wide kinematic region, from the GeV to TeV scale, becomes possible. We show that the total cross section data can be well described within the model, and our predictions for the photon-proton differential cross section are consistent with the data.</description>

Abstract: The evolution kernels that govern the scale dependence of the generalized parton distributions are invariant under transformations of the $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathrm R)$ collinear subgroup of the conformal group. Beyond one loop the symmetry generators, due to quantum effects, differ from the canonical ones. We construct the transformation which brings the {\it full} symmetry generators back to their canonical form and show that the eigenvalues (anomalous dimensions) of the new, canonically invariant, evolution kernel coincide with the so-called parity respecting anomalous dimensions. We develop an efficient method that allows one to restore an invariant kernel from the corresponding anomalous dimensions. As an example, the explicit expressions for NNLO invariant kernels for the twist two flavor-nonsinglet operators in QCD and for the planar part of the universal anomalous dimension in $ N=4$ SYM are presented.</description>

      <title>Testing Realistic $SO(10)$ SUSY GUTs with Proton Decay and Gravitational Waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.05799v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of a supersymmetric $SO(10)$ Grand Unified Theory, which is broken to the Standard Model via the breaking of two intermediate symmetries. The spontaneous breaking of the first intermediate symmetry, $B-L$, leads to the generation of cosmic strings and right-handed neutrino masses and further to an observable cosmological background of gravitational waves and generation of light neutrino masses via type-I seesaw mechanism. Supersymmetry breaking manifests as sparticle masses below the $B-L$ breaking but far above the electroweak scale due to proton decay limits. This naturally pushes the $B-L$ breaking scale close to the GUT scale, leading to the formation of metastable cosmic strings, which can provide a gravitational wave spectrum consistent with the recent Pulsar Timing Arrays observation. We perform a detailed analysis of this model using two-loop renormalisation group equations, including threshold corrections, to determine the symmetry-breaking scale consistent with the recent Pulsar Timing Arrays signals such as NANOGrav 15-year data and testable by the next-generation limits on proton decay from Hyper-K and JUNO. Simultaneously, we find the regions of the model parameter space that can predict the measured quark and lepton masses and mixing, baryon asymmetry of our Universe, a viable dark matter candidate and can be tested by a combination of neutrinoless double beta decay searches and limits on the sum of neutrinos masses.</description>

Abstract: Cobimaximal mixing predicts $\pi/4$ and $3\pi/2$ for the atmospheric angle and the Dirac CP-violating phase, respectively. These values are in tension with the neutrino globals fits. If this pattern was behind the lepton mixings, then it would have to be broken. In that case, in this paper, we explore the $\mathbf{S}_{3}$ flavor symmetry within the $B-L$ gauge model where the aforementioned scheme comes from the neutrino sector but the charged lepton contribution breaks the well known predictions so the mixing observables as well as the $m_{ee}$ mass can be accommodated quite well according to the available data. Notably, the predicted regions for the Dirac CP-violating phase would allow us to test the model in future experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.19544v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Axions and dark photons are common in many extensions of the Standard Model. The dark axion portal -- an axion coupling to the dark photon and photon -- can significantly modify their phenomenology. We study the cosmological constraints on the dark axion portal from Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) bounds on the energy density of dark radiation, $\Delta N_\text{eff}$. By computing the axion-photon-dark photon collision terms and solving the Boltzmann equations including their effects, we find that light axions are generally more constrained by $\Delta N_\text{eff}$ than from supernova cooling or collider experiments. However, with dark photons at the MeV scale, a window of parameter space is opened up above the supernova limits and below the experimental exclusion, allowing for axion decay constants as low as $f_a \sim 10^4$ GeV. This region also modifies indirectly the neutrino energy density, thus relaxing the cosmological upper bound on the sum of neutrino masses. Future CMB measurements could detect a signal or close this open window on the dark axion portal.</description>

      <title>Polarized fragmenting jet functions in Inclusive and Exclusive Jet Production</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.00672v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we present a complete theoretical framework for analyzing the distribution of polarized hadrons within jets, with and without measuring the transverse momentum relative to the standard jet axis. Using soft-collinear effective theory (SCET), we derive the factorization and provide the theoretical calculation of both semi-inclusive and exclusive fragmenting jet functions (FJFs) under longitudinal and transverse polarization. With the polarized FJFs, one gains access to a variety of new observables that can be used for extracting both collinear and transverse momentum dependent parton distribution functions (PDFs) and fragmentation functions (FFs). As examples, we provide numerical results for the spin asymmetry $A_{TU,T}^{\cos(\phi _S - \hat{\phi}_{S_h})}$ from polarized semi-inclusive hadron-in-jet production in polarized $pp$ collisions at RHIC kinematics, where a transversely polarized quark would lead to the transverse spin of the final-state hadron inside the jet and is thus sensitive to the transversity fragmentation functions. Similarly, another spin asymmetry, $A_{TU, L}^{\cos(\phi _q - \phi _{S})}$ from polarized exclusive hadron-in-jet production in polarized $ep$ collisions at EIC kinematics would allow us to access the helicity fragmentation functions. These observables demonstrate promising potential in investigating transverse momentum dependent PDFs and FFs and are worthwhile for further measurements.</description>

Abstract: We study thermal production of dark matter (DM) in a realization of the minimal models of Ref.~\cite{Bonnefoy:2023afx}, where parity is used to solve the strong CP problem by transforming the entire Standard Model (SM) into a mirror copy. Although the mirror electron $e^{\prime}$ is a good DM candidate, its viability is mired by the presence of the mirror up-quark $u^{\prime}$, whose abundance is intimately related to the $e^{\prime}$ abundance and must be suppressed. This can be achieved through a sequential freeze-in mechanism, where mirror photons are first produced from SM gluons, and then the mirror photons produce $e'$. After computing the details of this double freeze-in, we discuss the allowed parameter space of the model, which lies at the threshold of experimental observations. We find that this origin of $e'$ DM requires a low reheating temperature after inflation and is consistent with the baryon asymmetry arising from leptogenesis, providing mirror neutrinos have a significant degeneracy. Finally, we show that this $e'$ DM is not compatible with Higgs Parity, the simplest scheme with exact parity, unless SM parameters deviate significantly from their central values or the minimal model is extended.</description>

      <title>A neutrino floor for the Migdal effect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.17719v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neutrino-nucleus scatterings in the detector could induce electron ionization signatures due to the Migdal effect. We derive prospects for a future detection of the Migdal effect via coherent elastic solar neutrino-nucleus scatterings in liquid xenon detectors, and discuss the irreducible background that it constitutes for the Migdal effect caused by light dark matter-nucleus scatterings. Furthermore, we explore the ionization signal induced by some neutrino electromagnetic and non-standard interactions on nuclei. In certain scenarios, we find a distinct peak on the ionization spectrum of xenon around 0.1 keV, in clear contrast to the Standard Model expectation.</description>

      <title>Models of Accidental Dark Matter with a Fundamental Scalar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07759v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider models of accidental dark matter, namely models in which the dark matter is a composite state that is stable thanks to an accidental symmetry of the theory. The fundamental constituents are vectorlike fermions, taken to be fragments of representations of the grand unifying gauge group $SU(5)$, as well as a scalar singlet. All the new fields are charged under a new confining gauge group, which we take to be $SU(N)$, leading to models with complex dark matter. We analyse the models in the context of $SU(5)$ grand unification with a non-standard approach recently proposed in the literature. The advantage of including the scalar mainly resides in the fact that it allows to break several undesired accidental symmetries leading to a larger set of viable models with respect to previous literature, in which only fermions (or only scalars) were considered. Moreover these models present distinct novelties, namely dark states with non-zero baryon and lepton number and the existence of composite hybrid states of fermions and scalars. We identify phenomena that are specific to the inclusion of the scalar and discuss possibilities to test this setup.</description>

      <title>Three-family supersymmetric Pati-Salam models with symplectic groups from intersecting D6-branes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.09644v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct new three-family ${\cal N}=1$ supersymmetric Pati-Salam models from intersecting D6-branes with original gauge group ${\rm U}(4)_C \times {\rm USp}(2)_L \times {\rm U}(2)_R$ on a Type IIA $\mathbb{T}^6/(\mathbb{Z}_2\times \mathbb{Z}_2)$ orientifold. We find that replacing a ${\rm U}(2)$ with a ${\rm USp}(2)$ group severely restricts the number of three-generation supersymmetric models such that there are only five inequivalent models. Exchanging the left and right sectors, we obtain five dual models with gauge group ${\rm U}(4)_C \times {\rm U}(2)_L \times {\rm USp}(2)_R$. These ten models have different gauge coupling relations at string scale. The highest wrapping number is 4, and one of the models contains no filler O6-planes. Moreover, we discuss in detail the particle spectra, the composite particles through strong coupling dynamics, and the exotic particle decouplings. Also, we study how to realize the string-scale gauge coupling relations in some models.</description>

      <title>Dark energy and matter interacting scenario to relieve $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.13146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.13146v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a new cosmological model (called $\tilde\Lambda$CDM) in which the vacuum energy interacts with matter and radiation, and test this model using the current cosmological observations. Using the CMB+BAO+SN (CBS) dataset to constrain the model, we find that $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions are relieved to $2.87\sigma$ and $2.77\sigma$, respectively. However, in this case, the $\tilde\Lambda$CDM model is not favored by the data, compared with $\Lambda$CDM. We find that when the $H_0$ and $S_8$ data are added to the data combination, the situation is significantly improved. In the CBS+$H_0$ case, the model relieves the $H_0$ tension to $0.47\sigma$, and the model is favored over $\Lambda$CDM. In the CBS+$H_0$+$S_8$ case, we obtain a synthetically best situation, in which the $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions are relieved to $0.72\sigma$ and $2.11\sigma$, respectively. In this case, the model is most favored by the data. Therefore, this cosmological model can greatly relieve the $H_0$ tension and simultaneously effectively alleviate the $S_8$ tension.</description>

      <title>Exact Renormalization of the Higgs Field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.10004v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using Wilsonian renormalization, we calculate the quantum correction to observable quantities, rather than the bare parameters, of the Higgs field. A physical parameter, such as a mass-squared or a quartic coupling, at an energy scale $\mu$ is obtained from that at a reference scale by integrating in the degrees of freedom in between. In this process, heavy modes decouple and the ultraviolet scale dependence is canceled in the observables. An exact renormalization group equation is parametrized by the low-energy scale $\mu$.</description>

      <title>Lellouch-L\"uscher factor for the $K\to 3\pi$ decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04391v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive an explicit expression for the Lellouch-L\"uscher (LL) factor in the $K\to 3\pi$ decays at leading order (without derivative couplings). Several important technical details are addressed, like a proper decomposition into the isospin amplitudes, the choice of a minimal set of effective couplings and the renormalization, as well as the algorithm for the solution of the pertinent Faddeev equations in the infinite volume which is based on the contour deformation method. Most importantly, our numerical results demonstrate that the three-body force contributes very little to the LL factor. This result paves the way for the study of the $K\to 3\pi$ decays on the lattice.</description>

      <title>Localization of $q-$form field on the brane-world by coupling with gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11688v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The scalar fields, $U(1)$ gauge vector fields, and Kalb-Ramond fields are the $0$-form, 1-form, and 2-form fields, respectively. In four-dimensional space-time, free $q$-form fields are equivalent to scalar or vector fields by a duality, however, in higher-dimensional space-time, $q-$form fields correspond to new types of particles. In this paper, with considering a coupling mechanism between the kinetic term of the $q-$form fields and the background spacetime, we investigate the localization of Kaluza-Klein modes for the $q-$form fields on a $D-$dimensional Randall-Sundrum-like brane model. We demonstrate that the zero mode can be localized on the brane, and the massive Kaluza-Klein modes could be localized or quasi-localized on the brane when with certain value of parameters. Then, we present the localization of the scalar fields, $U(1)$ gauge vector fields, and 2-form Kalb-Ramond fields within a five-dimensional bulk spacetime. For a massless scalar field, an interesting characteristic emerges: When the parameter $t_2$ is negative, the zero mode is localized on both sides of the brane, whereas the massive Kaluza-Klein modes can be quasi-localized at the center of the brane.</description>

      <title>Towards the quark mass dependence of $T_{cc}^+$ from lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14715v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The $DD^*$ scattering phase shifts in the $T_{cc}^+=cc\bar{u}\bar{d}$ channel are extracted from lattice QCD for five different charm quark masses and a fixed light-quark mass corresponding to $m_\pi\simeq 280$ MeV. The phase shifts are analysed employing two approaches: effective range expansion and Lippmann-Schwinger equation derived in the effective field theory. In the latter case, the results imply an attraction at short range parametrised by contact terms and a slight repulsion at long range mediated by one-pion exchange with $m_\pi &gt;m_{D^*}-m_D$. The poles in the amplitude across the complex energy plane are extracted and their trajectories are discussed as the charm quark mass is varied. Two complex conjugate poles corresponding to a resonance below threshold are found for $m_c$ close to the physical value. They turn into a pair of virtual states at the largest $m_c$ studied. With further increasing $m_c$, one virtual pole representing $T_{cc}^+$ is expected to move towards the two-body threshold and turn into a bound state. The light-quark mass dependence of the $T_{cc}^+$ pole is briefly discussed using the data on $DD^*$ scattering from other lattice collaborations.</description>
