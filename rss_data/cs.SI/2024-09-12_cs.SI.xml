      <title>Modeling Information Narrative Detection and Evolution on Telegram during the Russia-Ukraine War</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Following the Russian Federation's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, a multitude of information narratives emerged within both pro-Russian and pro-Ukrainian communities online. As the conflict progresses, so too do the information narratives, constantly adapting and influencing local and global community perceptions and attitudes. This dynamic nature of the evolving information environment (IE) underscores a critical need to fully discern how narratives evolve and affect online communities. Existing research, however, often fails to capture information narrative evolution, overlooking both the fluid nature of narratives and the internal mechanisms that drive their evolution. Recognizing this, we introduce a novel approach designed to both model narrative evolution and uncover the underlying mechanisms driving them. In this work we perform a comparative discourse analysis across communities on Telegram covering the initial three months following the invasion. First, we uncover substantial disparities in narratives and perceptions between pro-Russian and pro-Ukrainian communities. Then, we probe deeper into prevalent narratives of each group, identifying key themes and examining the underlying mechanisms fueling their evolution. Finally, we explore influences and factors that may shape the development and spread of narratives.</description>

      <title>Surprising Resilience of Science During a Global Pandemic: A Large-Scale Descriptive Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic profoundly impacted people globally, yet its effect on scientists and research institutions has yet to be fully examined. To address this knowledge gap, we use a newly available bibliographic dataset covering tens of millions of papers and authors to investigate changes in research activity and collaboration during this period. Employing statistical methods, we analyze the pandemic's disruptions on the participation, productivity, and collaborations of researchers at the top 1,000 institutions worldwide based on historical productivity, taking into account variables such as geography, researcher seniority and gender, and field of study. Our findings reveal an unexpected trend: research activity and output significantly increased in the early stages of the pandemic, indicating a surprising resilience in the scientific community. However, by the end of 2022, there was a notable reversion to historical trends in research participation and productivity. This reversion suggests that the initial spike in research activity was a short-lived disruption rather than a permanent shift. As such, monitoring scientific outputs in 2023 and beyond becomes crucial. There may be a delayed negative effect of the pandemic on research, given the long time horizon for many research fields and the temporary closure of wet labs. Further analysis is needed to fully comprehend the factors that underpin the resilience of scientific innovation in the face of global crises. Our study provides an initial comprehensive exploration up to the end of 2022, offering valuable insights into how the scientific community has adapted and responded over the course of the pandemic.</description>

      <title>Virtual Node Generation for Node Classification in Sparsely-Labeled Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the broader machine learning literature, data-generation methods demonstrate promising results by generating additional informative training examples via augmenting sparse labels. Such methods are less studied in graphs due to the intricate dependencies among nodes in complex topology structures. This paper presents a novel node generation method that infuses a small set of high-quality synthesized nodes into the graph as additional labeled nodes to optimally expand the propagation of labeled information. By simply infusing additional nodes, the framework is orthogonal to the graph learning and downstream classification techniques, and thus is compatible with most popular graph pre-training (self-supervised learning), semi-supervised learning, and meta-learning methods. The contribution lies in designing the generated node set by solving a novel optimization problem. The optimization places the generated nodes in a manner that: (1) minimizes the classification loss to guarantee training accuracy and (2) maximizes label propagation to low-confidence nodes in the downstream task to ensure high-quality propagation. Theoretically, we show that the above dual optimization maximizes the global confidence of node classification. Our Experiments demonstrate statistically significant performance improvements over 14 baselines on 10 publicly available datasets.</description>

      <title>Polarization Detection on Social Networks: dual contrastive objectives for Self-supervision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Echo chambers and online discourses have become prevalent social phenomena where communities engage in dramatic intra-group confirmations and inter-group hostility. Polarization detection is a rising research topic for detecting and identifying such polarized groups. Previous works on polarization detection primarily focus on hand-crafted features derived from dataset-specific characteristics and prior knowledge, which fail to generalize to other datasets. This paper proposes a unified self-supervised polarization detection framework, outperforming previous methods in unsupervised and semi-supervised polarization detection tasks on various publicly available datasets. Our framework utilizes a dual contrastive objective (DocTra): (1) interaction-level: to contrast between node interactions to extract critical features on interaction patterns, and (2) feature-level: to contrast extracted polarized and invariant features to encourage feature decoupling. Our experiments extensively evaluate our methods again 7 baselines on 7 public datasets, demonstrating significant performance improvements.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised node clustering via contrastive hard sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a fine-grained contrastive learning scheme for unsupervised node clustering. Previous clustering methods only focus on a small feature set (class-dependent features), which demonstrates explicit clustering characteristics, ignoring the rest of the feature spaces (class-invariant features). This paper exploits class-invariant features via graph contrastive learning to discover additional high-quality features for unsupervised clustering. We formulate a novel node-level fine-grained augmentation framework for self-supervised learning, which iteratively identifies competitive contrastive samples from the whole feature spaces, in the form of positive and negative examples of node relations. While positive examples of node relations are usually expressed as edges in graph homophily, negative examples are implicit without a direct edge. We show, however, that simply sampling nodes beyond the local neighborhood results in less competitive negative pairs, that are less effective for contrastive learning. Inspired by counterfactual augmentation, we instead sample competitive negative node relations by creating virtual nodes that inherit (in a self-supervised fashion) class-invariant features, while altering class-dependent features, creating contrasting pairs that lie closer to the boundary and offering better contrast. Consequently, our experiments demonstrate significant improvements in supervised node clustering tasks on six baselines and six real-world social network datasets.</description>

      <title>Keeping it Authentic: The Social Footprint of the Trolls Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2016, a network of social media accounts animated by Russian operatives attempted to divert political discourse within the American public around the presidential elections. This was a coordinated effort, part of a Russian-led complex information operation. Utilizing the anonymity and outreach of social media platforms Russian operatives created an online astroturf that is in direct contact with regular Americans, promoting Russian agenda and goals. The elusiveness of this type of adversarial approach rendered security agencies helpless, stressing the unique challenges this type of intervention presents. Building on existing scholarship on the functions within influence networks on social media, we suggest a new approach to map those types of operations. We argue that pretending to be legitimate social actors obliges the network to adhere to social expectations, leaving a social footprint. To test the robustness of this social footprint we train artificial intelligence to identify it and create a predictive model. We use Twitter data identified as part of the Russian influence network for training the artificial intelligence and to test the prediction. Our model attains 88% prediction accuracy for the test set. Testing our prediction on two additional models results in 90.7% and 90.5% accuracy, validating our model. The predictive and validation results suggest that building a machine learning model around social functions within the Russian influence network can be used to map its actors and functions.</description>

      <title>Hypergraph Change Point Detection using Adapted Cardinality-Based Gadgets: Applications in Dynamic Legal Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hypergraphs provide a robust framework for modeling complex systems with higher-order interactions. However, analyzing them in dynamic settings presents significant computational challenges. To address this, we introduce a novel method that adapts the cardinality-based gadget to convert hypergraphs into strongly connected weighted directed graphs, complemented by a symmetrized combinatorial Laplacian. We demonstrate that the harmonic mean of the conductance and edge expansion of the original hypergraph can be upper-bounded by the conductance of the transformed directed graph, effectively preserving crucial cut information. Additionally, we analyze how the resulting Laplacian relates to that derived from the star expansion. Our approach was validated through change point detection experiments on both synthetic and real datasets, showing superior performance over clique and star expansions in maintaining spectral information in dynamic settings. Finally, we applied our method to analyze a dynamic legal hypergraph constructed from extensive United States court opinion data.</description>

      <title>Reducing Population-level Inequality Can Improve Demographic Group Fairness: a Twitter Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many existing fairness metrics measure group-wise demographic disparities in system behavior or model performance. Calculating these metrics requires access to demographic information, which, in industrial settings, is often unavailable. By contrast, economic inequality metrics, such as the Gini coefficient, require no demographic data to measure. However, reductions in economic inequality do not necessarily correspond to reductions in demographic disparities. In this paper, we empirically explore the relationship between demographic-free inequality metrics -- such as the Gini coefficient -- and standard demographic bias metrics that measure group-wise model performance disparities specifically in the case of engagement inequality on Twitter. We analyze tweets from 174K users over the duration of 2021 and find that demographic-free impression inequality metrics are positively correlated with gender, race, and age disparities in the average case, and weakly (but still positively) correlated with demographic bias in the worst case. We therefore recommend inequality metrics as a potentially useful proxy measure of average group-wise disparities, especially in cases where such disparities cannot be measured directly. Based on these results, we believe they can be used as part of broader efforts to improve fairness between demographic groups in scenarios like content recommendation on social media.</description>

      <title>Structural Robustness and Vulnerability of Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Networks are useful descriptions of the structure of many complex systems. Unsurprisingly, it is thus important to analyze the robustness of networks in many scientific disciplines. In applications in communication, logistics, finance, ecology, biomedicine, and many other fields, researchers have studied the robustness of networks to the removal of nodes, edges, or other subnetworks to identify and characterize robust network structures. A major challenge in the study of network robustness is that researchers have reported that different and seemingly contradictory network properties are correlated with a network's robustness. Using a framework by Alderson and Doyle~\cite{Alderson2010}, we categorize several notions of network robustness and we examine these ostensible contradictions. We survey studies of network robustness with a focus on (1)~identifying robustness specifications in common use, (2)~understanding when these specifications are appropriate, and (3)~understanding the conditions under which one can expect different notions of robustness to yield similar results. With this review, we aim to give researchers an overview of the large, interdisciplinary body of work on network robustness and develop practical guidance for the design of computational experiments to study a network's robustness.</description>

      <title>Self-similarity of temporal interaction networks arises from hyperbolic geometry with time-varying curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The self-similarity of complex systems has been studied intensely across different domains due to its potential applications in system modeling, complexity analysis, etc., as well as for deep theoretical interest. Existing studies rely on scale transformations conceptualized over either a definite geometric structure of the system (very often realized as length-scale transformations) or purely temporal scale transformations. However, many physical and social systems are observed as temporal interactions among agents without any definitive geometry. Yet, one can imagine the existence of an underlying notion of distance as the interactions are mostly localized. Analysing only the time-scale transformations over such systems would uncover only a limited aspect of the complexity. In this work, we propose a novel technique of scale transformation that dissects temporal interaction networks under spatio-temporal scales, namely, flow scales. Upon experimenting with multiple social and biological interaction networks, we find that many of them possess a finite fractal dimension under flow-scale transformation. Finally, we relate the emergence of flow-scale self-similarity to the latent geometry of such networks. We observe strong evidence that justifies the assumption of an underlying, variable-curvature hyperbolic geometry that induces self-similarity of temporal interaction networks. Our work bears implications for modeling temporal interaction networks at different scales and uncovering their latent geometric structures.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning Discovers Efficient Decentralized Graph Path Search Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph path search is a classic computer science problem that has been recently approached with Reinforcement Learning (RL) due to its potential to outperform prior methods. Existing RL techniques typically assume a global view of the network, which is not suitable for large-scale, dynamic, and privacy-sensitive settings. An area of particular interest is search in social networks due to its numerous applications. Inspired by seminal work in experimental sociology, which showed that decentralized yet efficient search is possible in social networks, we frame the problem as a collaborative task between multiple agents equipped with a limited local view of the network. We propose a multi-agent approach for graph path search that successfully leverages both homophily and structural heterogeneity. Our experiments, carried out over synthetic and real-world social networks, demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms learned and heuristic baselines. Furthermore, our results show that meaningful embeddings for graph navigation can be constructed using reward-driven learning.</description>

      <title>Community detection in multi-layer networks by regularized debiased spectral clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Community detection is a crucial problem in the analysis of multi-layer networks. In this work, we introduce a new method, called regularized debiased sum of squared adjacency matrices (RDSoS), to detect latent communities in multi-layer networks. RDSoS is developed based on a novel regularized Laplacian matrix that regularizes the debiased sum of squared adjacency matrices. In contrast, the classical regularized Laplacian matrix typically regularizes the adjacency matrix of a single-layer network. Therefore, at a high level, our regularized Laplacian matrix extends the classical regularized Laplacian matrix to multi-layer networks. We establish the consistency property of RDSoS under the multi-layer stochastic block model (MLSBM) and further extend RDSoS and its theoretical results to the degree-corrected version of the MLSBM model. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is evaluated and demonstrated through synthetic and real datasets.</description>

      <title>Designing a Collaborative Platform for Advancing Supply Chain Transparency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Enabling supply chain transparency (SCT) is essential for regulatory compliance and meeting sustainability standards. Multi-tier SCT plays a pivotal role in identifying and mitigating an organization's operational, environmental, and social (ESG) risks. While research observes increasing efforts towards SCT, a minority of companies are currently publishing supply chain information. Using the Design Science Research approach, we develop a collaborative platform for supply chain transparency. We derive design requirements, formulate design principles, and evaluate the artefact with industry experts. Our artefact is initialized with publicly available supply chain data through an automated pipeline designed to onboard future participants to our platform. This work contributes to SCT research by providing insights into the challenges and opportunities of implementing multi-tier SCT and offers a practical solution that encourages organizations to participate in a transparent ecosystem.</description>

      <title>Estimating mixed memberships in multi-layer networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03916v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Community detection in multi-layer networks has emerged as a crucial area of modern network analysis. However, conventional approaches often assume that nodes belong exclusively to a single community, which fails to capture the complex structure of real-world networks where nodes may belong to multiple communities simultaneously. To address this limitation, we propose novel spectral methods to estimate the common mixed memberships in the multi-layer mixed membership stochastic block model. The proposed methods leverage the eigen-decomposition of three aggregate matrices: the sum of adjacency matrices, the debiased sum of squared adjacency matrices, and the sum of squared adjacency matrices. We establish rigorous theoretical guarantees for the consistency of our methods. Specifically, we derive per-node error rates under mild conditions on network sparsity, demonstrating their consistency as the number of nodes and/or layers increases under the multi-layer mixed membership stochastic block model. Our theoretical results reveal that the method leveraging the sum of adjacency matrices generally performs poorer than the other two methods for mixed membership estimation in multi-layer networks. We conduct extensive numerical experiments to empirically validate our theoretical findings. For real-world multi-layer networks with unknown community information, we introduce two novel modularity metrics to quantify the quality of mixed membership community detection. Finally, we demonstrate the practical applications of our algorithms and modularity metrics by applying them to real-world multi-layer networks, demonstrating their effectiveness in extracting meaningful community structures.</description>

Abstract: Graph outlier detection is a prominent task of research and application in the realm of graph neural networks. It identifies the outlier nodes that exhibit deviation from the majority in the graph. One of the fundamental challenges confronting supervised graph outlier detection algorithms is the prevalent issue of class imbalance, where the scarcity of outlier instances compared to normal instances often results in suboptimal performance. Conventional methods mitigate the imbalance by reweighting instances in the estimation of the loss function, assigning higher weights to outliers and lower weights to inliers. Nonetheless, these strategies are prone to overfitting and underfitting, respectively. Recently, generative models, especially diffusion models, have demonstrated their efficacy in synthesizing high-fidelity images. Despite their extraordinary generation quality, their potential in data augmentation for supervised graph outlier detection remains largely underexplored.
  To bridge this gap, we introduce GODM, a novel data augmentation for mitigating class imbalance in supervised Graph Outlier detection with latent Diffusion Models. Specifically, our proposed method consists of three key components: (1) Variantioanl Encoder maps the heterogeneous information inherent within the graph data into a unified latent space. (2) Graph Generator synthesizes graph data that are statistically similar to real outliers from latent space, and (3) Latent Diffusion Model learns the latent space distribution of real organic data by iterative denoising. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple datasets substantiate the effectiveness and efficiency of GODM. The case study further demonstrated the generation quality of our synthetic data. To foster accessibility and reproducibility, we encapsulate GODM into a plug-and-play package and release it at the Python Package Index (PyPI).</description>
