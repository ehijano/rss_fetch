      <title>Esakia's theorem for the amended monadic intuitionistic calculus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the amended monadic Grzegorczyk logic $\mathsf{M^+Grz}$ is the largest modal companion of the amended monadic intuitionistic logic $\mathsf{M^+IPC}$. Thus, unlike the monadic intuitionistic logic $\mathsf{MIPC}$, Esakia's theorem does extend to $\mathsf{M^+IPC}$.</description>

      <title>Model Theory of Generic Vector Space Endomorphisms II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper further studies the model companion of an endomorphism acting on a vector space, possibly with extra structure. Given a theory $T$ that $\varnothing$-defines an infinite $K$-vector space $\mathbb{V}$ in every model, we set $T_\theta := T \cup \{\text{``$\theta$ defines a $K$-endomorphism of $\mathbb{V}$"}\}$. We previously defined a family $\{T^C_\theta : C \in \mathcal{C}\}$ of extensions of $T_\theta$ which parameterizes all consistent extensions of the form $$
  T_\theta \cup \left\{\sum\nolimits_{k}\bigcap\nolimits_{l}\operatorname{Ker}(\rho_{j, k, l}[\theta]) = \sum\nolimits_{k}\bigcap\nolimits_{l} \operatorname{Ker}(\eta_{j, k, l}[\theta]) : j \in \mathcal{J}\right\}, $$ where all sums and intersections are finite, and all the $\rho[\theta]$'s and $\eta[\theta]$'s are polynomials over $K$ with $\theta$ plugged in. Notice that properties such as $\theta^2 - 2\operatorname{Id} = 0$ or ``$\rho[\theta]$ is injective for every $\rho \in K[X] \setminus \{0\}$" can be expressed in such a manner. We also presented a sufficient condition which implies that every $T^C_\theta$ has a model companion $T\theta^C$. Under this condition, we characterize all definable sets in $T\theta^C$ and use this to study the completions of $T\theta^C$, as well as the algebraic closure. If $T$ is o-minimal and extends $\operatorname{Th}(\mathbb{R}, &lt;)$, we prove that $T\theta^C$ has o-minimal open core.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.18349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study definable ranks of ordered fields, ordered abelian groups, and linear orders. For an arbitrary linear order $\Gamma$, we construct an ordered abelian group $G$ with archimedian spine $\Gamma$ and an ordered field $K$ with natural value group $G$ such that the definable ranks of $K$, $G$ and $\Gamma$ are all isomorphic. This answers a question of Krapp, Kuhlmann, and the second author.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The category of models of any theory $T$ in any first-order language $L$ has the surprising property that any small category that is elementarily equivalent with it, already embeds in it. The proof uses an abstract argument via ultrapowers, leaving one wonder which concrete categorical axioms, depending on $T$ and $L$, are responsible for this embedding result.
  We also propose a first-order logic for which equivalent categories are always elementarily equivalent.</description>

      <title>Undecidability of theories of semirings with fixed points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we prove the undecidability (and $\Sigma^0_1$-completeness) of several theories of semirings with fixed points. The generality of our results stems from recursion theoretic methods, namely the technique of effective inseperability. Our result applies to many theories proposed in the literature, including Conway $\mu$-semirings, Park $\mu$-semirings, and Chomsky algebras.</description>

      <title>Quasipolynomial behavior via constructability in multigraded algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Piecewise quasipolynomial growth of Presburger counting functions combines with tame persistent homology module theory to conclude piecewise quasipolynomial behavior of constructible families of finely graded modules over constructible commutative semigroup rings. Functorial preservation of constructibility for families under local cohomology, $\operatorname{Tor}$, and $\operatorname{Ext}$ yield piecewise quasipolynomial, quasilinear, or quasiconstant growth statements for length of local cohomology, $a$-invariants, regularity, depth; length of $\operatorname{Tor}$ and Betti numbers; length of $\operatorname{Ext}$ and Bass numbers; associated primes via $v$-invariants; and extended degrees, including the usual degree, Hilbert--Samuel multiplicity, arithmetic degree, and homological~degree.</description>

      <title>A logic for default deontic reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In many real-life settings, agents must navigate dynamic environments while reasoning under incomplete information and acting on a corpus of unstable, context-dependent, and often conflicting norms. We introduce a general, non-modal, proof-theoretic framework for deontic reasoning grounded in default logic. Its central feature is the notion of controlled sequent - a sequent annotated with sets of formulas (control sets) that prescribe what should or should not be entailed by the formulas in the antecedent. When combined with distinct extra-logical rules representing defaults and norms, these control sets record the conditions and constraints governing their applicability, thereby enabling local soundness checks for derived sequents. We prove that controlled sequent calculi satisfies admissibility of contraction and non-analytic cuts, and we establish their strong completeness with respect to credulous consequence in default theories and normative systems. Finally, we illustrate in depth how controlled sequent calculi provide a flexible and expressive basis for resolving deontic conflicts and capturing dynamic deontic notions via appropriate extra-logical rules.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.18891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that every categorical model of dependent type theory with dependent sums and products, intensional identity types and univalent universes presents via its $\infty$-localisation an elementary $\infty$-topos, that is, a finitely complete, locally cartesian closed $\infty$-category with enough univalent universal morphisms. We also show that elementary $\infty$-toposes have small subobject classifiers. To achieve this, we extend Joyal's theory of tribes by introducing the notion of a univalent tribe and a univalent fibration in a tribe.</description>

      <title>Conditioning Accept-Desirability models in the context of AGM-like belief change</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss conditionalisation for Accept-Desirability models in an abstract decision-making framework, where uncertain rewards live in a general linear space, and events are special projection operators on that linear space. This abstract setting allows us to unify classical and quantum probabilities, and extend them to an imprecise probabilities context. We introduce a new conditioning rule for our Accept-Desirability models, based on the idea that observing an event introduces new indifferences between options. We associate a belief revision operator with our conditioning rule, and investigate which of the AGM axioms for belief revision still hold in our more general framework. We investigate two interesting special cases where all of these axioms are shown to still hold: classical propositional logic and full conditional probabilities.</description>

      <title>The modal logic of arithmetic potentialism and the universal algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.04599</link>
      <description>arXiv:1801.04599v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I investigate the modal commitments of various conceptions of the philosophy of arithmetic potentialism. Specifically, I shall consider the potentialist conceptions arising from a model-theoretic view of the models of arithmetic as possible arithmetic realms of feasibility, considering them under their natural extension concepts, such as end-extensions, arbitrary extensions, conservative extensions and more, which in effect express distinct potentialist ideas. In these potentialist systems, I show, the propositional modal assertions that are valid with respect to all arithmetic assertions with parameters are exactly the assertions of S4. With respect to sentences, however, the validities of a model lie between S4 and S5, and these bounds are sharp in that there are models realizing both endpoints. For a model of arithmetic to validate S5 is precisely to fulfill the arithmetic maximality principle, which asserts that every possibly necessary statement is already true, and these models are equivalently characterized as those satisfying a maximal $\Sigma_1$ theory. The main S4 analysis makes fundamental use of the universal algorithm, of which this article provides a simplified, self-contained account. The main philosophical point is that fundamentally different potentialist conceptions -- linear inevitability, convergent potentialism and radical branching possibility -- are revealed by the precise modal validities of the corresponding potentialist systems in which those attitudes are expressed, and so it is important to discover them.</description>

      <title>A new decision method for Intuitionistic Logic by 3-valued non-deterministic truth-tables (pre-print version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.13664v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kurt G\"odel proved that it is not possible to characterize Intuitionistic Propositional Logic (IPL) by means of finite and deterministic truth-tables. After extending the same result with respect to non-deterministic matrices, we provide a semantical characterization of IPL by means of a 3-valued non-deterministic matrix with a restricted set of valuations. This structure allows to define an algorithm to delete unsound rows from the non-deterministic truth-tables generated for each formula, which constitutes a new and very simple decision procedure for IPL. This method can be seen as truth-tables in a broader sense, and a way to overcome G\"odel's limiting result.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13114v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present algebraic semantics for Continuous Propositional Logic, CPL, introduced by Itai Ben Yaacov, viewed as {\L}ukasiewicz propositional logic with a reversed truth-falsity orientation and enriched by a unary halving connective. We introduce continuous algebras as MV-algebras together with an unary operator $\kappa$ analogous to the halving operator introduced in CPL and analyze their core structural properties, including ideals, quotient constructions, and subdirect representations. We further establish a correspondence between continuous algebras and the class of 2-divisible $\ell u$-groups, extending Mundici's representation theory to the continuous setting. This correspondence leads to a purely algebraic proof of the weak completeness theorem for CPL.</description>

  We note an analogy between Tarski's notion of cylindric algebras, as a tool of algebraisation of first order logic, and Hilbert spaces which can serve the same purpose for continuous logic of physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01900v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We recast the well-known axiom system of quantum mechanics used by physicists (the Dirac calculus) in the language of Continuous Logic. For the basic version of the axiomatic system we prove that along with the canonical continuous model the axioms have approximate finite models of large sizes, in fact the continuous model is isomorphic to an ultraproduct of finite models. We analyse the continuous logic quantifier corresponding to Dirac integration and show that in finite context it has two versions, local and global, which coincide on Gaussian wave-functions.</description>

      <title>Partition Principle without Choice via Symmetric Iterations and Sheaf-Toposes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.07675v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the topos $\mathcal{E}=\mathsf{Sh}(H\ltimes 2^{\mathbb{N}})$ arising from a nontrivial finite group $H$ acting freely on Cantor space.
  Using a local embedding property for the relevant epimorphisms together with effective descent for monomorphisms,
  we show that the \emph{internal} set universe $V$ obtained from algebraic set theory (AST) inside $\mathcal{E}$
  satisfies the Partition Principle.
  On the other hand, the quotient $q:X\to X/H$ is a small epimorphism in $\mathcal{E}$ with no section,
  and this yields (via the display interpretation) an internal surjection in $V$ with no internal section; hence $V\models\neg\mathsf{AC}$.
  In summary, $\mathcal{E}$ contains an internal model of $\mathsf{IZF}+\mathsf{PP}+\neg\mathsf{AC}$
  (and if $\mathcal{E}$ is Boolean, equivalently after $\neg\neg$-sheafification, this upgrades to $\mathsf{ZF}+\mathsf{PP}+\neg\mathsf{AC}$).</description>

      <title>Ordinal Analysis of Well-Ordering Principles, Well Quasi-Orders Closure Properties, and $\Sigma_n$-Collection Schema</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11196v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of well quasi-orders, wqo, is a cornerstone of combinatorics and within wqo theory Kruskal's theorem plays a crucial role. Extending previous proof-theoretic results, we calculate the $\Pi^1_1$ ordinals of two different versions of labelled Kruskal's theorem: $\forall n \,$ $\mbox{KT}_\ell(n)$ and $\mbox{KT}_{\omega}(n)$; denoting, respectively, all the cases of labelled Kruskal's theorem for trees with an upper bound on the branching degree, and the standard Kruskal's theorem for labelled trees.
  In order to reach these computations, a key step is to move from Kruskal's theorem, which regards preservation of wqo's, to an equivalent Well-Ordering Principle (WOP), regarding instead preservation of well-orders. Given an ordinal function $g$, WOP$(g)$ amounts to the following principle $\forall X\, [\mbox{WO}(X) \rightarrow \mbox{WO}(g(X))]$, where $WO(X)$ states that ``$X$ is a well-order''. In our case, the two ordinal functions involved are ${g}_{\forall}(X)=\sup_{n}\vartheta(\Omega^n \cdot X)$ and ${g}_{\omega}(X)=\vartheta(\Omega^{\omega}\! \cdot X)$.
  In addition to the ordinal analysis of Kruskal's theorem and its related WOP, a series of Well Quasi-orders Principles (WQP) is considered. Given a set operation $G$ that preserves the property of being a wqo, its Well Quasi-orders closure Property, WQP$(G)$, is given by the principle $\forall Q\, [Q\, \mbox{wqo} \rightarrow G(Q)\, \mbox{wqo}]$. Conducting this study, unexpected connections with different principles arising from Ramsey and Computational theory, such as RT$^2_{&lt;\infty}$, CAC, ADS, RT$^1_{&lt;\infty}$, turn up.
  Lastly, extending and combining previous results, we achieve also the ordinal analysis of the collection schema $\mbox{B}\Sigma_n$.</description>

      <title>Logic-based analogical proportions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14402v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The author has recently introduced an abstract algebraic framework of analogical proportions within the general setting of universal algebra. The purpose of this paper is to lift that framework from universal algebra to the strictly more expressive setting of full first-order logic. We show that the so-obtained logic-based framework preserves all desired properties and we prove novel results in that extended setting.</description>
