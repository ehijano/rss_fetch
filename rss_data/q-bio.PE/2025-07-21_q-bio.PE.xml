      <title>Knowing when to stop: insights from ecology for building catalogues, collections, and corpora</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A major locus of musicological activity-increasingly in the digital domain-is the cataloguing of sources, which requires large-scale and long-lasting research collaborations. Yet, the databases aiming at covering and representing musical repertoires are never quite complete, and scholars must contend with the question: how much are we still missing? This question structurally resembles the 'unseen species' problem in ecology, where the true number of species must be estimated from limited observations. In this case study, we apply for the first time the common Chao1 estimator to music, specifically to Gregorian chant. We find that, overall, upper bounds for repertoire coverage of the major chant genres range between 50 and 80 %. As expected, we find that Mass Propers are covered better than the Divine Office, though not overwhelmingly so. However, the accumulation curve suggests that those bounds are not tight: a stable ~5% of chants in sources indexed between 1993 and 2020 was new, so diminishing returns in terms of repertoire diversity are not yet to be expected. Our study demonstrates that these questions can be addressed empirically to inform musicological data-gathering, showing the potential of unseen species models in musicology.</description>

      <title>Partitioning of Eddy Covariance Footprint Evapotranspiration Using Field Data, UAS Observations and GeoAI in the U.S. Chihuahuan Desert</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study proposes a new method for computing transpiration across an eddy covariance footprint using field observations of plant sap flow, phytomorphology sampling, uncrewed aerial system (UAS), deep learning-based digital image processing, and eddy covariance micrometeorological measurements. The method is applied to the Jornada Experimental Range, New Mexico, where we address three key questions: (1) What are the daily summer transpiration rates of Mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa) and Creosote (Larrea tridentata) individuals, and how do these species contribute to footprint-scale evapotranspiration? (2) How can the plant-level measurements be integrated for terrain-wide transpiration estimates? (3) What is the contribution of transpiration to total evapotranspiration within the eddy covariance footprint? Data collected from June to October 2022, during the North American Monsoon season, include hourly evapotranspiration and precipitation rates from the Ameriflux eddy covariance system (US Jo-1 Bajada site) and sap flux rates from heat-balance sensors. We used plant biometric measurements and supervised classification of multispectral imagery to upscale from the patch to footprint-scale estimations. A proportional relationship between the plant's horizontal projected area and the estimated number of water flow conduits was extended to the eddy covariance footprint via UAS data. Our results show that Mesquite's average daily summer transpiration is 2.84 mm/d, while Creosote's is 1.78 mm/d (a ratio of 1.6:1). The summer footprint integrated transpiration to evapotranspiration ratio (T/ET) was 0.50, decreasing to 0.44 during dry spells and increasing to 0.63 following significant precipitation. Further testing of this method is needed in different regions to validate its applicability. With appropriate adjustments, it could be relevant for other areas with similar ecological conditions.</description>

      <title>Constructing the Molecular Tree of Life using Assembly Theory and Mass Spectrometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09305v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Here we demonstrate the first biochemistry-agnostic approach to map evolutionary relationships at the molecular scale, allowing the construction of phylogenetic models using mass spectrometry (MS) and Assembly Theory (AT) without elucidating molecular identities. AT allows us to estimate the complexity of molecules by deducing the amount of shared information stored within them when . By examining 74 samples from a diverse range of biotic and abiotic sources, we used tandem MS data to detect 24102 analytes (9262 unique) and 59518 molecular fragments (6755 unique). Using this MS dataset, together with AT, we were able to infer the joint assembly spaces (JAS) of samples from molecular analytes. We show how JAS allows agnostic annotation of samples without fingerprinting exact analyte identities, facilitating accurate determination of their biogenicity and taxonomical grouping. Furthermore, we developed an AT-based framework to construct a biochemistry-agnostic phylogenetic tree which is consistent with genome-based models and outperforms other similarity-based algorithms. Finally, we were able to use AT to track colony lineages of a single bacterial species based on phenotypic variation in their molecular composition with high accuracy, which would be challenging to track with genomic data. Our results demonstrate how AT can expand causal molecular inference to non-sequence information without requiring exact molecular identities, thereby opening the possibility to study previously inaccessible biological domains.</description>

      <title>Basic offspring number and robust feedback design for the biological control of vectors by sterile insect release technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23729v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sterile Insect Technique (SIT) is a promising control method against insect pests and insect vectors. It consists in releasing males previously sterilized in laboratory, in order to reduce or eliminate a specific wild population. We study in this paper the implementation by feedback control of SIT-based elimination campaign of Aedes mosquitoes. We provide state-feedback and output-feedback control laws and establish their convergence, as well as their robustness properties. In this design procedure, a pivotal role is played by the average number of secondary female insects produced by a single female insect, called basic offspring number, and by the use of properties of monotone systems. Illustrative simulations are provided.</description>

      <title>Carbon removal capacity estimation of taiga reforestation and afforestation at the western boreal edge using spatially explicit carbon budget modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12331v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Canada's northern boreal forest edge offers considerable potential for climate change mitigation through large-scale tree planting. Afforestation in these sparsely forested regions could assist the natural northward migration of forests while capitalizing on their carbon removal capacity. However, the sequestration potential is uncertain due to a lack of spatially explicit models. This study uses Monte Carlo estimates and a carbon budget model to quantify the carbon removal capacity of afforestation at the northwestern boreal edge from 2025 to 2100. We combined satellite inventory data and probabilistic fire regime representations to simulate total ecosystem carbon under scenarios considering fire return intervals, land classes, planting mortality, and climate variables. Our results indicate that afforesting ~6.4-32 million hectares could sequester ~3.88-19.4 Gigatonnes of $CO_{2}$e over the next 75 years, with the Taiga Shield West ecozone showing the most potential. Even the conservative estimate (3.88 Gt$CO_{2}$e) is over five times Canada's total annual greenhouse gas emissions, making it a substantial contribution toward the nation's 2050 net-zero goal. Further research is needed to refine these estimates, assess economic viability, and investigate impacts on regional processes like permafrost thaw and surface albedo.</description>
