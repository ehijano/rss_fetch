      <title>Unified Lorentz-covariant Poisson Bracket for the Electrodynamics of a Point Particle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the multisymplectic Hamiltonian formalism, we propose a Poisson bracket for the electromagnetic field that, in addition to satisfying the restricted principle of relativity, reproduces well-established results from the standard formulations of field theories. To this end, it is necessary to translate the multisymplectic description of the system to the field's momentum representation, where a bilinear and Lorentz-covariant form emerges in a straightforward manner. Consequently, we establish a description for a system consisting of an electromagnetic field and a point particle interacting with each other that is based on a single Lorentz-covariant Poisson bracket with respect to all the canonical variables of the system. The results obtained from this proposal offer a solid foundation for the development of a Lorentz-covariant quantization process.</description>

      <title>Quasicoherent states of noncommutative D2-branes, Aharonov-Bohm effect and quantum Mobius strip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We find an analytical formula for the quasicoherent states of 3D fuzzy spaces defined by algebras generated by bosonic creation and annihilation operators. This one is expressed in a representation onto the coherent states of the CCR algebra. Such a fuzzy space can be assimilated to a noncommutative D2-brane of the M-theory (but also as a model of a qubit in contact with a bosonic environment). We apply this formula onto a D2-brane wrapped around an axis to obtain the geometry of a noncommutative cylinder. We show that the adiabatic transport of its quasicoherent states exhibits a topological effect similar to the Aharonov-Bohm effect. We study also a D2-brane wrapped and twisted to have the geometry of a noncommutative Mobius strip. Finally we briefly present the other two examples of a noncommutative torus and of a noncommutative Klein bottle.</description>

      <title>An integrable Anderson-impurity problem embedded in the one-dimensional Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An exactly solvable one-dimensional Hubbard model with a single Anderson impurity embedded at the boundary is constructed in the framework of the quantum inverse scattering method. The model is solved exactly by the nested Bethe ansatz method. We identify the boundary bound states and determine the ground state phase diagram. By deriving the impurity contribution to the magnetic susceptibility, we show that in the dilute electron limit, a nearly free local moment forms at the impurity site, while at finite electron densities, the impurity spin is screened by the host electrons, consistent with Kondo physics.</description>

      <title>On the magnetization of electronic ground states in frustrated superstable graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07079v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Geometric frustration lies at the heart of many unconventional quantum phases in strongly interacting electron systems. Here, we analytically determine the ground state magnetization of the half-filled Hubbard model on frustrated geometries where superstable states -- eigenstates which are robust against frustration -- are manifest. Our results apply to a broad class of lattices, including those where altermagnetic and superconducting states are known to emerge. Furthermore, they provide evidence for phase transitions involving a geometric rearrangement of magnetic correlations in the thermodynamic limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The onset of Bose-Einstein condensation in systems with { various} densities of states is examined, with particular attention to the role of the behavior of their {energy} spectrum at low and high energies. Specifically, the results of Chatterjee and Diaconis, which rely exclusively on the high-energy behavior, are compared and reconciled with those of the standard physics approach, where the existence of condensation is determined by the low-energy behavior.</description>

      <title>Clifford quantum cellular automata from topological quantum field theories and invertible subalgebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a general framework for constructing quantum cellular automata (QCA) from topological quantum field theories (TQFT) and invertible subalgebras (ISA) using the cup-product formalism. This approach explicitly realizes all $\mathbb{Z}_2$ and $\mathbb{Z}_p$ Clifford QCAs (for prime $p$) in all admissible dimensions, in precise agreement with the classification predicted by algebraic $L$-theory. We determine the orders of these QCAs by explicitly showing that finite powers reduce to the identity up to finite-depth quantum circuits (FDQC) and lattice translations. In particular, we demonstrate that the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Clifford QCAs in $(4l+1)$ spatial dimensions can be disentangled by non-Clifford FDQCs. Our construction applies beyond cubic lattices, allowing $\mathbb{Z}_2$ QCAs to be defined on arbitrary cellulations. Furthermore, we explicitly construct invertible subalgebras in higher dimensions, obtaining $\mathbb{Z}_2$ ISAs in $2l$ spatial dimensions and $\mathbb{Z}_p$ ISAs in $(4l-2)$ spatial dimensions. These ISAs give rise to $\mathbb{Z}_2$ QCAs in $(2l+1)$ dimensions and $\mathbb{Z}_p$ QCAs in $(4l-1)$ dimensions. Together, these results establish a unified and dimension-periodic framework for Clifford QCAs, connecting their explicit lattice realizations to field theories.</description>

      <title>An Egorov Theorem for Wasserstein Distances</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07185v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a new version of Egorov's theorem formulated in the Schr\"{o}dinger picture of quantum mechanics, using the $p$-Wasserstein metric applied to the Husimi functions of quantum states. The special case $p=1$ corresponds to a "low-regularity" Egorov theorem, while larger values $p&gt;1$ yield progressively stronger estimates. As a byproduct of our analysis, we prove an optimal transport inequality analogous to a result of Golse and Paul in the context of mean-field many-body quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Construction of the Jaynes-Cummings interaction over the finite two-dimensional oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interaction between a two-level atom and the finite two-dimensional oscillator in the Cartesian coordinate system is addressed. The construction of the coupling between the degenerate energy states of the finite oscillator and the two levels of the atom allows the identification of an excitation-conserved eigenbasis. A dynamical approach to the evolution of mean values of the fields mediated by the atom is shown in the interaction picture. As an example, the eigenenergies states and $\mathfrak{su}(2)$ coherent states are studied. Perspectives and prospectives are given to settle a path in the study of atomic systems coupled to finite versions of the harmonic oscillator.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a class of lubrication-type equations modeling the spread of thin poroelastic biofilms at air/agar interfaces. Starting from a biofilm slab model, we perform a formal multi-scale asymptotic expansion to derive a reduced nonlinear evolution equation with time-dependent coefficients. First, we establish a local-in-time existence result as well as a continuation criteria. Moreover, under suitable assumptions on the radius of the biofilm, we show the existence of global in time solutions. We conclude with some numerical simulations illustrating the emergence of instabilities and potential singularities in finite time.</description>

      <title>Performance enhancement in Josephson traveling wave parametric amplifiers by tailoring the relative distance between junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Josephson traveling wave parametric amplifiers with heterogeneously spaced junctions are theoretically investigated. We consider unit cells with three junctions and characterize their interaction by spatially displaced fields defined by node fluxes. To solve this problem we define the system action and apply the variational principle to obtain the static action, which determines the equations of motion. This work shows that gain and bandwidth can be increased by modifying the relative distance between junctions within the same unit cell, thus increasing the effective nonlinear interaction. We find an optimal sub-unit-cell size ratio, which maximizes both gain and bandwidth, while equally spaced junctions offer minimum performance. Even though this method does not rely on phase-matching, the same device can operate at different pump frequencies, it requires a very large number of JJs to achieve gains above 20 dB. We show that this method can be combined with resonant-phase matching and predicts an ideal gain above 29 dB on a 4 GHz bandwidth with 1998 junctions. Despite possible challenges fabricating devices at the optimal sub-unit-cell size with current technologies, substantial gain increase can still be achieved at sub-optimal sizes.</description>

      <title>Vanishing of the $H^3$ obstruction for time-reversal symmetry in (2+1)D abelian bosonic TQFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In $(2+1)$-dimensional topological quantum field theories (TQFTs), the action of a global symmetry group on the anyon system is one of the central topics of research. Owing to the subtle categorical nature of anyons, such group actions do not automatically satisfy associativity. The obstruction is captured by a cohomology class, known as the $H^3$ obstruction, whose presence signals a failure of group associativity. In these cases, the symmetry structure is no longer described by an ordinary group, but instead by a $2$-group -- a group-like structure extended by a $1$-form symmetry. In this short note, we prove that the $H^3$ obstruction for time-reversal symmetry always vanishes in abelian bosonic TQFTs.</description>

      <title>A set of master variables for the two-star random graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The two-star random graph is the simplest exponential random graph model with nontrivial interactions between the graph edges. We propose a set of auxiliary variables that control the thermodynamic limit where the number of vertices N tends to infinity. Such 'master variables' are usually highly desirable in treatments of 'large N' statistical field theory problems. For the dense regime when a finite fraction of all possible edges are filled, this construction recovers the mean field solution of Park and Newman, but with an explicit control over the 1/N corrections. We use this advantage to compute the first subleading correction to the Park-Newman result, which encodes the finite, nonextensive contribution to the free energy. For the sparse regime with a finite mean degree, we obtain a very compact derivation of the Annibale-Courtney solution, originally developed with the use of functional integrals, which is comfortably bypassed in our treatment.</description>

      <title>Gauge Theory and Integrability: An Overview</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While general quantum field theories (QFTs) have yet to be rigorously defined in mathematics, they have generated new mathematics and have served as a unifying principle connecting different branches of the subject. In 1989, Witten made a profound impact on the mathematical community by systematically constructing knot invariants via the three-dimensional Chern-Simons theory. One of the historical roots of knot invariants was integrable models, whose explanation in terms of QFT remained unsolved for decades. Recently, this problem was solved by a perturbative analysis of the four-dimensional Chern-Simons theory, which provides a novel framework for understanding and unifying many different aspects of integrable models. In this article, we summarize the basic aspects of these developments for non-experts in both physics and mathematics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb V$ be an $\mathbb N$-graded, $C_2$-cofinite vertex operator algebra (VOA) admitting a non-lowest generated module in $\mathrm{Mod}(\mathbb V)$ (e.g., the triplet algebras $\mathcal{W}_p$ for $p\in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 2}$ or the even symplectic fermion VOAs $SF_d^+$ for $d\in \mathbb{Z}_+$). We prove that, unlike in the rational case, the spaces of conformal blocks associated to certain $\mathbb V$-modules do not form a vector bundle on $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{0,N}$ for $N\geq 4$ by showing that their dimensions differ between nodal and smooth curves. Consequently, the sheaf of coinvariants associated to these $\mathbb V$-modules on $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{0,N}$ is not locally free for $N\geq 4$. It also follows that, unlike in the rational case, the mode transition algebra $\mathfrak A$ introduced by Damiolini-Gibney-Krashen is not isomorphic to the end $\mathbb E=\int_{\mathbb X\in \mathrm{Mod}(\mathbb X)}\mathbb X\otimes \mathbb{X}'$ as an object of $\mathrm{Mod}(\mathbb{V}^{\otimes 2})$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work describes models and numerical approximations that describe the mechanical behavior of deformable continua with embedded structural members, such as rigid bodies, beams, shells, etc. The continuum formulation extends an idea first presented in the context of the Arlequin method and constrains the kinematics of the two types of bodies to be compatible in the energy sense. In the article, we exploit the shared similarities of all structural theories to introduce a general framework for energetically coupling the latter with continua. In addition, we show that the problems, as well as their finite element approximations, are well-posed. Numerical examples of bodies with inclusions, fibers, and embedded surfaces are provided to illustrate the generality and robustness of the approach.</description>

This extension includes processes in the locally $C^{*}$-algebras of [CHP25] used to localise singular stochastic partial differential equations involving fermions, as well as processes in Banach algebras such as infinite-dimensional semicircular\circular Brownian motion, and more generally the $q$-Gaussians of [BS91, BKS97, Bo\.z99].
  A new challenge we encounter in the $q$-Gaussian setting with $q \in (-1,1)$ are noncommutative renormalisation estimates where we must estimate operators in homogeneous $q$-Gaussian chaoses with arbitrary operator insertions. We introduce a new Banach algebra norm on $q$-Gaussian operators that allows us to control such insertions; we believe this construction could be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Diagonal invariants and genus-zero Hurwitz Frobenius manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05165v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Frobenius manifold structure on the space of rational functions with multiple simple poles is constructed. In particular, the dependence of the Saito-flat coordinates on the flat coordinates of the intersection form is studied. While some of the individual flat coordinates are complicated rational functions, they appear in the prepotential in certain combinations known as diagonal invariants, which turn out to be polynomial. Two classes are studied in more detail. These are generalisations of the Coxeter and extended-affine-Weyl orbits space for the group $W=W(A_\ell)\,.$ An invariant theory is also developed.</description>

      <title>Maximally-stable Local Optima in Random Graphs and Spin Glasses: Phase Transitions and Universality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.03591v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider $h$-stable local optima of Ising spin glass models, defined as spin configurations such that for nearly all of the spins, flipping their values results in increasing energy by at least a given amount $h$. Spins satisfying this condition are referred to as $h$-stable spins for that configuration. Similarly, we consider a very related notion of $h$-friendly partitions of a graph. These are defined as bi-partitionings such that for most nodes, the normalized number of neighbors within the node's partition exceed the normalized number of neighbors outside the partition by a certain amount $h$. For spin glasses as well as sparse and dense random graphs, while restricting to bisections, we prove the existence of a phase transition for the normalized energy level $h$ around a universal value $h^*$. For $h$ below the phase transition value $h^*$, bisections exist where the number of spins (nodes) which are not $h$-stable (not $h$-friendly) is sublinear. Above the phase transition level $h^*$ the smallest number of spins that are not $h$-stable (not $h$-friendly) is linear. This confirms a conjecture from Behrens et al. (2022). Our results also allow the characterization of possible energy values of stable local optima for varying $h$. In particular, for $h=0$, this rigorously proves seminal results in statistical physics regarding the so-called metastable states, such as in the work of Bray and Moore (1981). Our results extend a recent proof of the so-called Friendly Partition Conjecture in Ferber et al. (2022) from the case $h=0$ to the case when $h$ takes general values. Our proofs are obtained by analyzing the model on sparse random graphs and adopting Lindeberg's type universality method to lift the results from sparse to dense graphs and spin systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07381v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a purely Lie algebraic formalization of the Feigin--Tipunin's geometric construction of logarithmic CFTs/VOAs. After reformulating the geometric representation theory of FT construction under this new setting, within this framework, we uniformly construct the (multiplet) principal W-algebras at positive integer level associated with any simple Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ and Lie superalgebra $\mathfrak{osp}(1|2r)$, thereby establishing Weyl-type character formulas and simplicity theorems that extend the second author's previous results.</description>

      <title>Nonabelian ferromagnets with three-body interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19916v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the thermodynamics of nonabelian ferromagnets consisting of atoms in the fundamental representation of $SU(N)$ and interacting with two-body and three-body interactions. Using a mean field approach, we uncover an intricate phase structure, depending on the relative strength and sign of the two-body and three-body coupling constants. In the case where two-body interactions are ferromagnetic and three-body ones are antiferromagnetic, we uncover a rich cascade of phase transitions, the appearance of phases with two distinct polarization directions being the most striking novel feature. Our results are relevant to magnetic systems where higher-body interactions cannot be neglected.</description>

      <title>Characterizing the Kirkwood-Dirac positivity on second countable LCA groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23628v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define the Kirkwood-Dirac quasiprobability representation of quantum mechanics associated with the Fourier transform over second countable locally compact abelian groups. We discuss its link with the Kohn-Nirenberg quantization of the phase space $G\times \widehat{G}$. We use it to argue that in this abstract setting the Wigner-Weyl quantization, when it exists, can still be interpreted as a symmetric ordering. Then, we identify all generalized (non-normalizable) pure states having a positive Kirkwood-Dirac distribution. They are, up to the natural action of the Weyl-Heisenberg group, Haar measures on closed subgroups. This generalizes a result known for finite abelian groups. We then show that the classical fragment of quantum mechanics associated with the Kirkwood-Dirac distribution is non-trivial if and only if the group has a compact connected component. Finally, we provide for connected compact abelian groups a complete geometric description of this classical fragment.</description>

      <title>On the Equivalence of Koopman Eigenfunctions and Commuting Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02437v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Koopman operator framework offers a way to represent a nonlinear system as a linear one. The key to this simplification lies in the identification of eigenfunctions. While various data-driven algorithms have been developed for this problem, a theoretical characterization of Koopman eigenfunctions from geometric properties of the flow is still missing. This paper provides such a characterization by establishing an equivalence between a set of Koopman eigenfunctions and a set of commuting symmetries -- both assumed to span the tangent spaces at every point on a simply connected open set. Based on this equivalence, we build an explicit and convergent formula for the principal Koopman eigenfunctions defined on the region of attraction of a locally asymptotically stable equilibrium point, thereby offering a constructive formula to compute Koopman eigenfunctions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.03731v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a new proof of the operator extension of the strong subadditivity of von Neumann entropy $\rho_{AB} \otimes \sigma_{C}^{-1} \leq \rho_{A} \otimes \sigma_{BC}^{-1}$ by identifying the mathematical structure behind it as Connes' theory of spatial derivatives. This immediately generalizes the inequality to arbitrary inclusions of von Neumann algebras. In the case of standard representations, it reduces to the monotonicity of the relative modular operator.</description>

      <title>Detecting $k$-nonstretchability via a class of informationally complete symmetric measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12817v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Characterizing multipartite entanglement is a fundamental problem in quantum information theory. The concept of $k$-stretchability [Szalay, Quantum 3, 204 (2019)] provides a framework for describing multipartite entanglement structures. We investigate the detection of $k$-nonstretchability using informationally complete $(s,t)$-POVMs [Siudzi$\textrm{\'{n}}$ska, Phys. Rev. A 105, 042209 (2022)], which encompass GSIC-POVMs and MUMs. Several criteria for $k$-nonstretchability in multipartite quantum systems are established. These criteria identify classes of $k$-nonstretchable states, and their applicability and advantages are demonstrated through explicit examples.</description>

      <title>Surface sums in two-dimensional large-$N$ lattice Yang--Mills: Cancellations and explicit computations for general loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13827v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the context of two-dimensional large-$N$ lattice Yang--Mills theory, we perform a refined study of the surface sums defined in the companion work [BCSK24]. In this setting, the surface sums are a priori expected to exhibit significant simplifications because two-dimensional Yang--Mills theory is a special model that admits many known exact formulas. Thus, a natural problem is to understand these simplifications directly from the perspective of the surface sums. Towards this goal, we develop a key new tool in the form of a surface exploration algorithm (or "peeling process"), which, at each step, carefully selects the next edge to explore. Using this algorithm, we manage to find many cancellations in the surface sums, thereby obtaining a detailed understanding of precisely which surfaces remain after cancellation. As a consequence, we obtain many new explicit formulas for Wilson loop expectations of general loops in the large-$N$ limit of lattice Yang--Mills in two dimensions and prove a convergence result for the empirical spectral measure of any simple loop.</description>

      <title>Spectral Methods in Complex Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05793v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: These notes offer a unified introduction to spectral methods for the study of complex systems. They are intended as an operative manual rather than a theorem-proof textbook: the emphasis is on tools, identities, and perspectives that can be readily applied across disciplines. Beginning with a compendium of matrix identities and inversion techniques, the text develops the connections between spectra, dynamics, and structure in finite-dimensional systems. Applications range from dynamical stability and random walks on networks to input-output economics, PageRank, epidemic spreading, memristive circuits, synchronization phenomena, and financial stability. Throughout, the guiding principle is that eigenvalues, eigenvectors, and resolvent operators provide a common language linking problems in physics, mathematics, computer science, and beyond. The presentation is informal, accessible to advanced undergraduates, yet broad enough to serve as a reference for researchers interested in spectral approaches to complex systems.</description>
