      <title>Toward Trusted Onboard AI: Advancing Small Satellite Operations using Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A RL (Reinforcement Learning) algorithm was developed for command automation onboard a 3U CubeSat. This effort focused on the implementation of macro control action RL, a technique in which an onboard agent is provided with compiled information based on live telemetry as its observation. The agent uses this information to produce high-level actions, such as adjusting attitude to solar pointing, which are then translated into control algorithms and executed through lower-level instructions. Once trust in the onboard agent is established, real-time environmental information can be leveraged for faster response times and reduced reliance on ground control. The approach not only focuses on developing an RL algorithm for a specific satellite but also sets a precedent for integrating trusted AI into onboard systems. This research builds on previous work in three areas: (1) RL algorithms for issuing high-level commands that are translated into low-level executable instructions; (2) the deployment of AI inference models interfaced with live operational systems, particularly onboard spacecraft; and (3) strategies for building trust in AI systems, especially for remote and autonomous applications. Existing RL research for satellite control is largely limited to simulation-based experiments; in this work, these techniques are tailored by constructing a digital twin of a specific spacecraft and training the RL agent to issue macro actions in this simulated environment. The policy of the trained agent is copied to an isolated environment, where it is fed compiled information about the satellite to make inference predictions, thereby demonstrating the RL algorithm's validity on orbit without granting it command authority. This process enables safe comparison of the algorithm's predictions against actual satellite behavior and ensures operation within expected parameters.</description>

      <title>Optimal Planning for Enhancing the Resilience of Modern Distribution Systems Against Cyberattacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing integration of IoT-connected devices in smart grids has introduced new vulnerabilities at the distribution level. Of particular concern is the potential for cyberattacks that exploit high-wattage IoT devices, such as EV chargers, to manipulate local demand and destabilize the grid. While previous studies have primarily focused on such attacks at the transmission level, this paper investigates their feasibility and impact at the distribution level. We examine how cyberattackers can target voltage-sensitive nodes, especially those exposed by the presence of high-consumption devices, to cause voltage deviation and service disruption. Our analysis demonstrates that conventional grid protections are insufficient against these intelligent, localized attacks. To address this, we propose resilience strategies using distributed generation (DGs), exploring their role in preemptive planning. This research highlights the urgent need for distribution-level cyber resilience planning in smart grids.</description>

      <title>Safe and Efficient Data-driven Connected Cruise Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we design a safe and efficient cruise control for the connected automated vehicle with access to motion information from multiple vehicles ahead via vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication. Position and velocity data collected from a chain of human-driven vehicles are systematically leveraged to design a connected cruise controller that smoothly responds to traffic perturbations while maximizing energy efficiency. A safety filter derived from a control barrier function provides the safety guarantee. We investigate the proposed control design's energy performance against real traffic datasets and quantify the safety filter's energy impact. It is shown that optimally utilizing V2V connectivity reduces energy consumption by more than 10\% compared to standard non-connected adaptive cruise control. Meanwhile, interesting interplays between safety filter and energy efficiency design are highlighted, revealing future research directions.</description>

      <title>Design and Experimental Validation of UAV Swarm-Based Phased Arrays with MagSafe- and LEGO-Inspired RF Connectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel UAV swarm-based phased array antenna system that leverages MagSafe- and LEGO-inspired radio frequency (RF) connectors to address key challenges in distributed phased arrays, including inter-element oscillator synchronization, localization, phase coherence, and positional accuracy. The proposed non-threaded, hands-free connectors enable precise inter-element spacing and establish a continuous, low-loss RF signal propagation path during mid-flight docking. A multi-stage optimization of the RF connector achieves a compact form factor, DC-to-RF bandwidth, and a measured insertion loss as low as 0.2\,dB. The system architecture offers scalability in gain and frequency by adjusting the array element density per UAV and UAV dimensions. Experimental results from both stationary and in-flight tests of two UAV-based phased array prototypes align closely with simulations, demonstrating robust beam steering to multiple directions. This work delivers a practical, scalable, and low-complexity platform that enables rapid deployment for next-generation airborne communications, radar, and remote sensing applications.</description>

      <title>Assessing Value of Renewable-based VPP Versus Electrical Storage: Multi-market Participation Under Different Scheduling Regimes and Uncertainties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper compares the participation of Renewable-only Virtual Power Plants (RVPPs) and grid-scale Electrical Storage Systems (ESSs) in energy and reserve markets, evaluating their technical performance, market strategies, and economic outcomes. To ensure a fair comparison, scheduling is analyzed over representative sample days that capture seasonal operating regimes, and the associated uncertainties are explicitly modeled. Two-stage robust optimization frameworks are employed: the RVPP model addresses price, generation, and demand uncertainties, whereas the ESS model considers price uncertainty only. In addition, an algorithm is proposed for sizing the ESS so that its market performance matches that of the RVPP. Simulations cover both favorable and unfavorable scenarios, reflecting seasonal energy limits for dispatchable resources, varying forecast errors for nondispatchable resources, and alternative uncertainty-management strategies. The results provide operators with quantitative guidance on the relative value of each approach.</description>

      <title>Safe Deployment of Offline Reinforcement Learning via Input Convex Action Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (offline RL) offers a promising framework for developing control strategies in chemical process systems using historical data, without the risks or costs of online experimentation. This work investigates the application of offline RL to the safe and efficient control of an exothermic polymerisation continuous stirred-tank reactor. We introduce a Gymnasium-compatible simulation environment that captures the reactor's nonlinear dynamics, including reaction kinetics, energy balances, and operational constraints. The environment supports three industrially relevant scenarios: startup, grade change down, and grade change up. It also includes reproducible offline datasets generated from proportional-integral controllers with randomised tunings, providing a benchmark for evaluating offline RL algorithms in realistic process control tasks.
  We assess behaviour cloning and implicit Q-learning as baseline algorithms, highlighting the challenges offline agents face, including steady-state offsets and degraded performance near setpoints. To address these issues, we propose a novel deployment-time safety layer that performs gradient-based action correction using input convex neural networks (PICNNs) as learned cost models. The PICNN enables real-time, differentiable correction of policy actions by descending a convex, state-conditioned cost surface, without requiring retraining or environment interaction.
  Experimental results show that offline RL, particularly when combined with convex action correction, can outperform traditional control approaches and maintain stability across all scenarios. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of integrating offline RL with interpretable and safety-aware corrections for high-stakes chemical process control, and lay the groundwork for more reliable data-driven automation in industrial systems.</description>

      <title>Distributed Average Consensus in Wireless Multi-Agent Systems with Over-the-Air Aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the average consensus problem of multi-agent systems over wireless networks. We propose a distributed average consensus algorithm by invoking the concept of over-the-air aggregation, which exploits the signal superposition property of wireless multiple-access channels. The proposed algorithm deploys a modified version of the well-known Ratio Consensus algorithm with an additional normalization step for compensating for the arbitrary channel coefficients. We show that, when the noise level at the receivers is negligible, the algorithm converges asymptotically to the average for time-invariant and time-varying channels. Numerical simulations corroborate the validity of our results.</description>

      <title>Malleability-Resistant Encrypted Control System with Disturbance Compensation and Real-Time Attack Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study proposes an encrypted PID control system with a disturbance observer (DOB) using a keyed-homomorphic encryption (KHE) scheme, aiming to achieve control performance while providing resistance to malleability-based attacks. The controller integrates a DOB with a PID structure to compensate for modeling uncertainties by estimating and canceling external disturbances. To enhance security, the system is designed to output error symbols when ciphertexts are falsified during decryption or evaluation, enabling real-time detection of malleability-based signal or parameter falsification. To validate the proposed method, we conduct stage positioning control experiments and attack detection tests using an industrial linear stage. The results show that the encrypted DOB-based PID controller outperforms a conventional encrypted PID controller in terms of tracking accuracy. Furthermore, the system successfully detects two types of malleability-based attacks: one that destabilizes the control system, and another that degrades its performance. The primary contributions of this study are: (i) the implementation of a KHE-based encrypted DOB-PID controller, (ii) the improvement of control performance under uncertainties, and (iii) the experimental demonstration of attack detection capabilities in encrypted control systems.</description>

      <title>Foundations for Energy-Aware Zero-Energy Devices: From Energy Sensing to Adaptive Protocols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zero-energy devices (ZEDs) are key enablers of sustainable Internet of Things networks by operating solely on harvested ambient energy. Their limited and dynamic energy budget calls for protocols that are energy-aware and intelligently adaptive. However, designing effective energy-aware protocols for ZEDs requires theoretical models that realistically reflect device constraints. Indeed, existing approaches often oversimplify key aspects such as energy information (EI) acquisition, task-level variability, and energy storage dynamics, limiting their practical relevance and transferability. This article addresses this gap by offering a structured overview of the key modeling components, trade-offs, and limitations involved in energy-aware ZED protocol design. For this, we dissect EI acquisition methods and costs, characterize core operational tasks, analyze energy usage models and storage constraints, and review representative protocol strategies. Moreover, we offer design insights and guidelines on how ZED operation protocols can leverage EI, often illustrated through selected in-house examples. Finally, we outline key research directions to inspire more efficient and scalable protocol solutions for future ZEDs.</description>

      <title>Of Good Demons and Bad Angels: Guaranteeing Safe Control under Finite Precision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As neural networks (NNs) become increasingly prevalent in safety-critical neural network-controlled cyber-physical systems (NNCSs), formally guaranteeing their safety becomes crucial. For these systems, safety must be ensured throughout their entire operation, necessitating infinite-time horizon verification. To verify the infinite-time horizon safety of NNCSs, recent approaches leverage Differential Dynamic Logic (dL). However, these dL-based guarantees rely on idealized, real-valued NN semantics and fail to account for roundoff errors introduced by finite-precision implementations. This paper bridges the gap between theoretical guarantees and real-world implementations by incorporating robustness under finite-precision perturbations -- in sensing, actuation, and computation -- into the safety verification. We model the problem as a hybrid game between a good Demon, responsible for control actions, and a bad Angel, introducing perturbations. This formulation enables formal proofs of robustness w.r.t. a given (bounded) perturbation. Leveraging this bound, we employ state-of-the-art mixed-precision fixed-point tuners to synthesize sound and efficient implementations, thus providing a complete end-to-end solution. We evaluate our approach on case studies from the automotive and aeronautics domains, producing efficient NN implementations with rigorous infinite-time horizon safety guarantees.</description>

      <title>Cluster Synchronization and Phase Cohesiveness of Kuramoto Oscillators via Mean-phase Feedback Control and Pacemakers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brain networks typically exhibit characteristic synchronization patterns where several synchronized clusters coexist. On the other hand, neurological disorders are considered to be related to pathological synchronization such as excessive synchronization of large populations of neurons. Motivated by these phenomena, this paper presents two approaches to control the cluster synchronization and the cluster phase cohesiveness of Kuramoto oscillators. One is based on feeding back the mean phases to the clusters, and the other is based on the use of pacemakers. First, we show conditions on the feedback gains and the pacemaker weights for the network to achieve cluster synchronization. Then, we propose a method to find optimal feedback gains through convex optimization. Second, we show conditions on the feedback gains and the pacemaker weights for the network to achieve cluster phase cohesiveness. A numerical example demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address numerical differentiation under coarse, non-uniform sampling and Gaussian noise. A maximum-likelihood estimator with $L_2$-norm constraint on a higher-order derivative is obtained, yielding spline-based solution. We introduce a non-standard parameterization of quadratic splines and develop recursive online algorithms. Two formulations -- quadratic and zero-order -- offer tradeoff between smoothness and computational speed. Simulations demonstrate superior performance over high-gain observers and super-twisting differentiators under coarse sampling and high noise, benefiting systems where higher sampling rates are impractical.</description>

      <title>Deployment of Objects with a Soft Everting Robot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Soft everting robots present significant advantages over traditional rigid robots, including enhanced dexterity, improved environmental interaction, and safe navigation in unpredictable environments. While soft everting robots have been widely demonstrated for exploration type tasks, their potential to move and deploy payloads in such tasks has been less investigated, with previous work focusing on sensors and tools for the robot. Leveraging the navigation capabilities, and deployed body, of the soft everting robot to deliver payloads in hazardous areas, e.g. carrying a water bottle to a person stuck under debris, would represent a significant capability in many applications. In this work, we present an analysis of how soft everting robots can be used to deploy larger, heavier payloads through the inside of the robot. We analyze both what objects can be deployed and what terrain features they can be carried through. Building on existing models, we present methods to quantify the effects of payloads on robot growth and self-support, and develop a model to predict payload slip. We then experimentally quantify payload transport using soft everting robot with a variety of payload shapes, sizes, and weights and though a series of tasks: steering, vertical transport, movement through holes, and movement across gaps. Overall, the results show that we can transport payloads in a variety of shapes and up to 1.5kg in weight and that we can move through circular apertures with as little as 0.01cm clearance around payloads, carry out discrete turns up to 135 degrees, and move across unsupported gaps of 1.15m in length.</description>

      <title>Large Language Model-Based Framework for Explainable Cyberattack Detection in Automatic Generation Control Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing digitization of smart grids has improved operational efficiency but also introduced new cybersecurity vulnerabilities, such as False Data Injection Attacks (FDIAs) targeting Automatic Generation Control (AGC) systems. While machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models have shown promise in detecting such attacks, their opaque decision-making limits operator trust and real-world applicability. This paper proposes a hybrid framework that integrates lightweight ML-based attack detection with natural language explanations generated by Large Language Models (LLMs). Classifiers such as LightGBM achieve up to 95.13% attack detection accuracy with only 0.004 s inference latency. Upon detecting a cyberattack, the system invokes LLMs, including GPT-3.5 Turbo, GPT-4 Turbo, and GPT-4o mini, to generate human-readable explanation of the event. Evaluated on 100 test samples, GPT-4o mini with 20-shot prompting achieved 93% accuracy in identifying the attack target, a mean absolute error of 0.075 pu in estimating attack magnitude, and 2.19 seconds mean absolute error (MAE) in estimating attack onset. These results demonstrate that the proposed framework effectively balances real-time detection with interpretable, high-fidelity explanations, addressing a critical need for actionable AI in smart grid cybersecurity.</description>

      <title>Modified Smith predictor for unstable linear systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper presents a new control algorithm for unstable linear systems with input delay. In comparison with known analogues, the control law has been designed, which is a modification of the Smith predictor, and is the simplest one to implement without requiring complex integration methods. At the same time, the problem of stabilization of a closed system is effectively solved, ensuring the boundedness of all state variables and the exponential stability of the equilibrium point.</description>

      <title>Resilient State Recovery using Prior Measurement Support Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Resilient state recovery of cyber-physical systems has attracted much research attention due to the unique challenges posed by the tight coupling between communication, computation, and the underlying physics of such systems. By modeling attacks as additive adversary signals to a sparse subset of measurements, this resilient recovery problem can be formulated as an error correction problem. To achieve exact state recovery, most existing results require less than $50\%$ of the measurement nodes to be compromised, which limits the resiliency of the estimators. In this paper, we show that observer resiliency can be further improved by incorporating data-driven prior information. We provide an analytical bridge between the precision of prior information and the resiliency of the estimator. By quantifying the relationship between the estimation error of the weighted $\ell_1$ observer and the precision of the support prior. This quantified relationship provides guidance for the estimator's weight design to achieve optimal resiliency. Several numerical simulations and an application case study are presented to validate the theoretical claims.</description>

      <title>Set Invariance with Probability One for Controlled Diffusion: Score-based Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a controlled diffusion and a connected, bounded, Lipschitz set, when is it possible to guarantee controlled set invariance with probability one? In this work, we answer this question by deriving the necessary and sufficient conditions for the same in terms of gradients of certain log-likelihoods -- a.k.a. score vector fields -- for two cases: given finite time horizon and infinite time horizon. The deduced conditions comprise a score-based test that provably certifies or falsifies the existence of Markovian controllers for given controlled set invariance problem data. Our results are constructive in the sense when the problem data passes the proposed test, we characterize all controllers guaranteeing the desired set invariance. When the problem data fails the proposed test, there does not exist a controller that can accomplish the desired set invariance with probability one. The computation in the proposed tests involve solving certain Dirichlet boundary value problems, and in the finite horizon case, can also account for additional constraint of hitting a target subset at the terminal time. We illustrate the results using several semi-analytical and numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Safety Evaluation of Motion Plans Using Trajectory Predictors as Forward Reachable Set Estimators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advent of end-to-end autonomy stacks - often lacking interpretable intermediate modules - has placed an increased burden on ensuring that the final output, i.e., the motion plan, is safe in order to validate the safety of the entire stack. This requires a safety monitor that is both complete (able to detect all unsafe plans) and sound (does not flag safe plans). In this work, we propose a principled safety monitor that leverages modern multi-modal trajectory predictors to approximate forward reachable sets (FRS) of surrounding agents. By formulating a convex program, we efficiently extract these data-driven FRSs directly from the predicted state distributions, conditioned on scene context such as lane topology and agent history. To ensure completeness, we leverage conformal prediction to calibrate the FRS and guarantee coverage of ground-truth trajectories with high probability. To preserve soundness in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios or under predictor failure, we introduce a Bayesian filter that dynamically adjusts the FRS conservativeness based on the predictor's observed performance. We then assess the safety of the ego vehicle's motion plan by checking for intersections with these calibrated FRSs, ensuring the plan remains collision-free under plausible future behaviors of others. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset show our approach significantly improves soundness while maintaining completeness, offering a practical and reliable safety monitor for learned autonomy stacks.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Optimization of Process Parameters of a Sensor-Based Sorting System using Gaussian Processes as Surrogate Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sensor-based sorting systems enable the physical separation of a material stream into two fractions. The sorting decision is based on the image data evaluation of the sensors used and is carried out using actuators. Various process parameters must be set depending on the properties of the material stream, the dimensioning of the system, and the required sorting accuracy. However, continuous verification and re-adjustment are necessary due to changing requirements and material stream compositions. In this paper, we introduce an approach for optimizing, recurrently monitoring and adjusting the process parameters of a sensor-based sorting system. Based on Bayesian Optimization, Gaussian process regression models are used as surrogate models to achieve specific requirements for system behavior with the uncertainties contained therein. This method minimizes the number of necessary experiments while simultaneously considering two possible optimization targets based on the requirements for both material output streams. In addition, uncertainties are considered during determining sorting accuracies in the model calculation. We evaluated the method with three example process parameters.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Optimization applied for accelerated Virtual Validation of the Autonomous Driving Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rigorous Verification and Validation (V&amp;V) of Autonomous Driving Functions (ADFs) is paramount for ensuring the safety and public acceptance of Autonomous Vehicles (AVs). Current validation relies heavily on simulation to achieve sufficient test coverage within the Operational Design Domain (ODD) of a vehicle, but exhaustively exploring the vast parameter space of possible scenarios is computationally expensive and time-consuming. This work introduces a framework based on Bayesian Optimization (BO) to accelerate the discovery of critical scenarios. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework on an Model Predictive Controller (MPC)-based motion planner, showing that it identifies hazardous situations, such as off-road events, using orders of magnitude fewer simulations than brute-force Design of Experiments (DoE) methods. Furthermore, this study investigates the scalability of the framework in higher-dimensional parameter spaces and its ability to identify multiple, distinct critical regions within the ODD of the motion planner used as the case study .</description>

      <title>Age of Estimates: When to Submit Jobs to a Markov Machine to Maximize Revenue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the dawn of AI factories ushering a new era of computing supremacy, development of strategies to effectively track and utilize the available computing resources is garnering utmost importance. These computing resources are often modeled as Markov sources, which oscillate between free and busy states, depending on their internal load and external utilization, and are commonly referred to as Markov machines (MMs). Most of the prior work solely focuses on the problem of tracking these MMs, while often assuming a rudimentary decision process that governs their utilization. Our key observation is that the ultimate goal of tracking a MM is to properly utilize it. In this work, we consider the problem of maximizing the utility of a MM, where the utility is defined as the average revenue generated by the MM. Assuming a Poisson job arrival process and a query-based sampling procedure to sample the state of the MM, we find the optimal times to submit the available jobs to the MM so as to maximize the average revenue generated per unit job. We show that, depending on the parameters of the MM, the optimal policy is in the form of either a \emph{threshold policy} or a \emph{switching policy} based on the \emph{age of our estimate} of the state of the MM.</description>

      <title>A reference frame-based microgrid primary control for ensuring global convergence to a periodic orbit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00916v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Power systems with a high penetration of renewable generation are vulnerable to frequency oscillation and voltage instability. Traditionally, the stability of power systems is considered either in terms of local stability or as an angle oscillator synchronization problem with the simplifying assumption that the dynamics of the amplitudes are on much shorter time scales. Without this assumption, however, the steady state being studied is essentially a limit cycle with the convergence of its orbit in question. In this paper, we present a method to analyze the orbital stability of a microgrid and propose a voltage controller for the inverter-interfaced renewable generators. The main hurdle to the problem lies in the constant terms in the rotating internal reference frames of each generator. We extend the shifted passivity of port-Hamiltonian systems to the analysis of limit cycles and prove that, if the system is shifted passive without considering these constant terms, then the periodic orbit is globally attractive. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first global stability result for non-nominal steady states of the microgrid in the full state space, which provides new insights into the synchronization phenomenon where the dissipativity of the system ensures convergence. The proposed controller is verified with a test microgrid, demonstrating its stability and transient smoothness compared to the standard droop control.</description>

      <title>Koopman-based control using sum-of-squares optimization: Improved stability guarantees and data efficiency</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03875v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel controller design approach for unknown nonlinear systems using the Koopman operator. In particular, we use the recently proposed stability- and certificate-oriented extended dynamic mode decomposition (SafEDMD) architecture to generate a data-driven bilinear surrogate model with certified error bounds. Then, by accounting for the obtained error bounds in a controller design based on the bilinear system, one can guarantee closed-loop stability for the true nonlinear system. While existing approaches over-approximate the bilinearity of the surrogate model, thus introducing conservatism and providing only local guarantees, we explicitly account for the bilinearity by using sum-of-squares (SOS) optimization in the controller design. More precisely, we parametrize a rational controller stabilizing the error-affected bilinear surrogate model and, consequently, the underlying nonlinear system. The resulting SOS optimization problem provides explicit data-driven controller design conditions for unknown nonlinear systems based on semidefinite programming. Our approach significantly reduces conservatism by establishing a larger region of attraction and improved data efficiency. The proposed method is evaluated using numerical examples, demonstrating its advantages over existing approaches.</description>

      <title>AVSim -- Realistic Simulation Framework for Airborne and Vector-Borne Disease Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06212v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Computational disease modeling plays a crucial role in understanding and controlling the transmission of infectious diseases. While agent-based models (ABMs) provide detailed insights into individual dynamics, accurately replicating human motion remains challenging due to its complex, multi-factorial nature. Most existing frameworks fail to model realistic human motion, leading to oversimplified and less realistic behavior modeling. Furthermore, many current models rely on synthetic assumptions and fail to account for realistic environmental structures, transportation systems, and behavioral heterogeneity across occupation groups. To address these limitations, we introduce AVSim, an agent-based simulation framework designed to model airborne and vector-borne disease dynamics under realistic conditions. A distinguishing feature of AVSim is its ability to accurately model the dual nature of human mobility (both the destinations individuals visit and the duration of their stay) by utilizing GPS traces from real-world participants, characterized by occupation. This enables a significantly more granular and realistic representation of human movement compared to existing approaches. Furthermore, spectral clustering combined with graph-theoretic analysis is used to uncover latent behavioral patterns within occupations, enabling fine-grained modeling of agent behavior. We validate the synthetic human mobility patterns against ground-truth GPS data and demonstrate AVSim's capabilities via simulations of COVID-19 and dengue. The results highlight AVSim's capacity to trace infection pathways, identify high-risk zones, and evaluate interventions such as vaccination, quarantine, and vector control with occupational and geographic specificity.</description>

      <title>Minimum Attention Control (MAC) in a Receding Horizon Framework with Applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20835v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Minimum Attention Control (MAC) is a control technique that provides minimal input changes to meet the control objective. Mathematically, the zero norm of the input changes is used as a constraint for the given control objective and minimized with respect to the process dynamics. In this paper, along with the zero norm constraint, stage costs are also considered for reference tracking in a receding horizon framework. For this purpose, the optimal inputs of the previous horizons are also considered in the optimization problem of the current horizon. An alternating minimization algorithm is applied to solve the optimization problem (Minimum Attention Model Predictive Control (MAMPC)). The outer step of the optimization is a quadratic program, while the inner step, which solves for sparsity, has an analytical solution. The proposed algorithm is implemented on two case studies: a four-tank system with slow dynamics and a fuel cell stack with fast dynamics. A detailed comparative study of the proposed algorithm with standard MPC indicates sparse control actions with a tradeoff in the tracking error.</description>

Abstract: The heavy-load legged robot has strong load carrying capacity and can adapt to various unstructured terrains. But the large weight results in higher requirements for motion stability and environmental perception ability. In order to utilize force sensing information to improve its motion performance, in this paper, we propose a finite state machine model for the swing leg in the static gait by imitating the movement of the elephant. Based on the presence or absence of additional terrain information, different trajectory planning strategies are provided for the swing leg to enhance the success rate of stepping and save energy. The experimental results on a novel quadruped robot show that our method has strong robustness and can enable heavy-load legged robots to pass through various complex terrains autonomously and smoothly.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06636v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of optimally composing a set of primitives to tackle planning and control tasks. To address this problem, we introduce a free energy computational model for planning and control via policy composition: Free-Gate. Within Free-Gate, control primitives are combined via a gating mechanism that minimizes variational free energy. This composition problem is formulated as a finite-horizon optimal control problem, which we prove remains convex even when the cost is not convex in states/actions and the environment is nonlinear, stochastic and non-stationary. We develop an algorithm that computes the optimal primitives composition and demonstrate its effectiveness via in-silico and hardware experiments on an application involving robot navigation in an environment with obstacles. The experiments highlight that Free-Gate enables the robot to navigate to the destination despite only having available simple motor primitives that, individually, could not fulfill the task.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09978v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Effective utilization of charging station capacity plays an important role in enhancing the profitability of ride-hailing systems using electric vehicles. Existing studies assume constant energy prices and uncapacitated charging stations or do not explicitly consider vehicle queueing at charging stations, resulting in over-optimistic charging infrastructure utilization. In this study, we develop a dynamic charging scheduling method (named CongestionAware) that anticipates vehicles' energy needs and coordinates their charging operations with real-time energy prices to avoid long waiting time at charging stations and increase the total profit of the system. A sequential mixed integer linear programming model is proposed to devise vehicles' day-ahead charging plans based on their experienced charging waiting times and energy consumption. The obtained charging plans are adapted within the day in response to vehicles' energy needs and charging station congestion. The developed charging policy is tested using NYC yellow taxi data in a Manhattan-like study area with a fleet size of 100 vehicles given the scenarios of 3000 and 4000 customers per day. The computational results show that our CongestionAware policy outperforms different benchmark policies with up to +15.06% profit and +19.16% service rate for 4000 customers per day. Sensitivity analysis is conducted with different system parameters and managerial insights are discussed.</description>

However, their broader applicability remains constrained by the lack of dynamic model-based control strategies tailored for multi-degree-of-freedom (DOF) configurations. This paper presents a novel design of a 2-DOF robotic wrist, envisioned as a fundamental building block for such advanced robotic systems. The wrist module is actuated by twisted and coiled actuators (TCAs) and utilizes a compact 3RRRR parallel mechanism to achieve a lightweight structure with enhanced motion capability. A comprehensive Lagrangian dynamic model is developed to capture the module's complex nonlinear behavior. Leveraging this model, a nonlinear model predictive controller (NMPC) is designed to ensure accurate trajectory tracking. A physical prototype of the robotic wrist is fabricated, and extensive experiments are performed to validate its motion performance and the fidelity of the proposed dynamic model. Subsequently, comparative evaluations between the NMPC and a conventional PID controller are conducted under various operating conditions. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the dynamic model-based control approach in managing the motion of TCA-driven robotic wrists. Finally, to illustrate its practical utility and integrability, the wrist module is incorporated into a multi-segment soft robotic arm, where it successfully executes a trajectory tracking task.</description>

      <title>Distributionally Robust LQG with Kullback-Leibler Ambiguity Sets</title>

Abstract: The Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) controller is known to be inherently fragile to model misspecifications common in real-world situations. We consider discrete-time partially observable stochastic linear systems and provide a robustification of the standard LQG against distributional uncertainties on the process and measurement noise. Our distributionally robust formulation specifies the admissible perturbations by defining a relative entropy based ambiguity set individually for each time step along a finite-horizon trajectory, and minimizes the worst-case cost across all admissible distributions. We prove that the optimal control policy is still linear, as in standard LQG, and derive a computational scheme grounded on iterative best response that provably converges to the set of saddle points. Finally, we consider the case of endogenous uncertainty captured via decision-dependent ambiguity sets and we propose an approximation scheme based on dynamic programming.</description>

      <title>Compression Method for Deep Diagonal State Space Model Based on $H^2$ Optimal Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10078v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep learning models incorporating linear SSMs have gained attention for capturing long-range dependencies in sequential data. However, their large parameter sizes pose challenges for deployment on resource-constrained devices. In this study, we propose an efficient parameter reduction method for these models by applying $H^{2}$ model order reduction techniques from control theory to their linear SSM components. In experiments, the LRA benchmark results show that the model compression based on our proposed method outperforms an existing method using the Balanced Truncation, while successfully reducing the number of parameters in the SSMs to $1/32$ without sacrificing the performance of the original models.</description>

      <title>Spatial Language Likelihood Grounding Network for Bayesian Fusion of Human-Robot Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19947v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fusing information from human observations can help robots overcome sensing limitations in collaborative tasks. However, an uncertainty-aware fusion framework requires a grounded likelihood representing the uncertainty of human inputs. This paper presents a Feature Pyramid Likelihood Grounding Network (FP-LGN) that grounds spatial language by learning relevant map image features and their relationships with spatial relation semantics. The model is trained as a probability estimator to capture aleatoric uncertainty in human language using three-stage curriculum learning. Results showed that FP-LGN matched expert-designed rules in mean Negative Log-Likelihood (NLL) and demonstrated greater robustness with lower standard deviation. Collaborative sensing results demonstrated that the grounded likelihood successfully enabled uncertainty-aware fusion of heterogeneous human language observations and robot sensor measurements, achieving significant improvements in human-robot collaborative task performance.</description>
