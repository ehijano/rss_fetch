      <title>The local Gaussian correlation networks among return tails in the Chinese stock market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Financial networks based on Pearson correlations have been intensively studied. However, previous studies may have led to misleading and catastrophic results because of several critical shortcomings of the Pearson correlation. The local Gaussian correlation coefficient, a new measurement of statistical dependence between variables, has unique advantages including capturing local nonlinear dependence and handling heavy-tailed distributions. This study constructs financial networks using the local Gaussian correlation coefficients between tail regions of stock returns in the Shanghai Stock Exchange. The work systematically analyzes fundamental network metrics including node centrality, average shortest path length, and entropy. Compared with the local Gaussian correlation network among positive tails and the conventional Pearson correlation network, the properties of the local Gaussian correlation network among negative tails are more sensitive to the stock market risks. This finding suggests researchers should prioritize the local Gaussian correlation network among negative tails. Future work should reevaluate existing findings using the local Gaussian correlation method.</description>

      <title>Anti-correlation network among China A-shares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00028v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The correlation-based financial networks are studied intensively. However, previous studies ignored the importance of the anti-correlation. This paper is the first to consider the anti-correlation and positive correlation separately, and accordingly construct the weighted temporal anti-correlation and positive correlation networks among stocks listed in the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges. For both types of networks during the first 24 years of this century, fundamental topological measurements are analyzed systematically. This paper unveils some essential differences in these topological measurements between the anti-correlation and positive correlation networks. It also observes an asymmetry effect between the stock market decline and rise. The methodology proposed in this paper has the potential to reveal significant differences in the topological structure and dynamics of a complex financial system, stock behavior, investment portfolios, and risk management, offering insights that are not visible when all correlations are considered together. More importantly, this paper proposes a new direction for studying complex systems: the anti-correlation network. It is well worth reexamining previous relevant studies using this new methodology.</description>
