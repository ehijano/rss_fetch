      <title>Gravitational Deflection of Vector Photons via Effective Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the gravitational scattering amplitude of an electromagnetic field off a heavy scalar field with the effective field theory method. From this we derive the photon deflection angle caused by massive bodies in the weak field approximation. Our calculation focuses on the long-range interaction exclusively, which is determined by the non-analytic terms of the momentum transfer in the amplitude. Using geometric optics and eikonal approximations, we derive expressions for the deflection angle. In contrast to previous works, we utilise the integration-by-parts reduction technique to the one-loop amplitudes, avoiding direct computations of a large number of Feynman integrals. Our calculation is performed in the covariant Lorenz gauge and harmonic coordinate condition. It includes contributions from the scalar and vector ghost fields to the scattering amplitude. Differences between our results and those in the literature are pointed out explicitly, and the origin is analysed briefly.</description>

      <title>Remarks on the Higgs Branch of 5d Conformal Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Among the elementary building blocks in the atomic classification of 5d SCFTs there are 5d bifundamental conformal matter theories of various kinds. In this work we study the Higgs branch of these models and of the corresponding molecules arising from their fusion. To this aim we use two complementary independent strategies. On the one hand for the type $A$ and $D$ conformal matter, we identify dual $(p,q)$ brane webs in IIB and exploit them to read off the corresponding magnetic quivers. On the other hand, we exploit circle reductions and study the resulting 4d $\mathcal N=2$ SCFTs, giving an alternative derivation of their Higgs branches which extend also to the $E$ types.</description>

      <title>Schubert defects in Lagrangian Grassmannians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a construction of GLSM defects corresponding to Schubert cycles in Lagrangian Grassmannians, following recent work of Closset-Khlaif on Schubert cycles in ordinary Grassmannians. In the case of Lagrangian Grassmannians, there are superpotential terms in both the bulk GLSM as well as on the defect itself, enforcing isotropy constraints. We check our construction by comparing the locus on which the GLSM defect is supported to mathematical descriptions, checking dimensions, and perhaps most importantly, comparing defect indices to known and expected polynomial invariants of the Schubert cycles in quantum cohomology and quantum K theory.</description>

      <title>Unitary Categorical Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Global invertible symmetries act unitarily on local observables or states of a quantum system. In this note, we aim to generalise this statement to non-invertible symmetries by considering unitary actions of higher fusion category symmetries $\mathcal{C}$ on twisted sector local operators. We propose that the latter transform in $\ast$-representations of the tube algebra associated to $\mathcal{C}$, which we introduce and classify using the notion of higher $S$-matrices of higher braided fusion categories.</description>

      <title>Fermions and the Renormalisation Group at Large N</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate fermionic quantum field theories using functional renormalisation. In the limit of many fermion flavours $N$, we demonstrate that theories have exact solutions for their quantum effective actions given by quasi-local interaction functionals of fermion bilinears. The structure implies that local potential approximations are exact, exactly solvable, and that field anomalous dimensions vanish. Theories with non-trivial anomalous dimensions may also arise under conditions that are identified. We further demonstrate that higher derivative interactions are inevitably induced by point-like ones, including at large-$N$. The local potential flows for fermionic theories with the most general $U(N)$ symmetric interactions are provided. For sample theories with scalar, pseudo-scalar, vector, or axial-vector interactions, we identify conformal fixed points, scaling dimensions, conformal manifolds, and quantum-induced shifts in scaling dimensions of higher derivative interactions. We also study fermion mass generation, and subleading modifications due to finite $N$ corrections. Implications for conformal field theories, and applications in condensed matter and particle physics are indicated.</description>

      <title>An Airy Tale at Large $N$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the sphere partition function of 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ holographic SCFTs arising on the worldvolume of $N$ coincident M2-branes in the presence of squashing and real mass deformations. We argue that the all-order large $N$ perturbative expansion of the partition function resums into a compact expression in terms of an Airy function. We provide ample evidence for this conjecture using numerical methods, saddle point analysis in the 't Hooft limit, and the relation of the squashed sphere partition function to the Cardy-like limit of the superconformal index. We also discuss the relation of our results to topological string theory and the statistical mechanics of Fermi gases. Our conjecture has a bearing on the AdS/CFT correspondence and the structure of perturbative M-theory corrections to 11d supergravity which we discuss.</description>

      <title>Supersymmetric scale-separated AdS$_3$ vacua of type IIB</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I construct supersymmetric, parametrically scale-separated AdS$_3$ vacua of type IIB string theory. These arise as compactifications with orientifold planes on specific seven-dimensional solvmanifolds admitting co-closed $G_2$-structures, preserving minimal supersymmetry. There are solutions that include either one set or four sets of intersecting O5-planes in the smeared approximation, and parametric scale separation can be achieved by tuning unbounded fluxes to infinity. Additionally, the putative holographic field theory operators that are dual to the lightest scalars in the gravitational theory have integer conformal dimensions at tree level, aligning with other scale-separated models of type II string theory.</description>

      <title>Hilbert Bundles and Holographic Space-time: the Hydrodynamic Approach to Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Results of Jacobson, Carlip and Solodukhin, from the 1990s, suggest a hydrodynamic approach to quantum gravity in which a classical solution of Einstein's equations determines the density matrices of subsystems associated with causal diamonds in the "empty diamond" state of a corresponding quantum system. The subsystem operator algebras are finite dimensional and correspond to a UV cutoff $1 + 1$ dimensional field theory of fermions living on a "stretched horizon" near each diamond's holographic screen. The fields can be thought of as fluctuations of solutions of the screen's Dirac operator around that of the background geometry, expanded up to a maximal Dirac eigenvalue determined by the Carlip-Solodukhin relation between area and central charge. This cutoff renders the screen geometry "fuzzy". Quantum dynamics is defined in a Hilbert bundle over the space of time-like geodesics on the background geometry. A nesting of diamonds along a given geodesic defines a series of unitary embedding maps of diamond Hilbert spaces into each other, analogous to half sided modular flows in quantum field theory. These can be extended into a consistent set of unitary maps of each fiber Hilbert space into itself by a quantum version of the principle of relativity. According to the QPR, the largest diamond in the overlap between any two diamonds is identified with a tensor factor in each individual diamond Hilbert space, and must have the a density matrix with the same entanglement spectrum no matter which fiber dynamics is used to compute it. This brief review summarizes how these ideas play out in a variety of contexts in different dimensions.</description>

      <title>Multicenter higher-derivative BPS black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the reduction of four-derivative heterotic supergravity on a torus and construct two-charge multicenter BPS black hole solutions. In $d=5$, the three-form field can be dualized to a gauge field and we correspondingly construct three-charge multicenter BPS black hole solutions to the dualized Bergshoeff-de Roo action. This makes precise the embedding of known solutions into five-dimensional $\alpha'$-corrected STU supergravity.</description>

      <title>On coefficients of operator product expansions for quantum field theories with ordinary, holomorphic, and topological spacetime dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In many quantum field theories (such as higher-dimensional holomorphic field theories or raviolo theories), operator product expansions of local operators can have as coefficients not only ordinary functions but also 'derived' functions with nonzero ghost number, which are certain elements of sheaf cohomology. We analyse the 'derived' functions that should appear in operator product expansions for a quantum field theory with an arbitrary number of topological, holomorphic and/or ordinary spacetime dimensions and identify necessary and sufficient conditions for such 'derived' functions to appear. In particular, theories with one topological spacetime dimension and multiple ordinary spacetime dimensions provide a smooth analogue of the (holomorphic) raviolo.</description>

      <title>Refining Integration-by-Parts Reduction of Feynman Integrals with Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integration-by-parts reductions of Feynman integrals pose a frequent bottle-neck in state-of-the-art calculations in theoretical particle and gravitational-wave physics, and rely on heuristic approaches for selecting integration-by-parts identities, whose quality heavily influences the performance. In this paper, we investigate the use of machine-learning techniques to find improved heuristics. We use funsearch, a genetic programming variant based on code generation by a Large Language Model, in order to explore possible approaches, then use strongly typed genetic programming to zero in on useful solutions. Both approaches manage to re-discover the state-of-the-art heuristics recently incorporated into integration-by-parts solvers, and in one example find a small advance on this state of the art.</description>

      <title>De Sitter quantum gravity within the covariant Lorentzian approach to asymptotic safety</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent technical and conceptual advancements in the asymptotic safety approach to quantum gravity have enabled studies of the UV completion of Lorentzian Einstein gravity, emphasizing the role of the state dependence. We present here the first complete investigation of the flow equations of the Einstein-Hilbert action within a cosmological spacetime, namely de Sitter spacetime. Using the newly derived graviton propagator for general gauges and masses in de Sitter spacetime, we analyze the dependence on the gauge and on finite renormalization parameters. Our results provide evidence of a UV fixed point for the most commonly used gauges.</description>

      <title>Exploring generalized Starobinsky Model of Inflation: Observational Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the power-law Starobinsky model, a generalized version of the Starobinsky inflation model, characterized by a power-law correction to Einstein gravity. Employing the $f(R)$ formalism, the scalar and tensor power spectra were numerically computed as functions of the dimensionless parameters $M$ and $\beta$. A Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis was conducted using Planck-2018, BICEP3 and BAO observational data, yielding precise constraints on $\beta = 1.987^{+0.013}_{-0.016},\, 95\%\, C.\, L.$. and $ \log_{10}M = -4.72^{+0.21}_{-0.20}$. The derived scalar spectral index $n_s=0.9676^{+0.0069}_{-0.0068}$ and tensor-to-scalar ratio $r=0.0074^{+0.0061}_{-0.0044}$ lie within the bounds set by Planck observations. We analyse a general reheating scenario while keeping the number of e-folds during inflation, $N_{pivot}$, fixed. The analysis confirms that deviations from the Starobinsky $R^2$ model are observationaly viable, with implications for high-energy physics and supergravity-based inflationary models.</description>

      <title>Searching for Inflationary Physics with the CMB Trispectrum: 1. Primordial Theory &amp; Optimal Estimators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The primordial four-point function encodes a wealth of information about the inflationary Universe. Despite extensive theoretical work, most models of four-point physics have never been compared to data. In this series, we conduct a detailed analysis of Cosmic Microwave Background temperature and polarization trispectra, searching for a wide variety of phenomena including local effects, self-interactions, curvatons, DBI inflation, gauge fields, solid inflation, scalar field exchange, spinning massive field exchange, chiral physics, point sources, and gravitational lensing. After presenting a suite of separable primordial templates, we derive thirteen quasi-optimal estimators that directly estimate the underlying template amplitudes. These are unbiased, minimum variance, mask-deconvolved, and account for correlations between templates (including with lensing). Each estimator can be efficiently implemented using spherical harmonic transforms, Monte Carlo methods, and optimization techniques, and asymptotes to standard forms in certain limits. In Paper 2, we implement these estimators in public code, and in Paper 3, use them to constrain primordial trispectra with Planck data. This enables a wide variety of tests of inflation, including some of the first direct constraints on cosmological collider physics.</description>

      <title>Tripartite Haar random state has no bipartite entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that no EPR-like bipartite entanglement can be distilled from a tripartite Haar random state $|\Psi\rangle_{ABC}$ by local unitary rotations when each subsystem has fewer than half of the total qubits. Specifically, we derive an upper bound on the probability of sampling a state with EPR-like entanglement for a given EPR fidelity tolerance, showing a doubly-exponential suppression in the number of qubits. Our proof relies on a simple volume argument supplemented by an $\epsilon$-net construction. We also discuss a physical interpretation in the AdS/CFT correspondence, indicating that a connected entanglement wedge does not necessarily imply bipartite entanglement as opposed to a previous belief.</description>

      <title>Symmetry Properties of Quantum Dynamical Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the relation between the Alicki-Fannes-Lindblad (AFL) quantum dynamical entropy and quantum symmetries. We show that, while the cumulative AFL entropy generally saturates to the dimensional bound at late times for chaotic dynamics, this saturation value is distinctively lower when the partitions (measurements) respect the symmetries. We provide rigorous analysis to this lowered value in three cases: Abelian symmetries, anticommuting unitaries, and non-Abelian symmetries. We further support our analytical results with numerical simulations of the perturbed quantum cat maps. Our findings highlight the complex relationship between the cumulative AFL entropy and symmetries, and suggest that caution is needed when interpreting it as an indicator of quantum chaos.</description>

Abstract: Topological stars are regular, horizonless solitons arising from dimensional compactification of Einstein-Maxwell theory in five dimensions, which could describe qualitative properties of microstate geometries for astrophysical black holes. They also provide a compelling realization of ultracompact objects arising from a well-defined theory and display all the phenomenological features typically associated with black hole mimickers, including a (stable) photon sphere, long-lived quasinormal modes, and echoes in the ringdown. By completing a thorough linear stability analysis, we provide strong numerical evidence that these solutions are stable against nonradial perturbations with zero Kaluza-Klein momentum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study equivariant primitives of Eisenstein series for principal congruence subgroups and show that they are precisely the corresponding non-holomorphic Eisenstein series. We present closed formulas that naturally generalise existing results for the full modular group. We also focus on Eisenstein series of weight two in the case where the modular curve has genus zero. We show that in those cases the non-holomorphic Eisenstein series of weight two can be written as single-valued logarithms whose argument is a rational function of the Hauptmodul.</description>

      <title>Constraining parity and Lorentz violations in gravity with future ground- and space-based gravitational wave detectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The future ground- and space-based gravitational wave (GW) detectors offer unprecedented opportunities to test general relativity (GR) with greater precision. In this work, we investigate the capability of future ground-based GW detectors, the Einstein Telescope (ET) and the Cosmic Explorer (CE), and space-based GW detectors, LISA, Taiji, and TianQin, for constraining parity and Lorentz violations in gravity. We inject several typical GW signals from compact binary systems into GW detectors and perform Bayesian inferences with the modified waveforms with parity and Lorentz-violating effects. These effects are modeled in the amplitude and phase corrections to the GW waveforms with their frequency-dependence described by factors $\beta_{\nu}$, $\beta_{\mu}$, $\beta_{\bar \nu}$, and $\beta_{\bar \mu}$. Our results show that the combined observations of ET and CE will impose significantly tighter bounds on the energy scale of parity and Lorentz violations ($M_{\rm PV}$ and $M_{\rm LV}$) compared to those given by LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) detectors. For cases with positive values of $\beta_{\nu}$, $\beta_{\mu}$, $\beta_{\bar \nu}$, and $\beta_{\bar \mu}$, the constraints on $M_{\rm PV}$ and $M_{\rm LV}$ from ground-based detectors are tighter than those from the space-based detectors. For the $\beta_{\mu} = -1$ case, space-based GW detectors provide constraints on $M_{\rm PV}$ that are better than current LVK observations and comparable to those from ET and CE. Additionally, space-based detectors exhibit superior sensitivity in constraining $M_{\rm LV}$ for $\beta_{\bar \mu} = -2$ case, which is approximately three orders of magnitude tighter than those from ground-based GW detectors. This scenario also enables bounds on the graviton mass at $m_g \lesssim 10^{-35}\; {\rm GeV}$. These findings highlight the promising role of future GW observatories in probing fundamental physics beyond GR.</description>

      <title>Why ETH? On thermalization and locality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) is foundational to modern discussions of thermalization in closed quantum systems. In this work, we expand on traditional explanations for the prevalence of ETH by emphasizing the role of operator locality. We introduce an operator-specific perturbation problem that can be thought of as a means of understanding the onset or breakdown of ETH for specific classes of operators in a given system. We derive explicit functional forms for the off-diagonal variances of operator matrix elements for typical local operators under various `scrambling ansatzes', expressed in terms of system parameters and parameters of the corresponding perturbation problem. We provide simple tests and illustrations of these ideas in chaotic spin chain systems.</description>

      <title>Black Strings and String Clouds Embedded in Anisotropic Quintessence: Solutions for Scalar Particles and Implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the spacetime metric associated with a black string surrounded by a cloud of strings and an anisotropic fluid of quintessence in cylindrically symmetric AdS spacetime. We solve Einstein's equation to obtain the explicit form of the metric, investigate typical values for its parameters, and determine their role in the event horizon formation. Within our findings, we show that the intensity of the cloud of strings regulates the size of the event horizon and, when the cloud is absent, the horizon increases drastically for larger values of the quintessence's state parameter $\alpha_{Q}$. Additionally, the metric shows that, unless $\alpha_{Q}$ is close to its lower bound, the contribution from the quintessence fluid is only significant at large distances from the black string. Finally, to explore the quantum implications of this dark energy candidate, we use the confluent Heun function to solve the Klein-Gordon equation for a spin-0 particle near the event horizon. Our results indicate that the presence of quintessence alters the particle's radial wave function. This modification, in principle, could give rise to an observable that we termed as \enquote{dark phase}.</description>

      <title>Robustness of Dark Energy Phenomenology Across Different Parameterizations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent evidence for dynamical dark energy from DESI, in combination with other cosmological data, has generated significant interest in understanding the nature of dark energy and its underlying microphysics. However, interpreting these results critically depends on how dark energy is parameterized. This paper examines the robustness of conclusions about the viability of particular kinds of dynamical dark energy models to the choice of parameterization, focusing on four popular two-parameter families: the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL), Jassal-Bagla-Padmanabhan (JBP), Barboza-Alcaniz (BA), and exponential (EXP) parameterizations. We find that conclusions regarding the viability of minimally and non-minimally coupled quintessence models are independent of the parameterization adopted. We demonstrate this both by mapping these dark energy models into the $(w_0, w_a)$ parameter space defined by these various parameterizations and by showing that all of these parameterizations can equivalently account for the phenomenology predicted by these dark energy models to a high degree of accuracy.</description>

      <title>The generic Markov CoHA is not spherically generated</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $Q$ be the Markov quiver, and let $W$ be an infinitely mutable potential for $Q$. We calculate some low degree refined BPS invariants for the resulting Jacobi algebra, and use them to show that the critical cohomological Hall algebra $\mathcal{H}_{Q,W}$ is not necessarily spherically generated, and is not independent of the choice of infinitely mutable potential $W$. This leads to a counterexample to a conjecture of Gaiotto, Grygoryev and Li \cite[\S 2.1]{GGL}, but also suggestions for how to modify it. In the case of generic cubic $W$, we discuss a way to modify the conjecture, by excluding the non-spherical part via the decomposition of $\mathcal{H}_{Q,W}$ according to the characters of a discrete symmetry group.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Random matrix theory yields valuable insights into the universal features of quantum many-body chaotic systems. Although all-to-all interactions are traditionally studied, many interesting dynamical questions, such as transport of a conserved density, require a notion of spatially local interactions. We study the transport of the energy, the most basic conserved density, in few-body and 1D chains of nearest-neighbor random matrix terms that square to one. In the few-body but large local Hilbert space dimension case, we develop a mapping for the energy dynamics to a single-particle hopping picture. This allows for the computation of the energy density autocorrelators and an out-of-time-ordered correlator of the energy density. In the 1D chain, we numerically study the energy transport for a small local Hilbert space dimension. We also discuss the density of states throughout and touch upon the relation to free probability theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2112.07942v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the context of supersymmetric quantum mechanics we formulate new supersymmetric localization principle, with application to trace formulas for a full thermal partition function. Unlike the standard localization principle, this new principle allows to compute the supertrace of non-supersymmetric observables, and is based on the existence of fermionic zero modes. We describe corresponding new invariant supersymmetric deformations of the path integral; they differ from the standard deformations arising from the circle action and require higher derivatives terms. Consequently, we prove that the path integral localizes to periodic orbits and not not only on constant ones. We illustrate the principle by deriving bosonic trace formulas on compact Lie groups, including classical Jacobi inversion formula.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.01251v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct an infinite set of conserved tensor currents of rank $2n$, $n=1,2,\dots$, in the two-dimensional theory of free massive fermions, which are bilinear in the fermionic fields. The one-point functions of these currents on the torus depend on the modular parameter $\tau$ and spin structure $(\alpha,\beta)$. We show that, upon scaling the mass $m$ so as to keep the combination $m^2$Im($\tau$) invariant, the one-point functions are non-holomorphic Jacobi forms of weights $(2n,0)$ or $(0,2n)$ and index 0, with respect to the modular parameter $\tau$ and elliptic parameter $z=\alpha\tau+\beta$. In particular, we express the one-point functions as Kronecker-Eisenstein-type sums over the lattice $\mathbb{Z}\tau+\mathbb{Z}$, which makes the modular symmetry manifest. We show that there is an action of three differential operators on these Jacobi forms which form an $\mathfrak{sl}_2(\mathbb{R})$ Lie algebra. Further we show that these Jacobi forms obey three differential equations arising from the representation theory of the Jacobi group.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10935v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The formula for correlation functions based on quantum $A_\infty$ algebras in arXiv:2203.05366, arXiv:2305.11634, and arXiv:2305.13103 requires us to divide the action into the free part and the interaction part. We present a new form of the formula which does not involve such division. The new formula requires us to choose a solution to the equations of motion which does not have to be real, and we claim that the formula gives correlation functions evaluated on the Lefschetz thimble associated with the solution we chose. Our formula correctly reproduces correlation functions in perturbation theory, but it can be valid nonperturbatively, and we present numerical evidence for scalar field theories in zero dimensions both in the Euclidean case and the Lorentzian case that correlation functions for finite coupling constants can be reproduced. When the theory consists of a single Lefschetz thimble, our formula gives correlation functions of the theory by choosing the solution corresponding to the thimble. When the theory consists of multiple Lefschetz thimbles, we need to evaluate the ratios of the partition functions for those thimbles and we describe a method of such evaluations based on quantum $A_\infty$ algebras in a forthcoming paper.</description>

Abstract: This work considers a variation of the massive ambitwistor string model presented in arXiv:2301.11227 that describes supergravity and super-Yang-Mills on the Coulomb branch simultaneously with a single Lagrangian. All-multiplicity tree and one-loop amplitudes are evaluated and shown to have proper unitary factorization. The massless limit provides Einstein Yang-Mills Amplitudes including multiple gluon traces. It is argued that the cosmological constant vanishes at all orders of perturbation theory. As application, results for Compton scattering are obtained and compared with ones in the literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01695v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: von Neumann algebras have been playing an increasingly important role in the context of gauge theories and gravity. The crossed product presents a natural method for implementing constraints through the commutation theorem, rendering it a useful tool for constructing gauge invariant algebras. The crossed product of a Type III algebra with its modular automorphism group is semifinite, which means that the crossed product regulates divergences in local quantum field theories. In this letter, we find a sufficient condition for the semifiniteness of the crossed product of a type III algebra with any locally compact group containing the modular automorphism group. Our condition surprisingly implies the centrality of the modular flow in the symmetry group, and we provide evidence for the necessity of this condition. Under these conditions, we construct an associated trace which computes physical expectation values. We comment on the importance of this result and and its implications for subregion physics in gauge theory and gravity.</description>

Abstract: We study the dynamical evolution of FLRW cosmologies in the presence of a tower of scalar light states and a runaway exponential potential. Some of the attractor solutions have problematic behaviours from the EFT point of view, which we use to argue for restrictions on the possible exponential scalings of the potential and tower characteristic mass as we move towards asymptotic regions in moduli space. These serve as further evidence that the tower mass should not decay faster than the potential or the KK scale associated to the homogeneous decompactification of a single compact dimension. We provide support from different top-down compactifications and connect with previous arguments found in the literature.</description>

Abstract: The hypergeometric amplitude is a one-parameter deformation of the Veneziano amplitude for four-point tachyon scattering in bosonic string theory that is consistent with $S$-matrix bootstrap constraints. In this article we construct a similar hypergeometric generalization of the Veneziano amplitude for type-I superstring theory. We then rule out a large region of the $(r,m^2,D)$ parameter space as non-unitary, and establish another large subset of the $(r, m^2, D)$ parameter space where all of the residue's partial wave coefficients are positive. We also analyze positivity in various limits and special cases. As a corollary to our analysis, we are able to directly demonstrate positivity of a wider set of Veneziano amplitude partial wave coefficients than what has been presented elsewhere.</description>

By constructing the Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT) for selected 5d $\mathcal{N}=1$, 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ and 4d $\mathcal{N}=1$ theories, we formalize the geometric origin of these symmetries and compute the mixed anomaly polynomials involving $(-1)$-form and higher-form symmetries. Our findings consistently reveal both discrete and continuous $(-1)$-form symmetries, aligning with established field theory results, while also uncovering new $(-1)$-form symmetry factors and structural insights. In particular, we study the SymTFT of 4d $\mathcal{N}=1$ theories from M-theory on a class of spaces with $G_2$ holonomy, and obtain properties such as modified instanton sums and 4-group structures observed in other 4d gauge theories. Additionally, we systematically construct symmetry operators for continuous abelian symmetries, refining existing proposals, and providing an M-theory origin for them.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14455v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give examples of cohomologies of the superconformal algebra, relevant to computations in the AdS supergravity. Our main examples are deformations of $AdS_5\times S^5$ transforming in finite-dimensional representations of the superconformal algebra at the linearized level. In the study of correlation functions, it is important to compute the resolution of BRST-exact products of vertex operators. The resolution is typically non-covariant, because of cohomological obstacles. Using the pure spinor formalism, we develop a framework to describe these obstacles, and formulate conjectures about their structure.</description>

      <title>Geometric Entropies and their Hamiltonian Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12438v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In holographic theories, the Hubeny-Rangamani-Takayanagi (HRT) area operator plays a key role in our understanding of the emergence of semiclassical Einstein-Hilbert gravity. When higher derivative corrections are included, the role of the area is instead played by a more general functional known as the geometric entropy. It is thus of interest to understand the flow generated by the geometric entropy on the classical phase space. In particular, the fact that the associated flow in Einstein-Hilbert or Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity induces a relative boost between the left and right entanglement wedges is deeply related to the fact that gravitational dressing promotes the von Neumann algebra of local fields in each wedge to type II. This relative boost is known as a boundary-condition-preserving (BCP) kink-transformation. In a general theory of gravity (with arbitrary higher-derivative terms), it is straightforward to show that the flow continues to take the above geometric form when acting on a spacetime where the HRT surface is the bifurcation surface of a Killing horizon. However, the form of the flow on other spacetimes is less clear.
  In this paper, we use the manifestly-covariant Peierls bracket to explore such flows in two-dimensional theories of JT gravity coupled to matter fields with higher derivative interactions. The results no longer take a purely geometric form and, instead, demonstrate new features that should be expected of such flows in general higher derivative theories. We also show how to obtain the above flows using Poisson brackets.</description>

      <title>Holographic QCD phase diagram for a rotating plasma in the Hawking-Page approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16446v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the combined effect of rotation and finite chemical potential in the confinement/deconfinement transition of strongly interacting matter. The holographic description consists of a five-dimensional geometry that contains a black hole (BH) in the deconfined (plasma) phase. The geometry is equipped with some cut-off that introduces an infrared energy scale. We consider two possibilities: the so-called hard wall and soft wall AdS/QCD models. The transition between the plasma and hadronic phases is represented holographically as a Hawking-Page transition between geometries with and without a black hole. The gravitational dual of the rotating plasma at finite density is given by a Reissner-Nordstr\"om (RN) charged anti-de Sitter (AdS) BH with non-zero angular momentum. This analysis provides the critical temperature of deconfinement as a function of the quark chemical potential and the plasma rotational velocity. For the particular case of very low temperatures and high densities, it is found that the critical value of the chemical potential for the transition to occur at $ T \to 0 $ does not depend on the plasma vorticity, since the effects of rotation and quark density on the critical temperature are shown to be independent.</description>

      <title>Cherenkov emission by a fast-moving uncharged Schwarzschild black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02811v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that in the presence of an external magnetic field, an uncharged classical Schwarzschild black hole moving superluminally in a dielectric with permittivity $\epsilon &gt; 1$ produces Cherenkov emission. This is a new physical effect: classical (non-quantum) emission of electromagnetic waves by a completely charge-neutral ``particle''. The governing equations (involving General Relativity, electromagnetism, and the physics of continuous media) have no external electromagnetic source - it is the distortion of the initial electromagnetic fields by the gravity of the black hole that plays the role of a superluminally moving source. The effect relies on nonzero values of both the magnetic field and the gravitational radius, as well as on the usual Cherenkov condition on the velocity, $v/c &gt; 1/\sqrt{\epsilon}$. Unlike Cherenkov emission by a point charge, the effective source in this case is spatially distributed, with emission generated along the single Cherenkov emission cone. The emitted spectrum is red-dominated, with power $\propto dk_z /|k_z|$ for wave numbers $|k_z| \leq 1/R_G$, where $R_G$ is the Schwarzschild radius. We comment on possible observability of this process during black hole -- neutron star mergers.</description>

      <title>Damping of spin waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00533v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that, in ideal-spin hydrodynamics, the components of the spin tensor follow damped wave equations. The damping rate is related to nonlocal collisions of the particles in the fluid, which enter at first order in $\hbar$ in a semi-classical expansion. This rate provides an estimate for the timescale of spin equilibration and is computed by considering a system of spin-1/2 fermions interacting via a quartic self-interaction as well as via (screened) one-gluon exchange. It is found that the relaxation times of the components of the spin tensor can become very large compared to the usual dissipative timescales of the system. Our results suggest that the spin degrees of freedom in a heavy-ion collision may not be in equilibrium by the time of freeze-out, and thus should be treated dynamically.</description>

      <title>Probing Celestial Energy and Charge Correlations through Real-Time Quantum Simulations: Insights from the Schwinger Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13816v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by recent developments in the application of light-ray operators (LROs) in high energy physics, we propose a new strategy to study correlation functions of LROs through real-time quantum simulations. We argue that quantum simulators provide an ideal laboratory to explore the properties LROs in lower-dimensional quantum field theories (QFTs). This is exemplified in the 1+1-d Schwinger model, employing tensor network methods, focusing on the calculation of energy and charge correlators. Despite some challenges in extracting the necessary correlation functions from the lattice the methodology used can be extended to real quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Matching current observational constraints with nonminimally coupled dark energy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17019v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that a Universe with a nonminimally coupled scalar field can fit current measurements of the expansion rate of the Universe better than the standard $\Lambda$-Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model or other minimally coupled dark energy models. In particular, the nonminimal coupling in this model allows for the dark energy model to exhibit stable phantom crossing behavior, which seems to be suggested by the constraints on the dark energy equation of state coming from the most recent data. While we find a clear improvement in the goodness of fit for this dark energy model with respect to others that have been considered in the recent literature, using information theoretic criteria, we show that the evidence for it is still inconclusive.</description>

      <title>Scale-dependence in $\Lambda$CDM parameters inferred from the CMB: a possible sign of Early Dark Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10559v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The early dark energy (EDE) model is one of the promising solutions to the Hubble tension. One of the successes of the EDE model is that it can provide a similar fit to the $\Lambda$CDM model for the CMB power spectrum. In this work, I analyze the phenomenology of the EDE and $\Lambda$CDM parameters on the CMB temperature power spectrum and notice that this cannot hold on all scales. Thus, if the real cosmology is as described by the EDE model, the $\Lambda$CDM parameters will be scale-dependent when fitting the CMB power spectrum with the $\Lambda$CDM model, which can be hints for the EDE model. I examine CMB-S4-like observations through mock data analysis and find that parameter shifts are notable. As observations include smaller scales, I find lower $H_0$, $n_s$, $\omega_b$ and higher $\omega_m$, $A_s e^{-2\tau}$, which will also constitute new tensions with other observations. They can serve as a possible signal for the EDE model.</description>

      <title>Field Equations in Chern-Simons-Gauss-Bonnet Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05911v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of Chern-Simons-Gauss-Bonnet gravity on fundamental metrics. This theory involves perturbative corrections to general relativity, as well as two scalar fields, the axion and the dilaton, that arise from Chern-Simons and Gauss-Bonnet gravity modifications respectively. The combined Chern-Simons-Gauss-Bonnet gravity is motivated by a wide range of theoretical and phenomenological perspectives, including particle physics, string theory, and parity violation in the gravitational sector. In this work, we provide the complete set of field equations and equations of motion of the Chern-Simons-Gauss-Bonnet modified gravity theory for a suite of fundamental metrics (Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker, Schwarzschild, spherically symmetric, and perturbed Minkowski), under no prior assumptions on the behavior of the fields. The full set of field equations and equations of motion can be numerically solved and applied to specific observables under certain assumptions, and can be used to place constraints on the Chern-Simons-Gauss-Bonnet modified gravity theory.</description>

Abstract: While there is a general consensus about the structure of one qubit operations in topological quantum computer, two qubits are as usual a more difficult and complex story of different attempts with varying approaches, problems and effectiveness. In this paper we discuss how to construct an efficient realization of a two qubit gate in topological quantum computer, by using principle of cabling from the knot theory. This allows to construct a braiding of cables dependent on the parameters of the theory where there is a low probability of moving out of computational space (high fidelity of operation) while there is a non-trivial entangling two-qubit operation. We also present some examples of these operations for different parameters of the theory.</description>

Abstract: Alexei Alexandrovich Starobinsky was one of the greatest cosmologists of all times, who made fundamental contributions to gravitational theory and cosmology based on geometrical ideas in physics, in the spirit of Einstein. One of his big achievements is the famous Starobinsky model of cosmological inflation in the early universe, proposed in 1979-1980. In this memorial paper, the Starobinsky inflation model is systematically reviewed from the modern perspective. Its deformation to include production of primordial black holes is proposed, and possible quantum corrections in the context of superstring theory and the Swampland Program are discussed. Starobinsky inflation also leads to the universal reheating mechanism for particle production after inflation.</description>

      <title>Massive Helicity-Chirality Spinor Formalism from Massless Amplitudes with On-shell Mass Insertion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09062v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a helicity-chirality spinor formalism to describe scattering amplitudes for particles of any masses and spins. The massive spin-spinors introduced by Arkani-hamed-Huang-Huang have been extended to the spin/helicity-transversality spinors, in which a new quantum number transversality, closely related to chirality, is introduced by extending the Poincare symmetry. The massive helicity-chirality amplitudes can be written by the large and small components of massless spinors $\lambda$ and $\eta$ following the $\lambda \sim \sqrt{E}, \eta \sim \mathbf{m}/\sqrt{E}$ expansion order by order, which formulate the power counting rules of a large energy effective theory. Diagrammatically the mass expansion in amplitudes originates from the on-shell mass insertion: the helicity flip and chirality flip, which completely determines the three-point massive amplitudes. From the chirality-helicity unification at the UV, any massive helicity-chirality amplitude can be one-to-one corresponded to massless helicity amplitudes with (without) additional Higgs insertion. This UV-IR correspondence explains the mass enhancement in the weak decay processes $\pi^+ \to \mu^+ \nu$ and $t \to W^+ b$, and isolates the correct UV of the three-point massive QED $F\bar{F}\gamma$ amplitudes in Arkani-hamed-Huang-Huang formalism. From massless-massive correspondence, the massless on-shell techniques can be utilized to construct higher-point massive amplitudes.</description>

      <title>Percolation of Domain Walls in the Two-Higgs Doublet Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03209v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Domain walls formed during a phase transition in a simple field theory model with $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry in a periodic box have been demonstrated to annihilate as fast as causality allows and their area density scales $\propto t^{-1}$. We have performed numerical simulations of the dynamics of domain walls in the Two-Higgs Doublet Model (2HDM) where the potential has $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry in two spatial dimensions. We observed significant differences with the standard case. Although the extreme long-time limit is the same for the $\approx 10^{5}$ sets of random initial configurations analysed, the percolation process is much slower due to the formation of long-lived loops. We suggest that this is due to the build up of superconducting currents on the walls which could lead ultimately to stationary configurations known as Kinky Vortons. We discuss the relevance of these findings for the production of Vortons in three spatial dimensions.</description>
