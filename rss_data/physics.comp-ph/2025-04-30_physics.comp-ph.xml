      <title>Faster Random Walk-based Capacitance Extraction with Generalized Antithetic Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Floating random walk-based capacitance extraction has emerged in recent years as a tried and true approach for extracting parasitic capacitance in very large scale integrated circuits. Being a Monte Carlo method, its performance is dependent on the variance of sampled quantities and variance reduction methods are crucial for the challenges posed by ever denser process technologies and layout-dependent effects. In this work, we present a novel, universal variance reduction method for floating random walk-based capacitance extraction, which is conceptually simple, highly efficient and provably reduces variance in all extractions, especially when layout-dependent effects are present. It is complementary to existing mathematical formulations for variance reduction and its performance gains are experienced on top of theirs. Numerical experiments demonstrate substantial such gains of up to 30% in number of walks necessary and even more in actual extraction times compared to the best previously proposed variance reduction approaches for the floating random-walk.</description>

      <title>In-poor IGZO: superior resilience to hydrogen in forming gas anneal and PBTI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrating In-Ga-Zn-oxide (IGZO) channel transistors in silicon-based ecosystems requires the resilience of the channel material to hydrogen treatment. Standard IGZO, containing 40% In (metal ratio) suffers from degradation under forming gas anneal (FGA) and hydrogen (H) driven positive bias temperature instability (PBTI). We demonstrate scaled top-gated ALD transistors with an In-poor (In $\le$ 17%) IGZO channel that show superior resilience to hydrogen compared to the In-rich (In=40%) counterpart. The devices, fabricated with a 300-mm FAB process with dimensions down to $W_\mathrm{CH} \times L_\mathrm{TG} = 80 \times 40 \mathrm{nm}^2$, show excellent stability in 2-hour 420$^\circ$C forming gas anneal ($0.06 \le \left| \Delta V_{\mathrm{TH}} \right| \le 0.33\mathrm{V}$) and improved resilience to H in PBTI at 125$^\circ$C (down to no detectable H-induced $V_{\mathrm{TH}}$ shift) compared to In-rich devices. We demonstrate that the device degradation by H in the FGA is different from the H-induced VTH instability in PBTI, namely oxygen scavenging by H and H release from a gate-dielectric into the channel, respectively, and that resilience to H in one process does not automatically translate to resilience to H in the other one. This significant improvement in IGZO resilience to H enables the use of FGA treatments during fabrication needed for silicon technology compatibility, as well as further scaling and 3D integration, bringing IGZO-based technologies closer to mass production.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the non-SUSY orbifolder, which is a program developed in C++ that computes the low-energy effective theory of non-supersymmetric heterotic orbifold compactifications. The program includes routines to compute the massless spectrum, to automatically generate large sets of orbifold models, to identify phenomenologically interesting models (e.g. models sharing features of the Standard Model (SM) or Grand Unified Theories (GUT)) and to analyze their vacuum configurations.</description>

      <title>Parameter optimization for the unimon qubit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inductively shunted superconducting qubits, such as the unimon qubit, combine high anharmonicity with protection from low-frequency charge noise, positioning them as promising candidates for the implementation of fault-tolerant superconducting quantum computers. In this work, we develop accurate closed-form approximations for the frequency and anharmonicity of the unimon qubit that are also applicable to any single-mode superconducting qubits with a single-well potential profile, such as the quarton qubit or the kinemon qubit. We use these results to theoretically explore the single-qubit gate fidelity and coherence times across the parameter space of qubits with a single-well potential. We find that the gate fidelity can be optimized by tuning the Hamiltonian to $(i)$ a high qubit mode impedance of $1-2$ $k\Omega$, $(ii)$ a low qubit frequency of $1$ $GHz$, $(iii)$ and a perfect cancellation of the linear inductance and the Josephson inductance attained at a flux bias of half flux quantum. According to our theoretical analysis, the proposed qubit parameters have potential to enhance the single-qubit gate fidelity of the unimon beyond $99.99\%$ even without significant improvements to the dielectric quality factor or the flux noise density measured for the first unimon qubits. Furthermore, we compare unimon, transmon and fluxonium qubits in terms of their energy spectra and qubit coherence subject to dielectric loss and $1/f$ flux noise in order to highlight the advantages and limitations of each qubit type.</description>

      <title>Ant Colony Optimization for Density Functionals in Strongly Correlated Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm is a nature-inspired metaheuristic method used for optimization problems. Although not a machine learning method per se, ACO is often employed alongside machine learning models to enhance performance through optimization. We adapt an ACO algorithm to optimize the so-called FVC density functional for the ground-state energy of strongly correlated systems. We find the parameter configurations that maximize optimization efficiency, while reducing the mean relative error ($MRE$) of the ACO functional. We then analyze the algorithm's performance across different dimensionalities ($1D-5D$), which are related to the number of parameters to be optimized within the FVC functional. Our results indicate that $15$ ants with a pheromone evaporation rate superior to $0.2$ are sufficient to minimize the $MRE$ for a vast regime of parameters of the strongly-correlated system -- interaction, particle density and spin magnetization. While the optimizations $1D$, $2D$, and $4D$ yield $1.5\%&lt; MRE&lt; 2.7\%$, the $3D$ and $5D$ optimizations lower the $MRE$ to $\sim0.8\%$, reflecting a $67\%$ error reduction compared to the original FVC functional ($MRE = 2.4\%$). As simulation time grows almost linearly with dimension, our results highlight the potential of ant colony algorithms for density-functional problems, combining effectiveness with low computational cost.</description>

      <title>FourierSpecNet: Neural Collision Operator Approximation Inspired by the Fourier Spectral Method for Solving the Boltzmann Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20408v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Boltzmann equation, a fundamental model in kinetic theory, describes the evolution of particle distribution functions through a nonlinear, high-dimensional collision operator. However, its numerical solution remains computationally demanding, particularly for inelastic collisions and high-dimensional velocity domains. In this work, we propose the Fourier Neural Spectral Network (FourierSpecNet), a hybrid framework that integrates the Fourier spectral method with deep learning to approximate the collision operator in Fourier space efficiently. FourierSpecNet achieves resolution-invariant learning and supports zero-shot super-resolution, enabling accurate predictions at unseen resolutions without retraining. Beyond empirical validation, we establish a consistency result showing that the trained operator converges to the spectral solution as the discretization is refined. We evaluate our method on several benchmark cases, including Maxwellian and hard-sphere molecular models, as well as inelastic collision scenarios. The results demonstrate that FourierSpecNet offers competitive accuracy while significantly reducing computational cost compared to traditional spectral solvers. Our approach provides a robust and scalable alternative for solving the Boltzmann equation across both elastic and inelastic regimes.</description>

      <title>Quality-factor inspired deep neural network solver for solving inverse scattering problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep neural networks have been applied to address electromagnetic inverse scattering problems (ISPs) and shown superior imaging performances, which can be affected by the training dataset, the network architecture and the applied loss function. Here, the quality of data samples is cared and valued by the defined quality factor. Based on the quality factor, the composition of the training dataset is optimized. The network architecture is integrated with the residual connections and channel attention mechanism to improve feature extraction. A loss function that incorporates data-fitting error, physical-information constraints and the desired feature of the solution is designed and analyzed to suppress the background artifacts and improve the reconstruction accuracy. Various numerical analysis are performed to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed quality-factor inspired deep neural network (QuaDNN) solver and the imaging performance is finally verified by experimental imaging test.</description>

      <title>Particle-Hole Asymmetry and Pinball Liquid in a Triangular-Lattice Extended Hubbard Model within Mean-Field Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, triangular lattice models have received a lot of attention since they can describe a number of strongly-correlated materials that exhibit superconductivity and various magnetic and charge orders. In this research we present an extensive analysis of the charge-ordering phenomenon of the triangular-lattice extended Hubbard model with repulsive onsite and nearest-neighbor interaction, arbitrary charge concentration, and $\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}$ supercell (3-sublattice assumption). The model is solved in the ground state with the mean-field approximation which allowed to identify $8$ charge-ordered phases and a large variety of phase transitions. An exotic pinball-liquid phase was found and described. Moreover, strong particle-hole asymmetry of the phase diagram is found to play an important role for triangular lattices. The analysis of band structures, unavailable for more advanced methods that take into account correlation effects, provided a great insight in the nature of triangular-lattice phases and phase transitions. The complexity of the mean-field phase diagram showed the importance and usefulness of the results for the further research with correlation effects included. Together with atomic-limit approximation it can serve them as both a starting point, and a tool to interpret results.</description>

      <title>Non-Equilibrium Phase Changes in Aircraft Exhaust: A Computational Study on Early Contrail Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A numerical framework is developed to model contrail formation in the near-field exhaust of aircraft engines, resolving non-equilibrium phase transitions in compressible, multi-component, non-ideal fluid flows. The approach combines well-established methods from steam turbine modeling for liquid-phase transitions with cloud microphysics models for ice formation. It resolves homogeneous and heterogeneous nucleation, interphase momentum exchange, and polydispersed size distributions of droplets, ice crystals, and soot particles. These models are implemented in a parallelized finite-volume solver and applied to a high-bypass turbofan exhaust configuration with simplified geometry. Results indicate that non-equilibrium effects strongly influence condensation and freezing dynamics, while nozzle geometry and water vapor content modulate local supersaturation and phase transition pathways. The findings underscore the limitations of equilibrium-based models and highlight the value of physics-based, scalable tools for analyzing contrail formation across fuels and propulsion systems.</description>

      <title>Energy-Based Coarse-Graining in Molecular Dynamics: A Flow-Based Framework Without Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coarse-grained (CG) models offer an effective route to reducing the complexity of molecular simulations, yet conventional approaches depend heavily on long all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories to adequately sample configurational space. This data-driven dependence limits their accuracy and generalizability, as unvisited configurations remain excluded from the resulting CG model. We introduce a data-free generative framework for coarse-graining that directly targets the all-atom Boltzmann distribution. Our model defines a structured latent space comprising slow collective variables, which are statistically associated with multimodal marginal densities capturing metastable states, and fast variables, which represent the remaining degrees of freedom with simple, unimodal conditional distributions. A potentially learnable, bijective map from the full latent space to the all-atom configuration space enables automatic and accurate reconstruction of molecular structures. The model is trained using an energy-based objective that minimizes the reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence, relying solely on the interatomic potential rather than sampled trajectories. A tempering scheme is used to stabilize training and promote exploration of diverse configurations. Once trained, the model can generate unbiased, one-shot equilibrium all-atom samples. We validate the method on two synthetic systems-a double-well potential and a Gaussian mixture-as well as on the benchmark alanine dipeptide. The model captures all relevant modes of the Boltzmann distribution, accurately reconstructs atomic configurations, and learns physically meaningful coarse-grained representations, all without any simulation data.</description>

      <title>Jekyll-and-Hyde Tipping Point in an AI's Behavior</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Trust in AI is undermined by the fact that there is no science that predicts -- or that can explain to the public -- when an LLM's output (e.g. ChatGPT) is likely to tip mid-response to become wrong, misleading, irrelevant or dangerous. With deaths and trauma already being blamed on LLMs, this uncertainty is even pushing people to treat their 'pet' LLM more politely to 'dissuade' it (or its future Artificial General Intelligence offspring) from suddenly turning on them. Here we address this acute need by deriving from first principles an exact formula for when a Jekyll-and-Hyde tipping point occurs at LLMs' most basic level. Requiring only secondary school mathematics, it shows the cause to be the AI's attention spreading so thin it suddenly snaps. This exact formula provides quantitative predictions for how the tipping-point can be delayed or prevented by changing the prompt and the AI's training. Tailored generalizations will provide policymakers and the public with a firm platform for discussing any of AI's broader uses and risks, e.g. as a personal counselor, medical advisor, decision-maker for when to use force in a conflict situation. It also meets the need for clear and transparent answers to questions like ''should I be polite to my LLM?''</description>

      <title>Fully GPU-Accelerated, Matrix-Free Immersed Boundary Method for Complex Fiber-reinforced Hyperelastic Cardiac Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22695v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The immersed boundary (IB) method has become a leading approach in cardiac fluid-structure interaction (FSI) modeling due to its ability to handle large deformations and complex geometries without requiring mesh regeneration. However, the use of nonlinear, fiber-reinforced hyperelastic materials for modeling soft cardiac tissues introduces challenges in computational efficiency, particularly due to the additional projection steps required for stability in the IB framework. These steps often involve sparse matrix storage and computation, which can degrade GPU performance. In this work, we present a novel, fully GPU-accelerated, matrix-free IB method for FSI in anatomically realistic cardiac models. By employing nodal coupling, our method eliminates the need for projection operations in the finite element space. Additionally, we solve the Navier-Stokes equations using Chorin's projection method combined with a matrix-free geometric multigrid solver, ensuring the entire FSI algorithm remains matrix-free and highly compatible with GPU acceleration. Our implementation features several GPU-specific optimizations, including the use of constant memory to store values of nodal basis functions and their derivatives at quadrature points, and texture memory to efficiently implement the semi-Lagrangian discretization of convection terms. These innovations maximize GPU utilization while preserving the complex mechanical behavior of soft cardiac tissue. Benchmark tests demonstrate that our GPU-accelerated solver achieves a $50\times$-$100\times$ speedup compared to a 20-core CPU implementation, with comparable accuracy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2207.10701v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Incoherent light is ubiquitous, yet designing optical devices that can handle its random nature is very challenging, since directly averaging over many incoherent incident beams can require a huge number of scattering calculations. We show how to instead solve this problem with a reciprocity technique which leads to three orders of magnitude speedup: one Maxwell solve (using any numerical technique) instead of thousands. This improvement enables us to perform efficient inverse design, large scale optimization of the metasurface for applications such as light collimators and concentrators. We show the impact of the angular distribution of incident light on the resulting performance, and show especially promising designs for the case of "annular" beams distributed only over nonzero angles.</description>

Abstract: Initial boundary value problems arise commonly in applications with engineering and natural systems governed by nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs). Operator learning is an emerging field for solving these equations by using a neural network to learn a map between infinite dimensional input and output function spaces. These neural operators are trained using a combination of data (observations or simulations) and PDE-residuals (physics-loss). A major drawback of existing neural approaches is the requirement to retrain with new initial/boundary conditions, and the necessity for a large amount of simulation data for training. We develop a physics-informed transformer neural operator (named PINTO) that efficiently generalizes to unseen initial and boundary conditions, trained in a simulation-free setting using only physics loss. The main innovation lies in our new iterative kernel integral operator units, implemented using cross-attention, to transform the PDE solution's domain points into an initial/boundary condition-aware representation vector, enabling efficient learning of the solution function for new scenarios. The PINTO architecture is applied to simulate the solutions of important equations used in engineering applications: advection, Burgers, and steady and unsteady Navier-Stokes equations (three flow scenarios). For these five test cases, we show that the relative errors during testing under challenging conditions of unseen initial/boundary conditions are only one-fifth to one-third of other leading physics informed operator learning methods. Moreover, our PINTO model is able to accurately solve the advection and Burgers equations at time steps that are not included in the training collocation points.

      <title>Reactor-scale stellarators with force and torque minimized dipole coils</title>

Abstract: In this work, we utilize new coil objectives for stellarator optimization with autodifferentiation, including pointwise and net coil-coil forces and torques. We use these methods to perform the first large-scale optimization of planar dipole coil arrays, since arrays of small and geometrically simple coils have been proposed to partially produce the 3D magnetic fields for stellarators, generate advantageous magnetic field perturbations in tokamaks, and provide active, real-time control capabilities. We perform an ablation study to show that minimizing the orientation and location of each coil may be essential to get coil forces, coil torques, and field errors to tolerable levels. We conclude with solutions for three reactor-scale quasi-symmetric stellarators by jointly optimizing nonplanar TF coils and planar coil arrays.</description>

      <title>Persistent current in a non-Hermitian Hatano-Nelson ring: Disorder-induced amplification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14593v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-reciprocal hopping induces a synthetic magnetic flux which leads to the non-Hermitian Aharonov-Bohm effect. Since non-Hermitian Hamiltonians possess both real and imaginary eigenvalues, this effect allows the observation of real and imaginary persistent currents in a ring threaded by the synthetic flux. Motivated by this, we investigate the behavior of persistent currents in a disordered Hatano-Nelson ring with anti-Hermitian intradimer hopping. The disorder is diagonal and we explore three distinct models, namely the Aubry-Andr\'{e}-Harper model, the Fibonacci model, both representing correlated disorder, and an uncorrelated (random) model. We conduct a detailed analysis of the energy spectrum and examine the real and imaginary parts of the persistent current under various conditions such as different ring sizes and filling factors. Interestingly, we find that real and imaginary persistent currents exhibit amplification in the presence of correlated disorder. This amplification is also observed in certain individual random configurations but vanishes after configuration averaging. Additionally, we observe both diamagnetic and paramagnetic responses in the current behavior and investigate aspects of persistent currents in the absence of disorder that have not been previously explored. Interestingly, we find that the intradimer bonds host only imaginary currents, while the interdimer bonds carry only real currents. The bulk-boundary correspondence is investigated by analyzing the existence of localized edge states under the open boundary condition.</description>

      <title>Molecular Learning Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10560v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We apply the physics-learning duality to molecular systems by complementing the physical description of interacting particles with a dual learning description, where each particle is modeled as an agent minimizing a loss function. In the traditional physics framework, the equations of motion are derived from the Lagrangian function, while in the learning framework, the same equations emerge from learning dynamics driven by the agent loss function. The loss function depends on scalar quantities that describe invariant properties of all other agents or particles. To demonstrate this approach, we first infer the loss functions of oxygen and hydrogen directly from a dataset generated by the CP2K physics-based simulation of water molecules. We then employ the loss functions to develop a learning-based simulation of water molecules, which achieves comparable accuracy while being significantly more computationally efficient than standard physics-based simulations.</description>

      <title>Geometry-Informed Neural Operator Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19452v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine-learning-based surrogate models offer significant computational efficiency and faster simulations compared to traditional numerical methods, especially for problems requiring repeated evaluations of partial differential equations. This work introduces the Geometry-Informed Neural Operator Transformer (GINOT), which integrates the transformer architecture with the neural operator framework to enable forward predictions for arbitrary geometries. GINOT encodes the surface points cloud of a geometry using a sampling and grouping mechanism combined with an attention mechanism, ensuring invariance to point order and padding while maintaining robustness to variations in point density. The geometry information is seamlessly integrated with query points in the solution decoder through the attention mechanism. The performance of GINOT is validated on multiple challenging datasets, showcasing its high accuracy and strong generalization capabilities for complex and arbitrary 2D and 3D geometries.</description>
