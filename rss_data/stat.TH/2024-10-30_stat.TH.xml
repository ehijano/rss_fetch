      <title>On parameter estimation for $N(\mu,\sigma^2 I_3)$ based on projected data into $\mathbb{S}^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the projected normal distribution, with isotropic variance, on the 2-sphere using intrinsic statistics. We show that in this case, the expectation commutes with the projection and that the covariance of the normal variable has a 1-1 correspondence with the intrinsic covariance of the projected normal distribution. This allows to estimate, after model identification, the parameters of the underlying normal distribution that generates the data.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Robust Confidence Intervals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the construction of adaptive confidence intervals under Huber's contamination model when the contamination proportion is unknown. For the robust confidence interval of a Gaussian mean, we show that the optimal length of an adaptive interval must be exponentially wider than that of a non-adaptive one. An optimal construction is achieved through simultaneous uncertainty quantification of quantiles at all levels. The results are further extended beyond the Gaussian location model by addressing a general family of robust hypothesis testing. In contrast to adaptive robust estimation, our findings reveal that the optimal length of an adaptive robust confidence interval critically depends on the distribution's shape.</description>

      <title>On tail inference in scale-free inhomogeneous random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Both empirical and theoretical investigations of scale-free network models have found that large degrees in a network exert an outsized impact on its structure. However, the tools used to infer the tail behavior of degree distributions in scale-free networks often lack a strong theoretical foundation. In this paper, we introduce a new framework for analyzing the asymptotic distribution of estimators for degree tail indices in scale-free inhomogeneous random graphs. Our framework leverages the relationship between the large weights and large degrees of Norros-Reittu and Chung-Lu random graphs. In particular, we determine a rate for the number of nodes $k(n) \rightarrow \infty$ such that for all $i = 1, \dots, k(n)$, the node with the $i$-th largest weight will have the $i$-th largest degree with high probability. Such alignment of upper-order statistics is then employed to establish the asymptotic normality of three different tail index estimators based on the upper degrees. These results suggest potential applications of the framework to threshold selection and goodness-of-fit testing in scale-free networks, issues that have long challenged the network science community.</description>

      <title>Real birational implicitization for statistical models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive an implicit description of the image of a semialgebraic set under a birational map, provided that the denominators of the map are positive on the set. For statistical models which are globally rationally identifiable, this yields model-defining constraints which facilitate model membership testing, representation learning, and model equivalence tests. Many examples illustrate the applicability of our results. The implicit equations recover well-known Markov properties of classical graphical models, as well as other well-studied equations such as the Verma constraint. They also provide Markov properties for generalizations of these frameworks, such as colored or interventional graphical models, staged trees, and the recently introduced Lyapunov models. Under a further mild assumption, we show that our implicit equations generate the vanishing ideal of the model up to a saturation, generalizing previous results of Geiger, Meek and Sturmfels, Duarte and G\"orgen, Sullivant, and others.</description>

      <title>Method of Moments for Estimation of Noisy Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of recovering a ground truth high dimensional piecewise linear curve $C^*(t):[0, 1]\to\mathbb{R}^d$ from a high noise Gaussian point cloud with covariance $\sigma^2I$ centered around the curve. We establish that the sample complexity of recovering $C^*$ from data scales with order at least $\sigma^6$. We then show that recovery of a piecewise linear curve from the third moment is locally well-posed, and hence $O(\sigma^6)$ samples is also sufficient for recovery. We propose methods to recover a curve from data based on a fitting to the third moment tensor with a careful initialization strategy and conduct some numerical experiments verifying the ability of our methods to recover curves. All code for our numerical experiments is publicly available on GitHub.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Inference for Relational Graph in a Causal Vector Autoregressive Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a method for simultaneously estimating a contemporaneous graph structure and autocorrelation structure for a causal high-dimensional vector autoregressive process (VAR). The graph is estimated by estimating the stationary precision matrix using a Bayesian framework. We introduce a novel parameterization that is convenient for jointly estimating the precision matrix and the autocovariance matrices. The methodology based on the new parameterization has several desirable properties. A key feature of the proposed methodology is that it maintains causality of the process in its estimates and also provides a fast feasible way for computing the reduced rank likelihood for a high-dimensional Gaussian VAR. We use sparse priors along with the likelihood under the new parameterization to obtain the posterior of the graphical parameters as well as that of the temporal parameters. An efficient Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm is developed for posterior computation. We also establish theoretical consistency properties for the high-dimensional posterior. The proposed methodology shows excellent performance in simulations and real data applications.</description>

      <title>Identifying Drift, Diffusion, and Causal Structure from Temporal Snapshots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stochastic differential equations (SDEs) are a fundamental tool for modelling dynamic processes, including gene regulatory networks (GRNs), contaminant transport, financial markets, and image generation. However, learning the underlying SDE from observational data is a challenging task, especially when individual trajectories are not observable. Motivated by burgeoning research in single-cell datasets, we present the first comprehensive approach for jointly estimating the drift and diffusion of an SDE from its temporal marginals. Assuming linear drift and additive diffusion, we prove that these parameters are identifiable from marginals if and only if the initial distribution is not invariant to a class of generalized rotations, a condition that is satisfied by most distributions. We further prove that the causal graph of any SDE with additive diffusion can be recovered from the SDE parameters. To complement this theory, we adapt entropy-regularized optimal transport to handle anisotropic diffusion, and introduce APPEX (Alternating Projection Parameter Estimation from $X_0$), an iterative algorithm designed to estimate the drift, diffusion, and causal graph of an additive noise SDE, solely from temporal marginals. We show that each of these steps are asymptotically optimal with respect to the Kullback-Leibler divergence, and demonstrate APPEX's effectiveness on simulated data from linear additive noise SDEs.</description>

      <title>Understanding Aggregations of Proper Learners in Multiclass Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multiclass learnability is known to exhibit a properness barrier: there are learnable classes which cannot be learned by any proper learner. Binary classification faces no such barrier for learnability, but a similar one for optimal learning, which can in general only be achieved by improper learners. Fortunately, recent advances in binary classification have demonstrated that this requirement can be satisfied using aggregations of proper learners, some of which are strikingly simple. This raises a natural question: to what extent can simple aggregations of proper learners overcome the properness barrier in multiclass classification?
  We give a positive answer to this question for classes which have finite Graph dimension, $d_G$. Namely, we demonstrate that the optimal binary learners of Hanneke, Larsen, and Aden-Ali et al. (appropriately generalized to the multiclass setting) achieve sample complexity $O\left(\frac{d_G + \ln(1 / \delta)}{\epsilon}\right)$. This forms a strict improvement upon the sample complexity of ERM. We complement this with a lower bound demonstrating that for certain classes of Graph dimension $d_G$, majorities of ERM learners require $\Omega \left( \frac{d_G + \ln(1 / \delta)}{\epsilon}\right)$ samples. Furthermore, we show that a single ERM requires $\Omega \left(\frac{d_G \ln(1 / \epsilon) + \ln(1 / \delta)}{\epsilon}\right)$ samples on such classes, exceeding the lower bound of Daniely et al. (2015) by a factor of $\ln(1 / \epsilon)$. For multiclass learning in full generality -- i.e., for classes of finite DS dimension but possibly infinite Graph dimension -- we give a strong refutation to these learning strategies, by exhibiting a learnable class which cannot be learned to constant error by any aggregation of a finite number of proper learners.</description>

      <title>Universality of the $\pi^2/6$ Pathway in Avoiding Model Collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Researchers in empirical machine learning recently spotlighted their fears of so-called Model Collapse. They imagined a discard workflow, where an initial generative model is trained with real data, after which the real data are discarded, and subsequently, the model generates synthetic data on which a new model is trained. They came to the conclusion that models degenerate as model-fitting generations proceed. However, other researchers considered an augment workflow, where the original real data continue to be used in each generation of training, augmented by synthetic data from models fit in all earlier generations. Empirical results on canonical datasets and learning procedures confirmed the occurrence of model collapse under the discard workflow and avoidance of model collapse under the augment workflow. Under the augment workflow, theoretical evidence also confirmed avoidance in particular instances; specifically, Gerstgrasser et al. (2024) found that for classical Linear Regression, test risk at any later generation is bounded by a moderate multiple, viz. pi-squared-over-6 of the test risk of training with the original real data alone. Some commentators questioned the generality of theoretical conclusions based on the generative model assumed in Gerstgrasser et al. (2024): could similar conclusions be reached for other task/model pairings? In this work, we demonstrate the universality of the pi-squared-over-6 augment risk bound across a large family of canonical statistical models, offering key insights into exactly why collapse happens under the discard workflow and is avoided under the augment workflow. In the process, we provide a framework that is able to accommodate a large variety of workflows (beyond discard and augment), thereby enabling an experimenter to judge the comparative merits of multiple different workflows by simulating a simple Gaussian process.</description>

      <title>Scoring Rules and Calibration for Imprecise Probabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23001v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: What does it mean to say that, for example, the probability for rain tomorrow is between 20% and 30%? The theory for the evaluation of precise probabilistic forecasts is well-developed and is grounded in the key concepts of proper scoring rules and calibration. For the case of imprecise probabilistic forecasts (sets of probabilities), such theory is still lacking. In this work, we therefore generalize proper scoring rules and calibration to the imprecise case. We develop these concepts as relative to data models and decision problems. As a consequence, the imprecision is embedded in a clear context. We establish a close link to the paradigm of (group) distributional robustness and in doing so provide new insights for it. We argue that proper scoring rules and calibration serve two distinct goals, which are aligned in the precise case, but intriguingly are not necessarily aligned in the imprecise case. The concept of decision-theoretic entropy plays a key role for both goals. Finally, we demonstrate the theoretical insights in machine learning practice, in particular we illustrate subtle pitfalls relating to the choice of loss function in distributional robustness.</description>

      <title>Wavenumber-Explicit Well-Posedness of Bayesian Shape Inversion in Acoustic Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the Bayesian approach to the inverse problem of recovering the shape of an object from measurements of its scattered acoustic field. Working in the time-harmonic setting, we focus on a Helmholtz transmission problem and then extend our results to an exterior Dirichlet problem. We assume the scatterer to be star-shaped and we use, as prior, a truncated expansion with uniform random variables for a radial parametrization of the scatterer's boundary. The main novelty of our work is that we establish the well-posedness of the Bayesian shape inverse problem in a wavenumber-explicit way, under some conditions on the material parameters excluding quasi-resonant regimes. Our estimates highlight how the stability of the posterior with respect to the data is affected by the wavenumber (or, in other words, the frequency), whose magnitude has to be understood not in absolute terms but in relationship to the spatial scale of the problem.</description>

      <title>On the fundamental limitations of multiproposal Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study multiproposal Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms, such as Multiple-try or generalised Metropolis-Hastings schemes, which have recently received renewed attention due to their amenability to parallel computing. First, we prove that no multiproposal scheme can speed-up convergence relative to the corresponding single proposal scheme by more than a factor of $K$, where $K$ denotes the number of proposals at each iteration. This result applies to arbitrary target distributions and it implies that serial multiproposal implementations are always less efficient than single proposal ones. Secondly, we consider log-concave distributions over Euclidean spaces, proving that, in this case, the speed-up is at most logarithmic in $K$, which implies that even parallel multiproposal implementations are fundamentally limited in the computational gain they can offer. Crucially, our results apply to arbitrary multiproposal schemes and purely rely on the two-step structure of the associated kernels (i.e. first generate $K$ candidate points, then select one among those). Our theoretical findings are validated through numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Improved convergence rate of kNN graph Laplacians</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In graph-based data analysis, $k$-nearest neighbor ($k$NN) graphs are widely used due to their adaptivity to local data densities. Allowing weighted edges in the graph, the kernelized graph affinity provides a more general type of $k$NN graph where the $k$NN distance is used to set the kernel bandwidth adaptively. In this work, we consider a general class of $k$NN graph where the graph affinity is $W_{ij} = \epsilon^{-d/2} \; k_0 ( \| x_i - x_j \|^2 / \epsilon \phi( \widehat{\rho}(x_i), \widehat{\rho}(x_j) )^2 ) $, with $\widehat{\rho}(x)$ being the (rescaled) $k$NN distance at the point $x$, $\phi$ a symmetric bi-variate function, and $k_0$ a non-negative function on $[0,\infty)$. Under the manifold data setting, where $N$ i.i.d. samples $x_i$ are drawn from a density $p$ on a $d$-dimensional unknown manifold embedded in a high dimensional Euclidean space, we prove the point-wise convergence of the $k$NN graph Laplacian to the limiting manifold operator (depending on $p$) at the rate of $O(N^{-2/(d+6)}\,)$, up to a log factor, when $k_0$ and $\phi$ have $C^3$ regularity and satisfy other technical conditions. This fast rate is obtained when $\epsilon \sim N^{-2/(d+6)}\,$ and $k \sim N^{6/(d+6)}\,$, both at the optimal order to balance the theoretical bias and variance errors. When $k_0$ and $\phi$ have lower regularities, including when $k_0$ is a compactly supported function as in the standard $k$NN graph, the convergence rate degenerates to $O(N^{-1/(d+4)}\,)$. Our improved convergence rate is based on a refined analysis of the $k$NN estimator, which can be of independent interest. We validate our theory by numerical experiments on simulated data.</description>

      <title>Kernel Two-Sample Tests in High Dimension: Interplay Between Moment Discrepancy and Dimension-and-Sample Orders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2201.00073v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the increasing use of kernel-based metrics for high-dimensional and large-scale data, we study the asymptotic behavior of kernel two-sample tests when the dimension and sample sizes both diverge to infinity. We focus on the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) using isotropic kernel, including MMD with the Gaussian kernel and the Laplace kernel, and the energy distance as special cases. We derive asymptotic expansions of the kernel two-sample statistics, based on which we establish the central limit theorem (CLT) under both the null hypothesis and the local and fixed alternatives. The new non-null CLT results allow us to perform asymptotic exact power analysis, which reveals a delicate interplay between the moment discrepancy that can be detected by the kernel two-sample tests and the dimension-and-sample orders. The asymptotic theory is further corroborated through numerical studies.</description>

      <title>Entrywise error bounds for low-rank approximations of kernel matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14494v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive entrywise error bounds for low-rank approximations of kernel matrices obtained using the truncated eigen-decomposition (or singular value decomposition). While this approximation is well-known to be optimal with respect to the spectral and Frobenius norm error, little is known about the statistical behaviour of individual entries. Our error bounds fill this gap. A key technical innovation is a delocalisation result for the eigenvectors of the kernel matrix corresponding to small eigenvalues, which takes inspiration from the field of Random Matrix Theory. Finally, we validate our theory with an empirical study of a collection of synthetic and real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>Zeroth-Order Sampling Methods for Non-Log-Concave Distributions: Alleviating Metastability by Denoising Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17886v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper considers the problem of sampling from non-logconcave distribution, based on queries of its unnormalized density. It first describes a framework, Denoising Diffusion Monte Carlo (DDMC), based on the simulation of a denoising diffusion process with its score function approximated by a generic Monte Carlo estimator. DDMC is an oracle-based meta-algorithm, where its oracle is the assumed access to samples that generate a Monte Carlo score estimator. Then we provide an implementation of this oracle, based on rejection sampling, and this turns DDMC into a true algorithm, termed Zeroth-Order Diffusion Monte Carlo (ZOD-MC). We provide convergence analyses by first constructing a general framework, i.e. a performance guarantee for DDMC, without assuming the target distribution to be log-concave or satisfying any isoperimetric inequality. Then we prove that ZOD-MC admits an inverse polynomial dependence on the desired sampling accuracy, albeit still suffering from the curse of dimensionality. Consequently, for low dimensional distributions, ZOD-MC is a very efficient sampler, with performance exceeding latest samplers, including also-denoising-diffusion-based RDMC and RSDMC. Last, we experimentally demonstrate the insensitivity of ZOD-MC to increasingly higher barriers between modes or discontinuity in non-convex potential.</description>

      <title>Is Transductive Learning Equivalent to PAC Learning?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05190v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Much of learning theory is concerned with the design and analysis of probably approximately correct (PAC) learners. The closely related transductive model of learning has recently seen more scrutiny, with its learners often used as precursors to PAC learners. Our goal in this work is to understand and quantify the exact relationship between these two models. First, we observe that modest extensions of existing results show the models to be essentially equivalent for realizable learning for most natural loss functions, up to low order terms in the error and sample complexity. The situation for agnostic learning appears less straightforward, with sample complexities potentially separated by a $\frac{1}{\epsilon}$ factor. This is therefore where our main contributions lie. Our results are two-fold:
  1. For agnostic learning with bounded losses (including, for example, multiclass classification), we show that PAC learning reduces to transductive learning at the cost of low-order terms in the error and sample complexity via an adaptation of the reduction of arXiv:2304.09167 to the agnostic setting.
  2. For agnostic binary classification, we show the converse: transductive learning is essentially no more difficult than PAC learning. Together with our first result this implies that the PAC and transductive models are essentially equivalent for agnostic binary classification. This is our most technical result, and involves two steps: A symmetrization argument on the agnostic one-inclusion graph (OIG) of arXiv:2309.13692 to derive the worst-case agnostic transductive instance, and expressing the error of the agnostic OIG algorithm for this instance in terms of the empirical Rademacher complexity of the class.
  We leave as an intriguing open question whether our second result can be extended beyond binary classification to show the transductive and PAC models equivalent more broadly.</description>

      <title>Scaling Laws in Linear Regression: Compute, Parameters, and Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08466v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Empirically, large-scale deep learning models often satisfy a neural scaling law: the test error of the trained model improves polynomially as the model size and data size grow. However, conventional wisdom suggests the test error consists of approximation, bias, and variance errors, where the variance error increases with model size. This disagrees with the general form of neural scaling laws, which predict that increasing model size monotonically improves performance.
  We study the theory of scaling laws in an infinite dimensional linear regression setup. Specifically, we consider a model with $M$ parameters as a linear function of sketched covariates. The model is trained by one-pass stochastic gradient descent (SGD) using $N$ data. Assuming the optimal parameter satisfies a Gaussian prior and the data covariance matrix has a power-law spectrum of degree $a&gt;1$, we show that the reducible part of the test error is $\Theta(M^{-(a-1)} + N^{-(a-1)/a})$. The variance error, which increases with $M$, is dominated by the other errors due to the implicit regularization of SGD, thus disappearing from the bound. Our theory is consistent with the empirical neural scaling laws and verified by numerical simulation.</description>

      <title>Spatial Proportional Hazards Model with Differential Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13420v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a semiparametric proportional hazards model designed to handle spatially varying covariate functions, applicable to both geostatistical and areal data observed on irregular spatial domains. The model is estimated through the maximization of a penalized partial likelihood, with a roughness penalty term based on a differential of the spatial field over the target domain. The finite element method is employed for efficient estimation, enabling a piecewise polynomial surface representation of the spatial field. We apply this method to analyze response time data from the London Fire Brigade.</description>

      <title>Denoising diffusion probabilistic models are optimally adaptive to unknown low dimensionality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18784v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) has emerged as a mainstream generative model in generative AI. While sharp convergence guarantees have been established for the DDPM, the iteration complexity is, in general, proportional to the ambient data dimension, resulting in overly conservative theory that fails to explain its practical efficiency. This has motivated the recent work Li and Yan (2024a) to investigate how the DDPM can achieve sampling speed-ups through automatic exploitation of intrinsic low dimensionality of data. We strengthen this line of work by demonstrating, in some sense, optimal adaptivity to unknown low dimensionality. For a broad class of data distributions with intrinsic dimension $k$, we prove that the iteration complexity of the DDPM scales nearly linearly with $k$, which is optimal when using KL divergence to measure distributional discrepancy. Notably, our work is closely aligned with the independent concurrent work Potaptchik et al. (2024) -- posted two weeks prior to ours -- in establishing nearly linear-$k$ convergence guarantees for the DDPM.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Transfer Clustering: A Unified Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21263v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a general transfer learning framework for clustering given a main dataset and an auxiliary one about the same subjects. The two datasets may reflect similar but different latent grouping structures of the subjects. We propose an adaptive transfer clustering (ATC) algorithm that automatically leverages the commonality in the presence of unknown discrepancy, by optimizing an estimated bias-variance decomposition. It applies to a broad class of statistical models including Gaussian mixture models, stochastic block models, and latent class models. A theoretical analysis proves the optimality of ATC under the Gaussian mixture model and explicitly quantifies the benefit of transfer. Extensive simulations and real data experiments confirm our method's effectiveness in various scenarios.</description>

      <title>Prior Knowledge Accelerate Variance Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21922v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Variance is a basic metric to evaluate the degree of data dispersion, and it is also frequently used in the realm of statistics. However, due to the computing variance and the large dataset being time-consuming, there is an urge to accelerate this computing process. The paper suggests a new method to reduce the time of this computation, it assumes a scenario in which we already know the variance of the original dataset, and the whole variance of this merge dataset could be expressed in the form of addition between the original variance and a remainder term. When we want to calculate the total variance after this adds up, the method only needs to calculate the remainder to get the result instead of recalculating the total variance again, which we named this type of method as PKA(Prior Knowledge Acceleration). The paper mathematically proves the effectiveness of PKA in variance calculation, and the conditions for this method to accelerate properly.</description>
