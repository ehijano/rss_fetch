      <title>Similarity of Information and Collective Action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14773v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a canonical collective action game with incomplete information. Individuals attempt to coordinate to achieve a shared goal, while also facing a temptation to free-ride. Consuming more similar information about the fundamentals can help them coordinate, but it can also exacerbate free-riding. Our main result shows that more similar information facilitates (impedes) achieving a common goal when achieving the goal is sufficiently challenging (easy). We apply this insight to show why insufficiently powerful authoritarian governments may face larger protests when attempting to restrict press freedom, and why informational diversity in committees is beneficial when each vote carries more weight.</description>

      <title>National accounting from the bottom up using large-scale financial transactions data: An application to input-output tables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Technical advances enabled real-time data collection at a large scale, but lacking standards hamper their economic interpretation. Here, we benchmark a new monthly time series of inter-industrial flows of funds, constructed from aggregated and anonymised real-time payments between UK businesses, covering 5-digit SIC codes industries for the period 08/2015 to 12/2023, against established economic indicators, including GDP, input-output tables (IOTs), and stylised facts of granular firm- and industry-level production networks. We supplement the quantitative analyses with conceptual discussions, explaining the caveats of bottom-up collected payment data and their differences to national account tables. The results reveal strong GDP correlations, some qualitative consistency with official IOTs and stylised facts. We guide on the interpretation of the data and areas that require special attention for reliable quantitative research.</description>

      <title>Temptation: Immediacy and certainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Is an option especially tempting when it is both immediate and certain? I test the effect of risk on the present-bias factor given quasi-hyperbolic discounting. My experimental subjects allocate about thirty to fifty minutes of real-effort tasks between two weeks. I study dynamic consistency by comparing choices made two days in advance of the workday with choices made when work is imminent. My novel design permits estimation of present-bias using a decision with a consequence that is both immediate and certain. I find greater present-bias when the consequence is certain. I offer a methodological remedy for experimental economists.</description>

      <title>Industry Dynamics with Cartels: The Case of the Container Shipping Industry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I investigate how explicit cartels, known as ``shipping conferences", in a global container shipping market facilitated the formation of one of the largest globally integrated markets through entry, exit, and shipbuilding investment of shipping firms. Using a novel data, I develop and construct a structural model and find that the cartels shifted shipping prices by 20-50\% and encouraged firms' entry and investment. In the counterfactual, I find that cartels would increase producer surplus while slightly decreasing consumer surplus, then may increase social welfare by encouraging firms' entry and shipbuilding investment. This would validate industry policies controlling prices and quantities in the early stage of the new industry, which may not be always harmful. Investigating hypothetical allocation rules supporting large or small firms, I find that the actual rule based on tonnage shares is the best to maximize social welfare.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning for Economists</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning provides powerful methods to impute structured information from large-scale, unstructured text and image datasets. For example, economists might wish to detect the presence of economic activity in satellite images, or to measure the topics or entities mentioned in social media, the congressional record, or firm filings. This review introduces deep neural networks, covering methods such as classifiers, regression models, generative AI, and embedding models. Applications include classification, document digitization, record linkage, and methods for data exploration in massive scale text and image corpora. When suitable methods are used, deep learning models can be cheap to tune and can scale affordably to problems involving millions or billions of data points.. The review is accompanied by a companion website, EconDL, with user-friendly demo notebooks, software resources, and a knowledge base that provides technical details and additional applications.</description>

      <title>The increase in the number of low-value transactions in international trade</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper documents a new feature of international trade: the increase in the number of low-value transactions. Using Spanish data, we show that the share of low-value transactions in the total number of transactions increased from 9% to 61% in exports and from 14% to 54% in imports between 1997 and 2023. The increase in the number of low-value trade transactions is related to the rise in e-commerce and direct-to-customer sales facilitated by online retail platforms. In the case of exports, the increase in the number of low-value transactions is also explained by the fast-fashion strategy followed by clothing firms.</description>

      <title>Income, health, and cointegration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data for many nations show a long-run increase, over many decades, of income, indexed by GDP per capita, and population health, indexed by mortality or life expectancy at birth (LEB). However, the short-run and long-run relationships between these variables have been interpreted in different ways, and many controversies are still open. Some authors have claimed that the causal relationships between population health and income can be discovered using cointegration models. We show, however, that empirically testing a cointegration relation between LEB and GDP per capita is not a sound method to infer a causal link between health and income. For a given country it is easy to find computer-generated data or time series of real observations, related or unrelated to the country, that according to standard methods are also cointegrated with the country's LEB. More generally, given a trending time series, it is easy to find other series, observational or artificial, that appear cointegrated with it. Thus, standard cointegration methodology cannot distinguish whether cointegration relationships are spurious or causal.</description>

      <title>Willingness to Pay for an Electricity Connection: A Choice Experiment Among Rural Households and Enterprises in Nigeria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rural electrification initiatives worldwide frequently encounter financial planning challenges due to a lack of reliable market insights. This research delves into the preferences and marginal willingness to pay (mWTP) for upfront electricity connections in rural and peri-urban areas of Nigeria. We investigate discrete choice experiment data gathered from 3,599 households and 1,122 Small to Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) across three geopolitical zones of Nigeria, collected during the 2021 PeopleSuN project survey phase. Employing conditional logit modeling, we analyze this data to explore preferences and marginal willingness to pay for electricity connection. Our findings show that households prioritize nighttime electricity access, while SMEs place a higher value on daytime electricity. When comparing improvements in electricity capacity to medium or high-capacity, SMEs exhibit a sharp increase in willingness to pay for high-capacity, while households value the two options more evenly. Preferences for the electricity source vary among SMEs, but households display a reluctance towards diesel generators and a preference for the grid or solar solutions. Moreover, households with older heads express greater aversion to connection fees, and male-headed households show a stronger preference for nighttime electricity compared to their female-headed counterparts. The outcomes of this study yield pivotal insights to tailor electrification strategies for rural Nigeria, emphasizing the importance of considering the diverse preferences of households and SMEs.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Digitalization and Climate: Don't Predict, Mitigate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Digitalization is a core component of the green transition. Today's focus is on quantifying and pre-dicting the climate effects of digitalization through various life-cycle assessments and baseline sce-nario methodologies. Here we argue that this is a mistake. Most attempts at prediction are based on three implicit assumptions: (a) the digital carbon footprint can be quantified, (b) business-as-usual with episodic change leading to a new era of stability, and (c) investments in digitalization will be delivered within the cost, timeframe, and benefits described in their business cases. We problema-tize each assumption within the context of digitalization and argue that the digital carbon footprint is inherently unpredictable. We build on uncertainty literature to show that even if you cannot predict, you can still mitigate. On that basis, we propose to rethink practice on the digital carbon footprint from prediction to mitigation.</description>

      <title>Cryptoeconomics and Tokenomics as Economics: A Survey with Opinions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper surveys products and studies on cryptoeconomics and tokenomics from an economic perspective, as these terms are still (i) ill-defined and (ii) disconnected from economic disciplines. We first suggest that they can be novel when integrated; we then conduct a literature review and case study following consensus-building for decentralization and token value for autonomy. Integration requires simultaneous consideration of strategic behavior, spamming, Sybil attacks, free-riding, marginal cost, marginal utility and stabilizers. This survey is the first systematization of knowledge on cryptoeconomics and tokenomics, aiming to bridge the contexts of economics and blockchain.</description>

      <title>Measuring artificial intelligence: a systematic assessment and implications for governance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.10304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.10304v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Governing artificial intelligence (AI) is high on the political agenda, but it is still not clear how to define and measure it. We compare four approaches to identifying AI patented inventions that reflect different ways of understanding AI with divergent definitions. Using US patents from 1990-2019, we assess the extent to which each approach qualifies AI as a general purpose technology (GPT) and study patterns of concentration, which both are criteria relevant for regulation. The four approaches overlap on only 1.37% of patents and vary in scale, accounting for shares that range from 3-17% of all US patents in 2019. The smallest set of AI patents in our sample, identified by the latest AI keywords, is most GPT-like with high levels of growth and generality. All four approaches show AI inventions to be concentrated in few firms, confirming worries about competition. Our results suggest that regulation may not be straightforward, as the identification of AI inventions ultimately depends on how AI is defined.</description>

      <title>Measures of physical mixing evaluate the economic mobility of the typical individual</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.02800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.02800v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Measures of economic mobility represent aggregate values for how individual wealth changes over time. As such, these measures may not describe the feasibility of a typical individual to change their wealth. To address this limitation, we introduce mixing, a concept from statistical physics, as a relevant phenomenon for quantifying how individuals move across the wealth distribution. We display the relationship between mixing and mobility both theoretically and using data. By studying the properties of an established model of wealth dynamics, we show that some individuals can move across the distribution when wealth is a non-mixing observable. Only in the mixing case every individual is able to move across the whole wealth distribution. There is also a direct equivalence between measures of mixing and the magnitude of the standard measures of economic mobility, but the opposite is not true. We then describe an empirical method for estimating the mixing properties of wealth dynamics in practice. We use this method to present a pedagogical application using the USA longitudinal data. This, approach, even though limited in data availability, leads to results suggesting that wealth in the USA is either non-mixing or that it takes a very long time for the individuals to mix within the distribution. These results showcase how mixing can be used in tandem with measures of mobility for drawing conclusions about the extent of mobility across the whole distribution.</description>

      <title>The Arrival of Fast Internet and Employment in Africa: Comment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13694v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hjort and Poulsen (2019) frames the staggered arrival of submarine Internet cables on the shores of Africa circa 2010 as a difference-in-differences natural experiment. The paper finds positive impacts of broadband on individual- and firm-level employment and nighttime light emissions. These results largely are not robust to alternative geocoding of survey locations, to correcting for a satellite changeover at end-2009, and to revisiting a definition of the treated zone that has no clear technological basis, is narrower than the spatial resolution of nearly all the data sources, and is empirically suboptimal as a representation of the geography of broadband.</description>

Abstract: This note explains the equivalence between approximate rationalizability and approximate cost-rationalizability within the context of consumer demand. In connection with these results, we interpret Afriat's (1973) critical cost efficiency index (CCEI) as a measure of approximate rationalizability through cost inefficiency, in the sense that an agent is spending more money than is required to achieve her utility targets.</description>

      <title>Concentration-Based Inference for Evaluating Horizontal Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12924v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Antitrust authorities routinely rely on concentration measures to evaluate the potential negative impacts of mergers. Using a first-order approximation argument with logit and CES demand, I show that the welfare effect of a merger on consumer surplus is proportional to the change in the Herfindahl-Hirschman index, where the proportionality coefficient depends on price responsiveness parameter, market size, and the distribution of merging firms' shares. This paper elucidates how HHI measures inform the market power effects of mergers.</description>
