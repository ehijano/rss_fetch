      <title>DeTEcT: Dynamic and Probabilistic Parameters Extension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a theoretical extension of the DeTEcT framework proposed by Sadykhov et al., DeTEcT, where a formal analysis framework was introduced for modelling wealth distribution in token economies. DeTEcT is a framework for analysing economic activity, simulating macroeconomic scenarios, and algorithmically setting policies in token economies. This paper proposes four ways of parametrizing the framework, where dynamic vs static parametrization is considered along with the probabilistic vs non-probabilistic. Using these parametrization techniques, we demonstrate that by adding restrictions to the framework it is possible to derive the existing wealth distribution models from DeTEcT. In addition to exploring parametrization techniques, this paper studies how money supply in DeTEcT framework can be transformed to become dynamic, and how this change will affect the dynamics of wealth distribution. The motivation for studying dynamic money supply is that it enables DeTEcT to be applied to modelling token economies without maximum supply (i.e., Ethereum), and it adds constraints to the framework in the form of symmetries.</description>

      <title>A Taxmans guide to taxation of crypto assets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15074v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Financial system has witnessed rapid technological changes. The rise of Bitcoin and other crypto assets based on Distributed Ledger Technology mark a fundamental change in the way people transact and transmit value over a decentralized network, spread across geographies. This has created regulatory and tax policy blind spots, as governments and tax administrations take time to understand and provide policy responses to this innovative, revolutionary, and fast-paced technology. Due to the breakneck speed of innovation in blockchain technology and advent of Decentralized Finance, Decentralized Autonomous Organizations and the Metaverse, it is unlikely that the policy interventions and guidance by regulatory authorities or tax administrations would be ahead or in sync with the pace of innovation. This paper tries to explain the principles on which crypto assets function, their underlying technology and relates them to the tax issues and taxable events which arise within this ecosystem. It also provides instances of tax and regulatory policy responses already in effect in various jurisdictions, including the recent changes in reporting standards by the FATF and the OECD. This paper tries to explain the rationale behind existing laws and policies and the challenges in their implementation. It also attempts to present a ballpark estimate of tax potential of this asset class and suggests creation of global public digital infrastructure that can address issues related to pseudonymity and extra-territoriality. The paper analyses both direct and indirect taxation issues related to crypto assets and discusses more recent aspects like proof-of-stake and maximal extractable value in greater detail.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Granular Models of Firm Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15226v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit granular models that represent the size of a firm as the sum of the sizes of multiple constituents or sub-units. Originally developed to address the unexpectedly slow reduction in volatility as firm size increases, these models also explain the shape of the distribution of firm growth rates.
  We introduce new theoretical insights regarding the relationship between firm size and growth rate statistics within this framework, directly linking the growth statistics of a firm to how diversified it is. The non-intuitive nature of our results arises from the fat-tailed distributions of the size and the number of sub-units, which suggest the categorization of firms into three distinct diversification types: well-diversified firms with sizes evenly distributed across many sub-units, firms with many sub-units but concentrated size in just a few, and poorly diversified firms consisting of only a small number of sub-units.
  Inspired by our theoretical findings, we identify new empirical patterns in firm growth. Our findings show that growth volatility, when adjusted by average size-conditioned volatility, has a size-independent distribution, but with a tail that is much too thin to be in agreement with the predictions of granular models. Furthermore, the predicted Gaussian distribution of growth rates, even when rescaled for firm-specific volatility, remains fat-tailed across all sizes. Such discrepancies not only challenge the granularity hypothesis but also underscore the need for deeper exploration into the mechanisms driving firm growth.</description>
