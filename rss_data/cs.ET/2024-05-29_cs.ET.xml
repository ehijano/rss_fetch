      <title>Error-Free and Current-Driven Synthetic Antiferromagnetic Domain Wall Memory Enabled by Channel Meandering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new type of multi-bit and energy-efficient magnetic memory based on current-driven, field-free, and highly controlled domain wall motion. A meandering domain wall channel with precisely interspersed pinning regions provides the multi-bit capability of a magnetic tunnel junction. The magnetic free layer of the memory device has perpendicular magnetic anisotropy and interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, so that spin-orbit torques induce efficient domain wall motion. Using micromagnetic simulations, we find two pinning mechanisms that lead to different cell designs: two-way switching and four-way switching. The memory cell design choices and the physics behind these pinning mechanisms are discussed in detail. Furthermore, we show that switching reliability and speed may be significantly improved by replacing the ferromagnetic free layer with a synthetic antiferromagnetic layer. Switching behavior and material choices will be discussed for the two implementations.</description>

      <title>eQMARL: Entangled Quantum Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Distributed Cooperation over Quantum Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collaboration is a key challenge in distributed multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) environments. Learning frameworks for these decentralized systems must weigh the benefits of explicit player coordination against the communication overhead and computational cost of sharing local observations and environmental data. Quantum computing has sparked a potential synergy between quantum entanglement and cooperation in multi-agent environments, which could enable more efficient distributed collaboration with minimal information sharing. This relationship is largely unexplored, however, as current state-of-the-art quantum MARL (QMARL) implementations rely on classical information sharing rather than entanglement over a quantum channel as a coordination medium. In contrast, in this paper, a novel framework dubbed entangled QMARL (eQMARL) is proposed. The proposed eQMARL is a distributed actor-critic framework that facilitates cooperation over a quantum channel and eliminates local observation sharing via a quantum entangled split critic. Introducing a quantum critic uniquely spread across the agents allows coupling of local observation encoders through entangled input qubits over a quantum channel, which requires no explicit sharing of local observations and reduces classical communication overhead. Further, agent policies are tuned through joint observation-value function estimation via joint quantum measurements, thereby reducing the centralized computational burden. Experimental results show that eQMARL with ${\Psi}^{+}$ entanglement converges to a cooperative strategy up to $17.8\%$ faster and with a higher overall score compared to split classical and fully centralized classical and quantum baselines. The results also show that eQMARL achieves this performance with a constant factor of $25$-times fewer centralized parameters compared to the split classical baseline.</description>

      <title>The MQT Handbook: A Summary of Design Automation Tools and Software for Quantum Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computers are becoming a reality and numerous quantum computing applications with a near-term perspective (e.g., for finance, chemistry, machine learning, and optimization) and with a long-term perspective (e.g., for cryptography or unstructured search) are currently being investigated. However, designing and realizing potential applications for these devices in a scalable fashion requires automated, efficient, and user-friendly software tools that cater to the needs of end users, engineers, and physicists at every level of the entire quantum software stack. Many of the problems to be tackled in that regard are similar to design problems from the classical realm for which sophisticated design automation tools have been developed in the previous decades.
  The Munich Quantum Toolkit (MQT) is a collection of software tools for quantum computing developed by the Chair for Design Automation at the Technical University of Munich which explicitly utilizes this design automation expertise. Our overarching objective is to provide solutions for design tasks across the entire quantum software stack. This entails high-level support for end users in realizing their applications, efficient methods for the classical simulation, compilation, and verification of quantum circuits, tools for quantum error correction, support for physical design, and more. These methods are supported by corresponding data structures (such as decision diagrams) and core methods (such as SAT encodings/solvers). All of the developed tools are available as open-source implementations and are hosted on https://github.com/cda-tum.</description>

      <title>Fast-FedUL: A Training-Free Federated Unlearning with Provable Skew Resilience</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18040v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has recently emerged as a compelling machine learning paradigm, prioritizing the protection of privacy for training data. The increasing demand to address issues such as ``the right to be forgotten'' and combat data poisoning attacks highlights the importance of techniques, known as \textit{unlearning}, which facilitate the removal of specific training data from trained FL models. Despite numerous unlearning methods proposed for centralized learning, they often prove inapplicable to FL due to fundamental differences in the operation of the two learning paradigms. Consequently, unlearning in FL remains in its early stages, presenting several challenges. Many existing unlearning solutions in FL require a costly retraining process, which can be burdensome for clients. Moreover, these methods are primarily validated through experiments, lacking theoretical assurances. In this study, we introduce Fast-FedUL, a tailored unlearning method for FL, which eliminates the need for retraining entirely. Through meticulous analysis of the target client's influence on the global model in each round, we develop an algorithm to systematically remove the impact of the target client from the trained model. In addition to presenting empirical findings, we offer a theoretical analysis delineating the upper bound of our unlearned model and the exact retrained model (the one obtained through retraining using untargeted clients). Experimental results with backdoor attack scenarios indicate that Fast-FedUL effectively removes almost all traces of the target client, while retaining the knowledge of untargeted clients (obtaining a high accuracy of up to 98\% on the main task). Significantly, Fast-FedUL attains the lowest time complexity, providing a speed that is 1000 times faster than retraining. Our source code is publicly available at \url{https://github.com/thanhtrunghuynh93/fastFedUL}.</description>

      <title>LLM experiments with simulation: Large Language Model Multi-Agent System for Process Simulation Parametrization in Digital Twins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel design of a multi-agent system framework that applies a large language model (LLM) to automate the parametrization of process simulations in digital twins. We propose a multi-agent framework that includes four types of agents: observation, reasoning, decision and summarization. By enabling dynamic interaction between LLM agents and simulation model, the developed system can automatically explore the parametrization of the simulation and use heuristic reasoning to determine a set of parameters to control the simulation to achieve an objective. The proposed approach enhances the simulation model by infusing it with heuristics from LLM and enables autonomous search for feasible parametrization to solve a user task. Furthermore, the system has the potential to increase user-friendliness and reduce the cognitive load on human users by assisting in complex decision-making processes. The effectiveness and functionality of the system are demonstrated through a case study, and the visualized demos are available at a GitHub Repository: https://github.com/YuchenXia/LLMDrivenSimulation</description>

      <title>ReStorEdge: An edge computing system with reuse semantics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17263v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates an edge computing system where requests are processed by a set of replicated edge servers. We investigate a class of applications where similar queries produce identical results. To reduce processing overhead on the edge servers we store the results of previous computations and return them when new queries are sufficiently similar to earlier ones that produced the results, avoiding the necessity of processing every new query. We implement a similarity-based data classification system, which we evaluate based on real-world datasets of images and voice queries. We evaluate a range of orchestration strategies to distribute queries and cached results between edge nodes and show that the throughput of queries over a system of distributed edge nodes can be increased by 25-33%, increasing its capacity for higher workloads.</description>

      <title>Optimizing T and CNOT Gates in Quantum Ripple-Carry Adders and Comparators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17921v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The state of the art of quantum circuits using the ripple-carry strategy for the addition and comparison of two n-bit numbers is presented, as well as optimizations in the Clifford+T gate set, both in terms of CNOT-depth and T-depth, or CNOT-count and T-count. In particular, we consider the adders presented by Cuccaro et al. and Takahashi et al., and exhibit an adder with a T-depth of 3n and a CNOT-depth of 8n, while without optimization of the original circuits, a T-depth of 6n is expected. Note that we have focused here on quantum ripple-carry adders using at most one ancilla, without any approximation of the 3-qubit gates involved (Toffoli, Peres and TR) or any strategy involving a measurement.</description>
