      <title>HGC: A hybrid method combining gravity model and cycle structure for identifying influential spreaders in complex networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying influential spreaders in complex networks is a critical challenge in network science, with broad applications in disease control, information dissemination, and influence analysis in social networks. The gravity model, a distinctive approach for identifying influential spreaders, has attracted significant attention due to its ability to integrate node influence and the distance between nodes. However, the law of gravity is symmetric, whereas the influence between different nodes is asymmetric. Existing gravity model-based methods commonly rely on the topological distance as a metric to measure the distance between nodes. Such reliance neglects the strength or frequency of connections between nodes, resulting in symmetric influence values between node pairs, which ultimately leads to an inaccurate assessment of node influence. Moreover, these methods often overlook cycle structures within networks, which provide redundant pathways for nodes and contribute significantly to the overall connectivity and stability of the network. In this paper, we propose a hybrid method called HGC, which integrates the gravity model with effective distance and incorporates cycle structure to address the issues above. Effective distance, derived from probabilities, measures the distance between a source node and others by considering its connectivity, providing a more accurate reflection of actual relationships between nodes. To evaluate the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed method, we conducted several experiments on eight real-world networks based on the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered model. The results demonstrate that HGC outperforms seven compared methods in accurately identifying influential nodes.</description>

      <title>Cross-modal Medical Image Generation Based on Pyramid Convolutional Attention Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of multimodal medical imaging can provide complementary and comprehensive information for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, in clinical practice, since positron emission tomography (PET) is often missing, multimodal images might be incomplete. To address this problem, we propose a method that can efficiently utilize structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) image information to generate high-quality PET images. Our generation model efficiently utilizes pyramid convolution combined with channel attention mechanism to extract multi-scale local features in sMRI, and injects global correlation information into these features using self-attention mechanism to ensure the restoration of the generated PET image on local texture and global structure. Additionally, we introduce additional loss functions to guide the generation model in producing higher-quality PET images. Through experiments conducted on publicly available ADNI databases, the generated images outperform previous research methods in various performance indicators (average absolute error: 0.0194, peak signal-to-noise ratio: 29.65, structural similarity: 0.9486) and are close to real images. In promoting AD diagnosis, the generated images combined with their corresponding sMRI also showed excellent performance in AD diagnosis tasks (classification accuracy: 94.21 %), and outperformed previous research methods of the same type. The experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms other competing methods in quantitative metrics, qualitative visualization, and evaluation criteria.</description>

      <title>Semi-analytical model for the calculation of solar radiation pressure and its effects on a LEO satellite with predicting the change in position vectors using machine learning techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid increase in the deployment of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites, catering to diverse applications such as communication, Earth observation, environmental monitoring, and scientific research, has significantly amplified the complexity of trajectory management. The current work focuses on calculating and analyzing perturbation effects on a satellite's anticipated trajectory in LEO, considering Solar Radiation Pressure (SRP) as the main perturbing force. The acceleration due to SRP and it's effects on the satellite was calculated using a custom-built Python module mainly based on the hypothesis of the cannonball model. The study demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed model through comprehensive simulations and comparisons with existing analytical and numerical methods. Here, the primary Keplerian orbital characteristics were employed to analyze a simulated low-earth orbit LEO satellite, initially visualizing the satellite's trajectory and ground tracks at a designated altitude. The study also focuses on a comparative analysis of ground stations, primarily considering the main regions of the subcontinent, with revisit time as the key parameter for comparison. In the end, we combine analytical techniques with Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to predict changes in the position vectors of the satellite. Using ML techniques, the model can adaptively learn and refine predictions based on historical data and real-time input, thus improving accuracy over time. In addition, the incorporation of analytical methods allows for a deeper understanding of the underlying physics governing satellite motion, enabling more precise adjustments and corrections.</description>

      <title>FinML-Chain: A Blockchain-Integrated Dataset for Enhanced Financial Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16277v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning is critical for innovation and efficiency in financial markets, offering predictive models and data-driven decision-making. However, challenges such as missing data, lack of transparency, untimely updates, insecurity, and incompatible data sources limit its effectiveness. Blockchain technology, with its transparency, immutability, and real-time updates, addresses these challenges. We present a framework for integrating high-frequency on-chain data with low-frequency off-chain data, providing a benchmark for addressing novel research questions in economic mechanism design. This framework generates modular, extensible datasets for analyzing economic mechanisms such as the Transaction Fee Mechanism, enabling multi-modal insights and fairness-driven evaluations. Using four machine learning techniques, including linear regression, deep neural networks, XGBoost, and LSTM models, we demonstrate the framework's ability to produce datasets that advance financial research and improve understanding of blockchain-driven systems. Our contributions include: (1) proposing a research scenario for the Transaction Fee Mechanism and demonstrating how the framework addresses previously unexplored questions in economic mechanism design; (2) providing a benchmark for financial machine learning by open-sourcing a sample dataset generated by the framework and the code for the pipeline, enabling continuous dataset expansion; and (3) promoting reproducibility, transparency, and collaboration by fully open-sourcing the framework and its outputs. This initiative supports researchers in extending our work and developing innovative financial machine-learning models, fostering advancements at the intersection of machine learning, blockchain, and economics.</description>
