      <title>Pfaffian Formulation of Schur's $Q$-functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a Pfaffian formula that extends Schur's $Q$-functions $Q_\lambda$ to be indexed by compositions $\lambda$ with negative parts. This formula makes the Pfaffian construction more consistent with other constructions, such as the Young tableau and Vertex Operator constructions. With this construction, we develop a proof technique involving decomposing $Q_\lambda$ into sums indexed by partitions with removed parts. Consequently, we are able to prove several identities of Schur's $Q$-functions using only simple algebraic methods.</description>

      <title>Almost Bipartite non-K\"onig-Egerv\'ary Graphs Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\alpha(G)$ denote the cardinality of a maximum independent set, while $\mu(G)$ be the size of a maximum matching in $G=\left( V,E\right) $. It is known that if $\alpha(G)+\mu(G)=\left\vert V\right\vert $, then $G$ is a K\"{o}nig-Egerv\'{a}ry graph.
  The critical difference $d(G)$ is $\max\{d(I):I\in\mathrm{Ind}(G)\}$, where $\mathrm{Ind}(G)$\ denotes the family of all independent sets of $G$. If $A\in\mathrm{Ind}(G)$ with $d\left( X\right) =d(G)$, then $A$ is a critical independent set. For a graph $G$, let $\mathrm{diadem}(G)=\bigcup\{S:S$ is a critical independent set in $G\}$, and $\varrho_{v}\left( G\right) $ denote the number of vertices $v\in V\left( G\right) $, such that $G-v$ is a K\"{o}nig-Egerv\'{a}ry graph. A graph is called almost bipartite if it has a unique odd cycle.
  In this paper, we show that if $G$ is an almost bipartite non-K\"{o}nig-Egerv\'{a}ry graph with the unique odd cycle $C$, then the following assertions are true:
  1. every maximum matching of $G$ contains $\left\lfloor {V(C)}/{2}\right\rfloor $ edges belonging to $C$;
  2. $V(C)\cup N_{G}\left[ \mathrm{diadem}\left( G\right) \right] =V$ and $V(C)\cap N_{G}\left[ \mathrm{diadem}\left( G\right) \right] =\emptyset$;
  3. $\varrho_{v}\left( G\right) =\left\vert \mathrm{corona}\left( G\right) \right\vert -\left\vert \mathrm{diadem}\left( G\right) \right\vert $, where $\mathrm{corona}\left( G\right) $ is the union of all maximum independent sets of $G$;
  4. $\varrho_{v}\left( G\right) =\left\vert V\right\vert $ if and only if $G=C_{2k+1}$ for some integer $k\geq1$.</description>

      <title>$q$-Analogs of divisible design graphs and Deza graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Divisible design graphs were introduced in 2011 by Haemers, Kharaghani and Meulenberg. In this paper, we introduce the notion of $q$-analogs of divisible design graphs and show that all $q$-analogs of divisible design graphs come from spreads, and are actually $q$-analogs of strongly regular graphs. Deza graphs were introduced by Erickson, Fernando, Haemers and Hardy in 1999. In this paper, we introduce $q$-analogs of Deza graphs. Further, we determine possible parameters, give examples of $q$-analogs of Deza graphs and characterize all non-strongly regular $q$-analogs of Deza graphs with the smallest parameters.</description>

      <title>A note on edge irregularity strength of Dandelion graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a simple graph $G$, a vertex labeling $\phi:V(G) \rightarrow \{1, 2,\ldots,k\}$ is called $k$-labeling. The weight of an edge $xy$ in $G$, written $w_{\phi}(xy)$, is the sum of the labels of end vertices $x$ and $y$, i.e., $w_{\phi}(xy)=\phi(x)+\phi(y)$. A vertex $k$-labeling is defined to be an edge irregular $k$-labeling of the graph $G$ if for every two different edges $e$ and $f$, $w_{\phi}(e) \neq w_{\phi}(f)$. The minimum $k$ for which the graph $G$ has an edge irregular $k$-labeling is called the edge irregularity strength of $G$, written $es(G)$. In this note, we find the exact value of edge irregularity strength of Dandelion graph when $\Delta(G) \geq \lceil \frac{|E(G)|+1}{2} \rceil$; and determine the bounds when $\Delta(G) &lt; \lceil \frac{|E(G)|+1}{2} \rceil $.</description>

      <title>Representation stability in the intrinsic hyperplane arrangements associated to irreducible representations of the symmetric-groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Some of the most classically relevant Hyperplane arrangements are the Braid Arrangements $B_n$ and their associated compliment spaces $\mathcal{F}_n$. In their recent work, Tsilevich, Vershik, and Yuzvinsky construct what they refer to as the intrinsic hyperplane arrangement within any irreducible representation of the symmetric group that generalize the classical braid arrangements. Through examples it is also shown that the associated compliment spaces to these intrinsic arrangements display behaviors far removed from $\mathcal{F}_n$. In this work we study the intrinsic hyperplane arrangements of irreducible representations of the symmetric group from the perspective of representation stability.</description>

      <title>Digraphs in which every $t$ vertices share exactly $\lambda$ out-neighbors and exactly $\lambda$ in-neighbors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the notion of two-way $(t,\lambda)$-liking digraphs as a way to extend the results for generalized friendship graphs.
  A two-way $(t,\lambda)$-liking digraph is a digraph in which every $t$ vertices have exactly $\lambda$ common out-neighbors and $\lambda$ common in-neighbors.
  We first show that if $\lambda \ge 2$, then a two-way $(2,\lambda)$-liking digraph of order $n$ is $k$-diregular for a positive integer $k$ satisfying the equation $(n-1)\lambda=k(k-1)$.
  This result is comparable to the result by Bose and Shrikhande in 1969 and actually extends it.
  Another main result is that if $t \ge 3$, then the complete digraph on $t+\lambda$ vertices is the only two-way $(t,\lambda)$-liking digraph.
  This result can stand up to the result by Carstens and Kruse in 1977 and essentially extends it.
  In addition, we find that two-way $(t, \lambda)$-liking digraphs are closely linked to symmetric block designs and extend some existing results of $(t, \lambda)$-liking digraphs.</description>

      <title>The asymptotic existence of BIBDs having a nesting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A $(v,k,\lambda)$-BIBD $(X,\mathcal B)$ can be nested if there is a mapping $\phi:\mathcal B\rightarrow X$ such that $(X,\{B\cup\{\phi(B)\}\mid B\in\mathcal B\})$ is a $(v,k+1,\lambda+1)$-packing. A $(v,k,\lambda)$-BIBD has a (perfect) nesting if and only if its incidence graph has a harmonious (exact) coloring with $v$ colors. This paper shows that given any positive integers $k$ and $\lambda$, if $k\geq 2\lambda+2$, then for any sufficiently large $v$, every $(v,k,\lambda)$-BIBD can be nested into a $(v,k+1,\lambda+1)$-packing; and if $k=2\lambda+1$, then for any sufficiently large $v$ satisfying $v \equiv 1 \pmod {2k}$, there exists a $(v,k,\lambda)$-BIBD having a perfect nesting. Banff difference families (BDF), as a special kind of difference families (DF), can be used to generate nested designs. This paper shows that if $G$ is a finite abelian group with a large size whose number of $2$-order elements is no more than a given constant, and $k\geq 2\lambda+2$, then a $(G,k,\lambda)$-BDF can be obtained by taking any $(G,k,\lambda)$-DF and then replacing each of its base blocks by a suitable translation. This is a Nov\'{a}k-like theorem. Nov\'{a}k conjectured in 1974 that for any cyclic Steiner triple system of order $v$, it is always possible to choose one block from each block orbit so that the chosen blocks are pairwise disjoint. Nov\'{a}k's conjecture was generalized to any cyclic $(v,k,\lambda)$-BIBDs by Feng, Horsley and Wang in 2021, who conjectured that given any positive integers $k$ and $\lambda$ such that $k\geq \lambda+1$, there exists an integer $v_0$ such that, for any cyclic $(v,k,\lambda)$-BIBD with $v\geq v_0$, it is always possible to choose one block from each block orbit so that the chosen blocks are pairwise disjoint. This paper confirms this conjecture for every $k\geq \lambda+2$.</description>

      <title>Competition-common enemy graphs of degree-bounded digraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The competition-common enemy graph (CCE graph) of a digraph $D$ is the graph with the vertex set $V(D)$ and an edge $uv$ if and only if $u$ and $v$ have a common predator and a common prey in $D$. If each vertex of a digraph $D$ has indegree at most $i$ and outdegree at most $j$, then $D$ is called an $\langle i,j \rangle$ digraph. In this paper, we fully characterize the CCE graphs of $\langle 2,2\rangle$ digraphs. Then we investigate the CCE graphs of acyclic $\langle 2,2 \rangle$ digraphs, and prove that any CCE graph of an acyclic $\langle 2,2 \rangle$ digraph with at most seven components is interval, and the bound is sharp. While characterizing acyclic $\langle 2,2 \rangle$ digraphs that have interval graphs as their competition graphs, Hefner~{\it et al}. (1991) initiated the study of competition graphs of degree-bounded digraphs. Recently, Lee~{\em et al}. (2017) and Eoh and Kim (2021) studied phylogeny graphs of degree-bounded digraphs to extend their work.</description>

      <title>Quasi-period collapse in half-integral polygons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A half-integral polygon with quasi-period collapse behaves similarly to a lattice polygon in the sense that the number of lattice points in its integer dilates can be calculated as values of a polynomial, its Ehrhart polynomial. As a main result, we classify the Ehrhart polynomials of all half-integral non-lattice polygons with quasi-period collapse. In particular, we obtain that for any positive integer $i$, the polynomial $\frac{4i+5}{2}t^2+\frac{2i+7}{2}t+1\in \mathbb{Q}[t]$ is an Ehrhart polynomial of a rational polygon, which was an open question for $i&gt;1$.
  We also study some extreme cases in detail. In particular, we show that up to affine unimodular equivalence there exist exactly $30$ half-integral non-lattice polygons with quasi-periodic collapse with exactly one interior lattice point, which are the dual polygons of the $30$ LDP polygons of Gorenstein index $2$. Furthermore, we classify all half-integral polygons with quasi-period collapse with at most $6$ interior lattice points or with $i\geq 1$ interior lattice points and the maximum possible number $2i+7$ of boundary lattice points.</description>

      <title>Unimodular polytopes and a new Heller-type bound on totally unimodular matrices via Seymour's decomposition theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a sharp upper bound on the number of columns of a totally unimodular matrix with column sums $1$ which improves upon Heller's bound by a factor of $2$. The proof uses Seymour's decomposition theorem. Unimodular polytopes are lattice polytopes such that the vertices of every full-dimensional subsimplex form an affine lattice basis. This is a subclass of 0/1-polytopes and contains for instance edge polytopes of bipartite graphs. Our main result implies a sharp upper bound on the number of vertices of unimodular polytopes.</description>

      <title>Sharp analysis on the joint distribution of the number of descents and inverse descents in a random permutation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chatteerjee and Diaconis have recently shown the asymptotic normality for the joint distribution of the number of descents and inverse descents in a random permutation. A noteworthy point of their results is that the asymptotic variance of the normal distribution is diagonal, which means that the number of descents and inverse descents are asymptotically uncorrelated.The goal of this paper is to go further in this analysis by proving a large deviation principlefor the joint distribution. We shall show that the rate function of the joint distributionis the sum of the rate functions of the marginal distributions, which also means that the number of descents and inverse descents are asymptotically independent at the large deviation level. However,we are going to prove that they are finely dependent at the sharp large deviation level.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On March 16, 2024, Daniel Litt, in an X-post, proposed the following brainteaser: "Flip a fair coin 100 times. It gives a sequence of heads (H) and tails (T). For each HH in the sequence of flips, Alice gets a point; for each HT, Bob does, so e.g. for the sequence THHHT Alice gets 2 points and Bob gets 1 point. Who is most likely to win?" We show the power of symbolic computation, in particular the (continuous) Almkvist-Zeilberger algorithm, to answer this, and far more general, questions of this kind.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics of Weighted Reflectable Walks in $A_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lattice walks are used to model various physical phenomena. In particular, walks within Weyl chambers connect directly to representation theory via the Littelmann path model. We derive asymptotics for centrally weighted lattice walks within the Weyl chamber corresponding to $A_2$ by using tools from analytic combinatorics in several variables (ACSV). We find universality classes depending on the weights of the walks, in line with prior results on the weighted Gouyou-Beauchamps model. Along the way, we identify a type of singularity within a multivariate rational generating function that is not yet covered by the theory of ACSV. We conjecture asymptotics for this type of singularity.</description>

      <title>Orbit structures and complexity in Schubert and Richardson Varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is twofold. Firstly, we provide a type-uniform formula for the torus complexity of the usual torus action on a Richardson variety, by developing the notion of algebraic dimensions of Bruhat intervals, strengthening a type A result by Donten-Bury, Escobar and Portakal. In the process, we give an explicit description of the torus action on any Deodhar component as well as describe the root subgroups that comprise the component. Secondly, we exhibit a codimension preserving bijection between Levi-Borel subgroup (a Borel subgroup of a Levi subgroup in a reductive algebraic group) orbits in the big open cell of a Schubert variety and torus orbits in the big open cell of a distinguished Schubert subvariety. This bijection has many applications: a type-uniform formula for the Levi-Borel complexity of the usual Levi-Borel subgroup action on a Schubert variety as well as an indexing set for Levi-Borel subgroup orbits in a Schubert variety. We conclude by extending the Levi-Borel complexity results to a large class of Schubert varieties in the partial flag variety.</description>

      <title>Sparse Induced Subgraphs of Large Treewidth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by an induced counterpart of treewidth sparsifiers (i.e., sparse subgraphs keeping the treewidth large) provided by the celebrated Grid Minor theorem of Robertson and Seymour [JCTB '86] or by a classic result of Chekuri and Chuzhoy [SODA '15], we show that for any natural numbers $t$ and $w$, and real $\varepsilon &gt; 0$, there is an integer $W := W(t,w,\varepsilon)$ such that every graph with treewidth at least $W$ and no $K_{t,t}$ subgraph admits a 2-connected $n$-vertex induced subgraph with treewidth at least $w$ and at most $(1+\varepsilon)n$ edges. The induced subgraph is either a subdivided wall, or its line graph, or a spanning supergraph of a subdivided biclique. This in particular extends a result of Weissauer [JCTB '19] that graphs of large treewidth have a large biclique subgraph or a long induced cycle.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We say that a graph or a multigraph is locally irregular if adjacent vertices have different degrees. The locally irregular edge coloring is an edge coloring of a (multi)graph $G$ such that every color induces a locally irregular sub(multi)graph of $G$. We denote by ${\rm lir}(G)$ the locally irregular chromatic index of $G$, which is the smallest number of colors required in a locally irregular edge coloring of $G$ if such a coloring exists. We state the following new problem. Let $G$ be a connected graph that is not isomorphic to $K_2$ or $K_3$. What is the minimum number of edges of $G$ whose doubling yields a multigraph which is locally irregular edge colorable using at most two colors with no multiedges colored with two colors? This problem is closely related to the Local Irregularity Conjecture for graphs, (2, 2)-Conjecture, Local Irregularity Conjecture for 2-multigraphs and other similar concepts concerning edge colorings. We solve this problem for graph classes like paths, cycles, trees, complete graphs, complete $k$-partite graphs, split graphs and powers of cycles. Our solution of this problem for complete $k$-partite graphs ($k&gt;1$) and powers of cycles which are not complete graphs shows that the locally irregular chromatic index is equal to two for these graph classes. We also consider this problem for some special families of cacti and prove that the minimum number of edges in a graph whose doubling yields a multigraph which has such coloring does not have a constant upper bound not only for locally irregular uncolorable cacti.</description>

      <title>The Chromatic Number of Very Dense Random Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The chromatic number of a very dense random graph $G(n,p)$, with $p \ge 1 - n^{-c}$ for some constant $c &gt; 0$, was first studied by Surya and Warnke, who conjectured that the typical deviation of $\chi(G(n,p))$ from its mean is of order $\sqrt{\mu_r}$, % fluctuates by about $\Theta(\sqrt{\mu_r})$, where $\mu_r$ is the expected number of independent sets of size $r$, and $r$ is maximal such that $\mu_r &gt; 1$, except when $\mu_r = O(\log n)$. They moreover proved their conjecture in the case $n^{-2} \ll 1 - p = O(n^{-1})$.
  In this paper, we study $\chi(G(n,p))$ in the range $n^{-1}\log n \ll 1 - p \ll n^{-2/3}$, that is, when the largest independent set of $G(n,p)$ is typically of size 3. We prove in this case that $\chi(G(n,p))$ is concentrated on some interval of length $O(\sqrt{\mu_3})$, %$O\big(n^{3/2}(1-p)^{3/2}\big)=O(\sqrt{\mu_3})$ with high probability. Moreover for a big family of $p(n)$, there is and for sufficiently `smooth' functions $p = p(n)$, that there are infinitely many values of $n$ such that $\chi(G(n,p))$ is not concentrated on any interval of size $o(\sqrt{\mu_3})$. We also show that $\chi(G(n,p))$ satisfies a central limit theorem in the range $n^{-1} \log n \ll 1 - p \ll n^{-7/9}$.</description>

      <title>On (shape-)Wilf-equivalence of certain sets of (partially ordered) patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a conjecture of Gao and Kitaev on Wilf-equivalence of sets of patterns {12345,12354} and {45123,45213} that extends the list of 10 related conjectures proved in the literature in a series of papers. To achieve our goals, we prove generalized versions of shape-Wilf-equivalence results of Backelin, West, and Xin and use a particular result on shape-Wilf-equivalence of monotone patterns. We also derive general results on shape-Wilf-equivalence of certain classes of partially ordered patterns and use their specialization (also appearing in a paper by Bloom and Elizalde) as an essential piece in proving the conjecture. Our results allow us to show (shape-)Wilf-equivalence of large classes of sets of patterns, including 11 out of 12 classes found by Bean et al. in relation to the conjecture.</description>

      <title>Oriented or signed Cayley graphs with all eigenvalues integer multiples of $\sqrt{\Delta}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite abelian group. Bridges and Mena characterized the Cayley graphs of $G$ that have only integer eigenvalues. Here we consider the $(0,1,-1)$ adjacency matrix of an oriented Cayley graph or of a signed Cayley graph $X$ on $G$. We give a characterization of when all the eigenvalues of $X$ are integer multiples of $\sqrt{\Delta}$ for some square-free integer $\Delta$. These are exactly the oriented or signed Cayley graphs on which the continuous quantum walks are periodic, a necessary condition for walks on such graphs to admit perfect state transfer. This also has applications in the study of uniform mixing on oriented Cayley graphs, as the occurrence of local uniform mixing at vertex $a$ in an oriented graph $X$ implies periodicity of the walk at $a$. We give examples of oriented Cayley graphs which admit uniform mixing or multiple state transfer.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the maximum cardinality and the mathematical structure of error-correcting codes endowed with the Kendall-$\tau$ metric. We establish an averaging bound for the cardinality of a code with prescribed minimum distance, discuss its sharpness, and characterize codes attaining it. This leads to introducing the family of $t$-balanced codes in the Kendall-$\tau$ metric. The results are based on novel arguments that shed new light on the structure of the Kendall-$\tau$ metric space.</description>

      <title>A Language-Theoretic Approach to the Heapability of Signed Permutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a signed version of the Hammersley process, a discrete process on words related to a property of integer sequences called heapability (Byers et al., ANALCO 2011). The specific version that we investigate corresponds to a version of this property for signed sequences.
  We give a characterization of the words that can appear as images the signed Hammersley process. In particular we show that the language of such words is the intersection of two deterministic one-counter languages.</description>

      <title>Dominating $K_t$-Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A $\textit{dominating $K_t$-model}$ in a graph $G$ is a sequence $(T_1,\dots,T_t)$ of pairwise disjoint non-empty connected subgraphs of $G$, such that for $1 \leqslant i&lt;j \leqslant t$ every vertex in $T_j$ has a neighbour in $T_i$. Replacing "every vertex in $T_j$" by "some vertex in $T_j$" retrieves the standard definition of $K_t$-model, which is equivalent to $K_t$ being a minor of $G$. We explore in what sense dominating $K_t$-models behave like (non-dominating) $K_t$-models. The two notions are equivalent for $t \leqslant 3$, but are already very different for $t = 4$, since the 1-subdivision of any graph has no dominating $K_4$-model. Nevertheless, we show that every graph with no dominating $K_4$-model is 2-degenerate and 3-colourable. More generally, we prove that every graph with no dominating $K_t$-model is $2^{t-2}$-colourable.
  Motivated by the connection to chromatic number, we study the maximum average degree of graphs with no dominating $K_t$-model. We give an upper bound of $2^{t-2}$, and show that random graphs provide a lower bound of $(1-o(1))t\log t$, which we conjecture is asymptotically tight. This result is in contrast to the $K_t$-minor-free setting, where the maximum average degree is $\Theta(t\sqrt{\log t})$. The natural strengthening of Hadwiger's Conjecture arises: is every graph with no dominating $K_t$-model $(t-1)$-colourable? We provide two pieces of evidence for this: (1) It is true for almost every graph, (2) Every graph $G$ with no dominating $K_t$-model has a $(t-1)$-colourable induced subgraph on at least half the vertices, which implies there is an independent set of size at least $\frac{\lvert V(G) \rvert}{2t-2}$.</description>

      <title>Increasingly Many Bounded Eigenvalues of the Graph of Whitehead Moves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix of the "graph of graphs", in which cubic graphs of order n are joined together using Whitehead moves. Our work follows recent results from arXiv:2303.13923 , which discovered a significant "bottleneck" in the graph of graphs. We found that their bottleneck implies an eigenvalue of order at most O(1). In fact, our main contribution is to expand upon this result by showing that the graph of graphs has increasingly many bounded eigenvalues as n increases to infinity. We also show that these eigenvalues are unusually small, in the sense that they are much smaller than the eigenvalues of a random regular graph with an equal number of vertices and a similar degree.</description>

      <title>Defective Parking Functions and Young Tableaux</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recall that a defective $(m,n)$-parking function with defect $d$ is a parking function with $m$ cars attempting to park on a street with $n$ parking spots in which exactly $d$ cars fail to park. We establish a way to compute the defect of a defective $(m,n)$-parking function and show that the defect of a parking function is invariant under the action of $\mathfrak{S}_m$ the symmetric group on $[m]=\{1,2,\ldots,m\}$. We also show that the set of nondecreasing defective $(m,n)$-parking functions with defect $d$ are in bijection with the set of standard Young tableaux of shape $(n + d, m - d)$. This implies that the number of $\mathfrak{S}_m$-orbits of defective $(m,n)$-parking functions with defect $d$ is given by $\frac{n-m+2d+1}{n+d+1}\binom{m+n}{n+d}$. We also give a multinomial formula for the size of an $\mathfrak{S}_m$-orbit of a nondecreasing $(m,n)$-parking function with defect $d$. We conclude by using these results to give a new formula for the number of defective parking functions.</description>

      <title>Connectoids I: a universal end space theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this series we introduce and investigate the concept of connectoids, which captures the connectivity structure of various discrete objects like undirected graphs, directed graphs, bidirected graphs, hypergraphs or finitary matroids.
  In this paper we develop a universal end space theory based on connectoids: the end spaces of connectoids unify the existing end spaces of undirected and directed graphs and establish end spaces for bidirected graphs, hypergraphs and finitary matroids.
  The main result shows that the tangle-like description of ends in undirected graphs, called directions, extends to connectoids: there is a one-to-one correspondence between the directions of a connectoid and its ends. Furthermore, we generalise normal trees of undirected graphs to connectoids and show that normal trees represent the ends of a connectoid as they do for undirected graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A rainbow stacking of $r$-edge-colorings $\chi_1, \ldots, \chi_m$ of the complete graph on $n$ vertices is a way of superimposing $\chi_1, \ldots, \chi_m$ so that no edges of the same color are superimposed on each other. We determine a sharp threshold for $r$ (as a function of $m$ and $n$) governing the existence and nonexistence of rainbow stackings of random $r$-edge-colorings $\chi_1,\ldots,\chi_m$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider limit probabilities of first order properties in random graphs with a given degree sequence. Under mild conditions on the degree sequence, we show that the closure set of limit probabilities is a finite union of closed intervals. Moreover, we characterize the degree sequences for which this closure set is the interval $[0,1]$, a property that is intimately related with the probability that the random graph is acyclic. As a side result, we compile a full description of the cycle distribution of random graphs and study their fragment (disjoint union of unicyclic components) in the subcritical regime. Finally, we amend the proof of the existence of limit probabilities for first order properties in random graphs with a given degree sequence; this result was already claimed by Lynch~[IEEE LICS 2003] but his proof contained some inaccuracies.</description>

      <title>Permutation invariant matrix quantum thermodynamics and negative specific heat capacities in large N systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the thermodynamic properties of the simplest gauged permutation invariant matrix quantum mechanical system of oscillators, for general matrix size $N$. In the canonical ensemble, the model has a transition at a temperature $T$ given by $x = e^{ -1/ T } \sim x_c=e^{-1/T_c}=\frac{\log N}{N}$, characterised by a sharp peak in the specific heat capacity (SHC), which separates a high temperature from a low temperature region. The peak grows and the low-temperature region shrinks to zero with increasing $N$. In the micro-canonical ensemble, for finite $N$, there is a low energy phase with negative SHC and a high energy phase with positive SHC. The low-energy phase is dominated by a super-exponential growth of degeneracies as a function of energy which is directly related to the rapid growth in the number of directed graphs, with any number of vertices, as a function of the number of edges. The two ensembles have matching behaviour above the transition temperature. We further provide evidence that these thermodynamic properties hold in systems with $U(N)$ symmetry such as the zero charge sector of the 2-matrix model and in certain tensor models. We discuss the implications of these observations for the negative specific heat capacities in gravity using the AdS/CFT correspondence.</description>

      <title>The Square-Root Law Does Not Hold in the Presence of Zero Divisors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $R$ be a finite ring and define the paraboloid $P = \{(x_1, \dots, x_d)\in R^d|x_d = x_1^2 + \dots + x_{d-1}^2\}.$ Suppose that for a sequence of finite rings of size tending to infinity, the Fourier transform of $P$ satisfies a square-root law for some fixed constant $C$. Then all but finitely many of the rings are fields. Most of our argument works in greater generality: let $f$ be a polynomial with integer coefficients in $d-1$ variables, with a fixed order of variable multiplications (so that it defines a function $R^{d-1}\rightarrow R$ even when $R$ is noncommutative), and set $V_f = \{(x_1, \dots, x_d)\in R^d|x_d = f(x_1, \dots, x_{d-1})\}$. If (for a sequence of finite rings of size tending to infinity) we have a square root law for the Fourier transform of $V_f$, then all but finitely many of the rings are fields or matrix rings of small dimension. We also describe how our techniques let us see that certain varieties do not satisfy a square root law even over finite fields.</description>

      <title>The Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi Random Graph Conditioned on Every Component Being a Clique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider an Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph, conditioned on the rare event that all connected components are fully connected. Such graphs can be considered as partitions of vertices into cliques. Hence, this conditional distribution defines a distribution over partitions. Using tools from analytic combinatorics, we prove limit theorems for several graph observables: the number of cliques; the number of edges; and the degree distribution. We consider several regimes of the connection probability $p$ as the number of vertices $n$ diverges. For $p=\frac{1}{2}$, the conditioning yields the uniform distribution over set partitions, which is well-studied, but has not been studied as a graph distribution before. For $p &lt; \frac{1}{2}$, we show that the number of cliques is of the order $n/\sqrt{\log n}$, while for $p &gt; \frac{1}{2}$, we prove that the graph consists of a single clique with high probability. This shows that there is a phase transition at $p=\frac{1}{2}$. We additionally study the near-critical regime $p_n\downarrow\frac{1}{2}$, as well as the sparse regime $p_n\downarrow0$.</description>

      <title>On the number of generators of groups acting arc-transitively on graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a finite connected graph ${\Gamma}$ and a group $G$ acting transitively on the vertices of ${\Gamma}$, we prove that the number of vertices of ${\Gamma}$ and the cardinality of $G$ are bounded above by a function depending only on the cardinality of ${\Gamma}$ and on the exponent of $G$. We also prove that the number of generators of a group $G$ acting transitively on the arcs of a finite graph ${\Gamma}$ cannot be bounded by a function of the valency alone.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate multiplicative groups consisting entirely of singular alternating sign matrices (ASMs), and present several constructions of such groups. It is shown that every finite group is isomorphic to a group of singular ASMs, with a singular idempotent ASM as its identity element. The relationship between the size, the rank, and the possible multiplicative orders of singular ASMs is explored.</description>

      <title>An optimal algorithm for geodesic mutual visibility on hexagonal grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13615v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a set of robots (or agents) moving in a graph, two properties are highly desirable: confidentiality (i.e., a message between two agents must not pass through any intermediate agent) and efficiency (i.e., messages are delivered through shortest paths). These properties can be obtained if the \textsc{Geodesic Mutual Visibility} (GMV, for short) problem is solved: oblivious robots move along the edges of the graph, without collisions, to occupy some vertices that guarantee they become pairwise geodesic mutually visible. This means there is a shortest path (i.e., a ``geodesic'') between each pair of robots along which no other robots reside. In this work, we optimally solve GMV on finite hexagonal grids $G_k$. This, in turn, requires first solving a graph combinatorial problem, i.e. determining the maximum number of mutually visible vertices in $G_k$.</description>

      <title>Geometry of rational quasi-independence models as toric fiber products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the geometry of a family of log-linear statistical models called quasi-independence models. The toric fiber product is useful for understanding the geometry of parameter inference in these models because the maximum likelihood degree is multiplicative under the TFP. We define the coordinate toric fiber product, or cTFP, and give necessary and sufficient conditions under which a quasi-independence model is a cTFP of lower-order models. We show that the vanishing ideal of every 2-way quasi-independence model with ML-degree 1 can be realized as an iterated toric fiber product of linear ideals. We also classify which Lawrence lifts of 2-way quasi-independence models are cTFPs and give a necessary condition under which a $k$-way model has ML-degree 1 using its facial submodels.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An expression is any mathematical formula that contains certain formal variables and operations to be executed in a specified order. In computer science, it is usually convenient to represent each expression in the form of an expression tree. Here, we consider only arithmetic expressions, i.e., those that contain only the four standard arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division, alongside additive inversion. We first provide certain theoretical results concerning the equivalence of such expressions and then disclose a $\Theta(n^2)$ algorithm that computes the number of inequivalent arithmetic expressions on $n$ distinct variables.</description>

      <title>The Boolean polynomial polytope with multiple choice constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a polytope to study multiple choice polynomial programming (MCPP). It is the convex hull of $0$-$1$ vectors satisfying multiple choice constraints and production constraints both of which are associated with a hypergraph. With the help of the decomposability property, we obtain an explicit half-space representation of the MCPP polytope when the underlying hypergraph is $\alpha$-acyclic by induction on the number of hyperedges. We also present a necessary and sufficient condition for the inequalities lifted from the facet-inducing ones for the multilinear polytope to be still facet-inducing for the MCPP polytope.</description>

Abstract: We determine all factorisations $X=AB$, where $X$ is a finite almost simple group and $A,B$ are core-free subgroups such that $A\cap B$ is cyclic or dihedral. As a main application, we classify the graphs $\Gamma$ admitting an almost simple arc-transitive group $X$ of automorphisms, such that $\Gamma$ has a 2-cell embedding as a map on a closed surface admitting a core-free arc-transitive subgroup $G$ of $X$. We prove that apart from the case where $X$ and $G$ have socles $A_n$ and $A_{n-1}$ respectively, the only such graphs are the complete graphs $K_n$ with $n$ a prime power, the Johnson graphs $J(n,2)$ with $n-1$ a prime power, and 14 further graphs. In the exceptional case, we construct infinitely many graph embeddings.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Multivariate Graph Dependencies: Theory and Estimation for Multiplex Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multiplex graphs, characterised by their layered structure, exhibit informative interdependencies within layers that are crucial for understanding complex network dynamics. Quantifying the interaction and shared information among these layers is challenging due to the non-Euclidean structure of graphs. Our paper introduces a comprehensive theory of multivariate information measures for multiplex graphs. We introduce graphon mutual information for pairs of graphs and expand this to graphon interaction information for three or more graphs, including their conditional variants. We then define graphon total correlation and graphon dual total correlation, along with their conditional forms, and introduce graphon $O-$information. We discuss and quantify the concepts of synergy and redundancy in graphs for the first time, introduce consistent nonparametric estimators for these multivariate graphon information--theoretic measures, and provide their convergence rates. We also conduct a simulation study to illustrate our theoretical findings and demonstrate the relationship between the introduced measures, multiplex graph structure, and higher--order interdependecies. Real-world applications further show the utility of our estimators in revealing shared information and dependence structures in real-world multiplex graphs. This work not only answers fundamental questions about information sharing across multiple graphs but also sets the stage for advanced pattern analysis in complex networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we give unified formulas for the numbers of representations of positive integers as sums of four generalized $m$-gonal numbers, and as restricted sums of four squares under a linear condition, respectively. These formulas are given as $\mathbb{Z}$-linear combinations of Hurwitz class numbers. As applications, we prove several Zhi-Wei Sun's conjectures. As by-products, we obtain formulas for expressing the Fourier coefficients of $\vartheta(\tau,z)^4$, $\eta(\tau)^{12}$, $\eta(\tau)^4$ and $\eta(\tau)^8\eta(2\tau)^8$ in terms of the Hurwitz class numbers, respectively. The proof is based on the theory of Jacobi forms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1803.05308v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Croot, Lev and Pach used a new polynomial technique to give a new exponential upper bound for the size of three-term progression-free subsets in the groups $(\mathbb Z _4)^n$.
  The main tool in proving their striking result is a simple lemma about polynomials, which gives interesting new bounds for the size of subsets of the vector space $({\mathbb Z _p})^n$.
  Our main result is a generalization of this lemma. In the proof we combined Tao's slice rank bounding method with Gr\"obner basis technique.
  As an application, we improve Green's results and present new upper bounds for the size of difference sets in polynomial rings. We give a new, more concrete upper bound for the size of arithmetic progression-free subsets in $({\mathbb Z _p})^n$.</description>

Abstract: We introduce $k$-signaletic operads and their Koszul duals, generalizing the dendriform, diassociative and duplicial operads (which correspond to the $k=1$ case). We show that the Koszul duals of the $k$-signaletic operads act on multipermutations and that the resulting algebras are free, thus providing combinatorial models for these operads. Finally, motivated by these actions on multipermutations, we introduce similar operations on multiposets which yield yet another relevant operad obtained as Manin powers of the $L$-operad.</description>

Abstract: We prove a Marstrand type slicing theorem for the subsets of the integer square lattice. This problem is the dual of the corresponding projection theorem, which was considered by Glasscock, and Lima and Moreira, with the mass and counting dimensions applied to subsets of $\mathbb{Z}^{d}$. In this paper, more generally we deal with a subset of the plane that is $1$ separated, and the result for subsets of the integer lattice follow as a special case. We show that the natural slicing question in this setting is true with the mass dimension.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2102.01320v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Binary functions are a generalisation of the cocircuit spaces of binary matroids to arbitrary functions. Every rank function is assigned a binary function, and the deletion and contraction operations of binary functions generalise matroid deletion and contraction. We give the excluded minor characterisations for the classes of binary functions with well defined minors, and those with an associated rank function. Within these classes, we also characterise the classes of binary functions corresponding to polymatroids, matroids and binary matroids by their excluded minors. This gives a new proof of Tutte's excluded minor characterisation of binary matroids in the more generalised space of binary functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2205.05100v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a graph $M,$ path eigenvalues are eigenvalues of its path matrix. The path energy of a simple graph $M$ is equal to the sum of the absolute values of the path eigenvalues of the graph $M$ (Shikare et. al, 2018). We have discovered new upper constraints on path energy in this study, expressed in terms of a graph's maximum degree. Additionally, a relationship between a graph's energy and path energy is given.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2206.14273v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A word~$w$ has a border $u$ if $u$ is a non-empty proper prefix and suffix of $u$. A word~$w$ is said to be \emph{closed} if $w$ is of length at most $1$ or if $w$ has a border that occurs exactly twice in $w$. A word~$w$ is said to be \emph{privileged} if $w$ is of length at most $1$ or if $w$ has a privileged border that occurs exactly twice in $w$. Let $C_k(n)$ (resp.~$P_k(n)$) be the number of length-$n$ closed (resp. privileged) words over a $k$-letter alphabet. In this paper, we improve existing upper and lower bounds on $C_k(n)$ and $P_k(n)$. We completely resolve the asymptotic behaviour of $C_k(n)$. We also nearly completely resolve the asymptotic behaviour of $P_k(n)$ by giving a family of upper and lower bounds that are separated by a factor that grows arbitrarily slowly.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.14091v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An infinite sequence of sets $\left\{B_{n}\right\}_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ is said to be a heterochromatic sequence from an infinite sequence of families $\left\{ \mathcal{F}_{n} \right\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$, if there exists a strictly increasing sequence of natural numbers $\left\{ i_{n}\right\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ such that for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$ we have $B_{n} \in \mathcal{F}_{i_{n}}$. In this paper, we have proved that if for each $n\in\mathbb{N}$, $\mathcal{F}_n$ is a family of {\em nicely shaped} convex sets in $\mathbb{R}^d$ such that each heterochromatic sequence $\left\{B_{n}\right\}_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ from $\left\{ \mathcal{F}_{n} \right\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ contains at least $k+2$ sets that can be pierced by a single $k$-flat ($k$-dimensional affine space) then all but finitely many families in $\left\{\mathcal{F}_{n}\right\}_{n\in \mathbb{N}}$ can be pierced by finitely many $k$-flats. This result can be considered as a {\em countably colorful} generalization of the $(\aleph_0, k+2)$-theorem proved by Keller and Perles (Symposium on Computational Geometry 2022). We have also established the tightness of our result by proving a number of no-go theorems.</description>

Abstract: Schubert polynomials form a basis of the polynomial ring. This basis and its structure constants have received extensive study. Recently, Pan and Yu initiated the study of top Lascoux polynomials. These polynomials form a basis of a subalgebra of the polynomial ring where each graded piece has finite dimension. This paper connects Schubert polynomials and top Lascoux polynomials via a simple operator. We use this connection to show these two bases share the same structure constants. We also translate several results on Schubert polynomials to top Lascoux polynomials, including combinatorial formulas for their monomial expansions and supports.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.02483v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give two extensions of the recent theorem of the first author that the odd distance graph has unbounded chromatic number. The first is that for any non-constant polynomial $f$ with integer coefficients and positive leading coefficient, every finite colouring of the plane contains a monochromatic pair of distinct points whose distance is equal to $f(n)$ for some integer $n$. The second is that for every finite colouring of the plane, there is a monochromatic pair of points whose distance is a prime number.</description>

Abstract: Let $ k, n \in \mathbb{N}^+ $ and $ m \in \mathbb{N}^+ \cup \{\infty \} $. A $ k $-multiset in $ [n]_m $ is a $ k $-set whose elements are integers from $ \{1, 2, \ldots, n\} $, and each element is allowed to have at most $ m $ repetitions. A family of $ k $-multisets in $ [n]_m $ is said to be intersecting if every pair of $ k $-multisets from the family have non-empty intersection. In this paper, we give the size and structure of the largest non-trivial intersecting family of $ k $-multisets in $ [n]_m $.</description>

      <title>On the Order of P-Strict Promotion on $V\times [\ell]$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.08757v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Denote by $V$ the poset consisting of the elements $\{A,B,C\}$ with cover relations $\{A\lessdot B, A\lessdot C\}$. We show that $P$-strict promotion, as defined by Bernstein, Striker, and Vorland, on $P$-strict labelings of $V\times [\ell]$ with labels in the set $[q]$ has order $2q$ for every $\ell\ge 1$ and $q\ge 3$ as conjectured by Bernstein, Striker, and Vorland. This resolves the equivalent conjecture of Hopkins that the order of piecewise-linear rowmotion on the order polytope of $V\times [k]$ has order $2(k+2)$ for all $k\ge 1$.</description>

      <title>Assouad-Nagata dimension of minor-closed metrics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.12273v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Assouad-Nagata dimension addresses both large and small scale behaviors of metric spaces and is a refinement of Gromov's asymptotic dimension. A metric space $M$ is a minor-closed metric if there exists an (edge-)weighted graph $G$ satisfying a fixed minor-closed property such that the underlying space of $M$ is the vertex-set of $G$, and the metric of $M$ is the distance function in $G$. Minor-closed metrics naturally arise when removing redundant edges of the underlying graphs by using edge-deletion and edge-contraction. In this paper, we determine the Assouad-Nagata dimension of every minor-closed metric. Our main theorem simultaneously generalizes known results about the asymptotic dimension of $H$-minor free unweighted graphs and about the Assouad-Nagata dimension of complete Riemannian surfaces with finite Euler genus.</description>

      <title>The double Hall property and cycle covers in bipartite graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.02909v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a graph $G$, the $2$-neighborhood of a vertex set $X$ consists of all vertices of $G$ having at least $2$ neighbors in $X$. We say that a bipartite graph $G(A,B)$ satisfies the double Hall property if $|A|\geq2$, and every subset $X \subseteq A$ of size at least $2$ has a $2$-neighborhood of size at least $|X|$. Salia conjectured that any bipartite graph $G(A,B)$ satisfying the double Hall property contains a cycle covering $A$. Here, we prove the existence of a $2$-factor covering $A$ in any bipartite graph $G(A,B)$ satisfying the double Hall property. We also show Salia's conjecture for graphs with restricted degrees of vertices in $B$. Additionally, we prove a lower bound on the number of edges in a graph satisfying the double Hall property, and the bound is sharp up to a constant factor.</description>

      <title>Subdivisions in dicritical digraphs with large order or digirth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05938v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Aboulker et al. proved that a digraph with large enough dichromatic number contains any fixed digraph as a subdivision. The dichromatic number of a digraph is the smallest order of a partition of its vertex set into acyclic induced subdigraphs. A digraph is dicritical if the removal of any arc or vertex decreases its dichromatic number. In this paper we give sufficient conditions on a dicritical digraph of large order or large directed girth to contain a given digraph as a subdivision. In particular, we prove that (i) for every integers $k,\ell$, large enough dicritical digraphs with dichromatic number $k$ contain an orientation of a cycle with at least $\ell$ vertices; (ii) there are functions $f,g$ such that for every subdivision $F^*$ of a digraph $F$, digraphs with directed girth at least $f(F^*)$ and dichromatic number at least $g(F)$ contain a subdivision of $F^*$, and if $F$ is a tree, then $g(F)=|V(F)|$; (iii) there is a function $f$ such that for every subdivision $F^*$ of $TT_3$ (the transitive tournament on three vertices), digraphs with directed girth at least $f(F^*)$ and minimum out-degree at least $2$ contain $F^*$ as a subdivision.</description>

      <title>Largest bipartite sub-matchings of a random ordered matching or a problem with socks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02223v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $M$ be an ordered matching of size $n$, that is, a partition of the set $[2n]$ into 2-element subsets. The sock number of $M$ is the maximum size of a sub-matching of $M$ in which all left-ends of the edges precede all the right-ends (such matchings are also called bipartite). The name of this parameter comes from an amusing "real-life" problem posed by Bosek, concerning an on-line pairing of randomly picked socks from a drying machine. Answering one of Bosek's questions we prove that the sock number of a random matching of size $n$ is asymptotically equal to $n/2$. Moreover, we prove that the expected average number of socks waiting for their match during the whole process is equal to $\frac{2n+1}{6}$. Analogous results are obtained if socks come not in pairs, but in sets of size $r\geq 2$, which corresponds to a similar problem for random ordered $r$-matchings. We also attempt to enumerate matchings with a given sock number.</description>

Abstract: We study the graph parameter elimination distance to bounded degree, which was introduced by Bulian and Dawar in their study of the parameterized complexity of the graph isomorphism problem. We prove that the problem is fixed-parameter tractable on planar graphs, that is, there exists an algorithm that given a planar graph $G$ and integers $d$ and $k$ decides in time $f(k,d)\cdot n^c$ for a computable function~$f$ and constant $c$ whether the elimination distance of $G$ to the class of degree $d$ graphs is at most $k$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2202.13844v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A graph G is a multi-interval PCG if there exist an edge weighted tree T with non-negative real values and disjoint intervals of the non-negative real half-line such that each node of G is uniquely associated to a leaf of T and there is an edge between two nodes in G if and only if the weighted distance between their corresponding leaves in T lies within any such intervals. If the number of intervals is k, then we call the graph a k-interval-PCG; in symbols, G = k-interval-PCG (T, I1, . . . , Ik). It is known that 2-interval-PCGs do not contain all graphs and the smallest known graph outside this class has 135 nodes. Here we prove that all graphs with at most 8 nodes are 2-interval-PCGs, so doing one step towards the determination of the smallest value of n such that there exists an n node graph that is not a 2-interval-PCG.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.14086v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a generalization of the classical notion of a Schur functor associated to a ribbon diagram. These functors are defined with respect to an arbitrary algebra, and in the case that the underlying algebra is the symmetric/exterior algebra, we recover the classical definition of Schur/Weyl functors, respectively. In general, we construct a family of 3-term complexes categorifying the classical concatenation/near-concatenation identity for symmetric functions, and one of our main results is that the exactness of these 3-term complexes is equivalent to the Koszul property of the underlying algebra $A$. We further generalize these ribbon Schur functors to the notion of a multi-Schur functor and construct a canonical filtration of these objects whose associated graded pieces are described explicitly; one consequence of this filtration is a complete equivariant description of the syzygies of arbitrary Segre products of Koszul modules over the Segre product of Koszul algebras. Further applications to the equivariant structure of derived invariants, symmetric function identities, and Koszulness of certain classes of modules are explored at the end, along with a characteristic-free computation of the regularity of a Schur functor applied to the tautological subbundle on projective space.</description>

Abstract: We explore the applications of Lorentzian polynomials to the fields of algebraic geometry, analytic geometry and convex geometry. In particular, we establish a series of intersection theoretic inequalities, which we call rKT property, with respect to $m$-positive classes and Schur classes. We also study its convexity variants -- the geometric inequalities for $m$-convex functions on the sphere and convex bodies. Along the exploration, we prove that any finite subset on the closure of the cone generated by $m$-positive classes can be endowed with a polymatroid structure by a canonical numerical-dimension type function, extending our previous result for nef classes; and we prove Alexandrov-Fenchel inequalities for valuations of Schur type. We also establish various analogs of sumset estimates (Pl\"{u}nnecke-Ruzsa inequalities) from additive combinatorics in our contexts.</description>

Abstract: We formulate a categorification of Robertson's conjecture analogous to the categorical graph minor conjecture of Miyata--Proudfood--Ramos. We show that these conjectures imply the existence of a finite list of atomic graphs generating the homology of configuration spaces of graphs -- in fixed degree, with a fixed number of particles, under topological embeddings. We explain how the simplest case of our conjecture follows from work of Barter and Miyata--Proudfoot, implying that the category of cographs is Noetherian, a result of potential independent interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.13572v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of maximum likelihood (ML) estimation for statistical models defined by reflexive polytopes. Our focus is on the maximum likelihood degree of these models as an algebraic measure of complexity of the corresponding optimization problem. We compute the ML degrees of all 4319 classes of three-dimensional reflexive polytopes, and observe some surprising behavior in terms of the presence of gaps between ML degrees and degrees of the associated toric varieties. We interpret these drops in the context of discriminants and prove formulas for the ML degree for families of reflexive polytopes, including the hypercube and its dual, the cross polytope, in arbitrary dimension. In particular, we determine a family of embeddings for the $d$-cube that implies ML degree one. Finally, we discuss generalized constructions of families of reflexive polytopes in terms of their ML degrees.</description>

      <title>Minimal doubling for small subsets in compact Lie groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14062v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a sharp bound for the minimal doubling of a small measurable subset of a compact connected Lie group. Namely, let $G$ be a compact connected Lie group of dimension $d_G$, we show that for for all measurable subsets $A$, we have $$\mu_G(A^2) \geq \left(2^{d_G-d_H} - C\mu_G(A)^{\frac{2}{d_G-d_H}}\right)\mu_G(A)$$ where $d_H$ is the maximal dimension of a proper closed subgroup $H$ and $C &gt; 0$ is a dimensional constant. This settles a conjecture of Breuillard and Green, and recovers and improves - with completely different methods - a recent result of Jing--Tran--Zhang corresponding to the case $G=SO_3(\mathbb{R})$. As is often the case, the above doubling inequality stems from a special case of general product-set estimates. We prove that for all $\epsilon &gt;0$ and for any pair of sufficiently small measurable subsets $A,B$ a Brunn--Minkowski-type inequality holds:
  $$ \mu_G(AB)^{\frac{1}{d_G-d_H}} \geq (1-\epsilon)\left( \mu_G(A)^{\frac{1}{d_G-d_H}} + \mu_G(B)^{\frac{1}{d_G-d_H}}\right).$$
  Going beyond the scope of the Breuillard--Green conjecture, we prove a stability result asserting that the only subsets with close to minimal doubling are essentially neighbourhoods of proper subgroups i.e. of the form $$H_{\delta}:=\{g \in G: d(g,H)&lt;\delta\}$$ where $H$ denotes a proper closed subgroup of maximal dimension, $d$ denotes a bi-invariant distance on $G$ and $\delta &gt;0$.
  Our approach relies on a combination of two toolsets: optimal transports and its recent applications to the Brunn--Minkowski inequality, and the structure theory of compact approximate subgroups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13124v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by Owings's problem, we investigate whether, for a given an Abelian group $G$ and cardinal numbers $\kappa,\theta$, every colouring $c:G\longrightarrow\theta$ yields a subset $X\subseteq G$ with $|X|=\kappa$ such that $X+X$ is monochromatic. (Owings's problem asks this for $G=\mathbb Z$, $\theta=2$ and $\kappa=\aleph_0$; while Hindman proved it false for the same $G$ and $\kappa$ but $\theta=3$.) We completely settle the question for $\kappa$ and $\theta$ both finite (by obtaining sufficient and necessary conditions for a positive answer) and for $\kappa$ and $\theta$ both infinite (with a negative answer). Also, in the case where $\theta$ is infinite but $\kappa$ is finite, we obtain some sufficient conditions for a negative answer as well as an example with a positive answer.</description>

Abstract: In this study, we introduce an innovative deep learning framework that employs a transformer model to address the challenges of mixed-integer programs, specifically focusing on the Capacitated Lot Sizing Problem (CLSP). Our approach, to our knowledge, is the first to utilize transformers to predict the binary variables of a mixed-integer programming (MIP) problem. Specifically, our approach harnesses the encoder decoder transformer's ability to process sequential data, making it well-suited for predicting binary variables indicating production setup decisions in each period of the CLSP. This problem is inherently dynamic, and we need to handle sequential decision making under constraints. We present an efficient algorithm in which CLSP solutions are learned through a transformer neural network. The proposed post-processed transformer algorithm surpasses the state-of-the-art solver, CPLEX and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) in solution time, optimal gap, and percent infeasibility over 240K benchmark CLSP instances tested. After the ML model is trained, conducting inference on the model, reduces the MIP into a linear program (LP). This transforms the ML-based algorithm, combined with an LP solver, into a polynomial-time approximation algorithm to solve a well-known NP-Hard problem, with almost perfect solution quality.</description>

      <title>The intersection cohomology Hodge module of toric varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04767v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the Hodge filtration of the intersection cohomology Hodge module for toric varieties. More precisely, we study the cohomology sheaves of the graded de Rham complex of the intersection cohomology Hodge module and give a precise formula relating it with the stalks of the intersection cohomology as a constructible complex. The main idea is to use the Ishida complex in order to compute the higher direct images of the sheaf of reflexive differentials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09372v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We classify closed curves on a once-punctured torus with a single self-intersection from a combinatorial perspective. We determine the number of closed curves with given word-length and with zero, one, and arbitrary self-intersections.</description>

      <title>Real Stability and Log Concavity are coNP-Hard</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00162v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Real-stable, Lorentzian, and log-concave polynomials are well-studied classes of polynomials, and have been powerful tools in resolving several conjectures. We show that the problems of deciding whether a polynomial of fixed degree is real stable or log concave are coNP-hard. On the other hand, while all homogeneous real-stable polynomials are Lorentzian and all Lorentzian polynomials are log concave on the positive orthant, the problem of deciding whether a polynomial of fixed degree is Lorentzian can be solved in polynomial time.</description>

      <title>On the set of points represented by harmonic subseries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07681v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We help Alice play a certain "convergence game" against Bob and win the prize, which is a constructive solution to a problem by Erd\H{o}s and Graham, posed in their 1980 book on open questions in combinatorial number theory. Namely, after several reductions using peculiar arithmetic identities, the game outcome shows that the set of points \[ \Big(\sum_{n\in A}\frac{1}{n}, \sum_{n\in A}\frac{1}{n+1}, \sum_{n\in A}\frac{1}{n+2}\Big), \] obtained as $A$ ranges over infinite sets of positive integers, has a non-empty interior. This generalizes a two-dimensional result by Erd\H{o}s and Straus.</description>
