      <title>On simple groups definable in some valued fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that non-abelian definable, definably simple groups in 1-h-minimal henselian valued fields are essentially already linear algebraic groups. Here, the group is assumed to live in the home sort. We have a similar result in pure algebraically closed valued fields of positive characteristic, under the additional assumption that the definable group is a subgroup of a linear algebraic group.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.08718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show Shelah's original creature forcing from 1984 strongly preserves tight mad families. In particular, answering questions of Fischer and Friedman and Friedman and Zdomskyy, we show the constellation $\aleph_1 = \mathfrak{a} &lt; \mathfrak{s} = \aleph_2$ is consistent with the existence of a $\Delta_3^1$ wellorder of the reals and tight mad families of sizes $\aleph_1, \aleph_2$ which are $\Pi_1^1, \Pi_2^1$-definable, respectively. Each of these projective definitions is of minimal possible complexity.</description>

      <title>Determining the Winner in Alternating-Move Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a criterion for determining the winner in two-player win-lose alternating-move games on trees, in terms of the Hausdorff dimension of the target set. We focus our study on special cases, including the Gale-Stewart game on the complete binary tree and a family of Schmidt games. Building on the Hausdorff dimension games originally introduced by Das, Fishman, Simmons, and Urba{\'n}ski, which provide a game-theoretic approach for computing Hausdorff dimensions, we employ a generalized family of these games, and show that they are useful for analyzing sets underlying the win-lose games we study.</description>

      <title>Degree-preserving Godel logics with an involution: intermediate logics and (ideal) paraconsistency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study intermediate logics between the degree preserving companion of Godel fuzzy logic with an involution and classical propositional logic CPL, as well as the intermediate logics of their finite-valued counterparts. Although these degree-preserving Godel logics are explosive with respect to Godel negation, they are paraconsistent with respect to the involutive negation. We introduce the notion of saturated paraconsistency, a weaker notion than ideal paraconsistency, and we fully characterize the ideal and the saturated paraconsistent logics between the degree-preserving n-valued Godel fuzzy logic with an involution and CPL. We also identify a large family of saturated paraconsistent logics in the family of intermediate logics for degree-preserving finite-valued Lukasiewicz logics.</description>

      <title>Does $\mathcal P(\omega) / \mathrm{fin}$ know its right hand from its left?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04358v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\sigma$ denote the shift automorphism on $\mathcal{P}(\omega) / \mathrm{fin}$, defined by setting $\sigma([A]) = [A+1]$ for all $A \subseteq \omega$. We show that the Continuum Hypothesis implies the shift automorphism $\sigma$ and its inverse $\sigma^{-1}$ are conjugate in the automorphism group of $\mathcal{P}(\omega) / \mathrm{fin}$.
  Due to work of van Douwen and Shelah, it has been known since the 1980's that it is consistent with $\mathsf{ZFC}$ that $\sigma$ and $\sigma^{-1}$ are not conjugate. Our result shows that the question of whether $\sigma$ and $\sigma^{-1}$ are conjugate is independent of $\mathsf{ZFC}$.
  As a corollary to the main theorem, we deduce that the structures $\langle \mathcal{P}(\omega) / \mathrm{fin},\sigma \rangle$ and $\langle \mathcal{P}(\omega) / \mathrm{fin},\sigma^{-1} \rangle$ are elementarily equivalent in the language of algebraic dynamical systems (Boolean algebras together with an automorphism). This corollary does not depend on the Continuum Hypothesis.</description>

      <title>Homomorphism Preservation Theorems for Many-Valued Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00217v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A canonical result in model theory is the homomorphism preservation theorem (h.p.t.) which states that a first-order formula is preserved under homomorphisms iff it is equivalent to an existential-positive formula, standardly proved via a compactness argument. Rossman (2008) established the h.p.t. remains valid when restricted to finite structures. This is a significant result, standing in contrast to the other preservation theorems proved via compactness where the failure of the latter carries forward. Almost all results from traditional model theory that do survive to the finite are those whose proofs work restricted to finite structures. Rossman's result is an example which remains true in the finite but whose proof uses different methods. It is of importance to the field of constraint satisfaction due to the equivalence of existential-positive formulas and unions of conjunctive queries. Adjacently, Dellunde and Vidal (2019) established a version of the h.p.t. holds for a collection of first-order many-valued logics, namely those whose structures (finite and infinite) are defined over a fixed finite MTL-chain.
  In this paper we unite these two strands. We show how one can extend Rossman's proof of a finite h.p.t. to a very wide collection of many-valued predicate logics. We establish a finite variant to Dellunde and Vidal's result, one which applies to structures defined over algebras more general than MTL-chains and where we allow for those algebra to vary between models. We identify the minimal critical features of classical logic that enable Rossman's proof from a model-theoretic point of view, and demonstrate how any non-classical logic satisfying them will inherit an appropriate finite h.p.t. Just as the classical finite h.p.t. has implications for constraint satisfaction, the many-valued finite h.p.t. has implications for valued constraint satisfaction problems.</description>

      <title>Approximability of deep computations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06064v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This is the first of a series of papers in which we study deep computations (ultracomputations) and deep iterates, formalizing the ideas of "asymptotic limit" of computations and compositional iterates, respectively.
  In this first paper of the series, we characterize deep computations that are bona fide computable, and prove the existence of deep equilibria, which hitherto have been found only empirically in deep learning. A subsequent paper will study the complexity of ultracomputations.
  Our approach adapts and combines technology from topology of function spaces, structural Ramsey theory, topological dynamics, and model theory.</description>

      <title>MSO logic of the real order with the set quantifiers ranging over the Borel sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23003v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A celebrated 1969 theorem of Michael Rabin is that the MSO theory of the real order where the monadic quantifier is allowed only to range over the sets of rational numbers, is decidable. In 1975 Saharon Shelah proved that if the monadic quantifier is allowed to range over all subsets of the reals, the resulting MSO theory is undecidable. He conjectured that when we allow the monadic quantifier to range over the Borel subsets of the reals, the resulting MSO theory is decidable. We confirm this conjecture. Namely, the MSO theory of the real order where the set quantifier is allowed to range over the Borel sets, is decidable. If we only ask for the decidability in the language where each level of the Borel hierarchy is allowed a quantifier to denote sets of that level in the hierarchy, then we obtain a weaker MSO theory, which is not inly decidable but also interpretable in S2S.</description>

      <title>Galois theory, automorphism groups of prime models, and the Picard-Vessiot closure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04076v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We work in the context of a complete totally transcendental theory $T = T^{eq}$. We consider the prime model $M_{A}$ over a set $A$. For intermediate sets $B$ with $A\subseteq B \subseteq M_{A}$ which are normal ($Aut(M_{A}/A)$-invariant) and ``minimal" we give a full Galois correspondence between intermediate definably closed sets $A\subseteq B \subseteq M_{A}$ and ``closed" subgroups of $Aut(B/A)$ (the group of $A$-elementary permutations of $B$).
  The unique greatest such minimal normal $B$ coincides with Poizat's ``minimal closure" $A_{min}$, so our paper extends (from $acl(A)$ to $A_{min}$) the well-known Galois correspondence between closed subgroups of the profinite group $Aut(acl(A)/A)$ and intermediate definably closed sets.
  The main result applies to the ``Picard-Vessiot closure" $K^{PV_{\infty}}$ of a differential field $K$ of char $0$ with algebraically closed field $C_{K}$ of constants. We also show that normal differential subfields of $K^{PV_{\infty}}$ containing $K$ are ``iterated $PV$-extensions" of $K$, and the Galois correspondence above holds for these extensions. This fills in some missing parts of Magid's paper [5].
  We also discuss exact sequences $1 \to N \to G \to H \to 1$, where $G = Aut(K_2/K)$, $N = Aut(K_2/K_1)$ and $H = Aut(K_1/K)$, $K_1$ is a (maybe infinite type) $PV$ extension of $K$, $K_2$ is a (maybe infinite type) $PV$ extension of $K_1$ and $K_2$ is normal over $K$ and again $C_K$ is algebraically closed. Both $N$ and $H$ have the structure of proalgebraic groups over $C_K$. We show that conjugation by any given element of $G$ is a proalgebraic automorphism of $N$. Moreover if $G$ splits as a semidirect product $N\rtimes H$, then left multiplication by any fixed element of $G$ is a morphism of proalgebraic varieties $N\times H \to N\times H$. This improves and extends observations in Section 4 of [5] which dealt with one example.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2112.11062v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A novel formalisation of variable control in languages with implicit names based on de Bruijn indices is presented. We design and implement three languages: first, a restricted language with implicit names; then, a restricted calculus with implicit names and explicit substitution, and finally, an extended calculus with implicit names, implicit substitution and resource control. We propose a novel concept of list types, which are used to give a simple and manageable definition of linearity. We develop an implementation in Haskell.</description>

      <title>On masas of the Calkin algebra generated by projections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06580v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Assuming the continuum hypothesis CH, we obtain complete $*$-isomorphic classification of maximal abelian self-adjoint subalgebras (masas) of the Calkin algebra $\mathcal Q(\ell_2)$ (bounded operators on a separable Hilbert space modulo compact operators) generated by projections. In particular, for any compact totally disconnected Hausdorff space $K$ of weight not exceeding the continuum and not admitting $G_\delta$ points we construct under CH a masa of $\mathcal Q(\ell_2)$ which is $*$-isomorphic to the algebra $C(K)$ of complex-valued continuous functions on $K$.
  This, among others, shows that masas of the Calkin algebra could have rather unexpected properties compared to the previously known three $*$-isomorphic types of them generated by projections: $\ell_\infty/c_0$, $L_\infty$ and $\ell_\infty/c_0\oplus L_\infty$.
  It can be shown that some additional set-theoretic hypothesis, like CH, is necessary for such results. However, without making any additional set-theoretic assumptions we still construct a family of maximal possible cardinality (of the power set of $\mathbb R$) of pairwise non-$*$-isomorphic masas of $\mathcal Q(\ell_2)$ generated by projections and with properties unlike the three above examples.</description>
