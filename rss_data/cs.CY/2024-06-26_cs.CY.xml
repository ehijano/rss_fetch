      <title>Unlocking Telemetry Potential: Self-Supervised Learning for Continuous Clinical Electrocardiogram Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) applied to routine patient monitoring within intensive care units (ICUs) has the potential to improve care by providing clinicians with novel insights into each patient's health and expected response to interventions. This paper applies deep learning to a large volume of unlabeled electrocardiogram (ECG) telemetry signals, which are commonly used for continuous patient monitoring in hospitals but have important differences from the standard, single time-point 12-lead ECG used in many prior machine learning studies. We applied self-supervised learning to pretrain a spectrum of deep networks on approximately 147,000 hours of ECG telemetry data. Our approach leverages this dataset to train models that significantly improve performance on four distinct downstream tasks compared with direct supervised learning using labeled data. These pretrained models enable medically useful predictions and estimates in smaller patient cohorts that are typically limited by the scarcity of labels. Notably, we demonstrate that our pretrained networks can continuously annotate ECG telemetry signals, thereby providing monitoring capabilities that are often unavailable due to the requirement for specialized expertise and time-consuming professional annotations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has become a crucial instrument for streamlining processes in various industries, including electrical power systems, as a result of recent digitalization. Algorithms for artificial intelligence are data-driven models that are based on statistical learning theory and are used as a tool to take use of the data that the power system and its users generate. Initially, we perform a thorough literature analysis of artificial intelligence (AI) applications related to renewable energy (RE). Next, we present a thorough analysis of renewable energy factories and assess their suitability, along with a list of the most widely used and appropriate AI algorithms. Nine AI-based strategies are identified here to assist Renewable Energy (RE) in contemporary power systems. This survey paper comprises an extensive review of the several AI techniques used for renewable energy as well as a methodical analysis of the literature for the study of various intelligent system application domains across different disciplines of renewable energy. This literature review identifies the performance and outcomes of nine different research methods by assessing them, and it aims to distill valuable insights into their strengths and limitations. This study also addressed three main topics: using AI technology for renewable power generation, utilizing AI for renewable energy forecasting, and optimizing energy systems. Additionally, it explored AI's superiority over conventional models in controllability, data handling, cyberattack prevention, smart grid implementation, robotics- AI's significance in shaping the future of the energy industry. Furthermore, this article outlines future directions in the integration of AI for renewable energy.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models Assume People are More Rational than We Really are</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In order for AI systems to communicate effectively with people, they must understand how we make decisions. However, people's decisions are not always rational, so the implicit internal models of human decision-making in Large Language Models (LLMs) must account for this. Previous empirical evidence seems to suggest that these implicit models are accurate -- LLMs offer believable proxies of human behavior, acting how we expect humans would in everyday interactions. However, by comparing LLM behavior and predictions to a large dataset of human decisions, we find that this is actually not the case: when both simulating and predicting people's choices, a suite of cutting-edge LLMs (GPT-4o &amp; 4-Turbo, Llama-3-8B &amp; 70B, Claude 3 Opus) assume that people are more rational than we really are. Specifically, these models deviate from human behavior and align more closely with a classic model of rational choice -- expected value theory. Interestingly, people also tend to assume that other people are rational when interpreting their behavior. As a consequence, when we compare the inferences that LLMs and people draw from the decisions of others using another psychological dataset, we find that these inferences are highly correlated. Thus, the implicit decision-making models of LLMs appear to be aligned with the human expectation that other people will act rationally, rather than with how people actually act.</description>

      <title>Achieving Fairness Across Local and Global Models in Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Achieving fairness across diverse clients in Federated Learning (FL) remains a significant challenge due to the heterogeneity of the data and the inaccessibility of sensitive attributes from clients' private datasets. This study addresses this issue by introducing \texttt{EquiFL}, a novel approach designed to enhance both local and global fairness in federated learning environments. \texttt{EquiFL} incorporates a fairness term into the local optimization objective, effectively balancing local performance and fairness. The proposed coordination mechanism also prevents bias from propagating across clients during the collaboration phase. Through extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks, we demonstrate that \texttt{EquiFL} not only strikes a better balance between accuracy and fairness locally at each client but also achieves global fairness. The results also indicate that \texttt{EquiFL} ensures uniform performance distribution among clients, thus contributing to performance fairness. Furthermore, we showcase the benefits of \texttt{EquiFL} in a real-world distributed dataset from a healthcare application, specifically in predicting the effects of treatments on patients across various hospital locations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advent of online social networks has led to the development of an abundant literature on the study of online social groups and their relationship to individuals' personalities as revealed by their textual productions. Social structures are inferred from a wide range of social interactions. Those interactions form complex -- sometimes multi-layered -- networks, on which community detection algorithms are applied to extract higher order structures. The choice of the community detection algorithm is however hardily questioned in relation with the cultural production of the individual they classify. In this work, we assume the entangled nature of social networks and their cultural production to propose a definition of cultural based online social groups as sets of individuals whose online production can be categorized as social group-related. We take advantage of this apparently self-referential description of online social groups with a hybrid methodology that combines a community detection algorithm and a natural language processing classification algorithm. A key result of this analysis is the possibility to score community detection algorithms using their agreement with the natural language processing classification. A second result is that we can assign the opinion of a random user at &gt;85% accuracy.</description>

      <title>CLERC: A Dataset for Legal Case Retrieval and Retrieval-Augmented Analysis Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Legal professionals need to write analyses that rely on citations to relevant precedents, i.e., previous case decisions. Intelligent systems assisting legal professionals in writing such documents provide great benefits but are challenging to design. Such systems need to help locate, summarize, and reason over salient precedents in order to be useful. To enable systems for such tasks, we work with legal professionals to transform a large open-source legal corpus into a dataset supporting two important backbone tasks: information retrieval (IR) and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). This dataset CLERC (Case Law Evaluation Retrieval Corpus), is constructed for training and evaluating models on their ability to (1) find corresponding citations for a given piece of legal analysis and to (2) compile the text of these citations (as well as previous context) into a cogent analysis that supports a reasoning goal. We benchmark state-of-the-art models on CLERC, showing that current approaches still struggle: GPT-4o generates analyses with the highest ROUGE F-scores but hallucinates the most, while zero-shot IR models only achieve 48.3% recall@1000.</description>

      <title>Machine Unlearning Fails to Remove Data Poisoning Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the efficacy of several practical methods for approximate machine unlearning developed for large-scale deep learning. In addition to complying with data deletion requests, one often-cited potential application for unlearning methods is to remove the effects of training on poisoned data. We experimentally demonstrate that, while existing unlearning methods have been demonstrated to be effective in a number of evaluation settings (e.g., alleviating membership inference attacks), they fail to remove the effects of data poisoning, across a variety of types of poisoning attacks (indiscriminate, targeted, and a newly-introduced Gaussian poisoning attack) and models (image classifiers and LLMs); even when granted a relatively large compute budget. In order to precisely characterize unlearning efficacy, we introduce new evaluation metrics for unlearning based on data poisoning. Our results suggest that a broader perspective, including a wider variety of evaluations, is required to avoid a false sense of confidence in machine unlearning procedures for deep learning without provable guarantees. Moreover, while unlearning methods show some signs of being useful to efficiently remove poisoned datapoints without having to retrain, our work suggests that these methods are not yet "ready for prime time", and currently provide limited benefit over retraining.</description>

      <title>ELIZA Reinterpreted: The world's first chatbot was not intended as a chatbot at all</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: ELIZA, often considered the world's first chatbot, was written by Joseph Weizenbaum in the early 1960s. Weizenbaum did not intend to invent the chatbot, but rather to build a platform for research into human-machine conversation and the important cognitive processes of interpretation and misinterpretation. His purpose was obscured by ELIZA's fame, resulting in large part from the fortuitous timing of it's creation, and it's escape into the wild. In this paper I provide a rich historical context for ELIZA's creation, demonstrating that ELIZA arose from the intersection of some of the central threads in the technical history of AI. I also briefly discuss how ELIZA escaped into the world, and how its accidental escape, along with several coincidental turns of the programming language screws, led both to the misapprehension that ELIZA was intended as a chatbot, and to the loss of the original ELIZA to history for over 50 years.</description>

      <title>Art-ificial Intelligence: The Effect of AI Disclosure on Evaluations of Creative Content</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.06217v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The emergence of generative AI technologies, such as OpenAI's ChatGPT chatbot, has expanded the scope of tasks that AI tools can accomplish and enabled AI-generated creative content. In this study, we explore how disclosure regarding the use of AI in the creation of creative content affects human evaluation of such content. In a series of pre-registered experimental studies, we show that AI disclosure has no meaningful effect on evaluation either for creative or descriptive short stories, but that AI disclosure has a negative effect on evaluations for emotionally evocative poems written in the first person. We interpret this result to suggest that reactions to AI-generated content may be negative when the content is viewed as distinctly "human." We discuss the implications of this work and outline planned pathways of research to better understand whether and when AI disclosure may affect the evaluation of creative content.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05355v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the rapidly evolving landscape of artificial intelligence, multimodal learning systems (MMLS) have gained traction for their ability to process and integrate information from diverse modality inputs. Their expanding use in vital sectors such as healthcare has made safety assurance a critical concern. However, the absence of systematic research into their safety is a significant barrier to progress in this field. To bridge the gap, we present the first taxonomy that systematically categorizes and assesses MMLS safety. This taxonomy is structured around four fundamental pillars that are critical to ensuring the safety of MMLS: robustness, alignment, monitoring, and controllability. Leveraging this taxonomy, we review existing methodologies, benchmarks, and the current state of research, while also pinpointing the principal limitations and gaps in knowledge. Finally, we discuss unique challenges in MMLS safety. In illuminating these challenges, we aim to pave the way for future research, proposing potential directions that could lead to significant advancements in the safety protocols of MMLS.</description>

      <title>Metrics for Dataset Demographic Bias: A Case Study on Facial Expression Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.15889v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Demographic biases in source datasets have been shown as one of the causes of unfairness and discrimination in the predictions of Machine Learning models. One of the most prominent types of demographic bias are statistical imbalances in the representation of demographic groups in the datasets. In this paper, we study the measurement of these biases by reviewing the existing metrics, including those that can be borrowed from other disciplines. We develop a taxonomy for the classification of these metrics, providing a practical guide for the selection of appropriate metrics. To illustrate the utility of our framework, and to further understand the practical characteristics of the metrics, we conduct a case study of 20 datasets used in Facial Emotion Recognition (FER), analyzing the biases present in them. Our experimental results show that many metrics are redundant and that a reduced subset of metrics may be sufficient to measure the amount of demographic bias. The paper provides valuable insights for researchers in AI and related fields to mitigate dataset bias and improve the fairness and accuracy of AI models.

      <title>Effects of Research Paper Promotion via ArXiv and X</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.11116v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the evolving landscape of scientific publishing, it is important to understand the drivers of high-impact research, to equip scientists with actionable strategies to enhance the reach of their work, and to understand trends in the use of modern scientific publishing tools to inform their further development. Here, we study trends in the use of early preprint publications and revisions on ArXiv and the use of X (formerly Twitter) for promotion of such papers in computer science and physics. We find that early submissions to ArXiv and promotion on X have soared in recent years. Estimating the effect that the use of each of these modern affordances has on the number of citations of scientific publications, we find that peer-reviewed conference papers in computer science that are submitted early to ArXiv gain on average $21.1 \pm 17.4$ more citations, revised on ArXiv gain $18.4 \pm 17.6$ more citations, and promoted on X gain $44.4 \pm 8$ more citations in the first 5 years from an initial publication. In contrast, journal articles in physics experience comparatively lower boosts in citation counts, with increases of $3.9 \pm 1.1$, $4.3 \pm 0.9$, and $6.9 \pm 3.5$ citations respectively for the same interventions. Our results show that promoting one's work on ArXiv or X has a large impact on the number of citations, as well as the number of influential citations computed by Semantic Scholar, and thereby on the career of researchers. These effects are present also for publications in physics, but they are relatively smaller. The larger relative effect sizes, effects of promotion accumulating over time, and elevated unpredictability of the number of citations in computer science than in physics suggest a greater role of world-of-mouth spreading in computer science than in physics.</description>

      <title>Representation Surgery: Theory and Practice of Affine Steering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09631v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Language models often exhibit undesirable behavior, e.g., generating toxic or gender-biased text. In the case of neural language models, an encoding of the undesirable behavior is often present in the model's representations. Thus, one natural (and common) approach to prevent the model from exhibiting undesirable behavior is to steer the model's representations in a manner that reduces the probability of it generating undesirable text. This paper investigates the formal and empirical properties of steering functions, i.e., transformation of the neural language model's representations that alter its behavior. First, we derive two optimal, in the least-squares sense, affine steering functions under different constraints. Our theory provides justification for existing approaches and offers a novel, improved steering approach. Second, we offer a series of experiments that demonstrate the empirical effectiveness of the methods in mitigating bias and reducing toxic generation.</description>

      <title>Accurately Classifying Out-Of-Distribution Data in Facial Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03876v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Standard classification theory assumes that the distribution of images in the test and training sets are identical. Unfortunately, real-life scenarios typically feature unseen data ("out-of-distribution data") which is different from data in the training distribution("in-distribution"). This issue is most prevalent in social justice problems where data from under-represented groups may appear in the test data without representing an equal proportion of the training data. This may result in a model returning confidently wrong decisions and predictions. We are interested in the following question: Can the performance of a neural network improve on facial images of out-of-distribution data when it is trained simultaneously on multiple datasets of in-distribution data? We approach this problem by incorporating the Outlier Exposure model and investigate how the model's performance changes when other datasets of facial images were implemented. We observe that the accuracy and other metrics of the model can be increased by applying Outlier Exposure, incorporating a trainable weight parameter to increase the machine's emphasis on outlier images, and by re-weighting the importance of different class labels. We also experimented with whether sorting the images and determining outliers via image features would have more of an effect on the metrics than sorting by average pixel value. Our goal was to make models not only more accurate but also more fair by scanning a more expanded range of images. We also tested the datasets in reverse order to see whether a more fair dataset with balanced features has an effect on the model's accuracy.</description>
