      <title>Minimally coupled fermion-antifermion pairs via exponentially decaying potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we explore how a fermion-antifermion ($f\overline{f}$) pair interacts via an exponentially decaying potential. Using a covariant one-time two-body Dirac equation, we examine their relative motion in a three-dimensional flat background. Our approach leads to coupled equations governing their behavior, resulting in a general second-order wave equation. Through this, we derive analytical solutions by establishing quantization conditions for pair formation, providing insights into their dynamics. Notably, we find that such interacting $f\overline{f}$ systems are unstable and decay over time, with the decay time depending on the Compton wavelength of the fermions.</description>

      <title>On Using The Path Integral Formalism to Interpret Synchronization in Quantum Graph Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article explores the application of the path integral formalism in describing synchronization phenomena in entangled networks, cavities, and reservoirs. We discuss the concept of using Lagrangian mechanics for systems undergoing synchronization and its connection to least-action principles. By replacing the concept of least action with a least signaling term, we investigate how the path integral representation can be applied to study synchronization dynamics in entangled networks, drawing parallels with coupled oscillators in phase space models such as the Kuramoto model, as well as its relation to algorithms, such as the firefly algorithm for potential use in optimization in networks. This article also illustrates how entanglement signals themselves can interact strongly with ordered systems of harmonic oscillators that reach thresholds of classical synchronization with potential therefore for using entangled signals as weak measurement probes where phase dynamics is of interest.</description>

      <title>Generalized Quantum Stein's Lemma and Second Law of Quantum Resource Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The second law of thermodynamics is the cornerstone of physics, characterizing the convertibility between thermodynamic states through a single function, entropy. Given the universal applicability of thermodynamics, a fundamental question in quantum information theory is whether an analogous second law can be formulated to characterize the convertibility of resources for quantum information processing by such a single function. In 2008, a promising formulation was proposed, linking resource convertibility to the optimal performance of a variant of the quantum version of hypothesis testing. Central to this formulation was the generalized quantum Stein's lemma, which aimed to characterize this optimal performance by a measure of quantum resources, the regularized relative entropy of resource. If proven valid, the generalized quantum Stein's lemma would lead to the second law for quantum resources, with the regularized relative entropy of resource taking the role of entropy in thermodynamics. However, in 2023, a logical gap was found in the original proof of this lemma, casting doubt on the possibility of such a formulation of the second law. In this work, we address this problem by developing alternative techniques and successfully proving the generalized quantum Stein's lemma. Based on our proof, we reestablish and extend the formulation of quantum resource theories with the second law, applicable to both static and dynamical resources. These results resolve the fundamental problem of bridging the analogy between thermodynamics and quantum information theory.</description>

      <title>Fock-space delocalization and the emergence of the Porter-Thomas distribution from dual-unitary dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The chaotic dynamics of quantum many-body systems are expected to quickly randomize any structured initial state, delocalizing it in Fock space. In this work, we study the spreading of an initial product state in Hilbert space under dual-unitary dynamics, captured by the inverse participation ratios and the distribution of overlaps (bit-string probabilities). We consider the self-dual kicked Ising model, a minimal model of many-body quantum chaos which can be seen as either a periodically driven Floquet model or a dual-unitary quantum circuit. Both analytically and numerically, we show that the inverse participation ratios rapidly approach their ergodic values, corresponding to those of Haar random states, and establish the emergence of the Porter-Thomas distribution for the overlap distribution. Importantly, this convergence happens exponentially fast in time, with a time scale that is independent of system size. We inspect the effect of local perturbations that break dual-unitarity and show a slowdown of the spreading in Fock space, indicating that dual-unitary circuits are maximally efficient at preparing random states.</description>

      <title>Quantum simulation of dynamical gauge theories in periodically driven Rydberg atom arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulating quantum dynamics of lattice gauge theories (LGTs) is an exciting frontier in quantum science. Programmable quantum simulators based on neutral atom arrays are a promising approach to achieve this goal, since strong Rydberg blockade interactions can be used to naturally create low energy subspaces that can encode local gauge constraints. However, realizing regimes of LGTs where both matter and gauge fields exhibit significant dynamics requires the presence of tunable multi-body interactions such as those associated with ring exchange, which are challenging to realize directly. Here, we develop a method for generating such interactions based on time-periodic driving. Our approach utilizes controlled deviations from time-reversed trajectories, which are accessible in constrained PXP-type models via the application of frequency modulated global pulses. We show that such driving gives rise to a family of effective Hamiltonians with multi-body interactions whose strength is non-perturbative in their respective operator weight. We apply this approach to a two-dimensional U(1) LGT on the Kagome lattice, where we engineer strong six-body magnetic plaquette terms that are tunable relative to the kinetic energy of matter excitations, demonstrating access to previously unexplored dynamical regimes. Potential generalizations and prospects for experimental implementations are discussed.</description>

      <title>Quantum information scrambling in adiabatically-driven critical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum information scrambling refers to the spread of the initially stored information over many degrees of freedom of a quantum many-body system. Information scrambling is intimately linked to the thermalization of isolated quantum many-body systems and has been typically studied in a sudden quench scenario. Here we extend the notion of quantum information scrambling to critical quantum many-body systems undergoing an adiabatic evolution. In particular, we analyze how the symmetry-breaking information of an initial state is scrambled in adiabatically-driven integrable systems, such as the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick and quantum Rabi model. Following a time-dependent protocol that drives the system from a symmetry-breaking to a normal phase, we show how the initial information is scrambled even for perfect adiabatic evolutions as indicated by the expectation value of a suitable observable. We detail the underlying mechanism for quantum information scrambling, its relation to ground- and excited-state quantum phase transitions and quantify the degree of scrambling in terms of the number of eigenstates that participate in the encoding of the initial symmetry-breaking information. While the energy of the final state remains unaltered in an adiabatic protocol, the relative phases among eigenstates are scrambled and so is the symmetry-breaking information. We show that a potential information retrieval, following a time-reversed protocol, is hindered by small perturbations as indicated by a vanishingly small Loschmidt echo and out-of-time-ordered correlators. The reported phenomenon is amenable for its experimental verification and may help in the understanding of information scrambling in critical quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian entanglement dip from scaling-induced exceptional criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well established that the entanglement entropy of a critical system generally scales logarithmically with system size. Yet, in this work, we report a new class of non-Hermitian critical transitions that exhibit dramatic divergent dips in their entanglement entropy scaling, strongly violating conventional logarithmic behavior. Dubbed scaling-induced exceptional criticality (SIEC), it transcends existing non-Hermitian mechanisms such as exceptional bound states and non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE)-induced gap closures, which are nevertheless still governed by logarithmic entanglement scaling. Key to SIEC is its strongly scale-dependent spectrum, where eigenbands exhibit an exceptional crossing only at a particular system size. As such, the critical behavior is dominated by how the generalized Brillouin zone (GBZ) sweeps through the exceptional crossing with increasing system size, and not just by the gap closure per se. We provide a general approach for constructing SIEC systems based on the non-local competition between heterogeneous NHSE pumping directions, and show how a scale-dependent GBZ can be analytically derived to excellent accuracy. Beyond 1D free fermions, SIEC is expected to occur more prevalently in higher-dimensional or even interacting systems, where antagonistic NHSE channels generically proliferate. SIEC-induced entanglement dips generalize straightforwardly to kinks in other entanglement measures such as Renyi entropy, and serve as spectacular demonstrations of how algebraic and geometric singularities in complex band structures manifest in quantum information.</description>

      <title>Non-symmetric GHZ states; weighted hypergraph and controlled-unitary graph representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-symmetric GHZ states ($n$-GHZ$_\alpha$), characterized by unequal superpositions of $|00...0&gt;$ and $|11...1&gt;$, represent a significant yet underexplored class of multipartite entangled states with potential applications in quantum information. Despite their importance, the lack of a well-defined stabilizer formalism and corresponding graph representation has hindered their comprehensive study. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing two novel graph formalisms and stabilizers for non-symmetric GHZ states. First, we provide a weighted hypergraph representation and demonstrate that non-symmetric GHZ states are local unitary (LU) equivalent to fully connected weighted hypergraphs. Although these weighted hypergraphs are not stabilizer states, we show that they can be stabilized using local operations, and an ancilla. We further extend this framework to qudits, offering a specific form for non-symmetric qudit GHZ states and their LU equivalent weighted qudit hypergraphs. Second, we propose a graph formalism using controlled-unitary (CU) operations, showing that non-symmetric qudit GHZ states can be described using star-shaped CU graphs. Our findings enhance the understanding of non-symmetric GHZ states and their potential applications in quantum information science.</description>

      <title>Floquet engineering of interactions and entanglement in periodically driven Rydberg chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutral atom arrays driven into Rydberg states constitute a promising approach for realizing programmable quantum systems. Enabled by strong interactions associated with Rydberg blockade, they allow for simulation of complex spin models and quantum dynamics. We introduce a new Floquet engineering technique for systems in the blockade regime that provides control over novel forms of interactions and entanglement dynamics in such systems. Our approach is based on time-dependent control of Rydberg laser detuning and leverages perturbations around periodic many-body trajectories as resources for operator spreading. These time-evolved operators are utilized as a basis for engineering interactions in the effective Hamiltonian describing the stroboscopic evolution. As an example, we show how our method can be used to engineer strong spin exchange, consistent with the blockade, in a one-dimensional chain, enabling the exploration of gapless Luttinger liquid phases. In addition, we demonstrate that combining gapless excitations with Rydberg blockade can lead to dynamic generation of large-scale multi-partite entanglement. Experimental feasibility and possible generalizations are discussed.</description>

      <title>Resilience-Runtime Tradeoff Relations for Quantum Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A leading approach to algorithm design aims to minimize the number of operations in an algorithm's compilation. One intuitively expects that reducing the number of operations may decrease the chance of errors. This paradigm is particularly prevalent in quantum computing, where gates are hard to implement and noise rapidly decreases a quantum computer's potential to outperform classical computers. Here, we find that minimizing the number of operations in a quantum algorithm can be counterproductive, leading to a noise sensitivity that induces errors when running the algorithm in non-ideal conditions. To show this, we develop a framework to characterize the resilience of an algorithm to perturbative noises (including coherent errors, dephasing, and depolarizing noise). Some compilations of an algorithm can be resilient against certain noise sources while being unstable against other noises. We condense these results into a tradeoff relation between an algorithm's number of operations and its noise resilience. We also show how this framework can be leveraged to identify compilations of an algorithm that are better suited to withstand certain noises.</description>

      <title>Polynomial-Time Classical Simulation of Hidden Shift Circuits via Confluent Rewriting of Symbolic Sums</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Implementations of Roetteler's shifted bent function algorithm have in recent years been used to test and benchmark both classical simulation algorithms and quantum hardware. These circuits have many favorable properties, including a tunable amount of non-Clifford resources and a deterministic output, and moreover do not belong to any class of quantum circuits which is known to be efficiently simulable. We show that this family of circuits can in fact be simulated in polynomial time via symbolic path integrals. We do so by endowing symbolic sums with a confluent rewriting system and show that this rewriting system suffices to reduce the circuit's path integral to the hidden shift in polynomial-time. We hence resolve an open conjecture about the efficient simulability of this class of circuits.</description>

      <title>Scrambling-induced entanglement suppression in noisy quantum circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum information scrambling is a process happening during thermalization in quantum systems and describes the delocalization of quantum information. It is closely tied to entanglement, a key resource for quantum technologies and an order parameter for quantum many-body phenomena. We investigate the effect of dephasing noise on a multi-qubit teleportation protocol that experimentally validated quantum information scrambling. We find that while scrambling enhances information distribution, it is highly noise-sensitive, leading to decreased teleportation fidelity and an increase in the classical mixing of the quantum state. Using negativity as a mixed-state entanglement measure, we identify two fundamentally different entanglement-scaling regimes: efficient entanglement generation under weak dephasing noise, and entanglement suppression under strong dephasing noise. We show that in the latter, the teleportation consumes more entanglement than the scrambling is able to create. Comparison with a SWAP-gate-based teleportation protocol confirms that the entanglement suppression is a consequence of the scrambling mechanism. Our findings suggest that the information dynamics during thermalization is critically affected by dephasing noise, and confirm that in present-day noisy quantum devices, local information exchange is preferable over long-range information scrambling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show how to use Boson Sampling schemes in order to create photonic post-selected Controlled-Z and Controlled-Controlled-Z gates, which are equivalent, modulo single-qubit gates, to Controlled-NOT and Toffoli gates, respectively. The new proposed method is based on the following ingredients: identical single photons, Mach-Zehnder interferometer networks, single-photon detectors and post-selection. In particular, by using dual-rail path encoding together with auxiliary paths and single photons, we improve the success probabilities of such gates. This result further proves the complexity and richness of Reck and Clements schemes beyond the usual notions and practices of Boson Sampling.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Learning for Quantum Linear Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent availability of quantum annealers as cloud-based services has enabled new ways to handle machine learning problems, and several relevant algorithms have been adapted to run on these devices. In a recent work, linear regression was formulated as a quadratic binary optimization problem that can be solved via quantum annealing. Although this approach promises a computational time advantage for large datasets, the quality of the solution is limited by the necessary use of a precision vector, used to approximate the real-numbered regression coefficients in the quantum formulation. In this work, we focus on the practical challenge of improving the precision vector encoding: instead of setting an array of generic values equal for all coefficients, we allow each one to be expressed by its specific precision, which is tuned with a simple adaptive algorithm. This approach is evaluated on synthetic datasets of increasing size, and linear regression is solved using the D-Wave Advantage quantum annealer, as well as classical solvers. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest dataset ever evaluated for linear regression on a quantum annealer. The results show that our formulation is able to deliver improved solution quality in all instances, and could better exploit the potential of current quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Modular Architectures and Entanglement Schemes for Error-Corrected Distributed Quantum Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Connecting multiple smaller qubit modules by generating high-fidelity entangled states is a promising path for scaling quantum computing hardware. The performance of such a modular quantum computer is highly dependent on the quality and rate of entanglement generation. However, the optimal architectures and entanglement generation schemes are not yet established. Focusing on modular quantum computers with solid-state quantum hardware, we investigate a distributed surface code's error-correcting threshold and logical failure rate. We consider both emission-based and scattering-based entanglement generation schemes for the measurement of non-local stabilizers. Through quantum optical modeling, we link the performance of the quantum error correction code to the parameters of the underlying physical hardware and identify the necessary parameter regime for fault-tolerant modular quantum computation. In addition, we compare modular architectures with one or two data qubits per module. We find that the performance of the code depends significantly on the choice of entanglement generation scheme, while the two modular architectures have similar error-correcting thresholds. For some schemes, thresholds nearing the thresholds of non-distributed implementations ($\sim0.4 \%$) appear feasible with future parameters.</description>

Abstract: State convertibility is fundamental in the study of resource theory of quantum coherence. It is aimed at identifying when it is possible to convert a given coherent state to another using only incoherent operations. In this paper, we give a complete characterization of state convertibility under genuinely incoherent operations. It is found that the convexity of the robustness of coherence plays a central role. Based on this, the majorization condition of determining convertibility from pure states to mixed states under strictly incoherent operations is provided. Moreover, maximally coherent states in the set of all states with fixed diagonal elements are determined. It is somewhat surprising that the convexity of the robustness of coherence can also decide conversion between off-diagonal parts of coherent states. This might be a big step to answer completely the question of state convertibility for mixed states under incoherent operations.</description>

      <title>Strongest nonlocal sets with minimum cardinality in multipartite systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum nonlocality based on state discrimination describes the global property of the set of orthogonal states and has a wide range of applications in quantum cryptographic protocols. Strongest nonlocality is the strongest form of quantum nonlocality recently presented in multipartite quantum systems: a set of orthogonal multipartite quantum states is strongest nonlocal if the only orthogonality-preserving local measurements on the subsystems in every bipartition are trivial. In this work, we found a construction of strongest nonlocal sets in $\mathbb{C}^{d_{1}}\otimes \mathbb{C}^{d_{2}}\otimes \mathbb{C}^{d_{3}}$ $(2\leq d_{1}\leq d_{2}\leq d_{3})$ of size $d_2d_3+1$ without stopper states. Then we obtain the strongest nonlocal sets in four-partite systems with $d^3+1$ orthogonal states in $\mathbb{C}^d\otimes \mathbb{C}^{d}\otimes \mathbb{C}^{d}\otimes \mathbb{C}^{d}$ $(d\geq2)$ and $d_{2}d_{3}d_{4}+1$ orthogonal states in $\mathbb{C}^{d_{1}}\otimes \mathbb{C}^{d_{2}}\otimes \mathbb{C}^{d_{3}}\otimes \mathbb{C}^{d_{4}}$ $(2\leq d_{1}\leq d_{2}\leq d_{3}\leq d_{4})$. Surprisingly, the number of the elements in all above constructions perfectly reaches the recent conjectured lower bound and reduces the size of the strongest nonlocal set in $\mathbb{C}^{d}\otimes \mathbb{C}^{d}\otimes \mathbb{C}^{d}\otimes \mathbb{C}^{d}$ of [\href{https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevA.108.062407}{Phys. Rev. A \textbf{108}, 062407 (2023)}] by $d-2$. In particular, the general optimal construction of the strongest nonlocal set in four-partite system is completely solved for the first time, which further highlights the theory of quantum nonlocality from the perspective of state discrimination.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the Quantum Energy Teleportation protocol within the phase space formulation of quantum mechanics. By employing the Wigner quasi-probability distribution and the star product, we show that the teleported energy is proportional to the amount of entanglement present in the initial ground state. Further, we introduce the Husimi $Q$-function on a Bloch coherent state in order to determine the Wehrl entropy of the system. Finally, the Wherl entropy enable us to compute the consumption of coherence and entanglement throughout the protocol.</description>

      <title>Explicit quantum surrogates for quantum kernel models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) leverages quantum states for data encoding, with key approaches being explicit models that use parameterized quantum circuits and implicit models that use quantum kernels. Implicit models often have lower training errors but face issues such as overfitting and high prediction costs, while explicit models can struggle with complex training and barren plateaus. We propose a quantum-classical hybrid algorithm to create an explicit quantum surrogate (EQS) for trained implicit models. This involves diagonalizing an observable from the implicit model and constructing a corresponding quantum circuit using an extended automatic quantum circuit encoding (AQCE) algorithm. The EQS framework reduces prediction costs, mitigates barren plateau issues, and combines the strengths of both QML approaches.</description>

      <title>Deep Unfolded Local Quantum Annealing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03026v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Local quantum annealing (LQA), an iterative algorithm, is designed to solve combinatorial optimization problems. It draws inspiration from QA, which utilizes adiabatic time evolution to determine the global minimum of a given objective function. In the original LQA, the classical Hamiltonian is minimized via gradient descent. The performance of LQA depends on the choice of the parameters. Owing to the non-convex nature of the original cost function, LQA often becomes trapped in local minima, limiting its effectiveness. To address this challenge, we combine LQA with a deep unfolding scheme, which enables us to tune the parameters from the training data via back-propagation. Our findings demonstrate that deep unfolded LQA outperforms the original LQA, exhibiting remarkable convergence speed and performance improvement. As the trained parameters can be generalized to unknown instances and different system sizes, our results have significant practical implications and provide valuable insights for real-world applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The depth of quantum circuits is a critical factor when running them on state-of-the-art quantum devices due to their limited coherence times. Reducing circuit depth decreases noise in near-term quantum computations and reduces overall computation time, thus, also benefiting fault-tolerant quantum computations. Here, we show how to reduce the depth of quantum sub-routines that typically scale linearly with the number of qubits, such as quantum fan-out and long-range CNOT gates, to a constant depth using mid-circuit measurements and feed-forward operations, while only requiring a 1D line topology. We compare our protocols with existing ones to highlight their advantages. Additionally, we verify the feasibility by implementing the measurement-based quantum fan-out gate and long-range CNOT gate on real quantum hardware, demonstrating significant improvements over their unitary implementations.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Variational Quantum Algorithms for Combinatorial Optimization in Practice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms and, in particular, variants of the varational quantum eigensolver have been proposed to address combinatorial optimization (CO) problems. Using only shallow ansatz circuits, these approaches are deemed suitable for current noisy intermediate-scale quantum hardware. However, the resources required for training shallow variational quantum circuits often scale superpolynomially in problem size. In this study we numerically investigate what this scaling result means in practice for solving CO problems using Max-Cut as a benchmark. For fixed resources, we compare the average performance of training a shallow variational quantum circuit, sampling with replacement, and a greedy algorithm starting from the same initial point as the quantum algorithm. We identify a minimum problem size for which the quantum algorithm can consistently outperform sampling and, for each problem size, characterize the separation between the quantum algorithm and the greedy algorithm. Furthermore, we extend the average case analysis by investigating the correlation between the performance of the algorithms by instance. Our results provide a step towards meaningful benchmarks of variational quantum algorithms for CO problems for a realistic set of resources.</description>

Abstract: This paper introduces an innovative and practical approach to universal quantum matrix multiplication. We designed optimized quantum adders and multipliers based on Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT), which significantly reduced the number of gates used compared to classical adders and multipliers. Subsequently, we construct a basic universal quantum matrix multiplication and extend it to the Strassen algorithm. We conduct comparative experiments to analyze the performance of the quantum matrix multiplication and evaluate the acceleration provided by the optimized quantum adder and multiplier. Furthermore, we investigate the advantages and disadvantages of the quantum Strassen algorithm compared to basic quantum matrix multiplication.</description>

      <title>QADQN: Quantum Attention Deep Q-Network for Financial Market Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Financial market prediction and optimal trading strategy development remain challenging due to market complexity and volatility. Our research in quantum finance and reinforcement learning for decision-making demonstrates the approach of quantum-classical hybrid algorithms to tackling real-world financial challenges. In this respect, we corroborate the concept with rigorous backtesting and validate the framework's performance under realistic market conditions, by including fixed transaction cost per trade. This paper introduces a Quantum Attention Deep Q-Network (QADQN) approach to address these challenges through quantum-enhanced reinforcement learning. Our QADQN architecture uses a variational quantum circuit inside a traditional deep Q-learning framework to take advantage of possible quantum advantages in decision-making. We gauge the QADQN agent's performance on historical data from major market indices, including the S&amp;P 500. We evaluate the agent's learning process by examining its reward accumulation and the effectiveness of its experience replay mechanism. Our empirical results demonstrate the QADQN's superior performance, achieving better risk-adjusted returns with Sortino ratios of 1.28 and 1.19 for non-overlapping and overlapping test periods respectively, indicating effective downside risk management.</description>

      <title>High-dimensional quantum XYZ product codes for biased noise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum XYZ product can construct a class of non-CSS codes by using three classical codes. However, before this work, their error-correcting performance is not studied in depth and whether this code construction method can be generalized to higher dimension is an open question. In this paper, we first study the error-correcting performance of the 3D Chamon code, which can be seen as a non-CSS variant of the 3D toric code and a special instance of the XYZ product of three repetition codes. Second, we show that XYZ product can be generalized to four dimension and propose four-dimensional (4D) XYZ product code construction, which can be seen as a variant of 4D homological product and constructs a class of non-CSS codes by using 4 classical codes or 2 CSS codes. Compared with 4D homological product, we show that 4D XYZ product can construct non-CSS codes with higher dimension or code distance. Third, we consider two special instances of 4D XYZ product, which we name 4D Chamon code and 4D XYZ concatenated code. Exploiting fully decoupled binary belief propagation combined with ordered statistics decoding, our simulation results show that, using the same two CSS codes, 4D XYZ product can construct non-CSS codes with better error-correcting performance for $Z$-biased noise than CSS codes constructed by 4D homological product, which is more meaningful for practice quantum computing system.</description>

      <title>Quantum Simulations of Chemistry in First Quantization with any Basis Set</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computation of the energy of molecules and materials is one of the most promising applications of fault-tolerant quantum computers. However, practical applications require algorithms with reduced resource requirements. Previous work has mainly represented the Hamiltonian of the system in second quantization. Existing methods in first quantization are limited to grid-based approaches that do not allow for active space calculations. In this work, we present a method to solve the generic ground-state chemistry problem in first quantization on a fault-tolerant quantum computer using any basis set. This allows for calculations in the active space using modern quantum chemistry basis sets. We derive a linear-combination-of-unitaries decomposition for a chemical Hamiltonian in first quantization and then construct an efficient block encoding, exploiting sparsity of the Hamiltonian. For active space calculations using a molecular orbital basis set, we achieve an asymptotic speed up in Toffoli-gate count compared to the equivalent method in second quantization [Berry, et. al. Quantum 3, 208 (2019)]. We also consider the dual plane waves for materials simulations and find that in physically interesting regimes we achieve orders of magnitude improvement in quantum resources compared to the second quantization counterpart. In some instances, our approach provides similar or even lower resources compared to the first quantization plane wave algorithm of Refs.[Babbush, et. al npj Quantum Inf 5(1) 92 (2019), Su et. al PRX Quantum 2(4), 040332 (2021)] that, unlike our approach, avoids loading the classical data from quantum memory. This work opens up possibilities to reduce quantum resources even further using factorization methods of a Hamiltonian or modern pseudopotentials. Furthermore, our approach can be adapted to other applications, such as the vibrational properties of chemical systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum Computation of Electronic Structure with Projector Augmented-Wave Method and Plane Wave Basis Set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum simulation of materials is a promising application area of quantum computers. In order to realize this promise, finding ways to reduce quantum resources while maintaining the accuracy of results will be necessary. In electronic structure calculations on classical computer the reduction of resources has been achieved by using the projector augmented-wave method (PAW) and plane wave basis sets. In this work, we present an implementation of the PAW with plane waves for quantum computation of the energy. We first generalize the approach to many-body wavefunctions and develop the unitary version of the PAW which preserves the orthonormality of orbitals. Then, we provide a linear-combination-of-unitaries decomposition which explicitly accounts for the atomic two-body PAW correction and provide the corresponding block encodings of the Hamiltonian used in qubitized quantum phase estimation. We then estimate quantum resources for crystalline solids using down-sampling to estimate the energy within chemical accuracy with respect to the full basis set limit, and also consider a supercell approach which is more suitable for calculations of defect states. We provide the quantum resources for energy estimation of a nitrogen-vacancy defect centre in diamond which is a challenging system for classical algorithms and a quintessential problem in the studies of quantum point defects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transition dynamics of two-state systems with time-dependent energy levels, first considered by Landau, Zener, Majorana, and St\"uckelberg, is one of the basic models in quantum physics and has been used to describe various physical systems. We propose here a generalization of the Landau-Zener (LZ) problem characterized by distinct paths of the instantaneous eigenstates as the system evolves in time, while keeping the instantaneous eigenenergies exactly as in the standard LZ model. We show that these paths play an essential role in the transition probability $P$ between the two states, and can lead to superadiabatic transitions, i.e., to a substantial reduction of $P$. As an instructive extreme case, we identify an unconditionally adiabatic regime with $P=0$ no matter how fast the system evolves in time and regardless of the energy gap between the two levels at the anticrossing point. On the other hand, large $P$ occur even in the absence of any anticrossing point. These phenomena can be explained by observing the rotation of the instantaneous eigenvectors on the Bloch sphere. The superadiabatic LZ model can describe valley transition dynamics during charge and spin shuttling in semiconductor quantum dots.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The non-commutative nature of quantum mechanics imposes fundamental constraints on system dynamics, which in the linear realm are manifested by the physical realizability conditions on system matrices. These restrictions endow system matrices with special structure. The purpose of this paper is to study such structure by investigating zeros and poses of linear quantum systems. In particular, we show that $-s_0^\ast$ is a transmission zero if and only if $s_0$ is a pole, and which is further generalized to the relationship between system eigenvalues and invariant zeros. Additionally, we study left-invertibility and fundamental tradeoff for linear quantum systems in terms of their zeros and poles.</description>

      <title>Enhanced sensing of Stark weak field under the influence of Aubry-Andr{\'e}-Harper criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The localization-delocalization transition can be leveraged as a resource for achieving quantum-enhanced sensitivity in parameter estimation. We demonstrate that by employing different classes of localization-delocalization transition potentials one can significantly enhance the precision of parameter estimation. Specifically, we focus on the precision measurement of the Stark strength parameter encoded in the ground state of a one-dimensional fermionic lattice under the influence of Aubry-Andr{\'e}-Harper (AAH) localization-delocalization transition. We consider the single-particle system and the system at half-filling. Our work reveals that the Quantum Fisher Information (QFI) offers a superior scaling with respect to the system size in comparison to the pure stark case, leading to a better parameter estimation. However, experimentally measuring fidelity-based QFI in a many-body system poses significant challenges. To address this, we suggest experimentally relevant operators that can be utilized to achieve precision surpassing the Heisenberg Limit (HL) or can even saturate the QFI scaling. These operators, relevant for practical experimental setups, provides a feasible pathway to harness the advantages offered by the localization-delocalization transition by exploiting two distinct localizing potentials for quantum-enhanced parameter estimation.</description>

      <title>A New Framework for Quantum Phases in Open Systems: Steady State of Imaginary-Time Lindbladian Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study delves into the concept of quantum phases in open quantum systems, examining the shortcomings of existing approaches that focus on steady states of Lindbladians and highlighting their limitations in capturing key phase transitions. In contrast to these methods, we introduce the concept of imaginary-time Lindbladian evolution as an alternative framework. This new approach defines gapped quantum phases in open systems through the spectrum properties of the imaginary-Liouville superoperator. We find that, in addition to all pure gapped ground states, the Gibbs state of a stabilizer Hamiltonian at any finite temperature can also be characterized by our scheme, demonstrated through explicit construction. To illustrate the effectiveness of this framework, we apply it to investigate the phase diagram for open systems with $\mathbb{Z}_{2}^{\sigma} \times \mathbb{Z}_{2}^{\tau}$ symmetry, including cases with nontrivial average symmetry protected topological order or spontaneous symmetry breaking order. Our findings demonstrate universal properties at quantum criticality, such as nonanalytic behaviors of steady-state observables, divergence of correlation lengths, and closing of the imaginary-Liouville gap. These results advance our understanding of quantum phase transitions in open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Modulated time evolution for efficient variational ground-state preparation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adiabatic state preparation seeks to prepare the ground state of a target Hamiltonian from an easily prepared ground state of the initial Hamiltonian. It is guaranteed to work for time-dependent Hamiltonians that always have an energy gap to the first excited state throughout the entire evolution, but it can be excruciatingly slow. To speed up the process, we introduce a scaling factor that modulates the Hamiltonian during the time evolution, controlled by a variational principle on the final energy of the unscaled Hamiltonian. We find the optimized time evolution resembles a local adiabatic time evolution with an additional rapid modulation of the scale, which both reduces diabatic excitation from the ground state, and returns excited states back to the ground state. This approach is particularly simple to implement; it does not require constructing complicated counter-diabatic Hamiltonians nor does it need any a priori knowledge of the energy gap of the system. When the time evolution is discretized into problem and mixer components it closely resembles the quantum approximate optimization algorithm, featuring a local adiabatic field with oscillations arising from the ratio of angles at each layer and from a layer-dependent modulation of the overall scale.</description>

      <title>Multivariable QSP and Bosonic Quantum Simulation using Iterated Quantum Signal Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide in this work a form of Modular Quantum Signal Processing that we call iterated quantum signal processing. This method recursively applies quantum signal processing to the outputs of other quantum signal processing steps, allowing polynomials to be easily achieved that would otherwise be difficult to find analytically. We specifically show by using a squaring quantum signal processing routine, that multiplication of phase angles can be approximated and in turn that any bounded degree multi-variate polynomial function of a set of phase angles can be implemented using traditional QSP ideas. We then discuss how these ideas can be used to construct phase functions relevant for quantum simulation such as the Coulomb potential and also discuss how to use these ideas to obviate the need for reversible arithmetic to compute square-root functions needed for simulations of bosonic Hamiltonians.</description>

      <title>Single-photon interference over 8.4 km urban atmosphere: towards testing quantum effect in curved spacetime with photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of quantum mechanics and general relativity has transformed our understanding of the natural world significantly. However, integrating these two theories presents immense challenges, and their interplay remains untested. Recent theoretical studies suggest that the single-photon interference covering huge space can effectively probe the interface between quantum mechanics and general relativity. We developed an alternative design using unbalanced Michelson interferometers to address this and validated its feasibility over an 8.4 km free-space channel. Using a high-brightness single-photon source based on quantum dots, we demonstrated single-photon interference along this long-distance baseline. We achieved a phase measurement precision of 16.2 mrad, which satisfied the measurement requirements for a gravitational redshift at the geosynchronous orbit by five times the standard deviation. Our results confirm the feasibility of the single-photon version of the Colella-Overhauser-Werner experiment for testing the quantum effects in curved spacetime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Any quantum computation consists of a sequence of unitary evolutions described by a finite set of Hamiltonians. When this set is taken to consist of only products of Pauli operators, we show that the minimal such set generating $\mathfrak{su}(2^{N})$ contains $2N+1$ elements. We provide a number of examples of such generating sets and furthermore provide an algorithm for producing a sequence of rotations corresponding to any given Pauli rotation, which is shown to have optimal complexity.</description>

Abstract: The fermionic von Neumann entropy, the fermionic entanglement entropy and the fermionic relative entropy are defined for causal fermion systems. Our definition makes use of entropy formulas for quasi-free fermionic states in terms of the reduced one-particle density operator. Our definitions are illustrated in various examples for Dirac spinors in two- and four-dimensional Minkowski space, in the Schwarzschild black hole geometry and for fermionic lattices. We review area laws for the two-dimensional diamond and a three-dimensional spatial region in Minkowski space. The connection is made to the computation of the relative entropy using modular theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02696v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the well-known Heisenberg uncertainty relations and Landau-Peierls uncertainty relations implicitly contain ``hidden'' angular variables, which belong to new uncertainty relations. Based on the obtained relations, we derive a formula for estimating the speed $U^*$ of a virtual particle in indirect measurements. We applied the theory of indirect measurements and the derived formula to estimate the module of the group velocity of virtual photons from the DIS HERA data. The HERA data indicate that the speed of virtual photons exceeds the speed of light $c$ in free space, $U^*&gt;c$. The properties of virtual photons and a hypothetical tachyon particle are almost identical. It is found that in the realm of particle interaction, the new angular parameters are closely related to the type of the phase-space geometry and dimensionality of the space-time continuum. It is suggested that the problem of the normalization condition $U^* =c$ at $Q^2=0\, \rm{GeV}^2$ can be solved naturally within the framework of ``Two-Time Physics'' developed by I. Bars. 2T-physics is the theory with local symplectic $\mathrm{Sp(2,R)}$ gauge symmetry in phase-space and the space-time geometry of signature $\mathrm{(1+1',d+1')}$ with one extra time-like and one extra space-like dimensions.</description>

      <title>Phonon-Induced Exchange Gate Infidelities in Semiconducting Si-SiGe Spin Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin-spin exchange interactions between semiconductor spin qubits allow for fast single and two-qubit gates. During exchange, coupling of the qubits to a surrounding phonon bath may cause errors in the resulting gate. Here, the fidelities of exchange operations with semiconductor double quantum dot spin qubits in a Si-SiGe heterostructure coupled to a finite temperature phonon bath are considered. By employing a master equation approach, the isolated effect of each spin-phonon coupling term may be resolved, as well as leakage errors of encoded qubit operations. As the temperature is increased, a crossover is observed from where the primary source of error is due to a phonon induced perturbation of the two electron spin states, to one where the phonon induced coupling to an excited orbital state becomes the dominant error. Additionally, it is shown that a simple trade-off in pulse shape and length can improve robustness to spin-phonon induced errors during gate operations by up to an order of magnitude. Our results suggest that for elevated temperatures within 200-300 mK, exchange gate operations are not currently limited by bulk phonons. This is consistent with recent experiments.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Superconducting Qubit Performance Through Ammonium Fluoride Etch</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The performance of superconducting qubits is often limited by dissipation and two-level systems (TLS) losses. The dominant sources of these losses are believed to originate from amorphous materials and defects at interfaces and surfaces, likely as a result of fabrication processes or ambient exposure. Here, we explore a novel wet chemical surface treatment at the Josephson junction-substrate and the substrate-air interfaces by replacing a buffered oxide etch (BOE) cleaning process with one that uses hydrofluoric acid followed by aqueous ammonium fluoride. We show that the ammonium fluoride etch process results in a statistically significant improvement in median $\text{T}_1$ by $\sim22\%$ ($p=0.002$), and a reduction in the number of strongly-coupled TLS in the tunable frequency range. Microwave resonator measurements on samples treated with the ammonium fluoride etch prior to niobium deposition also show $\sim33\%$ lower TLS-induced loss tangent compared to the BOE treated samples. As the chemical treatment primarily modifies the Josephson junction-substrate interface and substrate-air interface, we perform targeted chemical and structural characterizations to examine materials' differences at these interfaces and identify multiple microscopic changes that could contribute to decreased TLS.</description>

      <title>Quantum Imaging Using Spatially Entangled Photon Pairs from a Nonlinear Metasurface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02903v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear metasurfaces with subwavelength thickness were recently established as versatile platforms for the enhanced and tailorable generation of entangled photon pairs. The small dimensions and inherent stability of integrated metasurface sources are attractive for free-space applications in quantum communications, sensing, and imaging, yet this remarkable potential remained unexplored. Here, we formulate and experimentally demonstrate the unique benefits and practical potential of nonlinear metasurfaces for quantum imaging at infrared wavelengths, facilitating an efficient protocol combining ghost and all-optical scanning imaging. The metasurface incorporates a subwavelength-scale silica metagrating on a lithium niobate thin film. Its distinguishing feature is the capability to all-optically scan the photon emission angle in the direction across the grating simply by tuning the pump beam wavelength. Simultaneously, the photon emission is broad and anti-correlated along the grating direction, allowing for ghost imaging. Thereby, we reconstruct the images of 2D objects using just a 1D detector array in the idler path and a bucket detector in the signal path, by recording the dependencies of photon coincidences on the pump wavelength. Our results reveal new possibilities for quantum imaging with ultra-large field of view and improved imaging resolution as compared to photon pairs from conventional bulky crystals. The demonstrated concept can be extended to multi-wavelength operation and other applications such as quantum object tracking, paving the way for advancements in quantum technologies using ultra-compact nanostructured metasurfaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigated the dynamics of an electron--nuclear spin-coupled system using three Al$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$As bulk samples with different aluminum concentrations $x$ of 0, 0.05, and 0.15. The time-resolved Kerr rotation technique was primarily used. The samples with $x=$ 0.05 and 0.15 exhibited an anomalously large nuclear magnetic field of $\sim$1.1 T, which was twice the applied magnetic field. This observation is unusual for bulk semiconductors, which typically exhibit weak hyperfine interactions. Further investigations revealed a long nuclear field formation time, which indicated clear two-stage formation dynamics. Thus, this study concluded that slow nuclear spin diffusion owing to the nuclear quadrupole interaction facilitates the formation process of the nuclear field.</description>

      <title>Long-range optomechanical interactions in SiN membrane arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optomechanical systems using a membrane-in-the-middle configuration can exhibit a long-range type of interaction similar to how atoms show collective motion in an optical potential. Photons bounce back and forth inside a high-finesse Fabry-P\'{e}rot cavity and mediate the interaction between multiple membranes over a significant distance compared to the wavelength. Recently, it has been demonstrated that light coupling the center-of-mass mode of the membranes can cause coherent mechanical noise cancellation. Long-range interactions involving the breathing mode of the membranes have to date not been experimentally demonstrated, however. In our experiment, a double-membrane system inside a Fabry-P\'{e}rot cavity resonantly enhances the cavity field, resulting in a stronger optomechanical coupling strength from the increased radiation pressure. The resonance condition is first identified by analyzing the slope of the dispersion relation. Then, the optomechanical coupling is determined at various chip positions over one wavelength range. The optimum coupling conditions are obtained and enhancement is demonstrated for double membrane arrays with three different reflectivites, reaching nearly four-fold enhancement for the breathing mode of $R=65\%$ double membranes. The cavity losses at the optimum coupling are also characterized and the potential of reaching the single-photon strong coupling regime is discussed.</description>

Abstract: Completely positive transformations play an important role in the description of state changes in quantum mechanics, including the time evolution of open quantum systems. One useful tool to describe them is the so-called Choi isomorphism, which maps completely positive transformations to positive semi-definite matrices. Accordingly, there are numerous proposals to generalize the Choi isomorphism. In the present paper, we show that the 1976 paper of Gorini, Kossakowski and Sudarshan (GKS) already holds the key for a further generalization and study the resulting GKS isomorphism. As an application, we compute the GKS matrix of the time evolution of a general open quantum system up to second order in time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In quantum mechanics, a quantum wavepacket may acquire a geometrical phase as it evolves along a cyclic trajectory in parameter space. In condensed matter systems, the Berry phase plays a crucial role in fundamental phenomena such as the Hall effect, orbital magnetism, and polarization. Resolving the quantum nature of these processes commonly requires sensitive quantum techniques, as tunneling, being the dominant mechanism in STM microscopy and tunneling transport devices. In this study, we integrate these two phenomena - geometrical phases and tunneling - and observe a complex-valued Berry phase via strong field light matter interactions in condensed matter systems. By manipulating the tunneling barrier, with attoseconds precision, we measure the imaginary Berry phase accumulated as the electron tunnels during a fraction of the optical cycle. Our work opens new theoretical and experimental directions in geometrical phases physics and their realization in condensed matter systems, expanding solid state strong field light metrology to study topological quantum phenomena.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interplay between strong long-range interactions and the coherent driving contribute to the formation of complex patterns, symmetry, and novel phases of matter in many-body systems. However, long-range interactions may induce an additional dissipation channel, resulting in non-Hermitian many-body dynamics and the emergence of exceptional points in spectrum. Here, we report experimental observation of interaction-induced exceptional points in cold Rydberg atomic gases, revealing the breaking of charge-conjugation parity symmetry. By measuring the transmission spectrum under increasing and decreasing probe intensity, the interaction-induced hysteresis trajectories are observed, which give rise to non-Hermitian dynamics. We record the area enclosed by hysteresis loops and investigate the dynamics of hysteresis loops. The reported exceptional points and hysteresis trajectories in cold Rydberg atomic gases provide valuable insights into the underlying non-Hermitian physics in many-body systems, allowing us to study the interplay between long-range interactions and non-Hermiticity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a type system for the Quipper language designed to derive upper bounds on the size of the circuits produced by the typed program. This size can be measured according to various metrics, including width, depth and gate count, but also variations thereof obtained by considering only some wire types or some gate kinds. The key ingredients for achieving this level of flexibility are effects and refinement types, both relying on indices, that is, generic arithmetic expressions whose operators are interpreted differently depending on the target metric. The approach is shown to be correct through logical predicates, under reasonable assumptions about the chosen resource metric. This approach is empirically evaluated through the QuRA tool, showing that, in many cases, inferring tight bounds is possible in a fully automatic way.</description>

      <title>Microwave driven singlet-triplet qubits enabled by site-dependent g-tensors</title>

Abstract: Hole spin qubits are rapidly emerging as the workhorse of semiconducting quantum processors because of their large spin-orbit interaction, enabling fast all-electric operations at low power. However, spin-orbit interaction also causes non-uniformities in devices, resulting in locally varying qubit energies and site-dependent anisotropies. While these anisotropies can be used to drive single-spins, if not properly harnessed, they can hinder the path toward large-scale quantum processors. Here, we report on a qubit in planar germanium, where we control the anisotropy of two spins in a double quantum dot. By characterising microwave-driven singlet-triplet qubits, we show two distinct operating regimes depending on the magnetic field direction. For in-plane fields, the two spins are largely anisotropic, enabling to measure all the available transitions; coherence times exceeding 3 $\mu$s are extracted. For out-of-plane fields, they have an isotropic response but preserve the substantial energy difference required to address the singlet-triplet qubit. Even in this field direction, where the qubit lifetime is strongly affected by nuclear spins, we find 400 ns coherence times.

      <title>Krylov complexity of thermal state in early universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In our work, we perform a detailed study of the Krylov complexity of the thermal state across the entire early universe, encompassing the inflation, radiation-dominated period, and matter-dominated period, which is for the single field inflation. We utilize both the closed system's method and open system's method to achieve this goal. To accurately calculate the Krylov complexity, we purified the thermal state, resulting in a pure state with two modes. Our analysis with both methods indicates that the Krylov complexity will increase during inflation, but will saturate at constant values during the radiation-dominated and matter-dominated periods, where the generation of particles via preheating leads to this evolution. Furthermore, our findings reveal that inflation behaves as a strong dissipative system, while the radiation-dominated and matter-dominated periods act as weak dissipative systems. The chaotic feature during these periods follows a similar trend to the Krylov complexity. This research has the potential to provide new insights into the exploration of Krylov complexity in cosmology.</description>

      <title>Photonic Mpemba effect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Mpemba effect is the counterintuitive phenomenon in statistical physics for which a far-from-equilibrium state can relax toward equilibrium faster than a state closer to equilibrium. This effect has raised a great curiosity since long time and has been studied extensively in many classical and quantum systems. Here it is shown that the Mpemba effect can be observed in optics as well. Specifically, the process of light diffusion in finite-sized photonic lattices under incoherent (dephasing) dynamics is considered. Rather surprisingly, it is shown that certain highly-localized initial light distributions can diffuse faster than initial broadly delocalized distributions. The effect is illustrated by considering random walk of optical pulses in fiber-based temporal mesh lattices, which should provide an experimentally-accessible setup for the demonstration of the Mpemba effect in optics.</description>

      <title>Two-color Ytterbium MOT in a compact dual-chamber setup</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an experimental scheme for producing ultracold Ytterbium atoms in a compact dual-chamber setup. A dispenser-loaded two-dimensional (2D) magneto-optical trap (MOT) using permanent magnets and operating on the broad $^1S_0\to {}^1P_1$ singlet transition delivers over $10^7$ atoms per second through a differential pumping stage into a three-dimensional (3D) MOT. The two-color 3D MOT uses the broad singlet transition to accumulate $\sim\!2\times 10^7$ atoms of $^{174}\text{Yb}$ within $2.5~\text{s}$ and subsequently the narrow $^1S_0\to {}^3P_1$ intercombination line to cool the atomic cloud to below $10~\mathrm{\mu K}$. We report optimized parameters for each stage of the atom collection sequence, achieving high transfer efficiency. We find that shelving into the triplet state during the broad-transition MOT almost doubles the number of trapped atoms.</description>

      <title>Robustness of electron charge shuttling: Architectures, pulses, charge defects and noise thresholds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In semiconductor-based quantum technologies, the capability to shuttle charges between components is profoundly enabling. We numerically simulated various "conveyor-belt" shuttling scenarios for simple Si/SiO2 devices, explicitly modelling the electron's wave function using grid-based split-operator methods and a time-dependent 2D potential (obtained from a Poisson solver). This allowed us to fully characterise the electron loss probability and excitation fraction. Remarkably, with as few as three independent electrodes the process can remain near-perfectly adiabatic even in the presence of pulse imperfection, nearby charge defects, and Johnson-Nyquist noise. Only a substantial density of charge defects, or defects at 'adversarial' locations, can catastrophically disrupt the charge shuttling. While we do not explicitly model the spin or valley degrees of freedom, our results from this charge propagation study support the conclusion that conveyor-belt shuttling is an excellent candidate for providing connectivity in semiconductor quantum devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.12253v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sampling from a quantum distribution can be exponentially hard for classical computers and yet could be performed efficiently by a noisy intermediate-scale quantum device. A prime example of a distribution that is hard to sample is given by the output states of a linear interferometer traversed by $N$ identical boson particles. Here, we propose a scheme to implement such a boson sampling machine with ultracold atoms in a polarization-synthesized optical lattice. We experimentally demonstrate the basic building block of such a machine by revealing the Hong-Ou-Mandel interference of two bosonic atoms in a four-mode interferometer. To estimate the sampling rate for large $N$, we develop a theoretical model based on a master equation that accounts for particle losses, but not include technical errors. Our results show that atomic samplers have the potential to achieve quantum advantage over today's best supercomputers with $N \gtrsim 40$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.04938v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose and demonstrate two practical mitigation methods to attenuate the cosmic muon flux, compatible with experiments involving superconducting qubits: shallow underground sites and specific device orientation. Using a specifically-built cosmic muon detector, we identify underground sites, widely present in urban environments, where significant attenuation of cosmic muon flux, up to a factor 35 for 100-meter depths, can be attained. Furthermore, we employ two germanium wafers in an above-ground laboratory, each equipped with a particle sensor, to show how the orientation of the chip with respect to the sky affects the amount and type of energy deposited on the substrate by ionizing radiation. We observe that the horizontal detector sees more counts at lower energy, while the vertical one is impacted by more particles at higher energy. The methods here described proposed ways to directly understand and reduce the effects of cosmic rays on qubits by attenuating the source of this type of decoherence, complementing existing on-chip mitigation strategies. We expect that both on-chip and off-chip methods combined will become ubiquitous in quantum technologies based on superconducting qubit circuits.</description>

      <title>Squeezing equivalence of quantum harmonic oscillators under different frequency modulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.05577v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The papers by Janszky and Adam [Phys. Rev. A {\bf 46}, 6091 (1992)] and Chen \textit{et al.} [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 104}, 063002 (2010)] are examples of works where one can find the following equivalences: belonging to the following class: quantum harmonic oscillators subjected to different time-dependent frequency modulations, during a certain time interval $\tau$, exhibit exactly the same final null squeezing parameter ($r_f=0$). In the present paper, we discuss a more general case of squeezing equivalence, where the final squeezing parameter can be non-null ($r_f\geq0$). We show that when the interest is in controlling the forms of the frequency modulations, but keeping free the choice of the values of $r_f$ and $\tau$, this in general demands numerical calculations to find these values leading to squeezing equivalences (a particular case of this procedure recovers the equivalence found by Jansky and Adams). On the other hand, when the interest is not in previously controlling the form of these frequencies, but rather $r_f$ and $\tau$ (and also some constraints, such as minimization of energy), one can have analytical solutions for these frequencies leading to squeezing equivalences (particular cases of this procedure are usually applied in problems of shortcuts to adiabaticity, as done by Chen \textit{et al.}). In this way, this more general squeezing equivalence discussed here is connected to recent and important topics in the literature as, for instance, generation of squeezed states and the obtaining of shortcuts to adiabaticity.</description>

      <title>Optomechanics of optically-levitated particles: A tutorial and perspective</title>

Abstract: Optomechanics, the study of the mechanical interaction of light with matter, has proven to be a fruitful area of research that has yielded many notable achievements, including the direct detection of gravitational waves in kilometer-scale optical interferometers. Light has been used to cool and demonstrate quantum control over the mechanical degrees of freedom of individual ions and atoms, and more recently has facilitated the observation of quantum ``mechanics'' in objects of larger mass, even at the kg-scale. Optical levitation, where an object can be suspended by radiation pressure and largely decoupled from its environment, has recently established itself as a rich field of study, with many notable results relevant for precision measurement, quantum information science, and foundational tests of quantum mechanics and fundamental physics. This article provides a survey of several current activities in field along with a tutorial describing associated key concepts and methods, both from an experimental and theoretical approach. It is intended as a resource for junior researchers who are new to this growing field as well as beginning graduate students. The tutorial is concluded with a perspective on both promising emerging experimental platforms and anticipated future theoretical developments.</description>

      <title>Postselected communication over quantum channels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.02583v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The single-letter characterisation of the entanglement-assisted capacity of a quantum channel is one of the seminal results of quantum information theory. In this paper, we consider a modified communication scenario in which the receiver is allowed an additional, `inconclusive' measurement outcome, and we employ an error metric given by the error probability in decoding the transmitted message conditioned on a conclusive measurement result. We call this setting postselected communication and the ensuing highest achievable rates the postselected capacities. Here, we provide a precise single-letter characterisation of postselected capacities in the setting of entanglement assistance as well as the more general nonsignalling assistance, establishing that they are both equal to the channel's projective mutual information -- a variant of mutual information based on the Hilbert projective metric. We do so by establishing bounds on the one-shot postselected capacities, with a lower bound that makes use of a postselected teleportation-based protocol and an upper bound in terms of the postselected hypothesis testing relative entropy. As such, we obtain fundamental limits on a channel's ability to communicate even when this strong resource of postselection is allowed, implying limitations on communication even when the receiver has access to postselected closed timelike curves.</description>

      <title>Efficient Classical Shadow Tomography through Many-body Localization Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.01258v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Classical shadow tomography serves as a potent tool for extracting numerous properties from quantum many-body systems with minimal measurements. Nevertheless, prevailing methods yielding optimal performance for few-body operators necessitate the application of random two-qubit gates, a task that can prove challenging on specific quantum simulators such as ultracold atomic gases. In this work, we introduce an alternative approach founded on the dynamics of many-body localization, a phenomenon extensively demonstrated in optical lattices. Through an exploration of the shadow norm -- both analytically, employing a phenomenological model, and numerically, utilizing the TEBD algorithm -- we demonstrate that our scheme achieves remarkable efficiency comparable to shallow circuits or measurement-induced criticality, resulting in a significant improvement in the exponential exponent compared to the previous classical shadow protocol. Our findings are corroborated through direct numerical simulations encompassing the entire sampling and reconstruction processes. Consequently, our results present a compelling methodology for analyzing the output states of quantum simulators.</description>

Abstract: A leading approach to implementing small-scale quantum computers has been to use laser beams, focused to micron spot sizes, to address and entangle trapped ions in a linear crystal. Here we propose a method to implement individually-addressed entangling gate interactions, but driven by microwave fields, with a spatial-resolution of a few microns, corresponding to $10^{-5}$ microwave wavelengths. We experimentally demonstrate the ability to suppress the effect of the state-dependent force using a single ion, and find the required interaction introduces $3.7(4)\times 10^{-4}$ error per emulated gate in a single-qubit benchmarking sequence. We model the scheme for a 17-qubit ion crystal, and find that any pair of ions should be addressable with an average crosstalk error of $\sim 10^{-5}$.</description>

      <title>Hybrid quantum-classical computation for automatic guided vehicles scheduling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.03088v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by recent efforts to develop quantum computing for practical, industrial-scale challenges, we demonstrate the effectiveness of state-of-the-art hybrid (not necessarily quantum) solvers in addressing the business-centric optimization problem of scheduling Automatic Guided Vehicles (AGVs). Some solvers can already leverage noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. In our study, we utilize D-Wave hybrid solvers that implement classical heuristics with potential assistance from a quantum processing unit. This hybrid methodology performs comparably to existing classical solvers. However, due to the proprietary nature of the software, the precise contribution of quantum computation remains unclear. Our analysis focuses on a practical, business-oriented scenario: scheduling AGVs within a factory constrained by limited space, simulating a realistic production setting. Our approach maps a realistic AGVs problem onto one reminiscent of railway scheduling and demonstrates that the AGVs problem is better suited to quantum computing than its railway counterpart, the latter being denser in terms of the average number of constraints per variable. The main idea here is to highlight the potential usefulness of a hybrid approach for handling AGVs scheduling problems of practical sizes. We show that a scenario involving up to 21 AGVs, significant due to possible deadlocks, can be efficiently addressed by a hybrid solver in seconds.</description>

Abstract: Uncertainty relations are a fundamental feature of quantum mechanics. How can these relations be found systematically? Here we develop a semidefinite programming hierarchy for additive uncertainty relations in the variances of non-commuting observables. Our hierarchy is built on the state polynomial optimization framework, also known as scalar extension. The hierarchy is complete, in the sense that it converges to tight uncertainty relations. We improve upon upper bounds for all 1292 additive uncertainty relations on up to nine operators for which a tight bound is not known. The bounds are dimension-free and depend entirely on the algebraic relations among the operators. The techniques apply to a range of scenarios, including Pauli, Heisenberg-Weyl, and fermionic operators, and generalize to higher order moments and multiplicative uncertainty relations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.00309v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A systematic analysis of the advantages and challenges associated with the satellite-based implementation of the high dimensional extended B92 (HD-Ext-B92) and high-dimensional BB84 (HD-BB84) protocol is analyzed. The method used earlier for obtaining the key rate for the HD-Ext-B92 is modified here and subsequently the variations of the key rate, probability distribution of key rate (PDR), and quantum bit error rate (QBER) with respect to dimension and noise parameter of a depolarizing channel is studied using the modified key rate equation. Further, the variations of average key rate (per pulse) with zenith angle and link length in different weather conditions in day and night considering extremely low noise for dimension d=32 are investigated using elliptic beam approximation. The effectiveness of the HD-(extended) protocols used here in creating satellite-based quantum key distribution links (both up-link and down-link) is established by appropriately modeling the atmosphere and analyzing the variation of average key rates with the probability distribution of the transmittance (PDT). The analysis performed here has revealed that in higher dimensions, HD-BB84 outperforms HD-Ext-B92 in terms of both key rate and noise tolerance. However, HD-BB84 experiences a more pronounced saturation of QBER in high dimensions.</description>

Abstract: The ability to engineer entangled states that involve macroscopic objects is of particular importance for a wide variety of quantum-enabled technologies, ranging from quantum information processing to quantum sensing. Here we propose how to achieve coherent manipulation and enhancement of quantum entanglement in a hybrid optomechanical system, which consists of a Fabry-P\'{e}rot cavity with two movable mirrors, an optical parametric amplifier (OPA), and an injected squeezed vacuum reservoir. We show that the advantages of this system are twofold: (i) one can effectively regulate the light-mirror interactions by introducing a squeezed intracavity mode via the OPA; (ii) when properly matching the squeezing parameters between the squeezed cavity mode and the injected squeezed vacuum reservoir, the optical input noises can be suppressed completely. These peculiar features of this system allow us to generate and manipulate quantum entanglement in a coherent and controllable way. More importantly, we also find that such controllable entanglement, under some specific squeezing parameters, can be considerably enhanced in comparison with those of the conventional optomechanical system. Our work, providing a promising method to regulate and tailor the light-mirror interaction, are poised to serve as a useful tool for engineering various quantum effects which are based on cavity optomechanics.</description>

Abstract: Portfolio optimization is a primary component of the decision-making process in finance, aiming to tactfully allocate assets to achieve optimal returns while considering various constraints. Herein, we proposed a method that uses the knapsack-based portfolio optimization problem and incorporates the quantum computing capabilities of the quantum walk mixer with the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) to address the challenges presented by the NP-hard problem. Additionally, we present the sequential procedure of our suggested approach and demonstrate empirical proof to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in finding the optimal asset allocations across various constraints and asset choices. Moreover, we discuss the effectiveness of the QAOA components in relation to our proposed method. Consequently, our study successfully achieves the approximate ratio of the portfolio optimization technique using a circuit layer of p &gt;= 3, compared to the classical best-known solution of the knapsack problem. Our proposed methods potentially contribute to the growing field of quantum finance by offering insights into the potential benefits of employing quantum algorithms for complex optimization tasks in financial portfolio management.</description>

      <title>The noisy Landau-Streater(Werner-Holevo) channel in arbitrary dimensions</title>

Abstract: Two important classes of quantum channels, namly the Werner-Holevo and the Landau-Streater channels are known to be related only in three dimensions, i.e. when acting on qutrits. In this work, definition of the Landau-Streater channel is extended in such a way which retains its equivalence to the Werner-Holevo channel in all dimensions. This channel is then modified to be representable as a model of noise acting on qudits. We then investigate propeties of the resulting noisy channel and determine the conditions under which it cannot be the result of a Markovian evolution. Furthermore, we investigate its different capacities for transmitting classical and quantum information with or without entanglement. In particular, while the pure (or high noise) Landau-Streater or the Werner-Holevo channel is entanglement breaking and hence has zero capacity, by finding a lower bound for the quantum capacity, we show that when the level of noise is lower than a critical value the quantum capacity will be non-zero. Surprizingly this value turns out to be approximately equal to $0.4$ in all dimensions. Finally we show that, in even dimension, this channel has a decomposition in terms of unitary operations. This is in contrast with the three dimensional case where it has been proved that such a decomposition is impossible, even in terms of other quantum maps.</description>

      <title>Optimality and Noise-Resilience of Critical Quantum Sensing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15559v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compare critical quantum sensing to passive quantum strategies to perform frequency estimation, in the case of single-mode quadratic Hamiltonians. We show that, while in the unitary case both strategies achieve precision scaling quadratic with the number of photons, in the presence of dissipation this is true only for critical strategies. We also establish that working at the exceptional point or beyond threshold provides sub-optimal performance. This critical enhancement is due to the emergence of a transient regime in the open critical dynamics, and is invariant to temperature changes. When considering both time and system size as resources, for both strategies the precision scales linearly with the product of the total time and the number of photons, in accordance with fundamental bounds. However, we show that critical protocols outperform optimal passive strategies if preparation and measurement times are not negligible. Our results are applicable to a broad variety of critical sensors whose phenomenology can be reduced to that of a single-mode quadratic Hamiltonian, including systems described by finite-component and fully-connected models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16841v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The simultaneous treatment of static and dynamical correlations in strongly-correlated electron systems is a critical challenge. In particular, finding a universal scheme for identifying a single-particle orbital basis that minimizes the representational complexity of the many-body wavefunction is a formidable and longstanding problem. As a substantial contribution towards its solution, we show that the total orbital correlation actually reveals and quantifies the intrinsic complexity of the wavefunction,once it is minimized via orbital rotations. To demonstrate the power of this concept in practice, an iterative scheme is proposed to optimize the orbitals by minimizing the total orbital correlation calculated by the tailored coupled cluster singles and doubles (TCCSD) ansatz. The optimized orbitals enable the limited TCCSD ansatz to capture more non-trivial information of the many-body wavefunction, indicated by the improved wavefunction and energy. An initial application of this scheme shows great improvement of TCCSD in predicting the singlet ground state potential energy curves of the strongly correlated C$_{\rm 2}$ and Cr$_{\rm 2}$ molecule.</description>

      <title>Non-reciprocal dynamics and the non-Hermitian skin effect of repulsively bound pairs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10449v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of a Bose-Hubbard model coupled to an engineered environment which in the non-interacting limit is described by the celebrated Hatano-Nelson model. At strong interactions, two bosons occupying the same site form a so-called repulsively bound pair, or doublon. Using tensor-network simulations, we clearly identify a distinct doublon lightcone and show that the doublon inherits non-reciprocity from that of single particles. Applying the idea of reservoir engineering at the level of doublons, we introduce a new set of dissipators and we analytically show that then the doublon dynamics are governed by the Hatano-Nelson model. This brings about an interaction-induced non-Hermitian skin effect and non-reciprocal doublon motion. Combining features of the two models we study, we show that single particles and doublons can be made to spread with opposite directionality, opening intriguing possibilities for the study of dynamics in interacting non-reciprocal models.</description>

Abstract: Single-photon emitters integrated in optical micro-cavities are key elements in quantum communication applications. However, optimizing their emission properties and achieving efficient cavity coupling remain significant challenges. In this study, we investigate semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) emitting in the telecom O-band and integrate them in an open fiber-cavity. Such cavities offer spatial and spectral tunability and intrinsic fiber-coupling. The design promises high collection efficiency and enables the investigation of multiple emitters in heterogeneous samples. We observe a reduction of the decay times of several individual emitters by up to a factor of $2.46(2)$ due to the Purcell effect. We comprehensively analyze the current limitations of the system, including cavity and emitter properties, the impact of the observed regime where cavity and emitter linewidths are comparable, as well as the mechanical fluctuations of the cavity length. The results elucidate the path towards efficient telecom quantum light sources.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19748v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This note derives the stochastic differential equations and partial differential equation of general hybrid quantum--classical dynamics from the theory of continuous measurement and general (non-Markovian) feedback. The advantage of this approach is an explicit parameterization, without additional positivity constraints. The construction also neatly separates the different effects: how the quantum influences the classical and how the classical influences the quantum. This modular presentation gives a better intuition of what to expect from hybrid dynamics, especially when used to construct possibly fundamental theories.</description>

Abstract: The construction of time of arrival (TOA) operators canonically conjugate to the system Hamiltonian entails finding the solution of a specific second-order partial differential equation called the time kernel equation (TKE). In this paper, we provide an exact analytic solution of the TKE for a special class of potentials satisfying a specific separability condition. The solution enables us to investigate the time evolution of the eigenfunctions of the conjugacy-preserving TOA operators (CPTOA) and show that they exhibit unitary arrival at the intended arrival point at a time equal to their corresponding eigenvalues. We also compare the dynamics between the TOA operators constructed by quantization and those independent of quantization for specific interaction potentials. We find that the CPTOA operator possesses smoother and sharper unitary dynamics over the Weyl-quantized one within numerical accuracy.</description>

Abstract: According to the subjective Bayesian interpretation of quantum theory (QBism), quantum mechanics is a tool that an agent would be wise to use when making bets about natural phenomena. In particular, the Born rule is understood to be a decision-making norm, an ideal which one should strive to meet even if usually falling short in practice. What is required for an agent to make decisions that conform to quantum mechanics? Here we investigate how a realistic (hence non-ideal) agent might deviate from the Born rule in its decisions. To do so we simulate a simple agent as a reinforcement-learning algorithm that makes `bets' on the outputs of a symmetric informationally-complete measurement (SIC) and adjusts its decisions in order to maximize its expected return. We quantify how far the algorithm's decision-making behavior departs from the ideal form of the Born rule and investigate the limiting factors. We propose an experimental implementation of the scenario using heralded single photons.</description>

      <title>Continuous-variable quantum kernel method on a programmable photonic quantum processor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01086v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Among various quantum machine learning (QML) algorithms, the quantum kernel method has especially attracted attention due to its compatibility with noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices and its potential to achieve quantum advantage. This method performs classification and regression by nonlinearly mapping data into quantum states in a higher dimensional Hilbert space. Thus far, the quantum kernel method has been implemented only on qubit-based systems, but continuous-variable (CV) systems can potentially offer superior computational power by utilizing its infinite-dimensional Hilbert space. Here, we demonstrate the implementation of the classification task with the CV quantum kernel method on a programmable photonic quantum processor. We experimentally prove that the CV quantum kernel method successfully classifies several datasets robustly even under the experimental imperfections, with high accuracies comparable to the classical kernel. This demonstration sheds light on the utility of CV quantum systems for QML and should stimulate further study in other CV QML algorithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01946v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new technique for efficiently transitioning a quantum system from an initial to a final stationary state in less time than is required by an adiabatic (quasi-static) process. Our approach makes use of Nelson's stochastic quantization, which represents the quantum system as a classical Brownian process. Thanks to this mathematical analogy, known protocols for classical overdamped systems can be translated into quantum protocols. In particular, one can use classical methods to find optimal quantum protocols that minimize both the time duration and some other cost function to be freely specified. We have applied this method to the time-dependent harmonic oscillator and tested it on two different cost functions: (i) the cumulative energy of the system over time and (ii) the dynamical phase of the wavefunction. In the latter case, it is possible to construct protocols that are "adiabatically optimal", i.e., they minimize their distance from an adiabatic process for a given duration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20889v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum Optimal Control (QOC) supports the advance of quantum technologies by tackling its problems at the pulse level: Numerical approaches iteratively work towards a given target by parametrising the applied time-dependent fields with a finite set of variables. The effectiveness of the resulting optimisation depends on the complexity of the problem and the number of variables. We consider different parametrisations in terms of basis functions, asking whether the choice of the applied basis affects the quality of the optimisation. Furthermore, we consider strategies to choose the most suitable basis. For the comparison, we test three different randomisable bases - introducing the sinc and sigmoid bases as alternatives to the Fourier basis - on QOC problems of varying complexity. For each problem, the basis-specific convergence rates result in a unique ranking. Especially for expensive evaluations, e.g., in closed-loop, a potential speed-up by a factor of up to 10 may be crucial for the optimisation's feasibility. We conclude that a problem-dependent basis choice is an influential factor for QOC efficiency and provide advice for its approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02666v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum error correction protects logical quantum information against environmental decoherence by encoding logical qubits into entangled states of physical qubits. One of the most important near-term challenges in building a scalable quantum computer is to reach the break-even point, where logical quantum circuits on error-corrected qubits achieve higher fidelity than equivalent circuits on uncorrected physical qubits. Using Quantinuum's H2 trapped-ion quantum processor, we encode the GHZ state in four logical qubits with fidelity $ 99.5 \pm 0.15 \% \le F \le 99.7 \pm 0.1\% $ (after postselecting on over 98% of outcomes). Using the same quantum processor, we can prepare an uncorrected GHZ state on four physical qubits with fidelity $97.8 \pm 0.2 \% \le F\le 98.7\pm 0.2\%$. The logical qubits are encoded in a $[\![ 25,4,3 ]\!]$ Tanner-transformed long-range-enhanced surface code. Logical entangling gates are implemented using simple swap operations. Our results are a first step towards realizing fault-tolerant quantum computation with logical qubits encoded in geometrically nonlocal quantum low-density parity check codes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14989v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Adiabatic preparation of a critical ground state is hampered by the closing of its energy gap as the system size increases. However, this gap is directly relevant only for a uniform ramp, where a control parameter in the Hamiltonian is tuned uniformly in space towards the quantum critical point. Here, we consider inhomogeneous ramps in two dimensions: initially, the parameter is made critical at the center of a lattice, from where the critical region expands at a fixed velocity. In the 1D and 2D quantum Ising models, which have a well-defined speed of sound at the critical point, the ramp becomes adiabatic with a subsonic velocity. This subsonic ramp can prepare the critical state faster than a uniform one. Moreover, in both a model of $p$-wave paired 2D fermions and the Kitaev model, the critical dispersion is anisotropic -- linear with a nonzero velocity in one direction and quadratic in the other -- but the gap is still inversely proportional to the linear size of the critical region, with a coefficient proportional to the nonzero velocity. This suffices to make the inhomogeneous ramp adiabatic below a finite crossover velocity and superior to the homogeneous one.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10381v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum computing with discrete variable (DV, qubit) hardware is approaching the large scales necessary for computations beyond the reach of classical computers. However, important use cases such as quantum simulations of physical models containing bosonic modes, and quantum error correction are challenging for DV-only systems. Separately, hardware containing native continuous-variable (CV, oscillator) systems has received attention as an alternative approach, yet the universal control of such systems is non-trivial. In this work, we show that hybrid CV-DV hardware offers a great advantage in meeting these challenges, offering a powerful computational paradigm that inherits the strengths of both DV and CV processors. We provide a pedagogical introduction to CV-DV systems and the multiple abstraction layers needed to produce a full software stack connecting applications to hardware. We present a variety of new hybrid CV-DV compilation techniques, algorithms, and applications, including the extension of quantum signal processing concepts to CV-DV systems and strategies to simulate systems of interacting spins, fermions, and bosons. To facilitate the development of hybrid CV-DV processor systems, we introduce formal Abstract Machine Models and Instruction Set Architectures -- essential abstractions that enable developers to formulate applications, compile algorithms, and explore the potential of current and future hardware for realizing fault-tolerant circuits, modules, and processors. Hybrid CV-DV quantum computations are beginning to be performed in superconducting, trapped ion, and neutral atom platforms, and large-scale experiments are set to be demonstrated in the near future. We present a timely and comprehensive guide to this relatively unexplored yet promising approach to quantum computation and providing an architectural backbone to guide future development.</description>

Abstract: Quantum Fourier transformations are an essential component of many quantum algorithms, from prime factoring to quantum simulation. While the standard abelian QFT is well-studied, important variants corresponding to \emph{nonabelian} groups of interest have seen less development. In particular, fast nonabelian Fourier transformations are important components for both quantum simulations of field theories as well as approaches to the nonabelian hidden subgroup problem. In this work, we present fast quantum Fourier transformations for a number of nonabelian groups of interest for high energy physics, $\mathbb{BT}$, $\mathbb{BO}$, $\Delta(27)$, $\Delta(54)$, and $\Sigma(36\times3)$. For each group, we derive explicit quantum circuits and estimate resource scaling for fault-tolerant implementations. Our work shows that the development of a fast Fourier transformation can substantively reduce simulation costs by up to three orders of magnitude for the finite groups that we have investigated.</description>

      <title>Gibbs Sampling gives Quantum Advantage at Constant Temperatures with $O(1)$-Local Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01516v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sampling from Gibbs states $\unicode{x2013}$ states corresponding to system in thermal equilibrium $\unicode{x2013}$ has recently been shown to be a task for which quantum computers are expected to achieve super-polynomial speed-up compared to classical computers, provided the locality of the Hamiltonian increases with the system size (Bergamaschi et al., arXiv: 2404.14639). We extend these results to show that this quantum advantage still occurs for Gibbs states of Hamiltonians with O(1)-local interactions at constant temperature by showing classical hardness-of-sampling and demonstrating such Gibbs states can be prepared efficiently using a quantum computer. In particular, we show hardness-of-sampling is maintained even for 5-local Hamiltonians on a 3D lattice. We additionally show that the hardness-of-sampling is robust when we are only able to make imperfect measurements. Beyond these hardness results, we present a lower bound on the temperatures that Gibbs states become easy to sample from classically in terms of the maximum degree of the Hamiltonian's interaction graph.</description>

      <title>Something from Nothing: Enhanced Laser Cooling of a Mechanical Resonator via Zero-Photon Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01734v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Throughout quantum science and technology, measurement is used as a powerful resource for nonlinear operations and quantum state engineering. In particular, single-photon detection is commonly employed for quantum-information applications and tests of fundamental physics. By contrast, and perhaps counter-intuitively, measurement of the absence of photons also provides useful information, and offers significant potential for a wide range of new experimental directions. Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate cooling of a mechanical resonator below its laser-cooled mechanical occupation via zero-photon detection on the anti-Stokes scattered optical field and verify this cooling through heterodyne measurements. Our measurements are well captured by a stochastic master equation and the techniques introduced here open new avenues for cooling, quantum thermodynamics, quantum state engineering, and quantum measurement and control.</description>

      <title>Something from Nothing: A Theoretical Framework for Enhancing or Enabling Cooling of a Mechanical Resonator via the anti-Stokes or Stokes Interaction and Zero-Photon Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01735v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a theoretical framework to describe how zero-photon detection may be utilized to enhance laser cooling via the anti-Stokes interaction and, somewhat surprisingly, enable cooling via the Stokes interaction commonly associated with heating. Our description includes both pulsed and continuous measurements as well as optical detection efficiency and open-system dynamics. For both cases, we discuss how the cooling depends on the system parameters such as detection efficiency and optomechanical cooperativity, and we study the continuous-measurement-induced dynamics, contrasting to single-photon detection events. For the Stokes case, we explore the interplay between cooling and heating via optomechanical parametric amplification, and we find the efficiency required to cool a mechanical oscillator via zero-photon detection. This work serves as a companion article to the recent experiment [E. A. Cryer-Jenkins, K. D. Major, et al., arXiv:2408.01734 (2024)], which demonstrated enhanced laser cooling of a mechanical oscillator via zero-photon detection on the anti-Stokes signal. The framework developed here provides new approaches for cooling mechanical resonators that can be applied to a wide range of areas including nonclassical state preparation, quantum thermodynamics, and avoiding the often unwanted heating effects of parametric amplification.</description>

      <title>Dirac and Weyl Fermions -- the Only Causal Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.06556</link>
      <description>arXiv:1711.06556v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Causal systems describe the localizability of relativistic quantum systems complying with the principles of special relativity and elementary causality. At their classification we restrict ourselves to real mass and finite spinor systems. It follows that (up to certain not yet discarded unitarily related systems) the only irreducible causal systems are the Dirac and the Weyl fermions. Their wave-equations are established as a mere consequence of causal localization. - The bounded localized Dirac and Weyl wavefunctions are studied in detail. One finds that, at the speed of light, the carriers shrink in the past and expand in the future. For every direction in space there is a definite time at which the change from shrinking to expanding occurs. A late changing time characterizes those states, which shrink to a delta-strip if boosted in the opposite direction. Using a density result for these late-change states one shows that all Dirac and Weyl wave-functions are subjected to Lorentz contraction. The latter is discussed in some detail. - We tackle the question whether a causal system induces a representation of a causal logic and thus provides a localization in proper space-time regions rather than on spacelike hyperplanes. The causal logic generated by the spacelike relation is shown to do not admit representations at all. But the logic generated by the non-timelike relation in general does, and the necessary condition is derived that there is a projection valued measure on every non-timelike non-spacelike hyperplane being the high boost limit of the localization on the spacelike hyperplanes. Dirac and Weyl systems are shown to satisfy this condition and thus to extend to all non-timelike hyperplanes, which implies more profound properties of the causal systems. The bounded localized eigenstates of the projections to non-spacelike flat strips are late-change states.</description>

      <title>Defect groups of class $\mathcal{S}$ theories from the Coulomb branch</title>

Abstract: We study the global forms of class $\mathcal{S}[A_{N-1}]$ 4d $\mathcal{N} = 2$ theories by deriving their defect groups (charges of line operators up to screening by local operators) from Coulomb branch data. Specifically, we employ an explicit construction of the BPS quiver for the case of full regular punctures to show that the defect group is $(\mathbb{Z}_N)^{2g}$, where $g$ is the genus of the associated Riemann surface. This determines a sector of surface operators in the 5d symmetry TFT. We show how these can also be identified from dimensional reduction of M-theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.03179v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Large Hadron Collider's high luminosity era presents major computational challenges in the analysis of collision events. Large amounts of Monte Carlo (MC) simulation will be required to constrain the statistical uncertainties of the simulated datasets below these of the experimental data. Modelling of high-energy particles propagating through the calorimeter section of the detector is the most computationally intensive MC simulation task. We introduce a technique combining recent advancements in generative models and quantum annealing for fast and efficient simulation of high-energy particle-calorimeter interactions.</description>

      <title>Hong-Ou-Mandel Comb and Switch using parallel chains of non-identical Micro-Ring Resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14491v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Micro-Ring Resonators (MRRs) allow us to access the Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) effect at a variety of tunable parameter combinations along exact analytic solutions. This higher-dimensional space of parameters for which the HOM effect occurs constitutes what is known as a Hong-Ou-Mandel manifold (HOMM). Using a parallel series of non-identical MRRs and changing relative round-trip phase shifts between MRRs allows for the manipulation of the wavelength locations of the HOM effect. Through clever design and fabrication, we can mold the HOMM to place the HOM effect, or lack thereof, precisely at desired locations. In this paper we discuss how to adjust non-identical MRR parameters to change the resulting HOMM. We also promote example designs that exhibit advantageous HOMM structures, and highlight some of the myriad of possibilities that can be accessed with different circuit design. Finally, we show a wavelength division multiplexer example that matches the HOM effect locations with the already established channels to integrate with a classical communication network.</description>

      <title>ResQuNNs:Towards Enabling Deep Learning in Quantum Convolution Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09146v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel framework for enhancing the performance of Quanvolutional Neural Networks (QuNNs) by introducing trainable quanvolutional layers and addressing the critical challenges associated with them. Traditional quanvolutional layers, although beneficial for feature extraction, have largely been static, offering limited adaptability. Unlike state-of-the-art, our research overcomes this limitation by enabling training within these layers, significantly increasing the flexibility and potential of QuNNs. However, the introduction of multiple trainable quanvolutional layers induces complexities in gradient-based optimization, primarily due to the difficulty in accessing gradients across these layers. To resolve this, we propose a novel architecture, Residual Quanvolutional Neural Networks (ResQuNNs), leveraging the concept of residual learning, which facilitates the flow of gradients by adding skip connections between layers. By inserting residual blocks between quanvolutional layers, we ensure enhanced gradient access throughout the network, leading to improved training performance. Moreover, we provide empirical evidence on the strategic placement of these residual blocks within QuNNs. Through extensive experimentation, we identify an efficient configuration of residual blocks, which enables gradients across all the layers in the network that eventually results in efficient training. Our findings suggest that the precise location of residual blocks plays a crucial role in maximizing the performance gains in QuNNs. Our results mark a substantial step forward in the evolution of quantum deep learning, offering new avenues for both theoretical development and practical quantum computing applications.</description>

      <title>Edge states in all-dielectric square-lattice arrays of bianisotropic microwave resonators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15246v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that a bianisotropic response associated with a broken mirror symmetry of a dielectric resonator allows opening the bandgap in simple square lattice arrays of such resonators. Realizing the proposed system as an array of high-index ceramic resonators working at GHz frequencies, we numerically and experimentally demonstrate the presence of edge states at the interface between two domains with opposite orientations of the bianisotropic resonators as well as at the boundary between a single domain and free space. For both cases, we characterize the dispersion of edge states, examine their propagation along sharp bends, their resilience towards various types of geometrical defects, and a spin-momentum locked unidirectional propagation in the case of circularly polarized excitation. The considered design opens novel possibilities in constructing optical and microwave structures simultaneously featuring edge states at the interfaces between distinct resonator domains or a resonator domain and free space.</description>

      <title>Phase Diagram of the Schwinger Model by Adiabatic Preparation of States on a Quantum Simulator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09224v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We argue the feasibility to study the phase structure of a quantum physical system on quantum devices via adiabatic preparation of states. We introduce a novel method and successfully test it in application to the Schwinger model in the presence of a topological $\theta$-term. We explore the first-order-phase-transition and the no-transition regions of the corresponding phase diagram. The core idea of the method is to separately evolve the ground and the first excited states with a time-dependent Hamiltonian, the time-dependence of which interpolates between different values of $\theta$. Despite our approach being a direct application of the adiabatic theorem, in some cases we are able to demonstrate its advantages in comparison to a different method from the literature that also employs adiabatic state preparation.</description>

      <title>Spin entanglement in two-proton emission from $^6$Be</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11136v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a theoretical evaluation of coupled-spin entanglement in the two-proton ($2p$) radioactive emission. The three-body model of $^{6}$Be with the proton-proton interaction, which is adjusted to reproduce the experimental energy release, is utilized. Time-dependent calculation is performed to compute the coupled-spin state of the emitted two protons. The spin-correlation function $S$ as the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) indicator is evaluated as $\abs{S} \cong 2.65$. Namely, the $2p$-spin entanglement beyond the limit of local-hidden-variable (LHV) theory is suggested. This entanglement is sensitive to the proton-proton interaction. The short-lived (broad-width) $2p$~state has the weaker spin entanglement. In parallel, the core-proton interactions do not harm this entanglement during the time-dependent decaying process. The CHSH measurement can be a novel probe into the effective nuclear interaction inside finite systems.</description>

      <title>Relevance of Anisotropy in the Kondo Effect -- Lessons From the Symplectic Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12093v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A Kondo model with symplectic symmetry was recently put forward as the effective low-energy theory of a superconducting-island device coupled to multiple leads. This model, which possesses non-Fermi liquid physics and effective anyons, was argued to belong to the class of topological Kondo effects. Here, we clarify the extent of stability of its exotic fixed point using perturbative and numerical renormalization group in conjunction with bosonization and conformal field theory. In contrast to previous claims, we show that asymmetry in the coupling to the leads destabilizes the non-Fermi liquid. Other destabilizing perturbations include asymmetry in the superconducting pairing or internal energy of the individual quantum dots in the island. Nevertheless, these perturbations all generate the same relevant operators. Thus, only a small number of couplings need to be tuned individually, and these can be selected according to experimental convenience. Our results highlight a common misconception that anisotropy in the Kondo coupling is always irrelevant. As demonstrated, relevant terms will emerge whenever the group generators do not span the full space of impurity operators. This calls for a more detailed inspection of models that exhibit this property, such as large-spin impurities and SO(M) Kondo models</description>
