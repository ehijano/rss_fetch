      <title>Fractals in rate-induced tipping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When parameters of a dynamical system change sufficiently fast, critical transitions can take place even in the absence of bifurcations. This phenomenon is known as rate-induced tipping and has been reported in a variety of systems, from simple ordinary differential equations and maps to mathematical models in climate sciences and ecology. In most examples, the transition happens at a critical rate of parameter change, a rate-induced tipping point, and is associated with a simple unstable orbit (edge state). In this work, we show how this simple picture changes when non-attracting fractal sets exist in the autonomous system, a ubiquitous situation in non-linear dynamics. We show that these fractals in phase space induce fractals in parameter space, which control the rates and parameter changes that result in tipping. We explain how such rate-induced fractals appear and how the fractal dimensions of the different sets are related to each other. We illustrate our general theory in three paradigmatic systems: a piecewise linear one-dimensional map, the two-dimensional H\'enon map, and a forced pendulum.</description>

      <title>The effect of timescale separation on the tipping window for chaotically forced systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12530v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tipping behavior can occur when an equilibrium of a dynamical system loses stability in response to a slowly varying parameter crossing a bifurcation threshold, or where noise drives a system from one attractor to another, or some combination of these effects. Similar behavior can be expected when a multistable system is forced by a chaotic deterministic system rather than by noise. In this context, the chaotic tipping window was recently introduced and investigated for discrete-time dynamics. In this paper, we find tipping windows for continuous-time nonlinear systems forced by chaos. We characterize the tipping window in terms of forcing by unstable periodic orbits of the chaos, and we show how the location and structure of this window depend on the relative timescales between the forcing and the responding system. We illustrate this by finding tipping windows for two examples of coupled bistable ODEs forced with chaos. Additionally, we describe the dynamic tipping window in the setting of a changing system parameter.</description>
