      <title>Inverse Faraday effect in 3d, 4d, and 5d transition metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using first-principles calculations, we systematically investigate the spin contributions to the inverse Faraday effect (IFE) in transition metals. The IFE is primarily driven by spin-orbit coupling (SOC)-induced asymmetry between excited electron and hole spin moments. Our results reveal that even elements with smaller electron magnetic moments, like Os, can exhibit higher IFE due to greater electron-hole asymmetry. Pt shows the highest IFE in the 1 - 2 eV frequency range, while Os dominates in the 2 - 4 eV range. In addition, we demonstrate that the IFE of neighboring elements with similar crystal structures (e.g., Ir, Pt, and Au) can be tuned by adjusting their Fermi levels, indicating the importance of d electron filling on IFE. Finally, we find that the trend in electron (or hole) contributions to the IFE closely follows that of the spin Hall conductivity (SHC), however, the total IFE involves more complex interactions.</description>

      <title>Magnetoelastic Interactions Reduce Hysteresis in Soft Magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The width of the magnetic hysteresis loop is often correlated with the material's magnetocrystalline anisotropy constant $\kappa_1$. Traditionally, a common approach to reduce the hysteresis width has been to develop alloys with $\kappa_1$ as close to zero as possible. However, contrary to this widely accepted view, we present evidence that magnetoelastic interactions governed by magnetostriction constants, elastic stiffness, and applied stresses play an important role in reducing magnetic hysteresis width, despite large $\kappa_1$ values. We use a nonlinear micromagnetics framework to systematically investigate the interplay between material constants $\lambda_{100}$, $c_{11}$, $c_{12}$, $\kappa_1$, applied or residual stresses $\sigma_{\mathrm{R}}$, and needle domains to collectively lower the energy barrier for magnetization reversal. A distinguishing feature of our work is that we correlate the energy barrier governing the growth of needle domains with the width of the hysteresis loop. This energy barrier approach enables us to capture the nuanced interplay between anisotropy constant, magnetostriction, and applied stresses, and their combined influence on magnetic hysteresis. We propose a mathematical relationship on the coercivity map: $\kappa_1 = \alpha(c_{11}-c_{12})(\lambda_{100}+\beta\sigma_{11})^2$ for which magnetic hysteresis can be minimized for a uniaxial residual stress $\sigma_\mathrm{R} = \sigma_{11}\hat{\mathbf{e}}_1\otimes\hat{\mathbf{e}}_1$ (and for some constants $\alpha$, $\beta$). These results serve as quantitative guidelines to design magnetic alloys with small hysteresis, and potentially guide the discovery of a new generation of soft magnets located beyond the $\kappa_1 \to 0$ region.</description>

      <title>Nonradiative quenching of EPR signals in germanium-doped AlGaN: evidence for DX-center formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present photo-electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurements and first-principles calculations that indicate germanium (Ge) is a DX-center in AlGaN. Our photo-EPR measurements on Ge-doped AlGaN samples show no EPR spectra in the dark, while persistent EPR spectra is observed upon photoexcitation with photon energies greater than ~1.3 eV. Thermally annealing the samples decreased the EPR signal, with the critical temperature to quench the EPR signal being larger in the lower Al-content sample. Using detailed first-principles calculations of Ge in AlGaN, we show all of these observations can be explained by accounting for the DX configuration of Ge in AlGaN.</description>

      <title>Comparison of Kikuchi Diffraction Geometries in Scanning Electron Microscope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in scanning electron microscope (SEM) based Kikuchi diffraction have demonstrated the important potential for reflection and transmission methods, like transmission Kikuchi diffraction (TKD) and electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD). Furthermore, with the advent of compact direct electron detectors (DED) it has been possible to place the detector in a variety of configurations within the SEM chamber. This motivates the present work where we explore the similarities and differences of the different geometries that include on-axis TKD &amp; off-axis TKD using electron transparent samples, as well as more conventional EBSD. Furthermore, we compare these with the newest method called "reflection Kikuchi diffraction" RKD where the sample is placed flat in the chamber and the detector is placed below the pole piece. Through remapping collected diffraction patterns, all these methods can be used to generate an experimental "diffraction sphere" that can be used to explore diffraction from any scattering vector from the unit cell, as well as the ability to perform band profile analysis. This diffraction sphere approach enables us to further probe specific differences between the methods, including for example thickness effects in TKD that can result in the generation of diffraction spots, as well as electron scattering path length effects that result in excess and deficiency variations, as well as inversion of bands in experimental patterns.</description>

      <title>Stacking-dependent ferroicity of reversed bilayer: altermagnetism or ferroelectricity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnetism, as a new branch of magnetism independent of traditional ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism, has attracted extensive attention recently. At present, researchers have proved several kinds of three-dimensional altermagnets, but research on two-dimensional (2D) altermagnets remains elusive. Here, we propose a method for designing altermagnetism in 2D lattices: bilayer reversed stacking. This method could enable altermagnetism-type spin splitting to occur intrinsically and the spin-splitting can be controlled by crystal chirality. We also demonstrate it through a real material of bilayer PtBr$_3$ with AB' stacking order. Additionally, the combination of stacking order and slidetronics offers new opportunities for electrical writing and magnetic reading of electronic devices. In the case of AC' stacking, interlayer sliding results in reversible spontaneous polarization. This unique combination of antiferromagnetism and sliding ferroelectricity leads to polarization-controlled spin-splitting, thus enabling magnetoelectric coupling, which can be detected by magneto-optical Kerr effect even without net magnetization. Our research highlights that reversed stacking provides a platform to explore rich physical properties of magnetism, ferroelectricity, and spin-splitting.</description>

      <title>Electronic and optical properties of computationally predicted Na-K-Sb crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thanks to their favorable electronic and optical properties, sodium-potassium-antimonides are an emerging class of crystals used as photocathodes in particle accelerators. The persisting challenges related to the synthesis and characterization of these materials demand support from theory and make the study of computationally predicted polymorphs particularly relevant to identifying the structure and composition of the samples. Using first-principles methods based on density-functional theory and many-body perturbation theory, the electronic and optical properties of cubic NaK$_{2}$Sb and hexagonal Na$_{2}$KSb are studied. Both systems, most commonly found in the hexagonal and cubic phase, respectively, exhibit an indirect fundamental gap that is energetically very close to the direct band gap at $\Gamma$ of magnitude 0.81 eV for NaK$_{2}$Sb and 0.70 eV for Na$_{2}$KSb. In the band structure of both materials, Sb $p$-states dominate the valence region with minor contributions from the alkali $p$-states, while the alkali $s$-states mainly contribute at lower energies. The optical spectra of both crystals are not subject to sizeable excitonic effects, except for a redshift of the excitation energies of the 50-100 meV and some redistribution of the oscillator strength beyond the lowest-energy peak in the near-infrared region. Our results indicate that computationally predicted cubic NaK$_{2}$Sb and hexagonal Na$_{2}$KSb have favorable characteristics as photocathodes and, as such, their presence in polycrystalline samples is not detrimental for these applications.</description>

      <title>New insight into quantifying vacancy distribution in self-ion irradiated tungsten: a combined experimental and computational study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a new approach based on positron annihilation spectroscopy to estimate the concentration of vacancy-type defects induced by self-ion irradiation in tungsten at room temperature, 500, and 700{\deg}C. Using experimental and Two-component density functional theory calculated annihilation characteristics of various vacancy clusters V$_{n}$ ($n$=1-65) and a positron trapping model associated with the simulated annealing algorithm, vacancy cluster concentration distribution could be extracted from experimental data. The method was validated against simulation results for room-temperature irradiation and transmission electron microscopy observations for higher temperatures. After irradiation at 500 and 700{\deg}C, small clusters (&lt;20 vacancies, ~0.85 nm) undetectable by TEM were unveiled, with concentrations exceeding 10$^{25}$ m$^{-3}$, significantly higher than the concentration of TEM-visible defects (10$^{24}$ m$^{-3}$). Moreover, incorporating an oxygen-vacancy complex is deemed necessary to accurately replicate experimental data in samples subjected to high-temperature irradiation.</description>

      <title>The d-electron contribution to the stopping power of transition metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new non-perturbative model to describe the stopping power by ionization of the $d$-electrons of transition metals. These metals are characterized by the filling of the d-subshell and the promotion of part of the electrons to the conduction band. The contribution of d-electrons at low-impact energies has been noted experimentally in the past as a break of the linear dependence of the stopping power with the ion velocity. In this contribution, we describe the response of these electrons considering the atomic "inhomogeneous" momentum distribution. We focus on the transition metals of Groups 10 and 11 in the periodic table: Ni, Pd, Pt, Cu, Ag, and Au. Results describe the low energy-stopping power, with good agreement with the experimental data and available TDDFT results. By combining the present non-perturbative model for the $d$-subshell contribution with other approaches for the valence electrons and for the inner shells, we provide a coherent theoretical method capable of describing the stopping power of these transition metals from the very low to the high energy region.</description>

      <title>Doping dependence of low-energy charge collective excitations in high-T$_c$ cuprates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we analyze the dielectric function of high-Tc cuprates as a function of doping level, taking into account the full energy band dispersion within the CuO$_2$ monolayer. In addition to the conventional two-dimensional (2D) gapless plasmon mode, our findings reveal the existence of three anomalous branches within the plasmon spectrum. Two of these branches are overdamped modes, designated as hyperplasmons, and the third is an almost one-dimensional plasmon mode (1DP). We derive an analytic expression for dynamic part of the response function. Furthermore, we investigated the effect of the doping on these modes. Our analysis demonstrates that in the doping level range close to the optimal doping level, the properties of all three modes undergo a significant transformation.</description>

      <title>Breaking the wire: the impact of critical length on melting pathways in silver nanowires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the melting mechanisms of silver nanowires through molecular dynamics simulations and theoretical modelling, where we observe that two distinct mechanisms or pathways emerge that dictate how the solid-liquid interface melts during the phase transition. For wires longer than a critical length ($L&gt;L_{\textrm{crit}}$), an Arrhenius-type diffusion model successfully predicts the solid-liquid interface velocity, highlighting diffusion-driven melting pathways. In contrast, wires shorter than the critical length ($L\leq L_{\textrm{crit}}$) exhibit unique behaviours driven by non-equilibrium effects, including rapid overheating of the solid core, stabilization of the solid-liquid interface, and the pronounced impact of higher energy densities. These mechanisms lead to accelerated melting and distinct phase transition dynamics. Our findings reveal how geometry and nanoscale effects critically shape melting behaviour, offering insights for the design and stability of nanostructures in advanced applications.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear optics in 2D materials: from classical to quantum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear optics has long been a cornerstone of modern photonic technology, enabling a wide array of applications, from frequency conversion to the generation of ultrafast light pulses. Recent breakthroughs in two-dimensional (2D) materials have opened a frontier in this field, offering new opportunities for both classical and quantum nonlinear optics. These atomically thin materials exhibit strong light-matter interactions and large nonlinear responses, thanks to their tunable lattice symmetries, strong resonance effects, and highly engineerable band structures. In this paper, we explore the potential that 2D materials bring to nonlinear optics, covering topics from classical nonlinear optics to nonlinearities at the few-photon level. We delve into how these materials enable possibilities, such as symmetry control, phase matching, and integration into photonic circuits. The fusion of 2D materials with nonlinear optics provides insights into the fundamental behaviors of elementary excitations such as electrons, excitons, and photons in low dimensional systems and has the potential to transform the landscape of next-generation photonic and quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Time-resolved diamond magnetic microscopy of superparamagnetic iron-oxide nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superparamagnetic iron-oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) are promising probes for biomedical imaging, but the heterogeneity of their magnetic properties is difficult to characterize with existing methods. Here, we perform widefield imaging of the stray magnetic fields produced by hundreds of isolated ~30-nm SPIONs using a magnetic microscope based on nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond. By analyzing the SPION magnetic field patterns as a function of applied magnetic field, we observe substantial field-dependent transverse magnetization components that are typically obscured with ensemble characterization methods. We find negligible hysteresis in each of the three magnetization components for nearly all SPIONs in our sample. Most SPIONs exhibit a sharp Langevin saturation curve, enumerated by a characteristic polarizing applied field, B_c. The B_c distribution is highly asymmetric, with a standard deviation (1.4 mT) that is larger than the median (0.6 mT). Using time-resolved magnetic microscopy, we directly record SPION N\'eel relaxation, after switching off a 31 mT applied field, with a temporal resolution of ~60 ms that is limited by the ring-down time of the electromagnet coils. For small bias fields B_{hold}=1.5-3.5 mT, we observe a broad range of SPION N\'eel relaxation times--from milliseconds to seconds--that are consistent with an exponential dependence on B_{hold}. Our time-resolved diamond magnetic microscopy study reveals rich SPION sample heterogeneity and may be extended to other fundamental studies of nanomagnetism.</description>

      <title>Anomalous propagators and the particle-particle channel: Bethe-Salpeter equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Bethe-Salpeter equation has been extensively employed to compute the two-body electron-hole propagator and its poles which correspond to the neutral excitation energies of the system. Through a different time-ordering, the two-body Green's function can also describe the propagation of two electrons or two holes. The corresponding poles are the double ionization potentials and double electron affinities of the system. In this work, a Bethe-Salpeter equation for the two-body particle-particle propagator is derived within the linear-response formalism using a pairing field and anomalous propagators. This framework allows us to compute kernels corresponding to different self-energy approximations ($GW$, $T$-matrix, and second-Born) as in the usual electron-hole case. The performance of these various kernels is gauged for singlet and triplet valence double ionization potentials using a set of 23 small molecules. The description of double core hole states is also analyzed.</description>

      <title>Observation of non-Hermitian boundary induced hybrid skin-topological effect excited by synthetic complex frequencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The hybrid skin-topological effect (HSTE) has recently been proposed as a mechanism where topological edge states collapse into corner states under the influence of the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE). However, directly observing this effect is challenging due to the complex frequencies of eigenmodes. In this study, we experimentally observe HSTE corner states using synthetic complex frequency excitations in a transmission line network. We demonstrate that HSTE induces asymmetric transmission along a specific direction within the topological band gap. Besides HSTE, we identify corner states originating from non-chiral edge states, which are caused by the unbalanced effective onsite energy shifts at the boundaries of the network. Furthermore, our results suggest that whether the bulk interior is Hermitian or non-Hermitian is not a key factor for HSTE. Instead, the HSTE states can be realized and relocated simply by adjusting the non-Hermitian distribution at the boundaries. Our research has deepened the understanding of a range of issues regarding HSTE, paving the way for advancements in the design of non-Hermitian topological devices.</description>

      <title>Dissipation in quantum tunnel junctions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Based on experimental data, we propose a model to evaluate the energy dissipated during quantum tunneling processes in solid-state junctions. This model incorporates a nonlinear friction force expressed in the general form f(x)={\gamma} v(x)^{\alpha}, where {\gamma} is the frictional coefficient, which is fitted to data. We study this by applying voltages just below the barrier height up to near break down voltages. Furthermore, by lowering the temperature and adjusting the applied voltage to the junction, the effect on dissipation caused by the variation in barrier height is examined. We underline that the crucial dependency of dissipation on the fraction of particle energy lost is modulated by two primary mechanisms: the application of voltage and the variation of temperature. The fraction of energy dissipated decreases in general for increasing energies of the tunneling particles at a given temperature. However, for a given energy of the tunneling particle, the present work demonstrates a turning point at a temperature of 137 K, after which the dissipated energy starts increasing for higher temperatures. The latter can possibly be due to the increase of electron-phonon interactions which become predominant over barrier height reduction at higher temperatures and hence we identify T = 137 K as a critical temperature for change in dissipative characteristics of the solid-state junction under consideration. Notably, also the study identifies significant changes in dissipation parameters, {\gamma} and {\alpha}, above 137 K, exhibiting a linear decline and underscoring the importance of further research at higher temperatures.</description>

      <title>Tunable surface electron gas and effect of phonons in Sr$_2$CuO$_3$: A first-principles study</title>

Abstract: While the conducting CuO$_2$ planes in cuprate superconductors have been widely recognized as a crucial component in producing high superconducting $T_\text{c}$, recent experimental and theoretical studies on Ba$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_{3+}$$_\delta$ have also drawn much attention to the importance of Cu-O chains in one-dimensional (1D) cuprates. To better understand the cuprates containing Cu-O chains, here we have studied the electronic, magnetic, and phonon properties of Sr$_2$CuO$_3$ bulk and films based on the spin-polarized density functional theory calculations. We first reproduced the typical Mott insulator feature of the cuprate parent compound for bulk Sr$_2$CuO$_3$, and then built a Sr$_2$CuO$_3$ thin film with Cu-O chains exposed on the surface to directly investigate their characteristics. Different from the insulating bulk phase, the Sr$_2$CuO$_3$ surface shows interesting metallic properties. Further electronic structure calculations reveal the existence of spin-polarized electron gas between surface Sr atoms that strongly depends on the interchain coupling of Cu spins. Moreover, the phonon modes that involve the vibrations of in-chain and out-of-chain O atoms can induce strong charge and spin fluctuations in the surface layer of Sr$_2$CuO$_3$ film, which suggests significant multiple degree-of-freedom couplings that may be important for the superconductivity in 1D cuprates. Our work provides a comprehensive viewpoint of the properties of Cu-O chains in Sr$_2$CuO$_3$, facilitating a complete understanding of 1D cuprate superconductors.</description>

Abstract: Metal oxide thin films are of great interest in scientific advancement, particularly semiconductor thin films in transistors and in a wide range of optoelectronic applications. Many metal oxide thin films attract interest for their electronic bandgap, charge carrier mobility, optical opacity, luminescence, low cost, relative abundance and environmentally-friendly production. Additionally, these properties are often tuneable via particle size, film density, surface morphology, film deposition, growth method, hetero-interface engineering or ion-doping. Zinc oxide as a n-type semiconducting metal oxide is material of great interest owing to its intrinsically wide direct bandgap, high electron mobility, relatively high exciton binding energy, high optical transparency, demonstrated metal-ion doping optoelectronic effects, a range of different particle morphologies and deposition methods, photoluminescence ability, low cost and a variety of existing green synthesis methods. Here, these aspects of zinc oxide and some related oxides are reviewed, focusing on how the unique properties of this metal oxide make it suitable for a range of different applications from thin film transistors, high mobility oxide interfaces, transparent conductive oxides, photoanodes photodetectors, chemical sensors, photocatalysts, superlattice electronics and more. The properties and deposition methods and their impact on functionality will be discussed alongside their role in sustainable optoelectronics for future devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically and numerically elucidate the electrical control over spin waves in antiferromagnetic materials (AFM) with biaxial anisotropies and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions. The spin wave dispersion in an AFM manifests as a bifurcated spectrum with distinct high-frequency and low-frequency bands. Utilizing a heterostructure comprised of platinum and the AFM, we demonstrate anisotropic control of spin-wave bands via spin currents with three-dimensional spin polarizations, encompassing both resonant and propagating wave modes. Moreover, leveraging the confined geometry, we explore the possibility of controlling spin waves within a spectral domain ranging from tens of gigahertz to sub-terahertz frequencies. The implications of our findings suggest the potential for developing a terahertz wave source with electrical tunability, thereby facilitating its incorporation into ultrafast, broadband, and wireless communication technologies.</description>

      <title>Shear-resistant topology in quasi one-dimensional van der Waals material Bi$_4$Br$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bi$_4$Br$_4$ is a prototypical quasi one-dimensional (1D) material in which covalently bonded bismuth bromide chains are arranged in parallel, side-by-side and layer-by-layer, with van der Waals (vdW) gaps in between. So far, two different structures have been reported for this compound, $\alpha$-Bi$_4$Br$_4$ and $\beta$-Bi$_4$Br$_4$ , in both of which neighboring chains are shifted by $\mathbf{b}/2$, i.e., half a unit cell vector in the plane, but which differ in their vertical stacking. While the different layer arrangements are known to result in distinct electronic properties, the effect of possible in-plane shifts between the atomic chains remains an open question. Here, using scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy (STM/STS), we report a new Bi$_4$Br$_4$(001) structure, with a shift of $\mathbf{b}/3$ between neighboring chains in the plane and AB layer stacking. We determine shear strain to be the origin of this new structure, which can readily result in shifts of neighboring atomic chains because of the weak inter-chain bonding. For the observed $b/3$ structure, the (residual) atomic chain shift corresponds to an in-plane shear strain of $\gamma\approx7.5\%$. STS reveals a bulk insulating gap and metallic edge states at surface steps, indicating that the new structure is also a higher-order topological insulator, just like $\alpha$-Bi$_4$Br$_4$, in agreement with density functional theory (DFT) calculations.</description>

      <title>Wavenumber-dependent magnetic losses in YIG-GGG heterostructures at millikelvin temperatures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnons have inspired potential applications in modern quantum technologies and hybrid quantum systems due to their intrinsic nonlinearity, nanoscale scalability, and a unique set of experimentally accessible parameters for manipulating their dispersion. Such magnon-based quantum technologies demand long decoherence times, millikelvin temperatures, and minimal dissipation. Due to its low magnetic damping, the ferrimagnet yttrium iron garnet (YIG), grown on gadolinium gallium garnet (GGG), is the most promising material for this objective. To comprehend the magnetic losses of propagating magnons in such YIG-GGG heterostructures at cryogenic temperatures, we investigate magnon transport in a micrometer-thick YIG sample via propagating spin-wave spectroscopy (PSWS) measurements for temperatures between 4K to 26mK. We demonstrate an increase in the dissipation rate with wavenumber at cryogenic temperatures, caused by dipolar coupling to the partially magnetized GGG substrate. Additionally, we observe a temperature-dependent decrease in spin-wave transmission, attributed to rare earth ion relaxations. The critical role of the additional dissipation channels at cryogenic temperatures is underpinned by the comparison of the experimental results with theoretical calculations and micromagnetic simulations. Our findings strengthen the understanding of magnon losses at millikelvin temperatures, which is essential for the future detection of individual propagating magnons.</description>

Abstract: Large-area, high-quality monocrystalline antimonene polygons without alloy layers have been spontaneously synthesized on an Al(111) substrate at room temperature. Experimental measurements and first principles calculations both reveals a Dirac point at the Gamma point near -1.4eV in antimonene on Al(111), confirming that the structure exhibits topologically nontrivial properties. Additionally, a previously unpredicted kagome lattice structure of antimonene has been discovered, leading to a low-dispersion band structure near the Fermi level, which has significant implications for electronic properties and transport characteristics.These findings hold great potential for the next generation of electronic devices due to the material's distinctive electron transport properties and spin characteristics. Furthermore, first-principles calculations are utilized to verify the interaction forces between atoms in the Sb structure.</description>

Abstract: Heterostructures composed of the intrinsic magnetic topological insulator MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ and its non-magnetic counterpart Bi$_2$Te$_3$ host distinct surface electronic band structures depending on the stacking order and exposed termination. Here, we probe the ultrafast dynamical response of MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ and MnBi$_4$Te$_7$ following near-infrared optical excitation using time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, and disentangle surface from bulk dynamics based on density functional theory slab calculations of the surface-projected electronic structure. We gain access to the out-of-equilibrium charge carrier populations of both MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ and Bi$_2$Te$_3$ surface terminations of MnBi$_4$Te$_7$, revealing an instantaneous occupation of states associated with the Bi$_2$Te$_3$ surface layer followed by carrier extraction into the adjacent MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ layers with a laser fluence-tunable delay of up to 350 fs. The ensuing thermal relaxation processes are driven by phonon scattering with significantly slower relaxation times in the magnetic MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ septuple layers. The observed competition between interlayer charge transfer and intralayer phonon scattering demonstrates a method to control ultrafast charge transfer processes in MnBi$_2$Te$_4$-based van der Waals compounds.</description>

Abstract: Point defects in two-dimensional materials are of key interest for quantum information science. However, the space of possible defects is immense, making the identification of high-performance quantum defects extremely challenging. Here, we perform high-throughput (HT) first-principles computational screening to search for promising quantum defects within WS$_2$, which present localized levels in the band gap that can lead to bright optical transitions in the visible or telecom regime. Our computed database spans more than 700 charged defects formed through substitution on the tungsten or sulfur site. We found that sulfur substitutions enable the most promising quantum defects. We computationally identify the neutral cobalt substitution to sulfur (Co$_{\rm S}^{0}$) as very promising and fabricate it with scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). The Co$_{\rm S}^{0}$ electronic structure measured by STM agrees with first principles and showcases an attractive new quantum defect. Our work shows how HT computational screening and novel defect synthesis routes can be combined to design new quantum defects.</description>

      <title>Bilayer stacking A-type altermagnet: A general approach to generating two-dimensional altermagnetism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15097v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we propose a new concept of bilayer stacking A-type altermagnet (BSAA), in which two identical ferromagnetic monolayers are stacked with antiferromagnetic coupling to form a two-dimensional A-type altermagnet. By solving the stacking model, we derive all BSAAs for all layer groups and draw three key conclusions: (1) Only 17 layer groups can realize intrinsic A-type altermagnetism. All 2D A-type altermagnets must belong to these 17 layer groups, which will be helpful to search for 2D A-type altermagnet. (2) It is impossible to connect the two sublattices of BSAA using $S_{3z}$ or $S_{6z}$, a constraint that is also applicable to all 2D altermagnets. (3) $C_{2\alpha}$ is a general stacking operation to generate BSAA for an arbitrary monolayer. Our theory not only can explain the previously reported twisted-bilayer altermagnets, but also can provide more possibilities to generate A-type altermagnets. Our research has significantly broadened the range of candidate materials for 2D altermagnets. Based on conclusion (1), the bilayer NiZrCl$_6$ is predicted to exhibit intrinsic A-type altermagnetism. Additionally, we use twisted-bilayer NiCl$_2$, previously reported in the literature, as the second example of BSAA. Furthermore, utilizing symmetry analysis and first-principles calculation, we scrutinize their spin-momentum locking characteristic to substantiate their altermagnetic properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10978v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kagome metals are a unique class of quantum materials characterized by their distinct atomic lattice arrangement, featuring interlocking triangles and expansive hexagonal voids. These lattice structures impart exotic properties, including superconductivity, interaction-driven topological many-body phenomena, and magnetism, among others. The kagome metal CsM3Te5 (where M = Ti, Zr, or Hf) exhibits both superconductivity and nontrivial topological electronic properties, offering a promising platform for exploring topological superconductivity. This study employs first-principles density functional theory calculations to systematically analyze the elastic, mechanical, vibrational, thermodynamic, and electronic properties of CsM3Te5 (M = Ti, Zr, Hf). Our calculations reveal that the studied compounds - CsTi3Te5, CsZr3Te5, and CsHf3Te5 - are ductile metals with elastic properties akin to the hexagonal Bi and Sb, with average elastic constants, including a bulk modulus of 27 GPa, a shear modulus of 11 GPa, and Young's modulus of 29 GPa. We observe peculiar dispersionless, flat, phonon branches in the vibrational spectra of these metals. Additionally, we thoroughly analyze the symmetries of the zone-center phonon eigenvectors and predict vibrational fingerprints of the Raman- and infrared-active phonon modes. The analysis of thermodynamic properties reveals the Einstein temperature for CsTi3Te5, CsZr3Te5, and CsHf3Te5 to be 66, 54, and 53 K, respectively. Our orbital-decomposed electronic structure calculations reveal significant in-plane steric interactions and multiple Dirac band crossings near the Fermi level. We further investigate the role of spin-orbit coupling effect on the studied properties. This theoretical investigation sheds light on the intriguing quantum behaviour of kagome metals.</description>

      <title>Tuning Electric Polarization via Exchange Striction Interaction in CaMn$_7$O$_{12}$ by Sr-Doping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12041v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetoelectric materials displaying strong magnetically induced polarization have attracted considerable interest due to their potential applications in spintronics and various fast electrically controlled magnetic devices. CaMn$_7$O$_{12}$ (CMO) stands out for its giant spin-induced ferroelectric polarization. However, the origin of the induced electric polarization in CMO remains highly controversial and continues to be a subject of ongoing debate. In this paper, through room temperature X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD), temperature-dependent magnetic susceptibility, and thermally stimulated depolarizing current (TSDC) measurements, we provide experimental evidence for a route to tune the magnetically induced polarization by modifying the exchange-striction in CMO via Sr-doping. Our findings demonstrate that the large and broad current peaks observed near the first magnetic phase transition ($T_N1 \sim 90$ K) indicate polarization contributions from both thermally stimulated depolarization current (TSDC) and intrinsic magnetically induced electric polarization. We suggest that this reduction in induced electric polarization in CMO originates from the increase in the Mn$^{3+}$ -- O -- Mn$^{4+}$ bond angle due to Sr$^{2+}$ doping, weakening the exchange-striction interaction. Meanwhile, the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) effect determines the direction of the induced electric polarization. Our result sheds light on understanding the intriguing giant-induced polarization in CMO and similar compounds with complex magnetic structures.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Spectroscopical Effects in an Antiferromagnetic Semiconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11673v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Following the recent observation of anomalous Hall effect in antiferromagnetic hexagonal MnTe thin films, related phenomena at finite frequencies have come into focus. Magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) is the key material property here. In the x-ray range, the XMCD has already been demonstrated and used to visualise domains via photoemission electron microscopy (PEEM). Here we report on MCD in optical range and discuss its microscopic mechanism.</description>

      <title>Topological Optical Pseudospin Injection Beyond Weyl Semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09235v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Photoinduced effects are now reckoned to be important tools to reveal a rich gamut of entrancing physics in topological materials, which are normally inaccessible to conventional probes. Here we investigate one of these intriguing effects, namely, {\it optical pseudospin injection} (OPI) beyond ordinary Weyl semimetals (WSMs), specifically in multi-WSMs (mWSMs) and higher-order WSMs. Remarkably, we demonstrate that OPI in mWSMs is independent of the frequency of the light and linearly proportional to the quantized topological charge as a consequence of the inherent band linearity in their dispersions. Interestingly, while the response does not depend on the tilting of a type-I node, it is a decreasing function of the same in type-II mWSMs. We also reveal that the frequency-independence can be destroyed either by going beyond a certain cutoff frequency under lattice regularization or by going to a higher-order Weyl phase. The predicted signatures of OPI beyond the ordinary WSM could be experimentally exploited, leading to effective access as well as distinguishing between different nontrivial Weyl topologies.</description>

      <title>Impurity bands, line-nodes, and anomalous thermal Hall effect in Weyl superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09840</link>

Abstract: We investigate the anomalous thermal Hall effect (ATHE) in Weyl superconductors realized by the $E_{1u}$ ($p$-wave and $f$-wave) chiral superconducting order for the point group $D_{6h}$. Using the quasiclassical transport theory, we analyze the influence of the impurity scatterings and the line-nodal excitations on the ATHE. We compare the extrinsic (impurity-induced) ATHE with the intrinsic (topological) ATHE to identify the dominant contribution. Because the transverse response is sensitive to the slope in the density of states (DOS) at the Fermi energy, the extrinsic ATHE vanishes in both the Born (weak impurity potential) and unitarity (strong impurity potential) limits. The amplitude of the impurity contribution to the thermal Hall conductivity (THC) reaches maximum between these limits when the slope of the DOS becomes large due to impurity bands near the Fermi energy. In such situations, the extrinsic ATHE dominates the intrinsic ATHE even at low temperatures. The extrinsic ATHE is sensitive to line-nodal excitations, whereas the intrinsic ATHE is insensitive to bulk excitations. When line nodes involve the sign change of the order parameter, the impurity contribution to the THC is suppressed even though the phase space for low-energy excitation is large. In contrast, if line nodes are not accompanied by such sign changes, the extrinsic ATHE is significantly enhanced. Our results form a basis for the comprehensive analysis of anomalous thermal transport in Weyl superconductors.</description>

      <title>Accurate Electron-phonon Interactions from Advanced Density Functional Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08192v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electron-phonon coupling (EPC) is key for understanding many properties of materials such as superconductivity and electric resistivity. Although first principles density-functional-theory (DFT) based EPC calculations are used widely, their efficacy is limited by the accuracy and efficiency of the underlying exchange-correlation functionals. These limitations become exacerbated in complex $d$- and $f$-electron materials, where beyond-DFT approaches and empirical corrections, such as the Hubbard $U$, are commonly invoked. Here, using the examples of CoO and NiO, we show how the efficient r2scan density functional correctly captures strong EPC effects in transition-metal oxides without requiring the introduction of empirical parameters. We also demonstrate the ability of r2scan to accurately model phonon-mediated superconducting properties of the main group compounds (e.g., MgB$_2$), with improved electronic bands and phonon dispersions over those of traditional density functionals. Our study provides a pathway for extending the scope of accurate first principles modeling of electron-phonon interactions to encompass complex $d$-electron materials.</description>
