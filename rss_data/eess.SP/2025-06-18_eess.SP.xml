      <title>Demonstrating Superresolution in Radar Range Estimation Using a Denoising Autoencoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply machine learning methods to demonstrate range superresolution in remote sensing radar detection. Specifically, we implement a denoising autoencoder to estimate the distance between two equal intensity scatterers in the subwavelength regime. The machine learning models are trained on waveforms subject to a bandlimit constraint such that ranges much smaller than the inverse bandlimit are optimized in their precision. The autoencoder achieves effective dimensionality reduction, with the bottleneck layer exhibiting a strong and consistent correlation with the true scatterer separation. We confirm reproducibility across different training sessions and network initializations by analyzing the scaled encoder outputs and their robustness to noise. We investigate the behavior of the bottleneck layer for the following types of pulses: a traditional sinc pulse, a bandlimited triangle-type pulse, and a theoretically near-optimal pulse created from a spherical Bessel function basis. The Bessel signal performs best, followed by the triangle wave, with the sinc signal performing worst, highlighting the crucial role of signal design in the success of machine-learning-based range resolution.</description>

      <title>Metasurfaces-Integrated Doubly-Dispersive MIMO: Channel Modeling and Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The doubly-dispersive (DD) channel structure has played a pivotal role in wireless communications, particularly in high-mobility scenarios and integrated sensing and communications (ISAC), due to its ability to capture the key fading effects experienced by a transmitted signal as it propagates through a dynamic medium. However, extending the DD framework to multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, especially in environments artificially enhanced by reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) and stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIM), remains a challenging open problem. In this chapter, a novel metasurfaces-parametrized DD (MPDD) channel model that integrates an arbitrary number of RISs, while also incorporating SIM at both the transmitter and receiver is introduced. Next, the application of this model to some key waveforms optimized for DD environments -- namely orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS), and affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM) -- is discussed. Finally, the programmability of the proposed model is highlighted through an illustrative application, demonstrating its potential for enhancing waveform performance in SIM-assisted wireless systems.</description>

      <title>Secure Time-Modulated Intelligent Reflecting Surface via Generative Flow Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel directional modulation (DM) design for OFDM transmitters aided by a time-modulated intelligent reflecting surface (TM-IRS). The TM-IRS is configured to preserve the integrity of transmitted signals toward multiple legitimate users while scrambling the signal in all other directions. Existing TM-IRS design methods typically target a single user direction and follow predefined rule-based procedures, making them unsuitable for multi-user scenarios. Here, we propose a generative AI-based approach to design good sets of TM-IRS parameters out of a set of all possible quantized ranges of parameters. The design objective is to maximize the sum rate across the authorized directions. We model the TM-IRS parameter selection as a deterministic Markov decision process (MDP), where each terminal state corresponds to a specific configuration of TM-IRS parameters. GFlowNets are employed to learn a stochastic policy that samples TM-IRS parameter sets with probability proportional to their associated sum rate reward. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively enhances the security of the TM-IRS-aided OFDM systems with multi-users. Also, despite the vast size of the TM-IRS configuration space, the GFlowNet is able to converge after training on fewer than 0.000001% of all possible configurations, demonstrating remarkable efficiency compared to exhaustive combinatorial search. Implementation code is available at https://github.com/ZhihaoTao/GFN4TM-RIS to facilitate reproducibility.</description>

      <title>Fiber Signal Denoising Algorithm using Hybrid Deep Learning Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the applicability of optical fiber-based distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) systems, effective signal processing and analysis approaches are needed to promote its popularization in the field of intelligent transportation systems (ITS). This paper presents a signal denoising algorithm using a hybrid deep-learning network (HDLNet). Without annotated data and time-consuming labeling, this self-supervised network runs in parallel, combining an autoencoder for denoising (DAE) and a long short-term memory (LSTM) for sequential processing. Additionally, a line-by-line matching algorithm for vehicle detection and tracking is introduced, thus realizing the complete processing of fiber signal denoising and feature extraction. Experiments were carried out on a self-established real highway tunnel dataset, showing that our proposed hybrid network yields more satisfactory denoising performance than Spatial-domain DAE.</description>

      <title>Out-of-Band Modality Synergy Based Multi-User Beam Prediction and Proactive BS Selection with Zero Pilot Overhead</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-user millimeter-wave communication relies on narrow beams and dense cell deployments to ensure reliable connectivity. However, tracking optimal beams for multiple mobile users across multiple base stations (BSs) results in significant signaling overhead. Recent works have explored the capability of out-of-band (OOB) modalities in obtaining spatial characteristics of wireless channels and reducing pilot overhead in single-BS single-user/multi-user systems. However, applying OOB modalities for multi-BS selection towards dense cell deployments leads to high coordination overhead, i.e, excessive computing overhead and high latency in data exchange. How to leverage OOB modalities to eliminate pilot overhead and achieve efficient multi-BS coordination in multi-BS systems remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel OOB modality synergy (OMS) based mobility management scheme to realize multi-user beam prediction and proactive BS selection by synergizing two OOB modalities, i.e., vision and location. Specifically, mobile users are initially identified via spatial alignment of visual sensing and location feedback, and then tracked according to the temporal correlation in image sequence. Subsequently, a binary encoding map based gain and beam prediction network (BEM-GBPN) is designed to predict beamforming gains and optimal beams for mobile users at each BS, such that a central unit can control the BSs to perform user handoff and beam switching. Simulation results indicate that the proposed OMS-based mobility management scheme enhances beam prediction and BS selection accuracy and enables users to achieve 91% transmission rates of the optimal with zero pilot overhead and significantly improve multi-BS coordination efficiency compared to existing methods.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Trajectory GOSPA: A Metric for Uncertainty-Aware Multi-Object Tracking Performance Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a generalization of the trajectory general optimal sub-pattern assignment (GOSPA) metric for evaluating multi-object tracking algorithms that provide trajectory estimates with track-level uncertainties. This metric builds on the recently introduced probabilistic GOSPA metric to account for both the existence and state estimation uncertainties of individual object states. Similar to trajectory GOSPA (TGOSPA), it can be formulated as a multidimensional assignment problem, and its linear programming relaxation--also a valid metric--is computable in polynomial time. Additionally, this metric retains the interpretability of TGOSPA, and we show that its decomposition yields intuitive costs terms associated to expected localization error and existence probability mismatch error for properly detected objects, expected missed and false detection error, and track switch error. The effectiveness of the proposed metric is demonstrated through a simulation study.</description>

      <title>Enhancing eLoran Timing Accuracy via Machine Learning with Meteorological and Terrain Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The vulnerabilities of global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) to signal interference have increased the demand for complementary positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) systems. To address this, South Korea has decided to deploy an enhanced long-range navigation (eLoran) system as a complementary PNT solution. Similar to GNSS, eLoran provides highly accurate timing information, which is essential for applications such as telecommunications, financial systems, and power distribution. However, the primary sources of error for GNSS and eLoran differ. For eLoran, the main source of error is signal propagation delay over land, known as the additional secondary factor (ASF). This delay, influenced by ground conductivity and weather conditions along the signal path, is challenging to predict and mitigate. In this paper, we measure the time difference (TD) between GPS and eLoran using a time interval counter and analyze the correlations between eLoran/GPS TD and eleven meteorological factors. Accurate estimation of eLoran/GPS TD could enable eLoran to achieve timing accuracy comparable to that of GPS. We propose two estimation models for eLoran/GPS TD and compare their performance with existing TD estimation methods. The proposed WLR-AGRNN model captures the linear relationships between meteorological factors and eLoran/GPS TD using weighted linear regression (WLR) and models nonlinear relationships between outputs from expert networks through an anisotropic general regression neural network (AGRNN). The model incorporates terrain elevation to appropriately weight meteorological data, as elevation influences signal propagation delay. Experimental results based on four months of data demonstrate that the WLR-AGRNN model outperforms other models, highlighting its effectiveness in improving eLoran/GPS TD estimation accuracy.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning-Based Policy Optimisation For Heterogeneous Radio Access</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flexible and efficient wireless resource sharing across heterogeneous services is a key objective for future wireless networks. In this context, we investigate the performance of a system where latency-constrained internet-of-things (IoT) devices coexist with a broadband user. The base station adopts a grant-free access framework to manage resource allocation, either through orthogonal radio access network (RAN) slicing or by allowing shared access between services. For the IoT users, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL) approach based on double Q-Learning (QL) to optimise their repetition-based transmission strategy, allowing them to adapt to varying levels of interference and meet a predefined latency target. We evaluate the system's performance in terms of the cumulative distribution function of IoT users' latency, as well as the broadband user's throughput and energy efficiency (EE). Our results show that the proposed RL-based access policies significantly enhance the latency performance of IoT users in both RAN Slicing and RAN Sharing scenarios, while preserving desirable broadband throughput and EE. Furthermore, the proposed policies enable RAN Sharing to be energy-efficient at low IoT traffic levels, and RAN Slicing to be favourable under high IoT traffic.</description>

      <title>Urban RIS-Assisted HAP Networks: Performance Analysis Using Stochastic Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies a high-altitude platform (HAP) network supported by reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs). The practical irregular placement of HAPs and RISs is modeled using homogeneous Poisson point processes, while buildings that cause blockages in urban areas are modeled as a Boolean scheme of rectangles. We introduce a novel approach to characterize the statistical channel based on generalized Beta prime distribution. Analytical expressions for coverage probability and ergodic capacity in an interference-limited system are derived and validated through Monte Carlo simulations. The findings show notable performance improvements and reveal the impact of various system parameters, including blockages effect which contribute in mitigating interference from the other visible HAPs. This proposed system could enhance connectivity and enable effective data offloading in urban environments.</description>

      <title>Effect of Signal Quantization on Performance Measures of a 1st Order One Dimensional Differential Microphone Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In practical systems, recorded analog signals must be digitized for processing, introducing quantization as a critical aspect of data acquisition. While prior studies have examined quantization effects in various signal processing contexts, its impact on differential microphone arrays (DMAs), particularly in one-dimensional (1D) first-order configurations, remains unexplored. This paper investigates the influence of signal quantization on performance of first-order 1D DMAs across various beampatterns. An analytical expression for quantized beamformed output for a first-order 1D DMA has been formulated. The effect of signal quantization has been studied on array performance measures such as the Beampattern, Directivity Factor (DF), Front-to-Back Ratio (FBR), and null depth (ND). Simulation results reveal that beampattern shape remains structurally invariant across quantization bit depths, with quantization primarily affecting ND. DF and FBR remain constant with the varying number of quantization bits. Additionally, ND is shown to be frequency-independent; however, it increases with increasing quantization bit depths, enhancing interference suppression. The study also examines the effect of steering nulls across the azimuthal range, showing that ND degrades as the null moves closer to the source look direction, indicating reduced interference suppression.</description>

      <title>Analyzing URA Geometry for Enhanced Spatial Multiplexing and Extended Near-Field Coverage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the deployment of large antenna arrays at high frequency bands, future wireless communication systems are likely to operate in the radiative near-field. Unlike far-field beam steering, near-field beams can be focused within a spatial region of finite depth, enabling spatial multiplexing in both the angular and range dimensions. This paper derives the beamdepth for a generalized uniform rectangular array (URA) and investigates how array geometry influences the near-field beamdepth and the limits where near-field beamfocusing is achievable. To characterize the near-field boundary in terms of beamfocusing and spatial multiplexing gains, we define the effective beamfocusing Rayleigh distance (EBRD) for a generalized URA. Our analysis reveals that while a square URA achieves the narrowest beamdepth, the EBRD is maximized for a wide or tall URA. However, despite its narrow beamdepth, a square URA may experience a reduction in multiuser sum rate due to its severely constrained EBRD. Simulation results confirm that a wide or tall URA achieves a sum rate of 3.5 X more than that of a square URA, benefiting from the extended EBRD and improved spatial multiplexing capabilities.</description>

      <title>Near-Field SWIPT with gMIMO in the Upper Mid-Band: Opportunities, Challenges, and the Way Forward</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the integration of simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) with gigantic multiple-input multiple-output (gMIMO) technology operating in the upper mid-band frequency range (7-24 GHz). The near-field propagation achieved by gMIMO introduces unique opportunities for energy-efficient, high-capacity communication systems that cater to the demands of 6G wireless networks. Exploiting spherical wave propagation, near-field SWIPT with gMIMO enables precise energy and data delivery, enhancing spectral efficiency through beamfocusing and massive spatial multiplexing. This paper discusses theoretical principles, design challenges, and enabling solutions, including advanced channel estimation techniques, precoding strategies, and dynamic array configurations such as sparse and modular arrays. Through analytical insights and a case study, this paper demonstrates the feasibility of achieving optimized energy harvesting and data throughput in dense and dynamic environments. These findings contribute to advancing energy-autonomous Internet-of-Everything (IoE) deployments, smart factory networks, and other energy-autonomous applications aligned with the goals of next-generation wireless technologies.</description>

      <title>Comparative Analysis of QNN Architectures for Wind Power Prediction: Feature Maps and Ansatz Configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum Machine Learning (QML) is an emerging field at the intersection of quantum computing and machine learning, aiming to enhance classical machine learning methods by leveraging quantum mechanics principles such as entanglement and superposition. However, skepticism persists regarding the practical advantages of QML, mainly due to the current limitations of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. This study addresses these concerns by extensively assessing Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs)-quantum-inspired counterparts of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), demonstrating their effectiveness compared to classical methods. We systematically construct and evaluate twelve distinct QNN configurations, utilizing two unique quantum feature maps combined with six different entanglement strategies for ansatz design. Experiments conducted on a wind energy dataset reveal that QNNs employing the Z feature map achieve up to 93% prediction accuracy when forecasting wind power output using only four input parameters. Our findings show that QNNs outperform classical methods in predictive tasks, underscoring the potential of QML in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>An Integrated Sensing and Communication System for Time-Sensitive Targets with Random Arrivals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 6G networks, integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is envisioned as a key technology that enables wireless systems to perform joint sensing and communication using shared hardware, antennas and spectrum. ISAC designs facilitate emerging applications such as smart cities and autonomous driving. Such applications also demand ultra-reliable and low-latency communication (URLLC). Thus, an ISAC-enabled URLLC system can prioritize time-sensitive targets and ensure information delivery under strict latency and reliability constraints. We propose a bi-static MIMO ISAC system to detect the arrival of URLLC messages and prioritize their delivery. In this system, a base station (BS) communicates with a user equipment (UE) and a sensing receiver (SR) is deployed to collect echo signals reflected from a target of interest. The BS regularly transmits messages of enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) services to the UE. During each eMBB transmission, if the SR senses the presence of a target of interest, it immediately triggers the transmission of an additional URLLC message. To reinforce URLLC transmissions, we propose a dirty-paper coding (DPC)-based technique that mitigates the interference of both eMBB and sensing signals. To decode the eMBB message, we consider two approaches for handling the URLLC interference: treating interference as noise and successive interference cancellation. For this system, we formulate the rate-reliability-detection trade-off in the finite blocklength (FBL) regime by evaluating the communication rate of the eMBB transmissions, the reliability of the URLLC transmissions and the probability of the target detection. Our numerical analysis show that our proposed DPC-based ISAC scheme significantly outperforms power-sharing and traditional time-sharing schemes. In particular, it achieves higher eMBB transmission rate while satisfying both URLLC and sensing constraints.</description>

      <title>MIMO Systems Aided by Microwave Linear Analog Computers: Capacity-Achieving Architectures with Reduced Circuit Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15052</link>

Abstract: To meet the demands of future wireless networks, antenna arrays must scale from massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) to gigantic MIMO, involving even larger numbers of antennas. To address the hardware and computational cost of gigantic MIMO, several strategies are available that shift processing from the digital to the analog domain. Among them, microwave linear analog computers (MiLACs) offer a compelling solution by enabling fully analog beamforming through reconfigurable microwave networks. Prior work has focused on fully-connected MiLACs, whose ports are all interconnected to each other via tunable impedance components. Although such MiLACs are capacity-achieving, their circuit complexity, given by the number of required impedance components, scales quadratically with the number of antennas, limiting their practicality. To solve this issue, in this paper, we propose a graph theoretical model of MiLAC facilitating the systematic design of lower-complexity MiLAC architectures. Leveraging this model, we propose stem-connected MiLACs as a family of MiLAC architectures maintaining capacity-achieving performance while drastically reducing the circuit complexity. Besides, we optimize stem-connected MiLACs with a closed-form capacity-achieving solution. Our theoretical analysis, confirmed by numerical simulations, shows that stem-connected MiLACs are capacity-achieving, but with circuit complexity that scales linearly with the number of antennas, enabling high-performance, scalable, gigantic MIMO.</description>

      <title>CWGAN-GP Augmented CAE for Jamming Detection in 5G-NR in Non-IID Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the ever-expanding domain of 5G-NR wireless cellular networks, over-the-air jamming attacks are prevalent as security attacks, compromising the quality of the received signal. We simulate a jamming environment by incorporating additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) into the real-world In-phase and Quadrature (I/Q) OFDM datasets. A Convolutional Autoencoder (CAE) is exploited to implement a jamming detection over various characteristics such as heterogenous I/Q datasets; extracting relevant information on Synchronization Signal Blocks (SSBs), and fewer SSB observations with notable class imbalance. Given the characteristics of datasets, balanced datasets are acquired by employing a Conv1D conditional Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network-Gradient Penalty(CWGAN-GP) on both majority and minority SSB observations. Additionally, we compare the performance and detection ability of the proposed CAE model on augmented datasets with benchmark models: Convolutional Denoising Autoencoder (CDAE) and Convolutional Sparse Autoencoder (CSAE). Despite the complexity of data heterogeneity involved across all datasets, CAE depicts the robustness in detection performance of jammed signal by achieving average values of 97.33% precision, 91.33% recall, 94.08% F1-score, and 94.35% accuracy over CDAE and CSAE.</description>

      <title>Skew-Induced Insertion Loss Deviation (SILD) and FOM_SILD: Metrics for Quantifying P/N Skew Effects in High-Speed Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rise of AI workloads and growing data center demands have driven the need for ultra-high-speed interconnects exceeding 200 Gb/s. As unit intervals (UI) shrink, even a few picoseconds of P/N skew can degrade serializer-deserializer (SerDes) performance. Traditional methods for quantifying skew fall short in capturing its impact. We introduce two new metrics: 1) Skew-Induced Insertion Loss Deviation (SILD) and 2) its complementary Figure of Merit (FOM_SILD), analytically developed to assess P/N skew effects. Measured S-parameters confirm FOM_SILD reciprocity, while simulations of 224G PAM4 SerDes show strong correlation with bit error rate (BER) trends. This approach offers a robust framework for analyzing skew in next-generation ultra-high-speed interconnects.</description>

      <title>In-Context Learning for Gradient-Free Receiver Adaptation: Principles, Applications, and Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, deep learning has facilitated the creation of wireless receivers capable of functioning effectively in conditions that challenge traditional model-based designs. Leveraging programmable hardware architectures, deep learning-based receivers offer the potential to dynamically adapt to varying channel environments. However, current adaptation strategies, including joint training, hypernetwork-based methods, and meta-learning, either demonstrate limited flexibility or necessitate explicit optimization through gradient descent. This paper presents gradient-free adaptation techniques rooted in the emerging paradigm of in-context learning (ICL). We review architectural frameworks for ICL based on Transformer models and structured state-space models (SSMs), alongside theoretical insights into how sequence models effectively learn adaptation from contextual information. Further, we explore the application of ICL to cell-free massive MIMO networks, providing both theoretical analyses and empirical evidence. Our findings indicate that ICL represents a principled and efficient approach to real-time receiver adaptation using pilot signals and auxiliary contextual information-without requiring online retraining.</description>

      <title>Joint Computation Offloading and Resource Allocation for Uncertain Maritime MEC via Cooperation of UAVs and Vessels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The computation demands from the maritime Internet of Things (MIoT) increase rapidly in recent years, and the unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and vessels based multi-access edge computing (MEC) can fulfill these MIoT requirements. However, the uncertain maritime tasks present significant challenges of inefficient computation offloading and resource allocation. In this paper, we focus on the maritime computation offloading and resource allocation through the cooperation of UAVs and vessels, with consideration of uncertain tasks. Specifically, we propose a cooperative MEC framework for computation offloading and resource allocation, including MIoT devices, UAVs and vessels. Then, we formulate the optimization problem to minimize the total execution time. As for the uncertain MIoT tasks, we leverage Lyapunov optimization to tackle the unpredictable task arrivals and varying computational resource availability. 
By converting the long-term constraints into short-term constraints, we obtain a set of small-scale optimization problems. Further, considering the heterogeneity of actions and resources of UAVs and vessels, we reformulate the small-scale optimization problem into a Markov game (MG). Moreover, a heterogeneous-agent soft actor-critic is proposed to sequentially update various neural networks and effectively solve the MG problem. 
Finally, simulations are conducted to verify the effectiveness in addressing computational offloading and resource allocation.</description>

      <title>Diff-TONE: Timestep Optimization for iNstrument Editing in Text-to-Music Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Breakthroughs in text-to-music generation models are transforming the creative landscape, equipping musicians with innovative tools for composition and experimentation like never before. However, controlling the generation process to achieve a specific desired outcome remains a significant challenge. Even a minor change in the text prompt, combined with the same random seed, can drastically alter the generated piece. In this paper, we explore the application of existing text-to-music diffusion models for instrument editing. Specifically, for an existing audio track, we aim to leverage a pretrained text-to-music diffusion model to edit the instrument while preserving the underlying content. Based on the insight that the model first focuses on the overall structure or content of the audio, then adds instrument information, and finally refines the quality, we show that selecting a well-chosen intermediate timestep, identified through an instrument classifier, yields a balance between preserving the original piece's content and achieving the desired timbre. Our method does not require additional training of the text-to-music diffusion model, nor does it compromise the generation process's speed.</description>

      <title>Trajectory Optimization for Cellular-Enabled UAV with Connectivity and Battery Constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.16207v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address the path planning problem for a cellular-enabled unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) considering both connectivity and battery constraints. The UAV's mission is to expeditiously transport a payload from an initial point to a final point, while persistently keeping the connection with a base station and complying with its battery limit. At a charging station, the UAV's depleted battery can be swapped with a completely charged one. Our primary contribution lies in proposing an algorithm that outputs an optimal UAV trajectory with polynomial computational complexity, by converting the problem into an equivalent two-level graph-theoretic shortest path search problem. We compare our algorithm with several existing algorithms with respect to performance and computational complexity, and show that only our algorithm outputs an optimal UAV trajectory in polynomial time. Furthermore, we consider other objectives of minimizing the UAV energy consumption and of maximizing the deliverable payload weight, and propose algorithms that output an optimal UAV trajectory in polynomial time.</description>

      <title>Bayesian KalmanNet: Quantifying Uncertainty in Deep Learning Augmented Kalman Filter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.03058v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent years have witnessed a growing interest in tracking algorithms that augment Kalman Filters (KFs) with Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). By transforming KFs into trainable deep learning models, one can learn from data to reliably track a latent state in complex and partially known dynamics. However, unlike classic KFs, conventional DNN-based systems do not naturally provide an uncertainty measure, such as error covariance, alongside their estimates, which is crucial in various applications that rely on KF-type tracking. This work bridges this gap by studying error covariance extraction in DNN-aided KFs. We begin by characterizing how uncertainty can be extracted from existing DNN-aided algorithms and distinguishing between approaches by their ability to associate internal features with meaningful KF quantities, such as the Kalman Gain (KG) and prior covariance. We then identify that uncertainty extraction from existing architectures necessitates additional domain knowledge not required for state estimation. Based on this insight, we propose Bayesian KalmanNet, a novel DNN-aided KF that integrates Bayesian deep learning techniques with the recently proposed KalmanNet and transforms the KF into a stochastic machine learning architecture. This architecture employs sampling techniques to predict error covariance reliably without requiring additional domain knowledge, while retaining KalmanNet's ability to accurately track in partially known dynamics. Our numerical study demonstrates that Bayesian KalmanNet provides accurate and reliable tracking in various scenarios representing partially known dynamic systems.</description>

      <title>Distributionally Robust Receive Combining</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.12345v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article investigates signal estimation in wireless transmission (i.e., receive combining) from the perspective of statistical machine learning, where the transmit signals may be from an integrated sensing and communication system; that is, 1) signals may be not only discrete constellation points but also arbitrary complex values; 2) signals may be spatially correlated. Particular attention is paid to handling various uncertainties such as the uncertainty of the transmit signal covariance, the uncertainty of the channel matrix, the uncertainty of the channel noise covariance, the existence of channel impulse noises, the non-ideality of the power amplifiers, and the limited sample size of pilots. To proceed, a distributionally robust receive combining framework that is insensitive to the above uncertainties is proposed, which reveals that channel estimation is not a necessary operation. For optimal linear estimation, the proposed framework includes several existing combiners as special cases such as diagonal loading and eigenvalue thresholding. For optimal nonlinear estimation, estimators are limited in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces and neural network function spaces, and corresponding uncertainty-aware solutions (e.g., kernelized diagonal loading) are derived. In addition, we prove that the ridge and kernel ridge regression methods in machine learning are distributionally robust against diagonal perturbation in feature covariance.</description>

      <title>Cooperative Integrated Sensing and Communication Networks: Analysis and Distributed Design</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13401v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a cooperative integrated sensing and communication network (Co-ISACNet) adopting hybrid beamforming (HBF) architecture, which improves both radar sensing and communication performance. The main contributions of this work are four-fold. First, we introduce a novel cooperative sensing method for the considered Co-ISACNet, followed by a comprehensive analysis of this method. This analysis mathematically verifies the benefits of Co-ISACNet and provides insightful design guidelines. Second, to show the benefits of Co-ISACNet, we propose to jointly design the HBF to maximize the network communication capacity while satisfying the constraint of beampattern similarity for radar sensing, which results in a highly dimensional and non-convex problem. Third, to facilitate the joint design, we propose a novel distributed optimization framework based on proximal gradient and alternating direction method of multipliers, namely PANDA. Fourth, we further adopt the proposed PANDA framework to solve the joint HBF design problem for the Co-ISACNet. By using the proposed PANDA framework, all access points (APs) optimize the HBF in parallel, where each AP only requires local channel state information and limited message exchange among the APs. Such framework reduces significantly the computational complexity and thus has pronounced benefits in practical scenarios. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm compared with the conventional centralized algorithm and show the remarkable performance improvement of radar sensing and communication by deploying Co-ISACNet.</description>

      <title>CISSIR: Beam Codebooks with Self-Interference Reduction Guarantees for Integrated Sensing and Communication Beyond 5G</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10371v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a beam codebook design to reduce self-interference (SI) in integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. Our optimization methods, which can be applied to both tapered beamforming and phased arrays, adapt the codebooks to the SI channel such that a certain SI level is achieved. Furthermore, we derive an upper bound on the quantization noise in terms of the achieved SI level, which provides guidelines to pose the optimization problem in order to obtain performance guarantees for sensing. By selecting standard reference codebooks in our simulations, we show substantially improved sensing quality with little impact on 5G-NR communication. Our proposed method is not only less dependent on hyperparameters than other approaches in the literature, but it can also reduce SI further, and thus deliver better sensing and communication performance.</description>

Abstract: This paper deals with modeling, analysis, and optimization of power amplifiers (PAs) placed in a cascaded structure, particularly the effect of cascaded nonlinearities is studied by showing potential ways to minimize the total nonlinearities. The nonlinear least-squares algorithm is proposed to optimize the PA parameters along with the input power level, and thereby minimize the total nonlinearities in the cascaded structure. The simulation results demonstrate that the performance of the optimized configurations for up to five PAs using the proposed framework can improve the linearity properties of the overall cascade.</description>

      <title>Low-Complexity Channel Estimation Protocol for Non-Diagonal RIS-Assisted Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19791v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) offer enhanced wireless signal manipulation over conventional RIS by enabling the incident signal on any of its $M$ elements to be reflected from another element via an $M \times M$ switch array. To fully exploit this flexible configuration, the acquisition of individual channel state information (CSI) is essential. However, due to the passive nature of the RIS, cascaded channel estimation is performed, as the RIS itself lacks signal processing capabilities. This entails estimating the CSI for the $M \times M$ switch array cascaded channels, resulting in estimating $M^2$ coefficients, to identify the optimal configuration of the non-diagonal RIS that maximizes the channel gain. In this paper, we propose a low-complexity channel estimation protocol that substantially reduces the estimation overhead from the exhaustive $M^2$ coefficients to only $3M$ coefficients for both single-input single-output (SISO) and multiple-input single-output (MISO) systems. Specifically, a three-stage pilot-based protocol is proposed to estimate scaled versions of the user-RIS and RIS-base-station (BS) channels in the first two stages using the least square (LS) estimator and the commonly used ON/OFF protocol for conventional RIS. These scaled estimates enable the optimization of the switch array. In the third stage, the cascaded user-RIS-BS channels are estimated to enable efficient beamforming optimization. Complexity analysis shows that our proposed protocol significantly reduces the BS estimation complexity from $\mathcal{O}(NM^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(NM)$, where $N$ is the number of BS antennas. This complexity is similar to the ON/OFF-based LS estimation for conventional diagonal RIS.</description>

      <title>Decoding Saccadic Eye Movements from Brain Signals Using an Endovascular Neural Interface</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07481v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An Oculomotor Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) records neural activity from regions of the brain involved in planning eye movements and translates this activity into control commands. While previous successful oculomotor BCI studies primarily relied on invasive microelectrode implants in non-human primates, this study investigates the feasibility of an oculomotor BCI using a minimally invasive endovascular Stentrode device implanted near the supplementary motor area in a patient with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). To achieve this, self-paced visually-guided and free-viewing saccade tasks were designed, in which the participant performed saccades in four directions (left, right, up, down), with simultaneous recording of endovascular EEG and eye gaze. The visually guided saccades were cued with visual stimuli, whereas the free-viewing saccades were self-directed without explicit cues. The results showed that while the neural responses of visually guided saccades overlapped with the cue-evoked potentials, the free-viewing saccades exhibited distinct saccade-related potentials that began shortly before eye movement, peaked approximately 50 ms after saccade onset, and persisted for around 200 ms. In the frequency domain, these responses appeared as a low-frequency synchronisation below 15 Hz. Classification of 'fixation vs. saccade' was robust, achieving mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) scores of 0.88 within sessions and 0.86 between sessions. In contrast, classifying saccade direction proved more challenging, yielding within-session AUC scores of 0.67 for four-class decoding and up to 0.75 for the best-performing binary comparisons (left vs. up and left vs. down). This proof-of-concept study demonstrates the feasibility of an endovascular oculomotor BCI in an ALS patient, establishing a foundation for future oculomotor BCI studies in human subjects.</description>

      <title>Computation Capacity Maximization for Pinching Antennas-Assisted Wireless Powered MEC Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07598v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper,we investigate a novel wireless powered mobile edge computing (MEC) system assisted by pinching antennas (PAs), where devices first harvest energy from a base station and then offload computation-intensive tasks to an MEC server. As an emerging technology, PAs utilize long dielectric waveguides embedded with multiple localized dielectric particles, which can be spatially configured through a pinching mechanism to effectively reduce large-scale propagation loss. This capability facilitates both efficient downlink energy transfer and uplink task offloading. To fully exploit these advantages, we adopt a non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) framework and formulate a joint optimization problem to maximize the system's computational capacity by jointly optimizing device transmit power, time allocation, PA positions in both uplink and downlink, and radiation control. To address the resulting non-convexity caused by variable coupling, we develop an alternating optimization algorithm that integrates particle swarm optimization (PSO) with successive convex approximation. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed PA-assisted design substantially improves both energy harvesting efficiency and computational performance compared to conventional antenna systems.</description>

      <title>Receiving RISs: Enabling Channel Estimation and Autonomous Configuration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10662v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This chapter focuses on a hardware architecture for semi-passive Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) and investigates its consideration for boosting the performance of Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) communication systems. The architecture incorporates a single or multiple radio-frequency chains to receive pilot signals via tunable absorption phase profiles realized by the metasurface front end, as well as a controller encompassing a baseband processing unit to carry out channel estimation, and consequently, the optimization of the RIS reflection coefficients. A novel channel estimation protocol, according to which the RIS receives non-orthogonal training pilot sequences from two multi-antenna terminals via tunable absorption phase profiles, and then, estimates the respective channels via its signal processing unit, is presented. The channel estimates are particularly used by the RIS controller to design the capacity-achieving reflection phase configuration of the metasurface front end. The proposed channel estimation algorithm, which is based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM), profits from the RIS random spatial absorption sampling to capture the entire signal space, and exploits the beamspace sparsity and low-rank properties of extremely large MIMO channels, which is particularly relevant for communication systems at the FR3 band and above. Our extensive numerical investigations showcase the superiority of the proposed channel estimation technique over benchmark schemes for various system and RIS hardware configuration parameters, as well as the effectiveness of using channel estimates at the RIS side to dynamically optimize the possibly phase-quantized reflection coefficients of its unit elements.</description>

      <title>A Smooshed BMOCZ Zero Constellation for CFO Estimation Without Channel Coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12599v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we propose a new binary modulation on conjugate-reciprocal zeros (BMOCZ) zero constellation, which we call smooshed binary modulation on conjugate-reciprocal zeros (SBMOCZ), to address carrier frequency offset (CFO)-induced zero rotation without depending on channel coding. In our approach, we modify the phase mapping of Huffman BMOCZ by shrinking the angle between adjacent zeros, except for the first and last, to introduce a gap in the zero constellation. By discerning the gap location in the received polynomial, the receiver can estimate and correct the phase rotation. We demonstrate the error rate performance of SBMOCZ relative to Huffman BMOCZ, showing that SBMOCZ addresses a CFO-induced rotation at the cost of a modest performance reduction compared to Huffman BMOCZ in the absence of a CFO. Finally, we compare SBMOCZ to Huffman BMOCZ using a cyclically permutable code (CPC), showing a 4 dB bit error rate (BER) improvement in a fading channel, while demonstrating comparable performance across other simulations.</description>

      <title>Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface Aided Vehicular Edge Computing: Joint Phase-shift Optimization and Multi-User Power Allocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13123v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vehicular edge computing (VEC) is an emerging technology with significant potential in the field of internet of vehicles (IoV), enabling vehicles to perform intensive computational tasks locally or offload them to nearby edge devices. However, the quality of communication links may be severely deteriorated due to obstacles such as buildings, impeding the offloading process. To address this challenge, we introduce the use of Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS), which provide alternative communication pathways to assist vehicular communication. By dynamically adjusting the phase-shift of the RIS, the performance of VEC systems can be substantially improved. In this work, we consider a RIS-assisted VEC system, and design an optimal scheme for local execution power, offloading power, and RIS phase-shift, where random task arrivals and channel variations are taken into account. To address the scheme, we propose an innovative deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework that combines the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm for optimizing RIS phase-shift coefficients and the Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MADDPG) algorithm for optimizing the power allocation of vehicle user (VU). Simulation results show that our proposed scheme outperforms the traditional centralized DDPG, Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) and some typical stochastic schemes.</description>

      <title>A Convex-Nonconvex Framework for Enhancing Minimization Induced Penalties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14819v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for nonconvex enhancement of minimization induced (MI) penalties while preserving the overall convexity of associated regularization models. MI penalties enable the adaptation to certain signal structures via minimization, but often underestimate significant components owing to convexity. To overcome this shortcoming, we design a generalized Moreau enhanced minimization induced (GME-MI) penalty by subtracting from the MI penalty its generalized Moreau envelope. While the proposed GME-MI penalty is nonconvex in general, we derive an overall convexity condition for the GME-MI regularized least-squares model. Moreover, we present a proximal splitting algorithm with guaranteed convergence to a globally optimal solution of the GME-MI model under the overall convexity condition. Numerical examples illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.</description>

      <title>A Survey on Semantic Communications in Internet of Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03767v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Internet of Vehicles (IoV), as the core of intelligent transportation system, enables comprehensive interconnection between vehicles and their surroundings through multiple communication modes, which is significant for autonomous driving and intelligent traffic management. However, with the emergence of new applications, traditional communication technologies face the problems of scarce spectrum resources and high latency. Semantic communication, which focuses on extracting, transmitting, and recovering some useful semantic information from messages, can reduce redundant data transmission, improve spectrum utilization, and provide innovative solutions to communication challenges in the IoV. This paper systematically reviews state of art of semantic communications in the IoV, elaborates the technical background of IoV and semantic communications, and deeply discusses key technologies of semantic communications in IoV, including semantic information extraction, semantic communication architecture, resource allocation and management, and so on. Through specific case studies, it demonstrates that semantic communications can be effectively employed in the scenarios of traffic environment perception and understanding, intelligent driving decision support, IoV service optimization, and intelligent traffic management. Additionally, it analyzes the current challenges and future research directions. This survey reveals that semantic communications has broad application prospects in IoV, but it is necessary to solve the real existing problems by combining advanced technologies to promote its wide application in IoV and contributing to the development of intelligent transportation system.</description>

      <title>Graph Neural Networks for Jamming Source Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03196v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph-based learning provides a powerful framework for modeling complex relational structures; however, its application within the domain of wireless security remains significantly underexplored. In this work, we introduce the first application of graph-based learning for jamming source localization, addressing the imminent threat of jamming attacks in wireless networks. Unlike geometric optimization techniques that struggle under environmental uncertainties and dense interference, we reformulate the localization as an inductive graph regression task. Our approach integrates structured node representations that encode local and global signal aggregation, ensuring spatial coherence and adaptive signal fusion. To enhance robustness, we incorporate an attention-based \ac{GNN} that adaptively refines neighborhood influence and introduces a confidence-guided estimation mechanism that dynamically balances learned predictions with domain-informed priors. We evaluate our approach under complex \ac{RF} environments with various sampling densities, network topologies, jammer characteristics, and signal propagation conditions, conducting comprehensive ablation studies on graph construction, feature selection, and pooling strategies. Results demonstrate that our novel graph-based learning framework significantly outperforms established localization baselines, particularly in challenging scenarios with sparse and obfuscated signal information.
