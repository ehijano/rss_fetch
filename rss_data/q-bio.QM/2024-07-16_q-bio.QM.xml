      <title>Implication of modelling choices on connectivity estimation: A comparative analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We focus on connectivity methods used to understand and predict how landscapes and habitats facilitate or impede the movement and dispersal of species. Our objective is to compare the implication of methodological choices at three stages of the modelling framework: landscape characterisation, connectivity estimation, and connectivity assessment. What are the convergences and divergences of different modelling approaches? What are the implications of their combined results for landscape planning? We implemented two landscape characterisation approaches: expert opinion and species distribution model (SDM); four connectivity estimation models: Euclidean distance, least-cost paths (LCP), circuit theory, and stochastic movement simulation (SMS); and two connectivity indices: flux and area-weighted flux (dPCflux). We compared outcomes such as movement maps and habitat prioritisation for a rural landscape in southwestern France. Landscape characterisation is the main factor influencing connectivity assessment. The movement maps reflect the models' assumptions: LCP produced narrow beams reflecting the optimal pathways; whereas circuit theory and SMS produced wider estimation reflecting movement stochasticity, with SMS integrating behavioural drivers. The indices highlighted different aspects: dPCflux the surface of suitable habitats and flux their proximity. We recommend focusing on landscape characterisation before engaging further in the modelling framework. We emphasise the importance of stochasticity and behavioural drivers in connectivity, which can be reflected using circuit theory, SMS or other stochastic individual-based models. We stress the importance of using multiple indices to capture the multi-factorial aspect of connectivity.</description>

      <title>Automated detection of gibbon calls from passive acoustic monitoring data using convolutional neural networks in the "torch for R" ecosystem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automated detection of acoustic signals is crucial for effective monitoring of vocal animals and their habitats across ecologically-relevant spatial and temporal scales. Recent advances in deep learning have made these approaches more accessible. However, there are few deep learning approaches that can be implemented natively in the R programming environment; approaches that run natively in R may be more accessible for ecologists. The "torch for R" ecosystem has made the use of transfer learning with convolutional neural networks accessible for R users. Here, we evaluate a workflow that uses transfer learning for the automated detection of acoustic signals from passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) data. Our specific goals include: 1) present a method for automated detection of gibbon calls from PAM data using the "torch for R" ecosystem; 2) compare the results of transfer learning for six pretrained CNN architectures; and 3) investigate how well the different architectures perform on datasets of the female calls from two different gibbon species: the northern grey gibbon (Hylobates funereus) and the southern yellow-cheeked crested gibbon (Nomascus gabriellae). We found that the highest performing architecture depended on the test dataset. We successfully deployed the top performing model for each gibbon species to investigate spatial of variation in gibbon calling behavior across two grids of autonomous recording units in Danum Valley Conservation Area, Malaysia and Keo Seima Wildlife Sanctuary, Cambodia. The fields of deep learning and automated detection are rapidly evolving, and we provide the methods and datasets as benchmarks for future work.</description>

      <title>Advances in the Simulation and Modeling of Complex Systems using Dynamical Graph Grammars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Dynamical Graph Grammar (DGG) formalism can describe complex system dynamics with graphs that are mapped into a master equation. An exact stochastic simulation algorithm may be used, but it is slow for large systems. To overcome this problem, an approximate spatial stochastic/deterministic simulation algorithm, which uses spatial decomposition of the system's time-evolution operator through an expanded cell complex (ECC), was previously developed and implemented for a cortical microtubule array (CMA) model. Here, computational efficiency is improved at the cost of introducing errors confined to interactions between adjacent subdomains of different dimensions, realized as some events occurring out of order. A rule instances to domains mapping function $\phi$, ensures the errors are local. This approach has been further refined and generalized in this work. Additional efficiency is achieved by maintaining an incrementally updated match data structure for all possible rule matches. The API has been redesigned to support DGG rules in general, rather than for one specific model. To demonstrate these improvements in the algorithm, we have developed the Dynamical Graph Grammar Modeling Library (DGGML) and a DGG model for the periclinal face of the plant cell CMA. This model explores the effects of face shape and boundary conditions on local and global alignment. For a rectangular face, different boundary conditions reorient the array between the long and short axes. The periclinal CMA DGG demonstrates the flexibility and utility of DGGML, and these new methods highlight DGGs' potential for testing, screening, or generating hypotheses to explain emergent phenomena.</description>

      <title>DMRIntTk: integrating different DMR sets based on density peak clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: \textbf{Background}: Identifying differentially methylated regions (DMRs) is a basic task in DNA methylation analysis. However, due to the different strategies adopted, different DMR sets will be predicted on the same dataset, which poses a challenge in selecting a reliable and comprehensive DMR set for downstream analysis. \textbf{Results}: Here, we develop DMRIntTk, a toolkit for integrating DMR sets predicted by different methods on a same dataset. In DMRIntTk, the genome is segmented into bins and the reliability of each DMR set at different methylation thresholds is evaluated. Then, the bins are weighted based on the covered DMR sets and integrated into DMRs by using a density peak clustering algorithm. To demonstrate the practicality of DMRIntTk, DMRIntTk was applied to different scenarios, including different tissues with relatively large methylation differences, cancer tissues versus normal tissues with medium methylation differences, and disease tissues versus normal tissues with subtle methylation differences. The results show that DMRIntTk can effectively trim the regions with small methylation differences in the original DMR sets and therefore it can enhance the proportion of DMRs with higher methylation differences. In addition, the overlap analysis suggests that the integrated DMR sets are quite comprehensive, and the functional analysis indicates the integrated disease-related DMR sets are significantly enriched in biological pathways, which are associated with the pathological mechanisms of the diseases. \textbf{Conclusions}: Conclusively, DMRIntTk can help researchers obtaining a reliable and comprehensive DMR set from many prediction methods. \textbf{Keywords}:{Differentially methylated regions, Methylation array, Cancer-related differentially methylated regions, Tissue-specific differentially methylated regions, Density peak clustering.}</description>

      <title>AI Detectors are Poor Western Blot Classifiers: A Study of Accuracy and Predictive Values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent rise of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) capable of creating scientific images presents a challenge in the fight against academic fraud. This study evaluates the efficacy of three free web-based AI detectors in identifying AI-generated images of Western blots, which is a very common technique in biology. We tested these detectors on a collection of artificial Western blot images (n=48) that were created using ChatGPT 4 DALLE 3 and on authentic Western blots (n=48) that were sampled from articles published within four biology journals in 2015; this was before the rise of generative AI based on large language models. The results reveal that the sensitivity (0.9583 for Is It AI, 0.1875 for Hive Moderation, and 0.7083 for Illuminarty) and specificity (0.5417 for Is It AI, 0.8750 for Hive Moderation, and 0.4167 for Illuminarty) are very different. Positive predictive values (PPV) across various AI prevalence were low, for example reaching 0.1885 for Is It AI, 0.1429 for Hive Moderation, and 0.1189 for Illuminarty at an AI prevalence of 0.1. This highlights the difficulty in confidently determining image authenticity based on the output of a single detector. Reducing the size of Western blots from four to two lanes reduced test sensitivities and increased test specificities but did not markedly affect overall detector accuracies and also only slightly improved the PPV of one detector (Is It AI). These findings strongly argue against the use of free AI detectors to detect fake scientific images, and they demonstrate the urgent need for more robust detection tools that are specifically trained on scientific content such as Western blot images.</description>

      <title>Methods for quantifying self-organization in biology: a forward-looking survey and tutorial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: From flocking birds to schooling fish, organisms interact to form collective dynamics across the natural world. Self-organization is present at smaller scales as well: cells interact and move during development to produce patterns in fish skin, and wound healing relies on cell migration. Across these examples, scientists are interested in shedding light on the individual behaviors informing spatial group dynamics and in predicting the patterns that will emerge under altered agent interactions. One challenge to these goals is that images of self-organization -- whether empirical or generated by models -- are qualitative. To get around this, there are many methods for transforming qualitative pattern data into quantitative information. In this tutorial chapter, I survey some methods for quantifying self-organization, including order parameters, pair correlation functions, and techniques from topological data analysis. I also discuss some places that I see as especially promising for quantitative data, modeling, and data-driven approaches to continue meeting in the future.</description>

      <title>Accelerating the inference of string generation-based chemical reaction models for industrial applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Template-free SMILES-to-SMILES translation models for reaction prediction and single-step retrosynthesis are of interest for industrial applications in computer-aided synthesis planning systems due to their state-of-the-art accuracy. However, they suffer from slow inference speed. We present a method to accelerate inference in autoregressive SMILES generators through speculative decoding by copying query string subsequences into target strings in the right places. We apply our method to the molecular transformer implemented in Pytorch Lightning and achieve over 3X faster inference in reaction prediction and single-step retrosynthesis, with no loss in accuracy.</description>

      <title>MKDTI: Predicting drug-target interactions via multiple kernel fusion on graph attention network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Drug-target relationships may now be predicted computationally using bioinformatics data, which is a valuable tool for understanding pharmacological effects, enhancing drug development efficiency, and advancing related research. A number of structure-based, ligand-based and network-based approaches have now emerged. Furthermore, the integration of graph attention networks with intricate drug target studies is an application area of growing interest. In our work, we formulate a model called MKDTI by extracting kernel information from various layer embeddings of a graph attention network. This combination improves the prediction ability with respect to novel drug-target relationships. We first build a drug-target heterogeneous network using heterogeneous data of drugs and targets, and then use a self-enhanced multi-head graph attention network to extract potential features in each layer. Next, we utilize embeddings of each layer to computationally extract kernel matrices and fuse multiple kernel matrices. Finally, we use a Dual Laplacian Regularized Least Squares framework to forecast novel drug-target entity connections. This prediction can be facilitated by integrating the kernel matrix associated with the drug-target. We measured our model's efficacy using AUPR and AUC. Compared to the benchmark algorithms, our model outperforms them in the prediction outcomes. In addition, we conducted an experiment on kernel selection. The results show that the multi-kernel fusion approach combined with the kernel matrix generated by the graph attention network provides complementary insights into the model. The fusion of this information helps to enhance the accuracy of the predictions.</description>

      <title>An Interpretable Neural Network for Vegetation Phenotyping with Visualization of Trait-Based Spectral Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Plant phenotyping is the assessment of a plant's traits and plant identification is the process of determining the category such as genus and species. In this paper we present an interpretable neural network trained on the UPWINS spectral library which contains spectra with rich metadata across variation in species, health, growth stage, annual variation, and environmental conditions for 13 selected indicator species and natural common background species. We show that the neurons in the network learn spectral indicators for chemical and physiological traits through visualization of the network weights, and we show how these traits are combined by the network for species identification with an accuracy around 90% on a test set. While neural networks are often perceived as `black box' classifiers, our work shows that they can be in fact more explainable and informative than other machine learning methods. We show that the neurons learn fundamental traits about the vegetation, for example the composition of different types of chlorophyll present which indicates species as well as response to illumination conditions. There is clear excess training capacity in our network, and we expect that as the UPWINS spectral library continues to grow the approach in this paper will provide further foundational insights in understanding plant traits. This provides a methodology for designing and interpreting neural networks on spectral data in general, and provides a framework for using neural networks with hyperspectral imagery for understanding vegetation that is extendable to other domains.</description>

      <title>Comparing AI versus Optimization Workflows for Simulation-Based Inference of Spatial-Stochastic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Model parameter inference is a universal problem across science. This challenge is particularly pronounced in developmental biology, where faithful mechanistic descriptions require spatial-stochastic models with numerous parameters, yet quantitative empirical data often lack sufficient granularity due to experimental limitations. Parameterizing such complex models thus necessitates methods that elaborate on classical Bayesian inference by incorporating notions of optimality and goal-orientation through low-dimensional objective functions that quantitatively capture the target behavior of the underlying system. In this study, we contrast two such inference workflows and apply them to biophysics-inspired spatial-stochastic models. Technically, both workflows are simulation-based inference (SBI) methods. The first method leverages a modern deep-learning technique known as sequential neural posterior estimation (SNPE), while the second is based on a classical optimization technique called simulated annealing (SA). We evaluate these workflows by inferring the parameters of two complementary models for the inner cell mass (ICM) lineage differentiation in the blastocyst-stage mouse embryo. This developmental biology system serves as a paradigmatic example of a highly robust and reproducible cell-fate proportioning process that self-organizes under strongly stochastic conditions, such as intrinsic biochemical noise and cell-cell signaling delays. Our results indicate that while both methods largely agree in their predictions, the modern SBI workflow provides substantially richer inferred distributions at an equivalent computational cost. We identify the computational scenarios that favor the modern SBI method over its classical counterpart. Finally, we propose a plausible approach to integrate these two methods, thereby synergistically exploiting their parameter space exploration capabilities.</description>

      <title>Role of Noise in the Fairen-Velarde model of bacterial respiration</title>

Abstract: Following our recent study (S. Kundu and M. Acharyya, International Journal of Modern Physics C, 35 (2024) 2450094), we have introduced stochasticity (random noise) in the Fairen-Velarde deterministic differential equations. The role of such noise on time scales is studied. The probability of reaching the domain of fixed points in a given interval is also calculated. The probability is studied as a function of the width of the noise, and a hyperbolic tangent fitting is proposed. The noise reduces the time scale for bringing the bacteria into an inactive state. The area of the fixed-point domain was found to be asympotically linear with noise. The time to reach the fixed-point domain is fitted to a Gaussian function with noise intensity.</description>

      <title>Solving the inverse problem of microscopy deconvolution with a residual Beylkin-Coifman-Rokhlin neural network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03239v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optic deconvolution in light microscopy (LM) refers to recovering the object details from images, revealing the ground truth of samples. Traditional explicit methods in LM rely on the point spread function (PSF) during image acquisition. Yet, these approaches often fall short due to inaccurate PSF models and noise artifacts, hampering the overall restoration quality. In this paper, we approached the optic deconvolution as an inverse problem. Motivated by the nonstandard-form compression scheme introduced by Beylkin, Coifman, and Rokhlin (BCR), we proposed an innovative physics-informed neural network Multi-Stage Residual-BCR Net (m-rBCR) to approximate the optic deconvolution. We validated the m-rBCR model on four microscopy datasets - two simulated microscopy datasets from ImageNet and BioSR, real dSTORM microscopy images, and real widefield microscopy images. In contrast to the explicit deconvolution methods (e.g. Richardson-Lucy) and other state-of-the-art NN models (U-Net, DDPM, CARE, DnCNN, ESRGAN, RCAN, Noise2Noise, MPRNet, and MIMO-U-Net), the m-rBCR model demonstrates superior performance to other candidates by PSNR and SSIM in two real microscopy datasets and the simulated BioSR dataset. In the simulated ImageNet dataset, m-rBCR ranks the second-best place (right after MIMO-U-Net). With the backbone from the optical physics, m-rBCR exploits the trainable parameters with better performances (from ~30 times fewer than the benchmark MIMO-U-Net to ~210 times than ESRGAN). This enables m-rBCR to achieve a shorter runtime (from ~3 times faster than MIMO-U-Net to ~300 times faster than DDPM). To summarize, by leveraging physics constraints our model reduced potentially redundant parameters significantly in expertise-oriented NN candidates and achieved high efficiency with superior performance.</description>

      <title>Injecting Hierarchical Biological Priors into Graph Neural Networks for Flow Cytometry Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18507v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the complex landscape of hematologic samples such as peripheral blood or bone marrow derived from flow cytometry (FC) data, cell-level prediction presents profound challenges. This work explores injecting hierarchical prior knowledge into graph neural networks (GNNs) for single-cell multi-class classification of tabular cellular data. By representing the data as graphs and encoding hierarchical relationships between classes, we propose our hierarchical plug-in method to be applied to several GNN models, namely, FCHC-GNN, and effectively designed to capture neighborhood information crucial for single-cell FC domain. Extensive experiments on our cohort of 19 distinct patients, demonstrate that incorporating hierarchical biological constraints boosts performance significantly across multiple metrics compared to baseline GNNs without such priors. The proposed approach highlights the importance of structured inductive biases for gaining improved generalization in complex biological prediction tasks.</description>
