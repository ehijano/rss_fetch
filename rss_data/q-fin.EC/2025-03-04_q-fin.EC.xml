      <title>Measure of Morality: A Mathematical Theory of Egalitarian Ethics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a rigorous mathematical framework for egalitarian ethics by integrating formal tools from economics and mathematics. We motivate the formalism by investigating the limitations of conventional informal approaches by constructing examples such as probabilistic variant of the trolley dilemma and comparisons of unequal distributions. Our formal model, based on canonical welfare economics, simultaneously accounts for total utility and the distribution of outcomes. The analysis reveals deficiencies in traditional statistical measures and establishes impossibility theorems for rank-weighted approaches. We derive representation theorems that axiomatize key inequality measures including the Gini coefficient and a generalized Atkinson index, providing a coherent, axiomatic foundation for normative philosophy.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Employee Education and Health on Firm-Level TFP in China</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines the influence of employee education and health on firm-level Total Factor Productivity (TFP) in China, using panel data from A-share listed companies spanning from 2007 to 2022. The analysis shows that life expectancy and higher education have a significant impact on TFP. More optimal health conditions can result in increased productivity through decreased absenteeism and improved work efficiency. Similarly, higher levels of education can support technological adaptation, innovation, and managerial efficiency. Nevertheless, the correlation between health and higher education indicates that there may be a point where further improvements in health yield diminishing returns in terms of productivity for individuals with advanced education. These findings emphasise the importance of implementing comprehensive policies that improve both health and education, maximising their impact on productivity. This study adds to the current body of research by presenting empirical evidence at the firm-level in China. It also provides practical insights for policymakers and business leaders who want to improve economic growth and competitiveness. Future research should take into account wider datasets, more extensive health metrics, and delve into the mechanisms that contribute to the diminishing returns observed in the relationship between health and education.</description>

      <title>The effect of remote work on urban transportation emissions: evidence from 141 cities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The overall impact of working from home (WFH) on transportation emissions remains a complex issue, with significant implications for policymaking. This study matches socioeconomic information from American Community Survey (ACS) to the global carbon emissions dataset for selected Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) in the US. We analyze the impact of WFH on transportation emissions before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Employing cross-sectional multiple regression models and Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition, we examine how WFH, commuting mode, and car ownership influence transportation emissions across 141 MSAs in the United States. We find that the prevalence of WFH in 2021 is associated with lower transportation emissions, whereas WFH in 2019 did not significantly impact transportation emissions. After controlling for public transportation usage and car ownership, we find that a 1% increase in WFH corresponds to a 0.17 kilogram or 1.8% reduction of daily average transportation emissions per capita. The Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition shows that WFH is the main driver in reducing transportation emissions per capita during the pandemic. Our results show that the reductive influence of public transportation on transportation emissions has declined, while the impact of car ownership on increasing transportation emissions has risen. Collectively, these results indicate a multifaceted impact of WFH on transportation emissions. This study underscores the need for a nuanced, data-driven approach in crafting WFH policies to mitigate transportation emissions effectively.</description>

      <title>Keynesian Beauty Contest in Morocco's Public Procurement Reform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines the recent reform of Morocco's public procurement market through the lens of Keynesian beauty contest theory. The reform introduces a mechanism akin to a guessing-the-average game, where bidders attempt to estimate a reference price, which in turn impacts bidding strategies. We utilize this setup to empirically test key hypotheses within auction theory, specifically the roles of common knowledge and bounded rationality. Our findings indicate potential manipulation risks under the current rules, suggesting that a shift to a median criterion could improve robustness and reduce the likelihood of manipulation. This work contributes to the broader understanding of strategic interactions in procurement and offers a foundation for future research on improving fairness and efficiency in public contract allocation.</description>

      <title>Using firm-level supply chain networks to measure the speed of the energy transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While many national and international climate policies clearly outline decarbonization targets and the timelines for achieving them, there is a notable lack of effort to objectively monitor progress. A significant share of the transition from fossil fuels to low-carbon energy will be borne by industry and the economy, requiring both the decarbonization of the electricity grid and the electrification of industrial processes. But how quickly are firms adopting low-carbon electricity? Using a unique dataset on Hungary\textquotesingle{}s national supply chain network, we analyze the energy portfolios of 27,067 firms, covering more than 80% of gas, 70% of electricity, and 50% of oil consumption between 2020 and 2023. This enables us to objectively measure the trends of decarbonization efforts at the firm level. Although more than half of firms have increased their share of low-carbon electricity, many have reduced it. Extrapolating the observed trends, we find a transition of only 20% of total energy consumption to low-carbon electricity by 2050. The current speed of transition in the economy is not sufficient to reach climate neutrality by 2050. If firms would adopt the same efforts as the decarbonization frontrunners in their industry, a low-carbon energy share of up to 86% could be reached, putting climate targets within reach. As a key barrier, we identify a \textquotesingle{}lock-in\textquotesingle{} effect, where firms with a high ratio of fossil fuel costs per revenue are less likely to transition. Accelerating the energy transition will require targeted policies that address these barriers, ensuring that firms can align their decarbonization strategies with best practices.</description>

      <title>Policy Design in Long-Run Welfare Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Improving social welfare is a complex challenge requiring policymakers to optimize objectives across multiple time horizons. Evaluating the impact of such policies presents a fundamental challenge, as those that appear suboptimal in the short run may yield significant long-term benefits. We tackle this challenge by analyzing the long-term dynamics of two prominent policy frameworks: Rawlsian policies, which prioritize those with the greatest need, and utilitarian policies, which maximize immediate welfare gains. Conventional wisdom suggests these policies are at odds, as Rawlsian policies are assumed to come at the cost of reducing the average social welfare, which their utilitarian counterparts directly optimize. We challenge this assumption by analyzing these policies in a sequential decision-making framework where individuals' welfare levels stochastically decay over time, and policymakers can intervene to prevent this decay. Under reasonable assumptions, we prove that interventions following Rawlsian policies can outperform utilitarian policies in the long run, even when the latter dominate in the short run. We characterize the exact conditions under which Rawlsian policies can outperform utilitarian policies. We further illustrate our theoretical findings using simulations, which highlight the risks of evaluating policies based solely on their short-term effects. Our results underscore the necessity of considering long-term horizons in designing and evaluating welfare policies; the true efficacy of even well-established policies may only emerge over time.</description>

      <title>Privacy vs. Profit: The Impact of Google's Manifest Version 3 (MV3) Update on Ad Blocker Effectiveness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Google's recent update to the manifest file for Chrome browser extensions-transitioning from manifest version 2 (MV2) to manifest version 3 (MV3)-has raised concerns among users and ad blocker providers, who worry that the new restrictions, notably the shift from the powerful WebRequest API to the more restrictive DeclarativeNetRequest API, might reduce ad blocker effectiveness. Because ad blockers play a vital role for millions of users seeking a more private and ad-free browsing experience, this study empirically investigates how the MV3 update affects their ability to block ads and trackers. Through a browser-based experiment conducted across multiple samples of ad-supported websites, we compare the MV3 to MV2 instances of four widely used ad blockers. Our results reveal no statistically significant reduction in ad-blocking or anti-tracking effectiveness for MV3 ad blockers compared to their MV2 counterparts, and in some cases, MV3 instances even exhibit slight improvements in blocking trackers. These findings are reassuring for users, indicating that the MV3 instances of popular ad blockers continue to provide effective protection against intrusive ads and privacy-infringing trackers. While some uncertainties remain, ad blocker providers appear to have successfully navigated the MV3 update, finding solutions that maintain the core functionality of their ad blockers.</description>

      <title>Extending the Range of Robust PCE Inflation Measures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.12494v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Robust inflation measures gauge inflation behavior by excluding volatile expenditure categories from headline inflation. We evaluate the forecasting performance of a wide set of such measures between 1970 and 2024, including core, median, and trimmed mean personal-consumption-expenditure (PCE) inflation. Core inflation performs significantly worse than official median and trimmed mean inflation. Among a set of alternative trimmed mean measures, there is no single best trim based on forecasting performance: A wide set of trims generates statistically indistinguishable average errors. Nonetheless, different trims imply different predictions for trend inflation in any given month, within a range of 0.5 to 1 percentage points. In tracking trend inflation, this range and its midpoint outperform all trimmed mean inflation measures, suggesting the use of the range of inflation implied by the set of near-optimal trims as a valuable complement to any single inflation measure.</description>

      <title>Can AI Detect Wash Trading? Evidence from NFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.18717v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Existing studies on crypto wash trading often use indirect statistical methods or leaked private data, both with inherent limitations. This paper leverages public on-chain NFT data for a more direct and granular estimation. Analyzing three major exchanges, we find that ~38% (30-40%) of trades and ~60% (25-95%) of traded value likely involve manipulation, with significant variation across exchanges. This direct evidence enables a critical reassessment of existing indirect methods, identifying roundedness-based regressions \`a la Cong et al. (2023) as most promising, though still error-prone in the NFT setting. To address this, we develop an AI-based estimator that integrates these regressions in a machine learning framework, significantly reducing both exchange- and trade-level estimation errors in NFT markets (and beyond).</description>

      <title>Natural Capital as a Stock Option</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14041v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The unfolding climate crisis is a physical manifestation of the damage that market economy, driven by the high intensity consumption of fossil fuels, has inflicted on the Earth System and on the stability conditions that were established by a complex conjugation of natural factors during the Holoecene. The magnitude of the human activities and its predatory nature is such that it is no longer possible to consider the Earth System and the services it provides for the habitability of the planet, the so-called natural capital, as an economical externality. Thus one is left with two main choices in what concerns the sustainability of the planet's habitability: radical economic degrowth or highly efficient solutions to internalise the maintenance and the restoration of ecosystems and the services of the Earth System. It is proposed that an interesting strategy for the latter is to consider the natural capital as a stock option.</description>

      <title>Nonparametric Estimation of Matching Efficiency and Elasticity on a Private On-the-Job Search Platform: Evidence from Japan, 2014-2024</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17011v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I use proprietary data from the online job scouting platform BizReach in Japan, spanning from 2014 to 2024, to estimate the matching function for high-skill employed workers on a private on-the-job search platform, employing a novel nonparametric approach developed by Lange and Papageorgiou (2020). This analysis is compared to the public off-the-job search platform, Hello Work. The results indicate that matching efficiency on the private platform is both more volatile and higher than that of the public platform, suggesting the increasing popularity of the private platform. The matching elasticity with respect to users consistently hovers around 0.75, while the elasticity with respect to vacancies reaches approximately 1.0, indicating a higher and more balanced elasticity compared to the Hello Work platform. Additionally, the study reveals evidence of industry-level heterogeneity on the private platform.</description>

      <title>Democratising Agricultural Commodity Price Forecasting: The AGRICAF Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20363v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ensuring food security is a critical global challenge, particularly for low-income countries where food prices impact the access to nutritious food. The volatility of global agricultural commodity (AC) prices exacerbates food insecurity, with international trade restrictions and market disruptions further complicating the situation. Despite online platforms for monitoring food prices, there is a significant gap in providing detailed explanations and forecasts accessible to non-specialists. To address this, we propose the Agricultural Commodity Analysis and Forecasts (AGRICAF) methodology, integrating explainable machine learning (XML) and econometric techniques to analyse and forecast global agricultural commodity prices up to one year ahead, dynamically adapting to different forecast horizons. This innovative integration allows us to model complex interactions and dynamics while providing clear, interpretable results. This paper demonstrates how AGRICAF can be used, applying it to three major agricultural commodities - maize, soybean, and wheat - and explaining how different factors impact prices across various months and forecast horizons. By facilitating access to accurate and interpretable medium-term forecasts of AC prices, AGRICAF can contribute to developing a fair and sustainable food system.</description>

      <title>An Instrumental Variables Approach to Testing Firm Conduct</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05022v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding firm conduct is crucial for industrial organization and antitrust policy. In this article, we develop a testing procedure based on the Rivers and Vuong non-nested model selection framework. Unlike existing methods that require estimating the demand and supply system, our approach compares the model fit of two first-stage price regressions. Through an extensive Monte Carlo study, we demonstrate that our test performs comparably to, or outperforms, existing methods in detecting collusion across various collusive scenarios. The results are robust to model misspecification, alternative functional forms for instruments, and data limitations. By simplifying the diagnosis of firm behavior, our method provides an efficient tool for researchers and regulators to assess industry conduct. Additionally, our approach offers a practical guideline for enhancing the strength of BLP-style instruments in demand estimation: once collusion is detected, researchers are advised to incorporate the product characteristics of colluding partners into own-firm instruments while excluding them from other-firm instruments.</description>
