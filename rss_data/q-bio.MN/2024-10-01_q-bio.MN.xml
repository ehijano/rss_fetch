      <title>Identifying Key Genes in Cancer Networks Using Persistent Homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying driver genes is crucial for understanding oncogenesis and developing targeted cancer therapies. Driver discovery methods using protein or pathway networks rely on traditional network science measures, focusing on nodes, edges, or community metrics. These methods can overlook the high-dimensional interactions that cancer genes have within cancer networks. This study presents a novel method using Persistent Homology to analyze the role of driver genes in higher-order structures within Cancer Consensus Networks derived from main cellular pathways. We integrate mutation data from six cancer types and three biological functions: DNA Repair, Chromatin Organization, and Programmed Cell Death. We systematically evaluated the impact of gene removal on topological voids ($\beta_2$ structures) within the Cancer Consensus Networks. Our results reveal that only known driver genes and cancer-associated genes influence these structures, while passenger genes do not. Although centrality measures alone proved insufficient to fully characterize impact genes, combining higher-order topological analysis with traditional network metrics can improve the precision of distinguishing between drivers and passengers. This work shows that cancer genes play an important role in higher-order structures, going beyond pairwise measures, and provides an approach to distinguish drivers and cancer-associated genes from passenger genes.</description>

      <title>AgentBasedModeling.jl: a tool for stochastic simulation of structured population dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Agent-based models capture heterogeneity among individuals in a population and are widely usedin studies of multi-cellular systems, disease, epidemics and demography to name a few. However, existing frameworks consider discrete time-step simulation or assume that agents' states only change as a result of discrete events. In this note, we present AgentBasedModeling.jl, a Julia package for simulating stochastic agent-based population models in continuous time. The tool allows to easily specify and simulate agents evolving through generic continuous-time jump-diffusions and interacting via continuous-rate processes. AgentBasedModeling.jl provides a powerful methodology for studying the effects of stochasticity on structured population dynamics.</description>

      <title>Active learning of digenic functions with boolean matrix logic programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14487v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We apply logic-based machine learning techniques to facilitate cellular engineering and drive biological discovery, based on comprehensive databases of metabolic processes called genome-scale metabolic network models (GEMs). Predicted host behaviours are not always correctly described by GEMs. Learning the intricate genetic interactions within GEMs presents computational and empirical challenges. To address these, we describe a novel approach called Boolean Matrix Logic Programming (BMLP) by leveraging boolean matrices to evaluate large logic programs. We introduce a new system, $BMLP_{active}$, which efficiently explores the genomic hypothesis space by guiding informative experimentation through active learning. In contrast to sub-symbolic methods, $BMLP_{active}$ encodes a state-of-the-art GEM of a widely accepted bacterial host in an interpretable and logical representation using datalog logic programs. Notably, $BMLP_{active}$ can successfully learn the interaction between a gene pair with fewer training examples than random experimentation, overcoming the increase in experimental design space. $BMLP_{active}$ enables rapid optimisation of metabolic models and offers a realistic approach to a self-driving lab for microbial engineering.</description>

      <title>Divergence asymmetry and connected components in a general duplication-divergence graph model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16943v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This Letter introduces a generalization of known duplication-divergence models for growing random graphs. This general duplication-divergence model includes a new coupled divergence asymmetry rate, which allows to obtain the structure of random growing networks by duplication-divergence in a continuous range of configurations between two known limit cases (1) complete asymmetric divergence, i.e., divergence rates affect only edges of either the original or the copy vertex, and (2) symmetric divergence, i.e., divergence rates affect equiprobably both the original and the copy vertex. Multiple connected sub-graphs (of order greater than one) (of order greater than one) emerge as the divergence asymmetry rate slightly moves from the complete asymmetric divergence case. Mean-field results of priorly published models are nicely reproduced by this generalization. In special cases, the connected components size distribution $C_s$ suggests a power-law scaling of the form $C_s \sim s^{-\lambda}$ for $s&gt;1$, e.g., with $\lambda \approx 5/3$ for divergence rate $\delta \approx 0.7$.</description>
