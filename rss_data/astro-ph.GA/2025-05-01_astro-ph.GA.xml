      <title>Discrepancies Between Limits and Measurements of Warm Dark Matter Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A limit on the expansion parameter a_hNR at which dark matter becomes non-relativistic has been obtained from the observed minimum halo mass hosting Milky Way satellites. This limit is in disagreement with measurements. In the present study, we attempt to understand this disagreement. We find that the limit does not include the following phenomena: non-linear regeneration of the power spectrum of density perturbations, the stripping of galaxy halos by neighboring galaxies, and baryons that act as cold dark matter. Considering these phenomena, we find that there is no longer a significant discrepancy between the limit and the measurements.</description>

      <title>Stacking PANCAKEZ: sPectroscopic Analysis with NirspeC stAcKs in the Epoch of reioniZation. Weak ISM Absorption and Implications for Ionizing Photon Escape at $z\sim7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a spectral stacking analysis of galaxies at $z\geq6$ observed with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). We curate a sample of $64$ galaxies spanning redshifts $z_{\rm spec} = 6.0 - 9.4$ which have NIRSpec medium resolution data. The stacks achieve sufficient signal-to-noise to measure equivalent widths (EW) and velocity centroids ($v_{\rm{cen}}$) of low-ionization species (LIS) absorption features, transmitted Lyman-alpha ($\rm{Ly\alpha}$) emission, and nebular emission lines. Overall, we find our sample has weaker LIS absorption lines ($\rm{EW}(\rm{LIS}) \approx 1 \r{A}$), smaller $v_{\rm{cen,LIS}} \approx -20 \pm 50~ \rm{km} \; \rm{s}^{-1}$, and significantly suppressed $\rm{Ly\alpha}$ emission ($\rm{EW}(\rm{Ly\alpha}) \approx 5~\r{A}$), compared to similar studies undertaken at lower redshift. The weaker LIS absorption may suggest a lower covering fraction of HI and larger escape fraction of ionizing photons from our sample. Additionally, the smaller blueshifted $v_{\rm{cen,LIS}}$ indicates less prevalent or weaker outflows in $z&gt;6$ galaxies. Stacking our sub-sample of $\rm{Ly\alpha}$ emitters (LAEs), we find high EW$(\rm{H}\beta) \approx 170 \pm 4~\r{A}$ and a detection of nebular $\rm{C}\; \rm{IV}$ emission suggesting higher $\xi_{ion}$ in LAEs at $z&gt;6$. This work showcases the enormous potential for stacked JWST spectra revealing properties of galaxies and their diffuse interstellar medium in the epoch of reionization.</description>

      <title>Automated detection and modeling of binary microlensing events in OGLE-IV data. I. Events with well-separated bumps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational microlensing depends primarily on the lens mass and presents a larger occurrence rate in crowded regions, which makes it the best tool to uncover the initial mass function (IMF) of low-mass stars in the Galactic bulge. The bulge IMF can be obtained from the luminosity function measured with the Hubble Space Telescope if one knows the statistics of binary stellar systems in the bulge. We aim to analyse a statistically significant number of binary-lens/single-source and single-lens/binary-source events, in order to explore the lower-mass end of the bulge IMF even in unresolved binary systems. This paper deals with events with clearly separated bumps and no caustic crossing or approach, whereas other types will be analysed in following works. A fully-automated approach in the search and modeling of binary events was implemented. Event detection was carried out with a modified version of the algorithm used in previous studies. Model fitting was carried out with Markov chain Monte Carlo and nested sampling methods, in order to find the most probable solution among binary lens or binary source models. We retrieved 107 binary events in Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) light curves spanning ten years in 9 high-cadence and 112 low-cadence fields towards the bulge. Several criteria were applied to reduce false positives, resulting in 55 most likely binary lenses and 52 binary sources. The tools were effective detecting a bona-fide sample of binary events, with a distribution of Einstein timescales around 35-40 days and flat distributions for mass ratio and source flux ratio. After proper consideration of detection efficiency, the statistics for binary fraction and mass ratio will provide valuable constraints for the bulge IMF.</description>

      <title>A New High-latitude H I Cloud Complex Entrained in the Northern Fermi Bubble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the discovery of eleven high-velocity HI clouds at Galactic latitudes of 25-30 degrees, likely embedded in the Milky Way's nuclear wind. The clouds are detected with deep Green Bank Telescope 21 cm observations of a $3.2^\circ \times 6.2^\circ$ field around QSO 1H1613-097, located behind the northern Fermi Bubble. Our measurements reach $3\sigma$ limits on $ N_{\mathrm{HI}}$ as low as $3.1 \times 10^{17}$ cm$^{-2}$, more than twice as sensitive as previous HI studies of the Bubbles. The clouds span $-180 \leq v_{\mathrm{LSR}} \leq -90$ km/s and are the highest-latitude 21 cm HVCs detected inside the Bubbles. Eight clouds are spatially resolved, showing coherent structures with sizes of 4-28 pc, peak column densities of $\log(N_{\mathrm{HI}}/\mathrm{cm}^2) = 17.9\text{-}18.7$, and HI masses up to 1470 $M_\odot$. Several exhibit internal velocity gradients. Their presence at such high latitudes is surprising, given the short expected survival times for clouds expelled from the Galactic Center. These objects may be fragments of a larger cloud disrupted by interaction with the surrounding hot gas.</description>

      <title>Predicting Potential Host Galaxies of Supermassive Black Hole Binaries Based on Stellar Kinematics in Archival IFU Surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) at the centers of galaxies emit continuous gravitational waves (GWs) at nanohertz frequencies, and ongoing pulsar timing array (PTA) experiments aim to detect the first individual system. Identifying the exact host galaxy of a SMBHB detected in GWs is paramount for a variety of multi-messenger science cases, but it will be challenging due to the large number of candidate galaxies in the sky localization region. Here, we apply recent insights on the distinct characteristics of SMBHB host galaxies to archival galaxy datasets, to predict which nearby massive galaxies are most likely to host SMBHBs detectable by PTAs. Specifically, we use archival galaxy IFU surveys to search for nearby galaxies with distinct stellar kinematic signatures of SMBHB host galaxies, as informed by cosmological simulations. These distinct stellar kinematic signatures, including slow rotation and strong kinematic/photometric misalignments, are a hallmark of recent major galaxy mergers that led to the formation of SMBHBs in these galaxies. We produce a list of nearby massive galaxies that may currently host SMBHBs, ranked by a combination of their host galaxy stellar kinematic properties and their hypothetical GW strain. We discuss how our ranked list can be used (1) for targeted searches for individual sources of continuous GWs by PTAs, (2) to corroborate candidate SMBHBs identified through other approaches, and (3) to select candidate recoiling AGN and closely-separated (&lt;100 pc) dual AGN for telescope follow-up confirmation.</description>

      <title>Dust in the Smith Cloud? A UV Investigation into the Smith Cloud's Gas-Phase Abundance Patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Smith Cloud is a high-velocity cloud (HVC) on its final approach to the Milky Way that shows evidence of interaction with the Galaxy's disk. We investigate the metallicity and gas-phase chemical depletion patterns in this HVC using UV absorption-line observations toward two background QSOs taken with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST)/Cosmic Origin Spectrograph (COS) and H I 21-cm emission-line observations taken with Green Bank Telescope (GBT). We find evidence of silicon gas-phase depletion with [Si/S]$=\,-0.72^{+0.26}_{-0.24}$ and [Si/O]$_{3\sigma}\,\lesssim\,-0.05$, implying the presence of dust within the Smith Cloud. Because dust is galactic in origin, this HVC could trace the return leg of a Galactic fountain or a dwarf galaxy that passed through the Galactic plane.</description>

      <title>Reevaluating UMa3/U1: star cluster or the smallest known galaxy?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21301v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ursa Major III/UNIONS 1 (UMa3/U1) is the faintest Milky Way satellite discovered to date, exhibiting a half-light radius of 3 $\pm$ 1 pc and an absolute V-band magnitude of +2.2 $\pm$ 0.4. Previous studies suggest UMa3/U1 is a dwarf galaxy, based on its large internal velocity dispersion and the improbability (indicated by dynamical cluster simulations) of its long-term survival if it were a dark-matter-free star cluster. In this paper, we model the evolution of UMa3/U1 as a star cluster using collisional N-body simulations that include a description of stellar evolution and the external tidal field of the Milky Way, with some simulations including primordial binaries. We find that UMa3/U1 has a substantial remaining lifetime of 2.7 $\pm$ 0.4 Gyr, primarily due to the retention of compact stellar remnants within the cluster. This retention is facilitated by mass segregation and the preferential loss of low-mass stars. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the observed large velocity dispersion of UMa3/U1 can be successfully reproduced. These results support the possibility that UMa3/U1 is a self-gravitating star cluster. Our simulations reveal that modelling UMa3/U1 as a dark matter free star cluster produces a markedly altered present-day mass function, driven by a strong depletion of low-mass stars. However, the degree of mass segregation among the visible stars is not statistically significant. We therefore recommend that future observations of UMa3/U1 and other very small Milky Way satellites focus on measuring their present-day mass functions to determine their nature.</description>

      <title>The Intermediate-Mass Black Hole Reverberation Mapping Project: First Detection of Mid-Infrared Lags in Prototypical IMBHs in NGC 4395 and POX 52</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The search for robust evidence of intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) is crucial for understanding black hole seeding process and the formation of supermassive black holes in the early Universe. NGC 4395 and POX 52 are two prototypical IMBH hosts, both exhibiting multi-line evidence of low-mass black hole activity. Here, we report the first detection of mid-infrared (MIR) lags in response to optical variability, with measurements of $3.0^{+2.4}_{-1.9}$ days for NGC 4395 and $35.2^{+14.2}_{-11.7}$ days for POX~52 at $3.4$ $\mu$m, respectively, using archival optical data and observations from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE). This detection provides the first reverberation evidence of low-mass black hole activity in POX 52. The time lags of these two low-mass, low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGNs) generally follow the extent of the $R_{\rm dust}-L_{\rm 5100}$ relation found in higher-mass AGNs. Based on an empirical relation between the broad-line region and dusty torus size, we constrain the black hole mass of POX 52 to log($M_{\rm BH}$/$M_\odot$) = 5.5 $\pm$ 0.37 (systemic and statistical errors), confirming its IMBH nature. Furthermore, long-term optical continuum monitoring of POX 52 reveals a mild inter-band lag of $\lesssim$ 1 day. However, no significant intranight variability was detected during its one-night, high-cadence monitoring, which we attribute to the longer duty cycle of fast variability in POX 52 compared to that in NGC 4395.</description>

      <title>Modelling JWST mid-infrared counts II: Extension to 5.6 {\mu}m, optical, radio and X-rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Paper I (Rowan-Robinson 2024), models derived in 2009 to fit mid-infrared (8-24 micron) source counts from the IRAS, ISO and Spitzer missions, were found to provide an excellent fit to deep counts at 7.7-21 mu with JWST, demonstrating that the evolution of dusty star-forming galaxies is well understood. Here the treatment of optical spectral energy distributions (SEDs) is improved and the counts are extended to 5.6 mu and optical wavelengths. The models proved a good fit to the latest, deeper, JWST counts. The models are also extended to radio and X-ray wavelengths. Predicted redshift distributions are given for a range of wavelengths and flux-densities.</description>

      <title>A Sequoia stellar candidate with very high 7Li and 9Be</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aims. The metal-poor star BPM 3066 belongs to the retrograde halo and presents unexpectedly strong spectral features of lithium. To gain insight into the origin of this peculiar abundance, we investigate the chemistry and kinematic properties of this star. Methods. We performed a local thermodynamic equilibrium chemical abundance analysis of UVES/VLT high-resolution spectra of BPM 3066 using ATLAS9 and ATLAS12 model atmospheres and the MyGIsFOS code. We further characterised the orbital properties of the star by integrating its orbit and analysing its integrals of motion using the galpy code. Results. The star BPM 3066 shows an exceptional overabundance of both lithium and beryllium. The abundances are A(Li) = 3.0 and A(Be) = 2.1, which are respectively about 0.8 and 2.2 dex higher than the Li and Be abundances expected at [Fe/H] = -1.5, the metallicity of the star. The observed ratio 7Li/9Be is 7.9, which is close to that expected from a synthesis by spallation processes. Overabundances of Si, Al, and of the neutron capture elements Sr,Y, Zr, and Ba are also measured. Kinematically, BPM 3066 has an eccentric, strongly retrograde orbit, confined to a height lower than 1 kpc from the galactic plane, and it is a candidate member of the Sequoia/Thamnos accreted galaxy. Conclusions. The processes leading to the 7Li and 9Be synthesis could have occurred in the environment of a hypernova. This is supported by some abundance anomalies like the high value of Si, [Si/Fe]=1.2 and [Si/O]=1.1. However, the simultaneous high values of N, Na, Al, Sc, Ti, and Cu are at odds with the expectations from a hypernova. Alternatively, the abundances of BPM 3066 could result from the engulfing of rocky planets that were rich in spallated Li and Be. In both cases, it is remarkable that such an extreme abundance pattern has been found in a star belonging to the Sequoia/Thamnos accreted galaxy.</description>

      <title>Parameter Inference of Black Hole Images using Deep Learning in Visibility Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using very long baseline interferometry, the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) collaboration has resolved the shadows of two supermassive black holes. Model comparison is traditionally performed in image space, where imaging algorithms introduce uncertainties in the recovered structure. Here, we develop a deep learning framework to perform parameter inference in visibility space, directly using the data measured by the interferometer without introducing potential errors and biases from image reconstruction. First, we train and validate our framework on synthetic data derived from general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD) simulations that vary in magnetic field state, spin, and $R_\mathrm{high}$. Applying these models to the real data obtained during the 2017 EHT campaign, and only considering total intensity, we do not derive meaningful constraints on either of these parameters. At present, our method is limited both by theoretical uncertainties in the GRMHD simulations and variation between snapshots of the same underlying physical model. However, we demonstrate that spin and $R_\mathrm{high}$ could be recovered using this framework through continuous monitoring of our sources, which mitigates variations due to turbulence. In future work, we anticipate that including spectral or polarimetric information will greatly improve the performance of this framework.</description>

      <title>Modification of Newtonian Gravity: Implications for Hot Gas in Clusters and Galactic Angular Momentum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In view of the negative results from various dark matter detection experiments, we had earlier proposed an alternate theoretical framework through Modification of Newtonian Gravity (MONG). Here, the Poison's equation is modified by introducing an additional gravitational self-energy density term along with the usual dark energy density term. In this work we extend this model to account for the presence of low-density gas at high temperatures (10^8 K) in the intra cluster medium (ICM) by estimating the velocities to which particles will be subjected by the modified gravitational force. Considering that the ICM is under the influence of the cluster's gravity, particle velocities of the ions in the ICM must be balanced by the cluster's gravitational force. The particle velocities obtained for various clusters from their temperature profiles match the velocity produced by the MONG gravitational force. Thus, the increase in the gravitational potential at the outskirts of galaxies balances the thermal pressure of the ICM, maintaining hydrostatic equilibrium without invoking DM. The effect of MONG on the angular momentum of galaxies is also studied by obtaining a scaling relation between the angular momentum and the mass of a galaxy. MONG predicts a higher dependence on mass in comparison to the \Lambda-CDM model. This increased dependence on mass compensates for the halo contribution to the angular momentum. The angular momentum from MONG for galaxies from the SPARC database is compared to the halo angular momentum by a Chi-square fit technique. The correlation coefficient is found to be unity, showing a replicable result.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Colour-Magnitude Relations for White Dwarf Stars in SDSS Photometry</title>

Abstract: In this study, colour-magnitude relations (CMRs) for DA-type white dwarfs in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) photometric system were investigated. For this purpose, the SDSS data for 20,247 white dwarf stars, as provided in the study by Anguiano et al. (2017), were matched with the Gaia third data release (Gaia DR3) catalogue to obtain trigonometric parallax ($\varpi$) data. The SDSS $ugriz$ magnitudes of the stars were corrected for interstellar extinction using dust maps provided for the Milky Way, and distances from the Sun to the stars were calculated. The SDSS magnitudes were thus corrected for the effects of interstellar extinction. For the calibration of the stars, 5,516 white dwarf stars were selected, with apparent magnitudes brighter than $g_0=21$ mag and relative parallax errors measured to better than $\sigma_\varpi/\varpi=0.1$. Subsequently, three separate CMRs were derived for the absolute magnitudes $M_{\rm g}$, $M_{\rm r}$, and $M_{\rm i}$, each calibrated to two-colour indices. The coefficient of determination ($R^2$) of the obtained CMRs are highly reliable in the bf range of 0.86 to 0.95. Moreover, the standard deviations of the differences between the absolute magnitudes obtained from the relations and the original ones of the calibration stars range from 0.26 to 0.37 mag.</description>

      <title>Kiloparsec-scale turbulence driven by reionization may grow intergalactic magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The intergalactic medium (IGM) underwent intense heating that resulted in pressure disequilibrium in the wake of ionization fronts during cosmic reionization. The dynamical relaxation to restore pressure balance may have driven small-scale turbulence and, hence, the amplification of intergalactic magnetic fields. We investigate this possibility using a suite of $\approx 100$ pc resolution radiation-hydrodynamics simulations of IGM gas dynamics. We show that as the spatial resolution improves beyond that achieved with most prior studies, much of the IGM becomes turbulent unless it was pre-heated to $\gg 100~$K before reionization. In our most turbulent simulations, we find that the gas energy spectrum follows the expected $k^{-5/3}$ Kolmogorov scaling to the simulation's resolution, and the eddy turnover time of the turbulence is $&lt; 1$ Gyr at $k \approx 1 ~$kpc$^{-1}$. Turbulence will grow magnetic fields, and we show that the fields grown by reionization-driven turbulence could explain lower limits on IGM B-field strengths from observations of TeV blazars.</description>

      <title>The case of AT2022wtn: a Tidal Disruption Event in an interacting galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the results from our multi-wavelength monitoring campaign of the transient AT2022wtn, discovered by the Zwicky Transient Facility in the nucleus of SDSSJ232323.79+104107.7, the less massive galaxy in an active merging pair with a mass ratio of ~10:1. AT2022wtn shows spectroscopic and photometric properties consistent with a X-ray faint N-strong TDE-H+He with a number of peculiarities. Specifically, a 30-days long plateau at maximum luminosity, a corresponding dip in temperature and the development of a double-horned N III+ He II line profile. Strong and time-evolving velocity offsets in the TDE broad emission lines and the detection of a transient radio emission, indicate the presence of outflows. Overall, the observed properties are consistent with the full disruption of a low-mass star by a ~10$^{6}$ M$_{\odot}$ SMBH followed by an efficient disk formation and the launch of a quasi-spherical reprocessing envelope of fast expanding outflowing material. The observed differences between the He II and the Hydrogen and N III lines can be explained either with a spatial separation of the lines emitting region or with a late-time reveal of shocks from the returning debris streams, as the photosphere recedes. Finally, we present an extensive analysis of the hosting environment and discuss the implications for the discovery of two TDEs in interacting galaxy pairs, finding indication for an over-representation of TDEs in these systems. The AT2022wtn host galaxy properties suggest that it is in the early stages of the merger, therefore we may be witnessing the initial enhanced rate of TDEs in interacting galaxies before the post-starburst phase.</description>

      <title>The Formation of Protoplanetary Disks through Pre-Main Sequence Bondi-Hoyle Accretion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07334v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Protoplanetary disks are traditionally described as finite mass reservoirs left over by the gravitational collapse of the protostellar core, a view that strongly constrains both disk evolution and planet formation models. We propose a different scenario where protoplanetary disks of pre-main sequence stars are primarily assembled by Bondi-Hoyle accretion from the parent gas cloud. We demonstrate that Bondi-Hoyle accretion can supply not only the mass, but also the angular momentum necessary to explain the observed size of protoplanetary disks. Additionally, we predict how the specific angular momentum of protoplanetary disks scales with stellar mass. Our conclusions are based on a new analytical derivation of the scaling of the angular momentum in turbulent flows, which we confirm with a numerical simulation of supersonic turbulence. A key outcome of our analysis is the recognition that density fluctuations in supersonic turbulence--previously overlooked in studies of cloud and core rotation--lead to a significant increase in angular momentum at disk-forming scales. This revised understanding of disk formation and evolution alleviates several longstanding observational discrepancies and compels substantial revisions to current models of disk and planet formation.</description>

      <title>Genesis-Metallicity: Universal Non-Parametric Gas-Phase Metallicity Estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07455v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce genesis-metallicity, a gas-phase metallicity measurement python software employing the direct and strong-line methods depending on the available oxygen lines. The non-parametric strong-line estimator is calibrated based on a kernel density estimate in the 4-dimensional space of O2 = [O II]$\lambda\lambda 3727,29$/H$\beta$; O3 = [O III]$\lambda 5007$/H$\beta$; H$\beta$ equivalent width EW(H$\beta$); and gas-phase metallicity $12 + \log$(O/H). We use a calibration sample of 1510 galaxies at $0 &lt; z &lt; 10$ with direct-method metallicity measurements, compiled from the JWST/NIRSpec and ground-based observations. In particular, we report 122 new NIRSpec direct-method metallicity measurements at $z &gt; 1$. We show that the O2, O3, and EW(H$\beta$) measurements are sufficient for a gas-phase metallicity estimate that is more accurate than 0.09 dex. Our calibration is universal, meaning that its accuracy does not depend on the target redshift. Furthermore, the direct-method module employs a non-parametric ${\rm T}_{\rm e}$(O II) electron temperature estimator based on a kernel density estimate in the 5-dimensional space of O2, O3, EW(H$\beta$), ${\rm T}_{\rm e}$(O III), and ${\rm T}_{\rm e}$(O II). This ${\rm T}_{\rm e}$(O II) estimator is calibrated based on 1004 spectra with detections of both [O III]$\lambda 4363$ and [O II]$\lambda\lambda 7320,30$, notably reporting 20 new NIRSpec detections of the [O II]$\lambda\lambda 7320,30$ doublet. We make genesis-metallicity and its calibration data publicly available and commit to keeping both up-to-date in light of the incoming data.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Galaxy-halo Size Relations on Galaxy Clustering Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13484v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Galaxies come in different sizes and morphologies, and these differences are thought to correlate with properties of their underlying dark matter halos. However, identifying the specific halo property that controls the galaxy size is a challenging task, especially because most halo properties depend on one another. In this work, we demonstrate this challenge by studying how the galaxy-halo size relations impact the galaxy clustering signals. We investigate the reason that a simple linear relation model, which prescribes that the galaxy size is linearly proportional to the dark matter halo's virial radius, can still produce clustering signals that match the observational data reasonably well. We find that this simple linear relation model for galaxy sizes, when combined with the subhalo abundance matching technique, introduces an implicit dependence on the halo formation history. As a result, the effect of halo assembly bias enters the resulting galaxy clustering, especially at lower stellar masses, producing a clustering signal that resembles the observed one. At higher stellar masses, the effect of halo assembly bias weakens and is partially canceled out by the effect of halo bias, and the clustering of large and small galaxies becomes more similar. This combined effect implies that small and large galaxies not only occupy halos of different masses, but they must also occupy halos of different assembly histories. Our study highlights the challenge of identifying a particular halo property that controls galaxy sizes through constraints from galaxy clustering alone.</description>

      <title>Magnetic fields limit the mass of Population III stars even before the onset of protostellar radiation feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12734v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The masses of Population III stars are largely unconstrained since no simulations exist that take all relevant primordial star formation physics into account. We perform the first suite of radiation magnetohydrodynamics (RMHD) simulations of Population III star formation, with the POPSICLE project. Compared to control simulations that only include magnetic fields (MHD), protostellar ionizing and dissociating feedback, or neither, the RMHD simulation best resembles the MHD simulation during the earliest stages of collapse and star formation. In $5000\,\rm{yrs}$, the mass of the most massive star is $65\,\rm{M_{\odot}}$ in the RMHD simulation, compared to $120\,\rm{M_{\odot}}$ in simulations without magnetic fields. This difference arises because magnetic fields act against gravity, suppress mass transport, and reduce compressional heating. The maximum stellar mass of Population III stars is thus already limited by magnetic fields, even before accretion rates drop to allow significant protostellar radiative feedback. Following classical main sequence stellar evolution with MESA reveals that it is difficult to create Population III stars with masses larger than $600\,\rm{M_{\odot}}$ in typical dark matter minihaloes at $z \gtrsim 20$, with maximum stellar masses $\sim 100\,\rm{M_{\odot}}$ more likely due to expected negative feedback from both magnetic fields and stellar radiation. This work lays the first step in building a full physics-informed mass function of Population III stars.</description>

Abstract: The properties of black holes and accretion flows can be inferred by fitting Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) data to simulated images generated through general relativistic ray tracing (GRRT). However, due to the computationally intensive nature of GRRT, the efficiency of generating specific radiation flux images needs to be improved. This paper introduces the Branch Correction Denoising Diffusion Model (BCDDM), which uses a branch correction mechanism and a weighted mixed loss function to improve the accuracy of generated black hole images based on seven physical parameters of the radiatively inefficient accretion flow (RIAF) model. Our experiments show a strong correlation between the generated images and their physical parameters. By enhancing the GRRT dataset with BCDDM-generated images and using ResNet50 for parameter regression, we achieve significant improvements in parameter prediction performance. This approach reduces computational costs and provides a faster, more efficient method for dataset expansion, parameter estimation, and model fitting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12612v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The total mass of a galaxy group, such as the Milky Way (MW) and the Andromeda Galaxy (M 31), is typically determined from the kinematics of satellites within their virial zones. Bahcall and Tremaine (1981) proposed the $v^2r$ estimator as an alternative to the virial theorem. In this work, we extend their approach by incorporating the three-dimensional spatial distribution of satellites within the system to improve the reliability and accuracy of galaxy mass estimates. Applying this method to a comprehensive dataset of Local Group satellites based on recent, high-precision distance measurements, we estimate the total mass of the MW to be $(7.9 \pm 2.3) \times 10^{11}$ $M_\odot$ and that of M~31 to be $(15.5 \pm 3.4) \times 10^{11}$ $M_\odot$. The effectiveness of the method is constrained by the precision of distance measurements, making it particularly well suited for the Local Group, but challenging to apply to more distant systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13842v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Peculiar Velocity Survey aims to measure the peculiar velocities of early and late type galaxies within the DESI footprint using both the Fundamental Plane and optical Tully-Fisher relations. Direct measurements of peculiar velocities can significantly improve constraints on the growth rate of structure, reducing uncertainty by a factor of approximately 2.5 at redshift 0.1 compared to the DESI Bright Galaxy Survey's redshift space distortion measurements alone. We assess the quality of stellar velocity dispersion measurements from DESI spectroscopic data. These measurements, along with photometric data from the Legacy Survey, establish the Fundamental Plane relation and determine distances and peculiar velocities of early-type galaxies. During Survey Validation, we obtain spectra for 6698 unique early-type galaxies, up to a photometric redshift of 0.15. 64\% of observed galaxies (4267) have relative velocity dispersion errors below 10\%. This percentage increases to 75\% if we restrict our sample to galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts below 0.1. We use the measured central velocity dispersion, along with photometry from the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys, to fit the Fundamental Plane parameters using a 3D Gaussian maximum likelihood algorithm that accounts for measurement uncertainties and selection cuts. In addition, we conduct zero-point calibration using the absolute distance measurements to the Coma cluster, leading to a value of the Hubble constant, $H_0 = 76.05 \pm 0.35$(statistical) $\pm 0.49$(systematic FP) $\pm 4.86$(statistical due to calibration) $\mathrm{km \ s^{-1} Mpc^{-1}}$. This $H_0$ value is within $2\sigma$ of Planck Cosmic Microwave Background results and within $1\sigma$, of other low redshift distance indicator-based measurements.</description>

      <title>The Effects of Dark Matter Annihilation and Dark Matter-Baryon Velocity Offsets at Cosmic Dawn</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10626v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dark matter annihilation has the potential to leave an imprint on the properties of the first luminous structures at Cosmic Dawn as well as the overall evolution of the intergalactic medium (IGM). In this work, we employ a semi-analytic method to model dark matter annihilation during Cosmic Dawn (approximately redshift $z=20$ to $40$), examining potential modifications to IGM evolution as well as gas collapse, cooling, and star formation in mini-halos. Our analysis takes into account the effects of dark matter-baryon velocity offsets, utilizing the public 21cmvFAST code, and producing predictions for the 21cm global signal. The results from our simplified model suggest that dark matter annihilation can suppress the gas fraction in small halos and alter the molecular cooling process, while the impact on star formation might be positive or negative depending on parameters of the dark matter model as well as the redshift and assumptions about velocity offsets. This underscores the need for more comprehensive simulations of the effects of exotic energy injection at Cosmic Dawn as observational probes are providing us new insights into the process of reionization and the formation of first stars and galaxies.</description>

      <title>A JWST project on 47 Tucanae: kinematics, energy equipartition and anisotropy of multiple populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03140v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent work with JWST has demonstrated its capability to identify and chemically characterize multiple populations in globular clusters down to the H-burning limit. In this study, we explore the kinematics of multiple populations in the globular cluster 47 Tucanae by combining data from JWST, HST, Gaia, and ground-based telescopes. We analyzed velocity dispersion and anisotropy profiles from the cluster center out to $\sim$10$R_h$. Our findings indicate that while first population (1G) stars' motions are isotropic, second population (2G) stars' motions are significantly radially anisotropic. These results align with the predictions of simulations of the dynamical evolution of clusters where 2G stars are initially more centrally concentrated than 1G stars. Furthermore, we subdivided the 2G population into two subpopulations: $2G_A$ and $2G_B$, with the latter being more chemically extreme. We compared their dynamical profiles and found no significant differences. For the first time, we measured the degree of energy equipartition among the multiple populations of 47 Tucanae. Overall, within the analyzed radial range ($\sim$2-4$R_h$), both populations exhibit a low degree of energy equipartition. The most significant differences between 1G and 2G stars are observed in the tangential velocity component, where 2G stars are characterized by a stronger degree of energy equipartition than 1G stars. In the radial component, the behavior of 1G and 2G stars is more variable, with differences largely dependent on radius. Moreover, our analysis reveals that the ratio of rotational velocity to velocity dispersion is larger for the 2G population. Finally, we found that 1G stars exhibit higher skewness in their tangential proper motions than 2G stars, providing additional evidence of kinematic differences between the two stellar generations.</description>

Abstract: The gas masses of protoplanetary disks are important but elusive quantities. In this work we present new ALMA observations of N2H+ (3-2) for 11 exoALMA disks. N2H+ is a molecule sensitive to CO freeze-out and has recently been shown to significantly improve the accuracy of gas masses estimated from CO line emission. We combine these new observations with archival N2H+ and CO isotopologue observations to measure gas masses for 19 disks, predominantly from the exoALMA Large program. For 15 of these disks the gas mass has also been measured using gas rotation curves. We show that the CO + N2H+ line emission-based gas masses typically agree with the kinematically measured ones within a factor 3 (1-2{\sigma}). Gas disk masses from CO + N2H+ are on average a factor 2.3(+0.7,-1.0) x lower than the kinematic disk masses, which could suggest slightly lower N2 abundances and/or lower midplane ionization rates than typically assumed. Herbig disks are found to have ISM level CO gas abundances based on their CO and N2H+ fluxes, which sets them apart from T-Tauri disks where abundances are typically 3-30x lower. The agreement between CO + N2H+ -based and kinematically measured gas masses is promising and shows that multi-molecule line fluxes are a robust tool to accurately measure disk masses at least for extended disks.</description>

      <title>A Time-Dependent Solution for GSN 069 Disk Evolution: The Nature of 'Long-Lived' TDEs and Implications for QPE Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20148v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the implementation of a fully time-dependent relativistic disk model - based on the light curve fitting package FitTeD - into the X-ray spectral fitting environment, pyXspec. This implementation enables simultaneous fitting of multi-epoch and multi-wavelength spectral data, where the only free parameters are those describing the black hole and the initial conditions, while the subsequent evolution is fully governed by the dynamical equations of an evolving accretion flow. We apply the model to fit seven epochs of X-ray spectra and two epochs of UV spectra of the 'long-lived' tidal disruption event (TDE) and quasi-periodic eruption (QPE) source GSN 069, spanning from its discovery in 2010 through late-2019. Our results show that such 'long-lived', X-ray-bright TDEs - of which GSN 069 is a prime, but not unique, example-can be naturally explained within the same framework as events with shorter-lived X-ray emission, such as ASASSN-14li and AT2019dsg. Their key distinction lies in the 'viscous' timescale parameter - tied to the disk's stress and angular momentum transport efficiency - which should be treated as a free parameter when modeling the disk evolution of transient events. We examine the implications for QPE models by tracking the time evolution of disk properties such as mass surface density and accretion rate. We show that existing QPE models cannot reproduce the observed connection between the presence (e.g., 2018) or absence (e.g., 2014) of eruptions and disk properties. In the context of orbiter-disk collision models, the change in mass surface density appears insufficient to explain the needed variation in the eruption's temperature. The absence of eruptions in GSN 069 in 2014 remains a major challenge for QPE models.</description>
