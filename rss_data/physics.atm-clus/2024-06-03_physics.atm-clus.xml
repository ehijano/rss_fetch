      <title>Revisiting Artifacts of Kohn-Sham Density Functionals for Biosimulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the problem of unphysical charge density delocalization/fractionalization induced by the self-interaction error of common approximate Kohn-Sham Density Functional Theory functionals on simulation of small to medium-size proteins in vacuum. Aside from producing unphysical electron densities and total energies, the vanishing of the HOMO-LUMO gap associated with the unphysical charge delocalization leads to an unphysical low-energy spectrum and catastrophic failure of most popular solvers for the Kohn-Sham (KS) self-consistent field (SCF) problem. We apply a robust quasi-Newton SCF solver [Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 26, 6557 (2024)] to obtain solutions for some of these difficult cases. The anatomy of the charge delocalization is revealed by the natural deformation orbitals obtained from the density matrix difference between the Hartree-Fock and KS solutions; the charge delocalization can occur not only between charged fragments (such as in zwitterionic polypeptides) but also may involve neutral fragments. The vanishing-gap phenomenon and troublesome SCF convergence are both attributed to the unphysical KS Fock operator eigenspectra of molecular fragments (e.g., amino acids or their side chains). Analysis of amino acid pairs suggests that the unphysical charge delocalization can be partially ameliorated by the use of {\em some} range-separated hybrid functionals, but not by semilocal or standard hybrid functionals. Last, we demonstrate that solutions without the unphysical charge delocalization can be located even for semilocal KS functionals highly prone to such defects, but such solutions have non-Aufbau character and are unstable with respect to mixing of the non-overlapping "frontier" orbitals.</description>

      <title>Specific versus Nonspecific Solvent Interactions of a Biomolecule in Water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.08217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.08217v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Solvent interactions, particularly hydration, are vital in chemical and biochemical systems. Model systems unveil microscopic details of such interactions. We uncover a specific hydrogen-bonding motif of the biomolecular building block indole (C$_8$H$_7$N), tryptophan's chromophore, in water: a strong localized $\text{N-H}\cdots\text{OH}_2$ hydrogen bond, alongside unstructured solvent interactions. This insight is revealed from a combined experimental and theoretical analysis of indole's electronic structure in aqueous solution. We have recorded the complete X-ray photoemission and Auger spectrum of aqueous-phase indole, quantitatively explaining all peaks through \emph{ab initio} modeling. The efficient and accurate technique for modeling valence and core photoemission spectra involves the maximum-overlap method and the non-equilibrium polarizable-continuum model. A two-hole electron-population analysis quantitatively describes the Auger spectra. Core-electron binding energies for nitrogen and carbon highlight the specific interaction with a hydrogen-bonded water molecule at the N-H group and otherwise nonspecific solvent interactions.</description>
