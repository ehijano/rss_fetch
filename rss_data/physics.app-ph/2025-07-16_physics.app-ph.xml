      <title>Real-time, Adaptive Radiological Anomaly Detection and Isotope Identification Using Non-negative Matrix Factorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spectroscopic anomaly detection and isotope identification algorithms are integral components in nuclear nonproliferation applications such as search operations. The task is especially challenging in the case of mobile detector systems due to the fact that the observed gamma-ray background changes more than for a static detector system, and a pretrained background model can easily find itself out of domain. The result is that algorithms may exceed their intended false alarm rate, or sacrifice detection sensitivity in order to maintain the desired false alarm rate. Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) has been shown to be a powerful tool for spectral anomaly detection and identification, but, like many similar algorithms that rely on data-driven background models, in its conventional implementation it is unable to update in real time to account for environmental changes that affect the background spectroscopic signature. We have developed a novel NMF-based algorithm that periodically updates its background model to accommodate changing environmental conditions. The Adaptive NMF algorithm involves fewer assumptions about its environment, making it more generalizable than existing NMF-based methods while maintaining or exceeding detection performance on simulated and real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>Realization of Friedrich-Wintgen QBIC with high Q-factors based on acoustic-solid coupling and sensing applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, bound states in the continuum (BICs) have attracted extensive attentions in the sensing field due to their theoretically ultra-high resonance quality factors (Q-factors). Among them, Friedrich-Wintgen (F-W) BICs, which arise from the interference between different coupled modes, are particularly promising for acoustic sensing applications owing to the easy realization. Most existing F-W BICs are realized in open systems through the interference between waveguides and resonant cavities. However, with increasing demands for higher resolution and sensitivity in modern chemical and biological sensing, the practically measured Q-factors of conventional open-system F-W BICs often fall short of expectations.In this work, we introduce F-P resonance via acoustic-solid coupling to explore the formation mechanism and realization method of high-Q F-W BICs in quasi-closed systems, and further investigate their application in gas sensing. A coupled resonator model combining elastic and acoustic waves in a quasi-closed cavity is first established. Coupled mode theory is employed to calculate the eigenmodes of both localized and radiative modes. Based on this, the Hamiltonian matrix of the coupled system is constructed, from which the acoustic transmission spectrum is derived. The results show that the Q-factor of the F-W BIC induced by acoustic-solid coupling is significantly higher than that of open systems, which is further validated by experiments.Based on this, a gas concentration sensing technique based on acoustic-solid coupled F-W BIC behavior is developed. A sensing device is fabricated accordingly, and gas concentration measurements are carried out. Experimental results demonstrate a pronounced response to gases with different concentrations, confirming the feasibility and reliability of this novel gas sensing approach.</description>

      <title>An eco-friendly universal strategy via ribavirin to achieve highly efficient and stable perovskite solar cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The grain boundaries of perovskite films prepared by the solution method are highly disordered, with a large number of defects existing at the grain boundaries. These defect sites promote the decomposition of perovskite. Here, we use ribavirin obtained through bacillus subtilis fermentation to regulate the crystal growth of perovskite, inducing changes in the work function and energy level structure of perovskite, which significantly reduces the defect density. Based on density functional theory calculations, the defect formation energies of VI, VMA, VPb, and PbI in perovskite are improved. This increases the open-circuit voltage of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/perovskite/PCBM/BCP/Ag) from 1.077 to 1.151 V, and the PCE increases significantly from 17.05% to 19.86%. Unencapsulated PSCs were stored in the environment (humidity approximately 35+-5%) for long-term stability testing. After approximately 900 hours of storage, the PCE of the ribavirin-based device retains 84.33% of its initial PCE, while the control-based device retains only 13.44% of its initial PCE. The PCE of PSCs (ITO/SnO2/perovskite/Spiro-OMETAD/Ag) is increased from 20.16% to 22.14%, demonstrating the universality of this doping method. This universal doping strategy provides a new approach for improving the efficiency and stability of PSCs using green molecular doping strategies.</description>

      <title>Tunable magnon emission from a nano-optomagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growing demand for dense, energy-efficient, and high-frequency signal processing continues to drive device miniaturization. While downscaling remains a central challenge, magnons offer a promising solution as nanoscale signal carriers, supporting broadband operation from GHz to THz without moving charge carriers and generating Joule heating. However, their integration at the nanoscale is limited by conventional electrical excitation based on coplanar waveguides, which require metal pads few to hundreds of micrometres in size. Here, we demonstrate tunable magnon emission into a yttrium iron garnet film by focusing microwave-modulated laser light onto an integrated Au nanodisc. Using inelastic light scattering spectroscopy, we observe magnons whose frequencies match the optical modulation frequencies in the GHz frequency regime. The largest magnon amplitudes are found for circularly polarized laser light and specific nanodisc diameters consistent with a plasmon-enhanced inverse Faraday effect. These results establish plasmonic nanoantennas as reconfigurable nanoscale magnon sources, enabling broadband signal generation governed entirely by optical modulation.</description>

      <title>Effective quality factor of mechanical resonators under complex-frequency excitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of mechanical resonators subject to excitations comprising of an oscillating or harmonic part, whose amplitude decays exponentially in time. We call these complex frequency excitations and show that the resulting response is quasi-steady, i.e. after an appropriate transform, the response of the new variable corresponds to the steady state behavior under a harmonic excitation. A procedure is presented to determine the amplitude-frequency response and effective quality factor based on this steady-state behavior. Optimal excitations are identified for both single and multi-degree of freedom systems that result in the amplitude-frequency response approaching that of an undamped system. The feasibility of the proposed method is verified through numerical simulations. Experiments with cantilever beams made of acrylic show a 54-fold increase in the effective quality factor. Our method does not involve any structural modifications and opens avenues for improving detection sensitivity in nondestructive testing and enhancing resolution in micro- and nano-electromechanical sensors.</description>

      <title>Indium Hydroxide Ceramic Targets: A Breakthrough in High-Mobility Thin-Film Transistor Technology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thin-film transistors composed of a hydrogen-containing indium oxide active layer are promising candidates for backplane devices in next-generation flat panel displays, offering higher definition and faster operation. However, the hydrogen incorporation process during film deposition poses challenges for scalable and industrial development due to both safety and controllability issues. Here, we demonstrate that using indium hydroxide ceramic as the target material for film deposition overcomes the difficulties associated with hydrogen gas usage. We sintered commercially available indium hydroxide powder using a conventional ceramic process at 150-250{\deg}C in air and utilized it for the deposition of hydrogen-incorporated indium oxide films via pulsed laser deposition. The resulting indium oxide films, after thermal annealing, contained a sufficient concentration of hydrogen and exhibited very high electron mobility due to significantly grown grains. Furthermore, we confirmed that the fabricated thin-film transistors exhibited comparably high performance to those produced using the gas-phase hydrogen incorporation method. This approach offers a practical pathway for hydrogen-containing indium oxide-based thin-film transistors in next-generation flat panel displays.</description>

      <title>Silicon nitride on-chip C-band spontaneous emission generation based on lanthanide doped microparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of active light-emitting elements into planar photonic circuits on a silicon nitride platform remains challenging due to material incompatibilities and high-temperature processing. Proposed hybrid method embeds monodisperse luminescent particles into lithographically defined wells above a 200 nm-thick silicon nitride taper coupler. A fabrication process involving wells etching, particle deposition, and planarization enables precise integration while maintaining waveguide integrity. When pumped at 950 nm with a diode laser, the device emits broadband radiation in the 1500-1600 nm range, covering the optical telecommunication C-band. Numerical simulations yield an average coupling efficiency of 0.25% into the fundamental waveguide mode, suggesting significant potential for further device optimization. The approach provides a scalable route for integrating broadband telecommunications emitters on a silicon nitride platform.</description>

      <title>Temporally-multiplexed dual-frequency terahertz imaging at kilohertz frame rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a temporally-multiplexed dual-colour terahertz (THz) imaging technique using THz-to-optical conversion in atomic vapour. By rapidly alternating the pump laser frequency, we sequentially excite two atomic states, each absorbing a different THz frequency: 0.5 THz and 1.1 THz. Each THz field induces optical fluorescence at a distinct wavelength, enabling the creation of a sequence of alternating, interleaved images for each frequency. Synchronizing the laser switching with camera acquisition allows video capture at 1,000 frames per second for both frequencies. The system's speed is limited only by laser power and fibre switching hardware. The presented method can be scaled to image more THz frequencies through the addition of further laser frequencies, paving the way for THz hyperspectral imaging in many real-world settings.</description>

      <title>The Influence of V-Defects, Leakage, and Random Alloy Fluctuations on the Carrier Transport in Red InGaN MQW LEDs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19020v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Red InGaN-based light-emitting diodes (LEDs) exhibit lower internal quantum efficiencies (IQEs) than violet, blue, and green InGaN LEDs due to a reduction in radiative recombination rates relative to non-radiative recombination rates as the indium composition increases. Additionally, the larger polarization and band offset barriers between high indium content InGaN quantum wells and GaN quantum barriers increase the forward voltage. In blue and green LEDs, random alloy fluctuations and V-defects play a key role in reducing the forward voltage. When V-defects are present, either naturally or intentionally introduced, they create an alternative path for carrier injection into the MQWs through the V-defect sidewalls. This injection mechanism explains the turn-on voltages of green LEDs. However, in InGaN red LEDs, these two phenomena do not reduce the forward voltage as effectively as in blue and green LEDs, and consequently, the computed forward voltage remains significantly higher than the measured one. Furthermore, currents are observed at low voltages before the turn-on voltage (\(V &lt; \hbar\omega/e = 2.0 \, \text{V}\)) of red LEDs. To address this, we introduce dislocation-induced tail states in the modeling, suggesting that leakage current through these states may play a significant role both below and at turn-on voltages. The simulation also indicates that leakage carriers below turn-on accumulate, partially diffuse in the QWs, screen the polarization-induced barrier in the low injection regime, and further reduce the forward voltage. Despite these beneficial effects, a drawback of dislocation-induced tail states is the enhanced nonradiative recombination in the dislocation line region. This study provides a detailed analysis of device injection physics in InGaN QW red LEDs and outlines potential optimization strategies.</description>

      <title>Strategy for Bayesian Optimized Beam Steering at TRIUMF-ISAC's MEBT and HEBT Beamlines</title>

Abstract: In preparation for operation of multiple Rare Isotope Beams (RIBs) when the Advanced Rare Isotope Laboratory (ARIEL) becomes operational, TRIUMF embarked on a program of advanced beam tuning applications and machine learning tools. The strategy for operationalizing Bayesian Optimization for beam steering purposes is being developed. A previously reported centroid correction algorithm is used to tune accelerated charged particle beams at TRIUMF's ISAC postaccelerator facility. We present findings and results from multiple machine development experiments conducted between October and November 2024, as part of a pivot toward semi-automated machine tuning methods. These findings were instrumental in shaping the tuning strategy for the medium and high energy beam transport (MEBT, HEBT) lines at ISAC, by sequentially optimizing sub-sections of the beamlines.</description>

      <title>High efficiency, high quality factor active membrane metasurfaces with extended Kerker effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10260v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficient, low-power, and highly integrated optoelectronic devices remain a critical yet challenging goal.Here, we introduce the extended Kerker effect paradigm that synergizes Kerker's condition with quasi-bound states in the continuum (q-BICs) to overcome these limitations. By engineering dual-mode dispersion, we achieve a high efficiency beam deflector using a membrane metasurface, simultaneously realizing robust parameter tolerance and narrow-linewidth resonances-two typically conflicting properties.Our experiment demonstrates an absolute beam deflection efficiency exceeding 92%, with exceptional spectral and spatial selectivity, including a 4 GHz linewidth, a 2.8o divergence angle, and a quality factor of 114. Additionally, it enables 94% transmission intensity modulation at a pump intensity as low as 0.5 W/cm2 in experiments. The extended Kerker effect provides a scalable platform for energy-efficient and integrable optoelectronic devices, paving the way for transformative advancements in next-generation wireless communications and LiDAR.</description>
