      <title>Accurate transition and hyperfine data in Ag I from Multiconfiguration Dirac-Hartree-Fock and Relativistic Coupled-Cluster methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Silver is a key tracer of the weak r-process in late-type stars. However, when the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) needs to be relaxed, accurate abundance determinations become even more sensitive to complete sets of reliable transition data. The aim of this work is to provide accurate and extensive results of excitation energies, radiative transition and hyperfine data for Ag I. The Multiconfiguration Dirac-Hartree-Fock (MCDHF) and relativistic coupled-cluster (RCC) methods were used in the present work. The quantitative and qualitative evaluation (QQE) approach is applied to the MCDHF transition rates to estimate the uncertainty according to the National Institute of Science and Technology Atomic Spectroscopic Data (NIST ASD) terminology. Excitation energies, transition data and hyperfine structure constants were calculated for $18$ states up to $4d^{10}8s$. $57$ electric dipole (E1) transition rates and weighted oscillator strengths are computed and estimated to be in the following NIST ASD uncertainty classes; $4$ in AA, $12$ in A+, $5$ in A, $13$ in B+, $6$ in B, $4$ in C+ with AA $\leq 1\%$, A+ $\leq 2\%$, A $\leq 3\%$, B+ $\leq 7\%$, B $\leq 10\%$, C+ $\leq 18\%$. The remaining transitions, mainly weak transitions involving the $4d^95s^2$ states, are estimated to be in the E class $&gt;50\%$. The computed lifetimes from both the MCDHF and RCC methods are in good mutual agreement and mostly fall within the error bars of available experimental values from laser induced fluorescence (LIF) measurements. The $4d^95s^2~^2D_{5/2}$ metastable state, important for establishing the ionization balance, decay through an E2 transition to the ground state. The calculated lifetime is $163\,\mathrm{ms}$. The computed hyperfine interaction constants from the MCDHF and RCC methods are in good agreement and compare well with the scattered experimental constants.</description>

      <title>Tune-out wavelength for the thulium atom near 576 nm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the theoretical prediction and measurement of a tune-out wavelength for the ground state of the thulium atom in a linearly polarized optical dipole trap with a wavelength of approximately 576 nm. The measurements were conducted using a combination of trap frequency and RF loss spectroscopy, thus making it possible to separate the scalar and tensor parts of the total polarizability without measurements in the range of negative total polarizability. The calculated tune-out wavelength is consistent with the measured one of $575.646_{-0.014}^{+0.016}$ nm in air. The existence of the zero in the polarizability for the Tm ground state was confirmed by the trap loss experiment, which also made it possible to refine the tune-out wavelength to $575.646_{-0.004}^{+0.004}$. Despite the presence of an imaginary part of the polarizability at some wavelengths, it was experimentally demonstrated that, with a proper choice of the dipole trap polarization, it was possible to achieve Bose-Einstein condensation of thulium atoms in the range from 575.348 to 575.689 nm, covering the tune-out wavelength.</description>

      <title>Earth Matter Enhanced Axion Dark Matter Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Laboratory searches for ultralight axion dark matter (DM) have traditionally assumed the terrestrial density of axions is equal to the average density of DM in the solar system. However, quadratic couplings to matter introduce a non-trivial field profile near the Earth. In this work, we present the first dedicated experimental implementation of this environment-aware axion DM wind search framework. Leveraging the extreme sensitivity of a K--Rb--$^{21}$Ne comagnetometer to pseudo-magnetic fields induced by axion DM, we analyzed our data in the context of the massively enhanced local gradient of axions due to interactions with matter, though no signal candidates were found. Consequently, we have set the most stringent limits on axion-neutron derivative interactions for masses $m_a \in [0.041, ~28.9]~\rm feV$, improving from previous experiments that ignore terrestrial matter effects by as much as three orders of magnitude for certain masses. Our work highlights the necessity of accounting for environmental modifications in precision frontier experiments and demonstrates how geophysical variations can be harnessed to act as a natural amplifier for DM possibly enabling future detection in parts of the parameter space that were previously beyond reach.</description>

      <title>Revealing Pseudo-Fermionization and Chiral Binding of One-Dimensional Anyons using Adiabatic State Preparation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fractional statistics give rise to quantum behaviors that differ fundamentally from those of bosons and fermions. While two-dimensional anyons play a major role in strongly correlated systems and topological quantum computing, the nature of their one-dimensional (1D) counterparts remains the subject of intense debate, with renewed interest fueled by recent experimental progress. Theoretically, 1D anyons are predicted to host exotic many-body phases and quantum phase transitions, yet experimental signatures have remained elusive. Using ultracold atoms in an optical lattice, we prepare two-body ground states of the 1D anyon-Hubbard model by combining Hamiltonian engineering via quasiperiodic drives and adiabatic state manipulation. We uncover the effects of statistical interactions that lead to pseudo-fermionization and to the formation of chiral bound states when particles remain close together. Our results establish a link between lattice and continuum realizations of anyon models, and mark important steps towards the precise control of 1D anyons in both equilibrium and out-of-equilibrium settings.</description>

      <title>Doppler-free Rydberg Spectroscopy in Warm Vapor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04504v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The common approach for producing Rydberg atoms in warm vapor cells is with lasers arranged in a counter-propagating, collinear configuration. Doppler effects in these configurations reduce the efficiency of excitation to the Rydberg state while also producing broadened spectral features. In this work, we demonstrate a three-laser Doppler-free excitation using laser beams whose k-vectors sum to zero, resulting in an enhancement in the Rydberg density and narrowed spectral features. A three-times enhancement to Rydberg density along with a near four-times reduction in spectroscopic line-widths are observed compared to a collinear configuration. This Doppler-free configuration could prove beneficial to Rydberg atomic technologies, such as electric field sensing with small volumes or deterministic photon sources.</description>

      <title>The hyperfine interaction as a probe of the microscopic structure of the atomic nucleus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18144v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of highly charged electronic and muonic hydrogen-like ions, provides an intriguing way to probe the internal structure of their atomic nuclei. In this work, we use nuclear structure calculations to accurately calculate the hyperfine splitting of electronic and muonic hydrogen-like ions, focusing in particular on the incorporation of finite-volume corrections, such as Bohr-Weisskopf and Breit-Rosenthal, due to the penetration of the electron and muon wavefunction into the nuclear electric charge and magnetic dipole densities. These corrections are essential for refining our understanding of the nuclear magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole moments. Our simulations use a Skyrme-Hartree-Fock-BCS model known for its effectiveness in modeling well-deformed nuclei such as ${}^{159}\mathrm{Tb}^{64+}$ and ${}^{165}\mathrm{Ho}^{66+}$, with particular emphasis on ${}^{161,163}\mathrm{Dy}^{65+}$ isotopes. It can also be generalised to multi-electron ions by studying the hyperfine anomaly between two isotopes.</description>
