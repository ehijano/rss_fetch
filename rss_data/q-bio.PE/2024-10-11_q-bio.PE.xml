      <title>Siamese networks for Poincar\'e embeddings and the reconstruction of evolutionary trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a method for reconstructing evolutionary trees from high-dimensional data, with a specific application to bird song spectrograms. We address the challenge of inferring phylogenetic relationships from phenotypic traits, like vocalizations, without predefined acoustic properties. Our approach combines two main components: Poincar\'e embeddings for dimensionality reduction and distance computation, and the neighbor joining algorithm for tree reconstruction. Unlike previous work, we employ Siamese networks to learn embeddings from only leaf node samples of the latent tree. We demonstrate our method's effectiveness on both synthetic data and spectrograms from six species of finches.</description>

      <title>Near-ideal selection for the Standard Genetic Code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evolutionary theorizing resembles building an aircraft while also piloting it; new results change the scaffold for older ideas, requiring revised strategy to remain airborne. A calculated kinetic pathway exists that, under explicit quantitative assumptions, delivers the SGC (Standard Genetic Code). The pathway and evidence for it is summarized below, striving for a clearer, more complete account than was possible during its construction. Beginning with experimental amino acid-RNA interactions, code assignments are fused, codes divide and an early coding crescendo is tested for homogeneous assignments, which are then selected for independent survival in a near-empty biotic world. During escape from the site of origin and diaspora, a near-complete SGC becomes dominant by supporting proficient division. Crescendo, escape and diaspora together comprise a near-ideal least selection for a Standard Genetic Code that specifically served LUCA, likely a free-living anaerobic thermophilic microbe. Selection during diaspora conceivably made persistence across gigayears feasible.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear dynamics of CAR-T cell therapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy is considered a promising cancer treatment. The dynamic response to this therapy can be broadly divided into a short-term phase, ranging from weeks to months, and a long-term phase, ranging from months to years. While the short-term response, encompassing the multiphasic kinetics of CAR-T cells, is better understood, the mechanisms underlying the outcomes of the long-term response, characterized by sustained remission, relapse, or disease progression, remain less understood due to limited clinical data. Here, we analyze the long-term dynamics of a previously validated mathematical model of CAR-T cell therapy. We perform a comprehensive stability and bifurcation analysis, examining model equilibria and their dynamics over the entire parameter space. Our results show that therapy failure results from a combination of insufficient CAR-T cell proliferation and increased tumor immunosuppression. By combining different techniques of nonlinear dynamics, we identify Hopf and Bogdanov-Takens bifurcations, which allow to elucidate the mechanisms behind oscillatory remissions and transitions to tumor escape. In particular, rapid expansion of CAR-T cells leads to oscillatory tumor control, while increased tumor immunosuppression destabilizes these oscillations, resulting in transient remissions followed by relapse. Our study highlights different mathematical tools to study nonlinear models and provides critical insights into the nonlinear dynamics of CAR-T therapy arising from the complex interplay between CAR-T cells and tumor cells.</description>

      <title>Chaos in opinion-driven disease dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: During the COVID-19 pandemic, it became evident that the effectiveness of applying intervention measures is significantly influenced by societal acceptance, which, in turn, is affected by the processes of opinion formation. This article explores one among the many possibilities of a coupled opinion-epidemic system. The findings reveal either intricate periodic patterns or chaotic dynamics, leading to substantial fluctuations in opinion distribution and, consequently, significant variations in the total number of infections over time. Interestingly, the model is exhibiting the protective pattern.</description>
