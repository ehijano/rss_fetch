      <title>Power System Electromagnetic Transient Stability: an Analysis Based on Convergent Hamiltonian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transient stability is crucial to the reliable operation of power systems. Existing theories rely on the simplified electromechanical models, substituting the detailed electromagnetic dynamics of inductor and capacitor with their impedance representations. However, this simplification is inadequate for the growing penetration of fast-switching power electronic devices. Attempts to extend the existing theories to include electromagnetic dynamics lead to overly conservative stability conditions. To tackle this problem more directly, we study the condition under which the power source and dissipation in the electromagnetic dynamics tend to balance each other asymptotically. This is equivalent to the convergence of the Hamiltonian (total stored energy) and can be shown to imply transient stability. Using contraction analysis, we prove that this property holds for a large class of time-varying port-Hamiltonian systems with (i) constant damping matrix and (ii) strictly convex Hamiltonian. Then through port-Hamiltonian modeling of the electromagnetic dynamics, we obtain that the synchronized steady state of the power system is globally stable if it exists. This result provides new insights into the reliable operation of power systems. The proposed theory is illustrated in the simulation results of a two-machine system.</description>

      <title>Perch like a bird: bio-inspired optimal maneuvers and nonlinear control for Flapping-Wing Unmanned Aerial Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research endeavors to design the perching maneuver and control in ornithopter robots. By analyzing the dynamic interplay between the robot's flight dynamics, feedback loops, and the environmental constraints, we aim to advance our understanding of the perching maneuver, drawing parallels to biological systems. Inspired by the elegant control strategies observed in avian flight, we develop an optimal maneuver and a corresponding controller to achieve stable perching. The maneuver consists of a deceleration and a rapid pitch-up (vertical turn), which arises from analytically solving the optimization problem of minimal velocity at perch, subject to kinematic and dynamic constraints. The controller for the flapping frequency and tail symmetric deflection is nonlinear and adaptive, ensuring robustly stable perching. Indeed, such adaptive behavior in a sense incorporates homeostatic principles of cybernetics into the control system, enhancing the robot's ability to adapt to unexpected disturbances and maintain a stable posture during the perching maneuver. The resulting autonomous perching maneuvers -- closed-loop descent and turn -- , have been verified and validated, demonstrating excellent agreement with real bird perching trajectories reported in the literature. These findings lay the theoretical groundwork for the development of future prototypes that better imitate the skillful perching maneuvers of birds.</description>

      <title>Safe Reinforcement Learning-based Control for Hydrogen Diesel Dual-Fuel Engines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The urgent energy transition requirements towards a sustainable future stretch across various industries and are a significant challenge facing humanity. Hydrogen promises a clean, carbon-free future, with the opportunity to integrate with existing solutions in the transportation sector. However, adding hydrogen to existing technologies such as diesel engines requires additional modeling effort. Reinforcement Learning (RL) enables interactive data-driven learning that eliminates the need for mathematical modeling. The algorithms, however, may not be real-time capable and need large amounts of data to work in practice. This paper presents a novel approach which uses offline model learning with RL to demonstrate safe control of a 4.5 L Hydrogen Diesel Dual-Fuel (H2DF) engine. The controllers are demonstrated to be constraint compliant and can leverage a novel state-augmentation approach for sample-efficient learning. The offline policy is subsequently experimentally validated on the real engine where the control algorithm is executed on a Raspberry Pi controller and requires 6 times less computation time compared to online Model Predictive Control (MPC) optimization.</description>

      <title>Stretching Rubber, Not Budgets: Accurate Parking Utilization on a Shoestring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective parking management is essential for ensuring accessibility, safety, and convenience in master-planned communities, particularly in active adult neighborhoods experiencing rapid growth. Accurately assessing parking utilization is a crucial first step in planning for future demand, but data collection methods can be costly and labor-intensive. This paper presents a low-cost yet highly accurate methodology for measuring parking utilization using road tubes connected to portable traffic counters from JAMAR Technologies, Inc. By integrating results from JAMAR's analysis tool with custom Python scripting, the methodology enables precise parking lot counts through parameter optimization and automated error correction. The system's efficiency allows for scalable deployment without significant manual observation, reducing both costs and disruptions to daily operations. Using Tellico Village as a case study, this research demonstrates that community planners can obtain actionable parking insights on a limited budget, empowering them to make informed decisions about capacity expansion, traffic flow improvements, and facility scheduling. The findings underscore the feasibility of leveraging cost-effective technology to optimize infrastructure planning and ensure long-term resident satisfaction as communities grow.</description>

      <title>Recovering nonlinear dynamics from non-uniform observations: A physics-based identification approach with practical case studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Uniform and smooth data collection is often infeasible in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose an identification framework to effectively handle the so-called non-uniform observations, i.e., data scenarios that include missing measurements, multiple runs, or aggregated observations. The goal is to provide a general approach for accurately recovering the overall dynamics of possibly nonlinear systems, allowing the capture of the system behavior over time from non-uniform observations. The proposed approach exploits prior knowledge by integrating domain-specific, interpretable, physical principles with black-box approximators, proving significant flexibility and adaptability in handling different types of non-uniform measurements, and addressing the limitations of traditional linear and black-box methods. The description of this novel framework is supported by a theoretical study on the effect of non-uniform observations on the accuracy of parameter estimation. Specifically, we demonstrate the existence of upper bounds on the parametric error resulting from missing measurements and aggregated observations. Then, the effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated through two case studies. These include a practical application with missing samples, i.e., the identification of a continuous stirred-tank reactor using real data, and a simulated Lotka-Volterra system under aggregated observations. The results highlight the ability of the framework to robustly estimate the system parameters and to accurately reconstruct the model dynamics despite the availability of non-uniform measurements.</description>

      <title>LifeSaver: Predictive Load Limit Estimation for Transport Vehicles in Hilly Areas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transportation of essential goods in moun- tainous regions faces severe logistical challenges and frequent disruptions. To mitigate these difficulties, transport companies often overload trucks, which, though cost-saving, significantly heightens the risk of accidents and mechanical failures. This paper presents the development of a device that detects over- loaded and insecurely fastened loads on trucks and commercial vehicles. Using advanced load sensors, the device offers real- time monitoring of cargo weight distribution, alerting drivers and authorities to unsafe conditions. The initial prototype utilised two basic load cells and an Arduino microcontroller. The second version was enhanced with four load cells and extended sensors. This version was tested by placing an electric golf cart onto the prototype. Various loads were then added to the cart in different orientations to assess whether the system could accurately detect improper or excessive load conditions.</description>

      <title>Safe platooning control of connected and autonomous vehicles on curved multi-lane roads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the safe platoon formation tracking and merging control problem of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) on curved multi-lane roads. The first novelty is the separation of the control designs into two distinct parts: a lateral control law that ensures a geometrical convergence towards the reference path regardless of the translational velocity, and a longitudinal control design for each vehicle to achieve the desired relative arc length and velocity with respect to its neighboring vehicle. The second novelty is exploiting the constructive barrier feedback as an additive term to the nominal tracking control, ensuring both lateral and longitudinal collision avoidance. This constructive barrier feedback acts as a dissipative term, slowing down the relative velocity toward obstacles without affecting the nominal controller's performance. Consequently, our proposed control method enables safe platoon formation of vehicles on curved multi-lane roads, with theoretical guarantees for safety invariance and stability analysis. Simulation and experimental results on connected vehicles are provided to further validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning based Constrained Optimal Control: an Interpretable Reward Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an interpretable reward design framework for reinforcement learning based constrained optimal control problems with state and terminal constraints. The problem is formalized within a standard partially observable Markov decision process framework. The reward function is constructed from four weighted components: a terminal constraint reward, a guidance reward, a penalty for state constraint violations, and a cost reduction incentive reward. A theoretically justified reward design is then presented, which establishes bounds on the weights of the components. This approach ensures that constraints are satisfied and objectives are optimized while mitigating numerical instability. Acknowledging the importance of prior knowledge in reward design, we sequentially solve two subproblems, using each solution to inform the reward design for the subsequent problem. Subsequently, we integrate reinforcement learning with curriculum learning, utilizing policies derived from simpler subproblems to assist in tackling more complex challenges, thereby facilitating convergence. The framework is evaluated against original and randomly weighted reward designs in a multi-agent particle environment. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly enhances satisfaction of terminal and state constraints and optimization of control cost.</description>

      <title>Optimal and Coordinated Voltage Control: Case Study on a 132 kV Norwegian Grid Subsystem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a framework for dynamic performance assessment of the higher layers in the hierarchical voltage regulation scheme, with case studies applied to specific areas of the Norwegian grid. Unlike the primary (PVR) level, the secondary (SVR) and tertiary (TVR) levels are not tuned to a single device at a time, handling instead several reactive power resources available within a control zone including generator units, static VAr compensators and others. Proper SVR-TVR coordination for realistic transmission systems is a challenging topic at the core of many ongoing discussions in voltage control literature. Special focus is placed on practical considerations from the system operator perspective, since this research is also aimed at simplifying daily control centre routines. Dynamic simulation results concern a 21-bus equivalent of a 132 kV network model that accurately represents a Norwegian grid subsystem. Case studies address daily grid operation with real-life load demand and wind power generation profiles, showing that the proposed strategy is effective not only to minimize total active power losses as much as possible within system-wide limitations, but also to maintain adequate voltage profiles and reactive power flows. Findings pertaining to this work showcase the benefits of applying hierarchical voltage regulation layers as an asset to day-to-day control center management of a realistic transmission network.</description>

      <title>Safety Blind Spot in Remote Driving: Considerations for Risk Assessment of Connection Loss Fallback Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As part of the overall goal of driverless road vehicles, remote driving is a major emerging field of research of its own. Current remote driving concepts for public road traffic often establish a fallback strategy of immediate braking to a standstill in the event of a connection loss. This may seem like the most logical option when human control of the vehicle is lost. However, our simulation results from hundreds of scenarios based on naturalistic traffic scenes indicate high collision rates for any immediate substantial deceleration to a standstill in urban settings. We show that such a fallback strategy can result in a SOTIF relevant hazard, making it questionable whether such a design decision can be considered acceptable. Therefore, from a safety perspective, we would call this problem a safety blind spot, as safety analyses in this regard seem to be very rare.
  In this article, we first present a simulation on a naturalistic dataset that shows a high probability of collision in the described case. Second, we discuss the severity of the resulting potential rear-end collisions and provide an even more severe example by including a large commercial vehicle in the potential collision.</description>

      <title>Optimized Strategies for Peak Shaving and BESS Efficiency Enhancement through Cycle-Based Control and Cluster-Level Power Allocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) are essential for peak shaving, balancing power supply and demand while enhancing grid efficiency. This study proposes a cycle-based control strategy for charging and discharging, which optimizes capture rate (CR), release rate (RR), and capacity utilization rate (CUR), improving BESS performance. Compared to traditional day-ahead methods, the cycle-based approach enhances operational accuracy and reduces capacity waste, achieving a CUR increase from 75.1% to 79.9%. An innovative cluster-level power allocation method, leveraging an improved Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm, is introduced. This strategy reduces daily energy loss by 174.21 kWh (3.7%) and increases BESS efficiency by 0.4%. Transient and steady-state energy loss components are analyzed, revealing that transient loss proportion decreases significantly as power depth increases, from 27.2% at 1 MW to 1.3% at 10 MW. Simulations based on a detailed Simulink/Simscape model validate these methods, demonstrating enhanced peak shaving effectiveness and prolonged BESS lifespan by reducing equivalent cycles. The study provides a robust framework for optimizing BESS performance and efficiency in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Analysis and Prediction of Coverage and Channel Rank for UAV Networks in Rural Scenarios with Foliage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are expected to play a key role in 6G-enabled vehicular-to-everything (V2X) communications requiring high data rates, low latency, and reliable connectivity for mission-critical applications. Multi-input multi-output (MIMO) technology is essential for meeting these demands. However, UAV link performance is significantly affected by environmental factors such as signal attenuation, multipath propagation, and blockage from obstacles, particularly dense foliage in rural areas. In this paper, we investigate RF coverage and channel rank over UAV channels in foliage-dominated rural environments using ray tracing (RT) simulations. We conduct RT-based channel rank and RF coverage analysis over Lake Wheeler Field Labs at NC State University to examine the impact on UAV links. Custom-modeled trees are integrated into the RT simulations using NVIDIA Sionna, Blender, and Open Street Map (OSM) database to capture realistic blockage effects. Results indicate that tree-induced blockage impacts RF coverage and channel rank at lower UAV altitudes. We also propose a Kriging interpolation-based 3D channel rank interpolation scheme, leveraging the observed spatial correlation of channel rank in the given environments. The accuracy of the proposed scheme is evaluated using the mean absolute error (MAE) metric and compared against baseline interpolation methods. Finally, we compare the RT-based received signal strength (RSS) and channel rank results with real-world measurements from the NSF AERPAW testbed demonstrating reasonable consistency between simulation results and the measurements.</description>

      <title>Decentralized State Estimation and Opacity Verification Based on Partially Ordered Observation Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate state estimation and opacity verification problems within a decentralized observation architecture. Specifically, we consider a discrete event system whose behavior is recorded by a set of observation sites. These sites transmit the partially ordered sequences of observations that they record to a coordinator whenever a \textit{synchronization} occurs. To properly analyze the system behavior from the coordinator's viewpoint, we first introduce the notion of an \textit{All Sequence Structure} (ASS), which concisely captures the state evolution of each system state upon different information provided by the observation sites. Based on the ASS, we then construct corresponding current-state and initial-state estimators for offline state estimation at the coordinator. When used to verify state-isolation properties under this decentralized architecture, the use of ASS demonstrates a significant reduction in complexity compared with existing approaches in the literature. In particular, we discuss how to verify initial-state opacity at the coordinator, as well as a novel opacity notion, namely current-state-at-synchronization opacity.</description>

      <title>Carbon- and Precedence-Aware Scheduling for Data Processing Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As large-scale data processing workloads continue to grow, their carbon footprint raises concerns. Prior research on carbon-aware schedulers has focused on shifting computation to align with availability of low-carbon energy, but these approaches assume that each task can be executed independently. In contrast, data processing jobs have precedence constraints (i.e., outputs of one task are inputs for another) that complicate decisions, since delaying an upstream ``bottleneck'' task to a low-carbon period will also block downstream tasks, impacting the entire job's completion time. In this paper, we show that carbon-aware scheduling for data processing benefits from knowledge of both time-varying carbon and precedence constraints. Our main contribution is $\texttt{PCAPS}$, a carbon-aware scheduler that interfaces with modern ML scheduling policies to explicitly consider the precedence-driven importance of each task in addition to carbon. To illustrate the gains due to fine-grained task information, we also study $\texttt{CAP}$, a wrapper for any carbon-agnostic scheduler that adapts the key provisioning ideas of $\texttt{PCAPS}$. Our schedulers enable a configurable priority between carbon reduction and job completion time, and we give analytical results characterizing the trade-off between the two. Furthermore, our Spark prototype on a 100-node Kubernetes cluster shows that a moderate configuration of $\texttt{PCAPS}$ reduces carbon footprint by up to 32.9% without significantly impacting the cluster's total efficiency.</description>

      <title>Contracting Strategies for Electrolyzers to Secure Grid Connection: The Dutch Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In response to increasing grid congestion in the Netherlands, non-firm connection and transport agreements (CTAs) and capacity restriction contracts (CRCs) have been introduced, allowing consumer curtailment in exchange for grid tariff discounts or per-MW compensations. This study examines the interaction between an electrolyzer project, facing sizing and contracting decisions, and a network operator, responsible for contract activations and determining grid connection capacity, under the new Dutch regulations. The interaction is modeled using two bilevel optimization problems with alternating leader-follower roles. Results highlight a trade-off between CRC income and non-firm CTA tariff discounts, showing that voluntary congestion management by the network operator increases electrolyzer profitability at CRC prices below 10 euro per MW but reduces it at higher prices. Furthermore, the network operator benefits more from reacting to the electrolyzer owner's CTA decisions than from leading the interaction at CRC prices above 10 euro per MW. Ignoring the other party's optimization problem overestimates profits for both the network operator and the electrolyzer owner, emphasizing the importance of coordinated decision-making.</description>

      <title>Suture Thread Modeling Using Control Barrier Functions for Autonomous Surgery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automating surgical systems enhances precision and safety while reducing human involvement in high-risk environments. A major challenge in automating surgical procedures like suturing is accurately modeling the suture thread, a highly flexible and compliant component. Existing models either lack the accuracy needed for safety critical procedures or are too computationally intensive for real time execution. In this work, we introduce a novel approach for modeling suture thread dynamics using control barrier functions (CBFs), achieving both realism and computational efficiency. Thread like behavior, collision avoidance, stiffness, and damping are all modeled within a unified CBF and control Lyapunov function (CLF) framework. Our approach eliminates the need to calculate complex forces or solve differential equations, significantly reducing computational overhead while maintaining a realistic model suitable for both automation and virtual reality surgical training systems. The framework also allows visual cues to be provided based on the thread's interaction with the environment, enhancing user experience when performing suture or ligation tasks. The proposed model is tested on the MagnetoSuture system, a minimally invasive robotic surgical platform that uses magnetic fields to manipulate suture needles, offering a less invasive solution for surgical procedures.</description>

      <title>Dual Control for Interactive Autonomous Merging with Model Predictive Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09918v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interactive decision-making is essential in applications such as autonomous driving, where the agent must infer the behavior of nearby human drivers while planning in real-time. Traditional predict-then-act frameworks are often insufficient or inefficient because accurate inference of human behavior requires a continuous interaction rather than isolated prediction. To address this, we propose an active learning framework in which we rigorously derive predicted belief distributions. Additionally, we introduce a novel model-based diffusion solver tailored for online receding horizon control problems, demonstrated through a complex, non-convex highway merging scenario. Our approach extends previous high-fidelity dual control simulations to hardware experiments, which may be viewed at https://youtu.be/Q_JdZuopGL4, and verifies behavior inference in human-driven traffic scenarios, moving beyond idealized models. The results show improvements in adaptive planning under uncertainty, advancing the field of interactive decision-making for real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Coordinated control of multiple autonomous surface vehicles: challenges and advances - a systematic review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing use and implementation of Autonomous Surface Vessels (ASVs) for various activities in maritime environments is expected to drive a rise in developments and research on their control. Particularly, the coordination of multiple ASVs presents novel challenges and opportunities, requiring interdisciplinary research efforts at the intersection of robotics, control theory, communication systems, and marine sciences. The wide variety of missions or objectives for which these vessels can be collectively used allows for the application and combination of different control techniques. This includes the exploration of machine learning to consider aspects previously deemed infeasible. This review provides a comprehensive exploration of coordinated ASV control while addressing critical gaps left by previous reviews. Unlike previous works, we adopt a systematic approach to ensure integrity and minimize bias in article selection. We delve into the complex world of sub-actuated ASVs with a focus on customized control strategies and the integration of machine learning techniques for increased autonomy. By synthesizing recent advances and identifying emerging trends, we offer insights that drive this field forward, providing both a comprehensive overview of state-of-the-art techniques and guidance for future research efforts.</description>

      <title>Strain-Induced Optical and Molecular Transformations in PET Films for Organic Electronic Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) films are widely used in flexible electronics and optoelectronics, where their mechanical durability and optical performance under strain are essential for device reliability. This study investigates the impact of applied mechanical strain on the optical and molecular properties of PET at room temperature,using UV-Vis absorption and Raman spectroscopy. The work explores how varying strain levels, from 0% (unstretched) to 30%, affect the transparency, vibrational modes, and molecular reorganization within PET films. UV-Vis absorbance measurements reveal that strain induces significant changes in the light transmission properties of PET, particularly in the visible range, and increases absorption in the UVA and visible region by up to 100%. Raman spectra indicate that strain levels higher than 5% lead to irreversible shifts of vibrational lines, accompanied by an increase of their full width at half maximum (FWHM), suggesting molecular reorientation and crystallinity changes. The phonon mode coupled with C-O stretching [O-CH2] shows the strongest response to applied mechanical stress. This study provides a comprehensive understanding of strain-induced optical and structural alterations in PET, with implications for improving the mechanical and optical performance of PET-based devices in strainsensitive applications, such as organic solar cells (OSCs), organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), and flexible sensors.</description>

      <title>Technical Risks of (Lethal) Autonomous Weapons Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The autonomy and adaptability of (Lethal) Autonomous Weapons Systems, (L)AWS in short, promise unprecedented operational capabilities, but they also introduce profound risks that challenge the principles of control, accountability, and stability in international security. This report outlines the key technological risks associated with (L)AWS deployment, emphasizing their unpredictability, lack of transparency, and operational unreliability, which can lead to severe unintended consequences.
  Key Takeaways:
  1. Proposed advantages of (L)AWS can only be achieved through objectification and classification, but a range of systematic risks limit the reliability and predictability of classifying algorithms.
  2. These systematic risks include the black-box nature of AI decision-making, susceptibility to reward hacking, goal misgeneralization and potential for emergent behaviors that escape human control.
  3. (L)AWS could act in ways that are not just unexpected but also uncontrollable, undermining mission objectives and potentially escalating conflicts.
  4. Even rigorously tested systems may behave unpredictably and harmfully in real-world conditions, jeopardizing both strategic stability and humanitarian principles.</description>

      <title>Anomaly Detection with LWE Encrypted Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detecting attacks using encrypted signals is challenging since encryption hides its information content. We present a novel mechanism for anomaly detection over Learning with Errors (LWE) encrypted signals without using decryption, secure channels, nor complex communication schemes. Instead, the detector exploits the homomorphic property of LWE encryption to perform hypothesis tests on transformations of the encrypted samples. The specific transformations are determined by solutions to a hard lattice-based minimization problem. While the test's sensitivity deteriorates with suboptimal solutions, similar to the exponential deterioration of the (related) test that breaks the cryptosystem, we show that the deterioration is polynomial for our test. This rate gap can be exploited to pick parameters that lead to somewhat weaker encryption but large gains in detection capability. Finally, we conclude the paper by presenting a numerical example that simulates anomaly detection, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method in identifying attacks.</description>

      <title>Experiencing Urban Air Mobility: How Passengers evaluate a simulated flight with an Air Taxi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01079v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For the successful development and implementation of novel concepts and technology, the acceptance of potential users is crucial. Therefore, within the project HorizonUAM of the German Aerospace Center (DLR), we investigated passengers' acceptance of air taxis. One challenge is that not many people have real experiences with urban air mobility (UAM) at the moment and thus requirements formulated by potential users refer to rather abstract concepts. To allow participants to gain realistic impressions of UAM concepts, a Mixed Reality (MR) Air Taxi Simulator was set up. In a study, 30 participants experienced an inner-city business shuttle flight. We assessed the influence of another person on board on wellbeing and information needs in nominal (experiment 1) and non-nominal situations (experiment 2). For the latter, participants experienced a re-routing of the flight due to landing side unavailability. During and after the flights, participants answered questionnaires and extensive interviews were conducted. The study produced empirical data on relevant factors regarding interaction, information needs and comfort within an air taxi. The findings show that passengers want to be informed about intentions of the vehicle. The presence of a flight attendant on board is not necessary but can increase wellbeing especially during non-nominal situations.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Expressway Ramp Merge Safety and Efficiency via Spatiotemporal Cooperative Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08121v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the context of autonomous driving on expressways, the issue of ensuring safe and efficient ramp merging remains a significant challenge. Existing systems often struggle to accurately assess the status and intentions of other vehicles, leading to a persistent occurrence of accidents despite efforts to maintain safe distances. This study proposes a novel spatiotemporal cooperative control approach integrating vehicle-road coordination to address this critical issue. A comprehensive methodology is developed, beginning with the calculation of safe distances under varying spatiotemporal conditions. This involves considering multiple factors, including vehicle speed differentials, positioning errors, and clock synchronization errors. Subsequently, an advanced vehicle conflict risk evaluation model is constructed. By incorporating collision acceleration and emergency acceleration as key parameters, this model offers a more accurate and detailed evaluation of potential risks during the ramp merging process. Based on the calculated safe distances and conflict risk evaluations, a mainline priority coordinated control method is formulated. This method enables the pre-planning of vehicle trajectories, effectively reducing conflicts among vehicles. Through rigorous simulations using diverse traffic volume and speed scenarios, the efficacy of the proposed strategy is validated. The results demonstrate remarkable improvements, with the average delay time reduced by an impressive 97.96% and fuel consumption decreased by 6.01%. These outcomes indicate that the proposed approach not only enhances the speed of vehicle merging but also significantly reduces latency and fuel consumption, thereby enhancing the overall performance of ramp merging operations.</description>

      <title>A scalable, gradient-stable approach to multi-step, nonlinear system identification using first-order methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03544v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents three main contributions to the field of multi-step system identification. First, drawing inspiration from Neural Network (NN) training, it introduces a tool for solving identification problems by leveraging first-order optimization and Automatic Differentiation (AD). The proposed method exploits gradients with respect to the parameters to be identified and leverages Linear Parameter-Varying (LPV) sensitivity equations to model gradient evolution. Second, it demonstrates that the computational complexity of the proposed method is linear in both the multi-step horizon length and the parameter size, ensuring scalability for large identification problems. Third, it formally addresses the "exploding gradient" issue: via a stability analysis of the LPV equations, it derives conditions for a reliable and efficient optimization and identification process for dynamical systems. Simulation results indicate that the proposed method is both effective and efficient, making it a promising tool for future research and applications in nonlinear system identification and non-convex optimization.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty-Aware Critic Augmentation for Hierarchical Multi-Agent EV Charging Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18047v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The advanced bidirectional EV charging and discharging technology, aimed at supporting grid stability and emergency operations, has driven a growing interest in workplace applications. It not only reduces electricity expenses but also enhances the resilience in handling practical matters, such as peak power limitation, fluctuating energy prices, and unpredictable EV departures. Considering these factors systematically can benefit energy efficiency in office buildings and for EV users simultaneously. To employ AI to address these issues, we propose HUCA, a novel real-time charging control for regulating energy demands for both the building and EVs. HUCA employs hierarchical actor-critic networks to dynamically reduce electricity costs in buildings, accounting for the needs of EV charging in the dynamic pricing scenario. To tackle the uncertain EV departures, we introduce a new critic augmentation to account for departure uncertainties in evaluating the charging decisions, while maintaining the robustness of the charging control. Experiments on real-world electricity datasets under both simulated certain and uncertain departure scenarios demonstrate that HUCA outperforms baselines in terms of total electricity costs while maintaining competitive performance in fulfilling EV charging requirements. A case study also manifests that HUCA effectively balances energy supply between the building and EVs based on real-time information, showcasing its potential as a key AI-driven solution for vehicle charging control.</description>

      <title>EIQP: Execution-time-certified and Infeasibility-detecting QP Solver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07738v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solving real-time quadratic programming (QP) is a ubiquitous task in control engineering, such as in model predictive control and control barrier function-based QP. In such real-time scenarios, certifying that the employed QP algorithm can either return a solution within a predefined level of optimality or detect QP infeasibility before the predefined sampling time is a pressing requirement. This article considers convex QP (including linear programming) and adopts its homogeneous formulation to achieve infeasibility detection. Exploiting this homogeneous formulation, this article proposes a novel infeasible interior-point method (IPM) algorithm with the best theoretical $O(\sqrt{n})$ iteration complexity that feasible IPM algorithms enjoy. The iteration complexity is proved to be \textit{exact} (rather than an upper bound), \textit{simple to calculate}, and \textit{data independent}, with the value $\left\lceil\frac{\log(\frac{n+1}{\epsilon})}{-\log(1-\frac{0.414213}{\sqrt{n+1}})}\right\rceil$ (where $n$ and $\epsilon$ denote the number of constraints and the predefined optimality level, respectively), making it appealing to certify the execution time of online time-varying convex QPs. The proposed algorithm is simple to implement without requiring a line search procedure (uses the full Newton step), and its C-code implementation (offering MATLAB, Julia, and Python interfaces) and numerical examples are publicly available at https://github.com/liangwu2019/EIQP.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.11761v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates MDPs with intermittent state information. We consider a scenario where the controller perceives the state information of the process via an unreliable communication channel. The transmissions of state information over the whole time horizon are modeled as a Bernoulli lossy process. Hence, the problem is finding an optimal policy for selecting actions in the presence of state information losses. We first formulate the problem as a belief MDP to establish structural results. The effect of state information losses on the expected total discounted reward is studied systematically. Then, we reformulate the problem as a tree MDP whose state space is organized in a tree structure. Two finite-state approximations to the tree MDP are developed to find near-optimal policies efficiently. Finally, we put forth a nested value iteration algorithm for the finite-state approximations, which is proved to be faster than standard value iteration. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods.</description>

      <title>Data Center Cooling System Optimization Using Offline Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15085v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent advances in information technology and artificial intelligence have fueled a rapid expansion of the data center (DC) industry worldwide, accompanied by an immense appetite for electricity to power the DCs. In a typical DC, around 30~40% of the energy is spent on the cooling system rather than on computer servers, posing a pressing need for developing new energy-saving optimization technologies for DC cooling systems. However, optimizing such real-world industrial systems faces numerous challenges, including but not limited to a lack of reliable simulation environments, limited historical data, and stringent safety and control robustness requirements. In this work, we present a novel physics-informed offline reinforcement learning (RL) framework for energy efficiency optimization of DC cooling systems. The proposed framework models the complex dynamical patterns and physical dependencies inside a server room using a purposely designed graph neural network architecture that is compliant with the fundamental time-reversal symmetry. Because of its well-behaved and generalizable state-action representations, the model enables sample-efficient and robust latent space offline policy learning using limited real-world operational data. Our framework has been successfully deployed and verified in a large-scale production DC for closed-loop control of its air-cooling units (ACUs). We conducted a total of 2000 hours of short and long-term experiments in the production DC environment. The results show that our method achieves 14~21% energy savings in the DC cooling system, without any violation of the safety or operational constraints. Our results have demonstrated the significant potential of offline RL in solving a broad range of data-limited, safety-critical real-world industrial control problems.</description>
