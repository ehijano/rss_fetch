      <title>On the stability of Ricci flow on hyperbolic 3-manifolds of finite volume</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On a hyperbolic 3-manifold of finite volume, we prove that if the initial metric is sufficiently close to the hyperbolic metric $h_0$, then the normalized Ricci-DeTurck flow exists for all time and converges exponentially fast to $h_0$ in a weighted H\"older norm. A key ingredient of our approach is the application of interpolation theory.
  Furthermore, this result is a valuable tool for investigating minimal surface entropy, which quantifies the growth rate of the number of closed minimal surfaces in terms of genus. We explore this in [17].</description>

      <title>Minimal surface entropy and applications of Ricci flow on finite-volume hyperbolic 3-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies minimal surface entropy (the exponential asymptotic growth of the number of minimal surfaces up to a given value of area) for negatively curved metrics on hyperbolic $3$-manifolds of finite volume, particularly its comparison to the hyperbolic minimal surface entropy in terms of sectional and scalar curvature.
  On one hand, for metrics that are bilipschitz equivalent to the hyperbolic metric and have sectional curvature bounded above by $-1$ and uniformly bounded below, we show that the entropy achieves its minimum if and only if the metric is hyperbolic.
  On the other hand, by analyzing the convergence rate of the Ricci flow toward the hyperbolic metric, we prove that among all metrics with scalar curvature bounded below by $-6$ and with non-positive sectional curvature on the cusps, the entropy is maximized at the hyperbolic metric, provided that it is infinitesimally rigid. Furthermore, if the metrics are uniformly $C^0$-close to the hyperbolic metric and asymptotically cusped, then the entropy associated with the Lebesgue measure is uniquely maximized at the hyperbolic metric.</description>

      <title>Weitzenb\"ock-Bochner-Kodaira formulas with quadratic curvature terms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we establish new Bochner-Kodaira formulas with quadratic curvature terms on compact K\"ahler manifolds: for any $\eta\in \Omega^{p,q}(M)$, $$ \left\langle\Delta_{\overline \partial} \eta,\eta\right\rangle =\left\langle \Delta_{{\overline\partial}_F} \eta,\eta\right\rangle +\frac{1}{4}\left\langle \left(\mathcal {R} \otimes \mathrm{Id}_{\Lambda^{p+1,q-1}T^*M}\right)(\mathbb T_\eta),\mathbb T_\eta \right\rangle. $$ This linearized curvature term yields new vanishing theorems and provides estimates for Hodge numbers under exceptionally weak curvature conditions. Furthermore, we derive Weitzenb\"ock formulas with quadratic curvature terms on both Riemannian and K\"ahler manifolds.</description>

      <title>A Lifting principle of curves under exponential-type maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for lifting smooth paths via the exponential map on semi-Riemannian manifolds, addressing the long-standing difficulties posed by its singularities. We prove that every smooth path -- up to a nondecreasing reparametrization -- can be (partially) lifted to a curve which is inextensible in the domain of definition of the exponential map. Under a natural and purely topological condition -- the so-called path-continuation property for the exponential map -- we also establish the existence of global lifts, leading to a general path-lifting theorem.
  This lifting approach yields new, alternative proofs of (generalizations of) a number of foundational results in semi-Riemannian geometry: the Hopf--Rinow theorem and Serre's classic theorem about multiplicity of connecting geodesics in the Riemannian case, as well as the Avez--Seifert theorem for globally hyperbolic spacetimes in Lorentzian geometry. More broadly, our results reveal the central role of the continuation property in obtaining geodesic connectivity across a wide range of semi-Riemannian geometries. This offers a unifying geometric principle that is complementary to the more traditional analytic, variational methods used to investigate geodesic connectedness, and provides new insight into the structure of geodesics, both on geodesically complete and non-complete manifolds.
  We also briefly point out how the lifting theory developed here can extend to more general flow-inducing maps on the tangent bundle other than the geodesic flow, suggesting broader geometric applicability beyond the exponential map.</description>

      <title>Sequences of surfaces in $4$-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(\Sigma_n)$ be a sequence of surfaces immersed in a $4$-manifold $M$ which converges to a branched surface $\Sigma_0$ .\\ We denote by $k^T_p$ (resp. $k^N_p$) the amount of curvature of the tangent bundles $T\Sigma_n$ (resp. normal bundles $N\Sigma_n$) which concentrates around a branch point $p$ of $\Sigma_0$ when $n$ goes to infinity. Alternatively $k^T\pm k^N$ measures how much the twistor degrees drop when we go from $\Sigma_n$ to $\Sigma_0$. For complex algebraic curves, $k^T+k^N=0$..\\ In some instances - 1) if $\Sigma_0$ is made up of at most $3$ branched disks or 2) if $\Sigma_0$ is area minimizing or 3) if the $\Sigma_n$'s are minimal - we show that $-k^T\geq |k^N|$ and we investigate the equality case.\\ When the second fundamental forms of the $\Sigma_n$'s have a common $L^2$ bound, we relate $k^T$ and $k^N$ to the bubbling-off of a current $C$ in the Grassmannian $G_2^+(M)$. If the $\Sigma_n$'s are minimal, $C$ is a complex curve.</description>

Abstract: In this short note, we construct an example of spiraling conformal geodesic in Euclidean signature in dimension $3$, answering the question posed by Helmuth Friedrich and Paul Tod, if such objects exists. Our example is not real analytic, but similar constructions can lead also to real analytic metrics in arbitrary dimensions.</description>

      <title>The CR Yamabe invariant and constant scalar curvature Sasaki metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new approach to the existence of constant transversal scalar curvature Sasaki structures drawing on ideas and tools from the CR Yamabe problem, establishing a link between the CR Yamabe invariant, the existence of Sasaki structures of constant transversal scalar curvature, and the K-stability of Sasaki manifolds. Assuming that the Sasaki-Reeb cone contains a regular vector field, we show that if the CR Yamabe invariant of a compact Sasaki manifold attains a specific value determined by the geometry of the Reeb cone, then the Sasaki manifold is K-semistable. Under the additional assumption of non-positive average scalar curvature, the CR Yamabe invariant attains this topological value if the manifold admits approximately constant scalar curvature Sasaki structures, and we also show a partial converse. As an application, we provide a new numerical criterion for the K-semistability of polarised compact complex manifolds.</description>

      <title>An introduction to conifold transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: These lecture notes introduce conifold transitions between complex threefolds with trivial canonical bundle from the differential geometric point of view, and with a particular view towards aspects of mathematical physics and string theory. The lecture notes are aimed at beginning graduate students and non-experts, emphasizing explicit calculations and examples. After a brief introduction in Section 1, we recall some basic facts about Calabi-Yau manifolds in Section 2. Section 3 studies the conifold as a Calabi-Yau manifold with singularities, and introduces the local model for a conifold transition. Section 4 discusses global conifold transitions, and recalls the famous result of Friedman concerning the existence of smoothings for nodal Calabi-Yau threefolds. We give a differential geometric proof of the necessity part of Friedman's theorem. Section 5 discusses Reid's fantasy, and the web of Calabi-Yau threefolds. Section 6 discusses metric aspects of the local conifold transition, constructing explicit asymptotically conical Calabi-Yau metrics on the small resolution and the smoothing. Section 7 discusses the metric aspects of global conifold transitions, with a particular emphasis on the heterotic string.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish integral curvature estimates for complete gradient shrinking Sasaki-Ricci solitons. As an application, we show that any such soliton with harmonic Weyl tensor must be a finite quotient of a sphere. This result can be regarded as the Sasaki analogue of the work of Munteanu and Sesum [15] on Ricci solitons.</description>

Abstract: In this short note, we describe the Helffer-Nourrigat cone of a singular foliation in terms of the Nash algebroid associated to the foliation. Along the way, we show that the Helffer-Nourrigat cone is a union of symplectic leaves of the canonical Poisson structures on the dual of the holonomy Lie algebroids. We also provide, within this framework, a characterization of longitudinally elliptic differential operators on a singular foliation $\mathcal{F}$, generalizing results previously known in the literature.</description>

      <title>On Topology and Geometry of Hessian Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a differentiable manifold $M$, a pair $(M, \nabla)$ is termed an affine manifold, if $\nabla$ is a flat and torsion-free connection on the tangent bundle $TM\rightarrow M$. A Riemannian metric $g$ on $M$ is called a Hessian metric on affine manifold $(M, \nabla)$, if $g$ can be expressed locally as the Hessian quadratic form of some smooth potential $f$. An affine manifold equipped with a Hessian metric is termed a Hessian manifold. We study the topology and geometry of Hessian manifolds.
  Key topological constraints are derived, including the vanishing of the Euler characteristic for any compact Hessian manifold and the proof that its fundamental group must be infinite and torsion-free. We demonstrate that compact Hessian manifolds with an abelian fundamental group are homeomorphic to the flat torus. The theory of flat line bundles is developed to introduce the canonical and obstruction bundles, which are used to prove that a curved compact orientable Hessian manifold must be a mapping torus.
  A Hessian manifold $((M, \nabla),g)$ is said to be of Koszul type, if there exists an $1$-form $\eta\in\Omega^1(M)$ such that $g=\nabla\eta$. We place emphasis on Hessian manifolds of Koszul type, establishing an equivalence between their existence and that of positive flat line bundles, space-like Lagrangian immersions, and hyperbolic affine structures. A duality with radiant manifolds, analogous to the classical Legendre transformation, is explored. We also construct a non-trivial family of compact Hessian manifolds of Koszul type with negative scalar curvature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers the Euler-Lagrange equations satisfied by the critical points of a large class of conformally invariant extrinsic energies for 4-manifolds immersed into Euclidean space (any codimension). Using invariances and Noether's theorem, we convert the Euler-Lagrange equation in a system of equations with analytically favourable structures. The present paper generalises to the four-dimensional setting ideas originally developed by Tristan Rivi\`ere in his study of the Willmore energy in two dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01639v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a local equivalence between toric steady K\"ahler-Ricci solitons and $A$-type toric generalized K\"ahler-Ricci solitons (GKRS). Under natural global conditions we show this equivalence extends to complete GKRS, yielding a general construction of new examples in all dimensions. We show that in four dimensions, all GKRS are either described by the generalized K\"ahler Gibbons-Hawking ansatz, or have split tangent bundle, or are $A$-type toric. This yields a local classification in four dimensions, together with a conjecturally exhaustive construction of complete symplectic-type examples.</description>

      <title>Regularity of cylindrical singular sets of mean curvature flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the $k$-cylindrical singular set of mean curvature flow in $\mathbb R^{n+1}$ for each $1\leq k\leq n-1$. We prove that they are locally contained in a $k$-dimensional $C^{2,\alpha}$-submanifold after removing some lower-dimensional parts. Moreover, if the $k$-cylindrical singular set is a $k$-submanifold, then its curvature is determined by the asymptotic profile of the flow at these singularities. As a byproduct, we provide a detailed asymptotic profile and graphical radius estimate at these singularities. The proof is based on a new $L^2$-distance non-concentration property that we introduced in [SWX25], modified into a relative version that allows us to modulo those low eigenmodes that are not decaying fast enough and do not contribute to the curvature of the singular set.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the study of Ricci-Yamabe solitons on a particular class of Walker manifolds in dimension 3. We consider a Walker metric where the function f depends on the
  three coordinates. The novelty of our research lies in the fact that the soliton field is found from the Hodge decomposition of De-Rham with the potential function. We classify all Ricci Yamabe and gradient Ricci-Yamabe soliton in a given Walker 3-manifold by using this decomposition. Many examples are given in this paper for illustrating our results.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study symplectic groups and indefinite orthogonal groups over involutive, possibly noncommutative, algebras $(A, \sigma)$. In the case when the algebra $(A, \sigma)$ is Hermitian, or the complexification $(A_{\mathbb{C}}, \sigma_{\mathbb{C}})$ of a Hermitian involutive algebra, one can identify maximal compact subgroups of such groups, and consider their associated Riemannian symmetric space. This new perspective allows for the realization of various geometric models for the symmetric space. We describe explicitly the complexified tangent space for each of the models, as well as the diffeomorphisms between them and their differentials.
  In an application of this theory, we introduce alternative notions of polystable Higgs bundles that can be used for the study of fundamental group representations into symplectic or into indefinite orthogonal groups over Hermitian involutive algebras. We characterize solutions to the relevant harmonicity equations with respect to these new models of the symmetric space. Reductive fundamental group representations then correspond to holomorphic pairs written with regard to these geometric incarnations of the associated symmetric space, thus allowing new insights for their study.</description>

      <title>Isometric deformations of pillow boxes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pillow boxes are surfaces used for gift boxes, packaging, and even architectural applications. By definition, a pillow box is isometric to a double rectangle consisting of two copies of a rectangle. If the crease pattern is allowed to change, there exist continuous isometric deformations from a pillow box to a double rectangle. However, practical applications often require preserving the crease pattern. In this paper, we classify isometric deformations from a pillow box to a double rectangle among curved foldings that preserve the crease pattern. As a corollary, we prove that such an isometric deformation necessarily changes the topology of a pillow box.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present extensions of the classical Bonnet-Myers theorem for Riemannian manifolds with nonnegative Ricci curvature. Our results provide criteria for compactness and a method for estimating the diameter of such manifolds under general curvature conditions. As applications, we establish compactness theorems for manifolds whose Ricci curvature decays at polynomial or exponential rates.</description>

      <title>Rigidity in the Ginzburg--Landau approximation of harmonic spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that not every harmonic map from $S^{2}$ to $S^{2}$ can arise as a limit of Ginzburg--Landau critical points. More precisely, we show that the only degree-one harmonic maps that can be approximated in this way are rotations.
  This conclusion follows from a rigidity theorem: we show that for every $\gamma&gt;0$ and $\varepsilon$ small enough, the only critical points $u_\varepsilon:S^{2}\to\mathbb R^{3}$ of the Ginzburg--Landau energy $E_\varepsilon$ with energy below $8\pi-\gamma$ are (up to conjugation) rotations, that is $u_\varepsilon(x)=\sqrt{1-2\varepsilon^{2}}\;R_\varepsilon\,x$.</description>

      <title>The Conjugate Function Method for Surfaces with Elaborate Topological Types</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The conjugate function method is an algorithm for numerical computation of conformal mappings for simply and multiply connected domains on surfaces. In this paper the conjugate function method is generalized and refined to achieve the same level of accuracy on simply and multiply connected planar domains and Riemann surfaces. The main challenge addressed here is the accurate and efficient construction of the conjugate problem for multiply connected domains. The method relies on high-order finite element methods which allow for highly accurate computations of mappings on surfaces, including domains of complex boundary geometry containing strong singularities and cusps. The efficacy of the proposed method is illustrated via an extensive set of numerical experiments with error estimates.</description>

      <title>Transforming tubular packings to bicontinuous surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02306v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The link between bicontinuous architectures in biological membranes and triply-periodic minimal surfaces (TPMS) is a well established example of stunning geometric form in nature. The prolamellar body (PLB) in early plant plastid development is a classic example, forming the Diamond TPMS in a lipid-protein-pigment membrane. However, the early development of such spectacular geometric structures is poorly understood. Inspired by the presence of tubules in the micrographs of early plastid membrane formation, we explore here geometric modelling of transformations of packings of cylinders that coalesce together to form bicontinuous structures. Using computational modelling, we find that specific cylinder packings with cubic symmetry transform into highly symmetric TPMS, which now stand as a candidate set of surfaces for further investigation into the PLB, as well as other occurrences of bicontinuous membranes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2205.08250v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a 1998 preprint, Bill Thurston outlined a Teichmuller theory for hyperbolic surfaces based on maps between surfaces which minimize the Lipschitz constant (minimum stretch or best Lipschitz maps). In this paper we continue the analytic investigation which we began in our previous paper. In the spirit of the construction of infinity-harmonic functions, we produce best Lipschitz maps u as limits p goes to infinity of minimizers of p-Schatten integrals (p-Schatten harmonic maps) in a fixed homotopy class between hyperbolic surfaces. We address existence and regularity of p-Schatten harmonic maps with the latter, due to higher degeneracies, being significantly harder than for ordinary p- harmonic maps. Moreover, we construct Lie algebra valued dual functions which minimize a dual q-Schatten integral and limit as q goes to 1 to a locally defined, Lie algebra valued function v of bounded variation. One of the main results of the paper is the surprising fact that the support of the measure dv (the derivative of v) lies on the canonical geodesic lamination constructed by Thurston and further studied by Gueritaud-Kassel. In the sequel paper we will show how these Lie algebra valued measures induce a transverse measure on the canonical lamination and relate to other aspects of Thurston theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15032v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss a large class of conformally invariant curvature energies for immersed hypersurfaces of dimension 4. The class under study includes various examples that have appeared in the recent literature and which arise from different contexts. We show that under natural small-energy hypotheses, critical points satisfy improved energy estimates. Nearly all the PDEs which we consider are quasilinear and fourth-order in the mean curvature. We approach the problem \`a la T. Rivi\`ere by generating first from Noether's theorem divergence-free "potentials", and then by exhibiting an underlying analytically favourable algebraic structure relating them. We also consider local Palais-Smale sequences and show they converge to a solution of a constrained Euler-Lagrange equation with Lagrange multiplier appearing in the form of a TT-tensor.</description>

Abstract: We show that for any Riemannian foliation with a simply connected and negatively curved leaf space the normal exponential map of a leaf is a diffeomorphism. As an application, if the leaves are furthermore minimal submanifolds, we give a sharp estimate for the bottom of the spectrum of such a Riemannian manifold. Our proof of the spectral estimate also yields an estimate for the bottom of the spectrum of the horizontal Laplacian.</description>

      <title>Weyl Law and convergence in the classical limit for min-max nonlocal minimal surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12162v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study nonlocal minimal surfaces as a new approximation theory for the area functional, and more specifically in the context of Yau's conjecture on the existence of minimal surfaces in closed three-dimensional manifolds.
  In recent work, the author and collaborators constructed infinitely many nonlocal $s$-minimal hypersurfaces (via min-max methods) on any closed $n$-dimensional Riemannian manifold $M$, establishing a full analogue of Yau's conjecture for $s\in(0,1)$.
  The present article first proves a Weyl Law for the fractional perimeters of these hypersurfaces. The rest -- and main part -- of the article is devoted to obtaining effective estimates (as $s\to 1$) for min-max $s$-minimal surfaces in closed three-dimensional manifolds, including classical perimeter and mean curvature estimates, and eventually establishing their convergence to smooth, classical minimal surfaces. We recover in particular recent results on generic density and equidistribution of minimal surfaces, which are a strong form of Yau's conjecture in this setting.</description>

Abstract: We extend calculus from smooth manifolds to topological manifolds making use of a theory of generalized functions developed for this aim. Actually such extension fits into a boarder context: the universal construction of a site containing all continuous maps between topological spaces and whose arrows are smooth in the generalized sense. As an application we prove the existence of non singular generalized tangent vector fields on spheres of any dimension, showing how this result is coherent with the non existence of smooth vector fields on spheres of even dimension. Many other applications are outlined or suggested, some of which are under development by the author.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we establish a scalar-mean curvature comparison theorem for the long neck problem on odd-dimensional spin manifolds. This extends previous work of Cecchini and Zeidler, and gives a complete answer to Gromov's long neck problem in terms of spin manifolds. As a related question, we prove a quantitative version of Llarull's theorem on non-compact spin manifolds. Our results are derived by studying the spectral flow of a family of Callias operators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17746v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the Schr\"odinger operator $H(\mu) = \nabla_{\bf A}^*\nabla_{\bf A} + \mu V$ on a Riemannian manifold $M$ of bounded geometry, where $\mu&gt;0$ is a coupling parameter, the magnetic field ${\bf B}=d{\bf A}$ and the electric potential $V$ are uniformly $C^\infty$-bounded, $V\geq 0$. We assume that, for some $E_0&gt;0$, each connected component of the sublevel set $\{V&lt;E_0\}$ of the potential $V$ is relatively compact. Under some assumptions on geometric and spectral properties of the connected components, we show that, for sufficiently large $\mu$, the spectrum of $H(\mu)$ in the interval $[0,E_0\mu]$ has a gap, the spectral projection of $H(\mu)$, corresponding to the interval $(-\infty,\lambda]$ with $\lambda$ in the gap, belongs to the Roe $C^*$-algebra $C^*(M)$ of the manifold $M$, and, if $M$ is not compact, its class in the $K$ theory of $C^*(M)$ is trivial.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17193v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a connected, simply connected three-dimensional Lie group (unimodular or non-unimodular) equipped with a left-invariant (Riemannian or Lorentzian) metric $g$. By definition, the isometry group $\mathrm{Isom}(G, g)$ contains $G$ itself, acting by left translations. It turns out that, generically, $\mathrm{Isom}(G, g)$ is actually equal to $G$, and the natural question then becomes to classify those special metrics for which this is not the case. Using Lie-theoretical methods, we present a unified approach to obtain all pairs $(G, g)$ whose full isometry group $\mathrm{Isom}(G, g)$ has dimension greater than or equal to four. As a consequence, we determine, for every pair $(G, g)$, up to automorphism and scaling, the dimension of $\mathrm{Isom}(G, g)$, which can be three, four, or six.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18000v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Building upon dimension reduction techniques in the study of positive scalar curvature (PSC) geometry, we prove an effective version of the positive mass theorem (PMT) for asymptotically flat (AF) manifolds of dimension $n\leq 8$ with arbitrary ends (Theorem \ref{thm: 8dim Schoen conj}). Furthermore, we prove two "free of singularity type rigidity theorems" for minimal hypersurfaces with isolated singularities (Theorem \ref{prop: rigidity for minimal surface} and Theorem \ref{thm: georch free of singularity}). Our approach bypasses the need for N. Smale's regularity theorem for minimal hypersurfaces in generic $8$-dimensional compact manifolds, providing a direct derivation of the PMT for such AF manifolds (Theorem \ref{thm: pmt8dim}).
  Motivated by these developments, we further establish PMT for singular spaces (Theorems \ref{thm:pmt with singularity4}). These results assume only that the scalar curvature is non-negative in a strong spectral sense, a condition naturally aligned with the stability of minimal hypersurfaces in PSC ambient manifolds.</description>

Abstract: This article is concerned with the analysis of Dirac operators $D$ twisted by ramified Euclidean line bundles $(Z,\mathfrak{l})$-motivated by their relation with harmonic $\mathbf{Z}/2\mathbf{Z}$ spinors, which have appeared in various context in gauge theory and calibrated geometry. The closed extensions of $D$ are described in terms of the Gelfand-Robbin quotient $\check{\mathbf{H}}$. Assuming that the branching locus $Z$ is a closed cooriented codimension two submanifold, a geometric realisation of $\check{\mathbf{H}}$ is constructed. This, in turn, leads to an $L^2$ regularity theory.</description>

This infinite-dimensional space has appeared in the study of Hermitian-Einstein structures, where a special L2-type Riemannian metric is introduced. We compute the metric spray, geodesics and curvature associated to this metric, and show that the exponential map is a diffeomorphsim. Though being geodesically complete, the space of Hermitian metrics is metrically incomplete, and its metric completion is proved to be the space of L2 integrable singular Hermitian metrics. In addition, both the original space and its completion are CAT(0). In the holomorphic case, it turns out that Griffiths seminegative/semipositive singular Hermitian metric is always "L2 integrable" in our sense. Also, in the Appendix, the Nash-Moser inverse function theorem is utilized to prove that, for any L2 metric on the space of smooth sections of a given fiber bundle, the exponential map is always a local diffeomorphism, provided that each fiber is nonpositively curved.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we show that there exists a step-two Carnot group on which the new lower bound of the curvature exponent given in arXiv:2308.15811v2 can be strictly less than the curvature exponent by studying the convergence of the structure constants of Lie algebra.</description>

      <title>On the non-existence of left-invariant hypercomplex structures on $SU(2)^{4n}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21766v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using elementary algebraic arguments, it is shown that $SU(2)^{m}:=SU(2)\times \cdots \times SU(2)$ ($m$ times) admits no left-invariant hypercomplex structures for all $m\ge 1$. This result answers (in a clear and easily accessible way) the question of whether every compact Lie group of dimension $4n$ admits a left-invariant hypercomplex structure. The aforementioned question has apparently been the source of some confusion in the recent literature.</description>

      <title>The Minkowski problem for the $k$-torsional rigidity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24494v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: P. Salani [Adv. Math., 229 (2012)] introduced the $k$-torsional rigidity associated with a $k$-Hessian equation and obtained the Brunn-Minkowski inequalities $w.r.t.$ the torsional rigidity in $\mathbb{R}^3$. Following this work, we first construct, in the present paper, a Hadamard variational formula for the $k$-torsional rigidity with $1\leq k\leq n-1$, then we can deduce a $k$-torsional measure from the Hadamard variational formula. Based on the $k$-torsional measure, we propose the Minkowski problem for the $k$-torsional rigidity and confirm the existence of its smooth non-even solutions by the method of a curvature flow. Specially, a new proof method for the uniform lower bound estimation in the $C^0$ estimation for the solution to the curvature flow is presented with the help of invariant functional $\Phi(\Omega_t)$.</description>

      <title>Gluing doubly periodic Scherk surfaces into minimal surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12859v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct minimal surfaces by stacking doubly periodic Scherk surfaces one above another and gluing them along their ends. It is previously known that the Karcher--Meeks--Rosenberg (KMR) doubly periodic minimal surfaces and Meeks' family of triply periodic minimal surfaces can both be obtained by gluing two Scherk surfaces. There have been hope and failed attempts to glue more Scherk surfaces. But our analysis shows that: Except for the special case where the doubly periodic Scherk surfaces all have triangular horizontal lattice, a glue construction can only produce the trivial Scherk surface itself, the KMR examples, or Meeks' surfaces.</description>

      <title>On contact Hamiltonian functions of singular contact structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13613v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For contact manifolds, it is well-known that the map which assigns to an infinitesimal contact transformation its contact Hamiltonian function is a linear isomorphism, and an explicit local formula for its inverse can be given. In contrast, infinitesimal contact transformations on a singular contact structure have not been well-studied yet. In this article, we show that this map is injective and present an explicit local formula for its inverse when the contact structure has singularities of the first type with structurally smooth Martinet hypersurface.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14240v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by Carrollian geometry, we define super-Carrollian manifolds as a supermanifold with an even degenerate metric such that the kernel is generated by a non-singular odd vector field that is a supersymmetry generator. Alongside other results, we show that compatible affine connections always exist, albeit they must carry torsion. As a physically relevant example, we show how a super-Carrollian manifold can be constructed from standard superspace $\mathbb{R}^{4|4}$ via an In\"on\"u--Wigner contraction.</description>

      <title>The Hasse Principle for Geometric Variational Problems: An Illustration via Area-minimizing Submanifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21045v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Hasse principle in number theory states that information about integral solutions to Diophantine equations can be pieced together from real solutions and solutions modulo prime powers. We show that the Hasse principle holds for area-minimizing submanifolds: information about area-minimizing submanifolds in integral homology can be fully recovered from those in real homology and mod $n$ homology for all $n\in \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 2}.$ As a consequence we derive several surprising conclusions, including: area-minimizing submanifolds in mod $n$ homology are asymptotically much smoother than expected and area-minimizing submanifolds are not generically calibrated. We conjecture that the Hasse principle holds for all geometric variational problems that can be formulated on chain space over different coeffiicients, e.g., Almgren-Pitts min-max, mean curvature flow, Song's spherical Plateau problem, minimizers of elliptic and other general functionals, etc.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02995v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that, on any closed manifold of dimension at least two with non-trivial first Betti number, a $C^\infty$ generic Riemannian metric has infinitely many closed geodesics, and indeed closed geodesics of arbitrarily large length. We derive this existence result combining a theorem of Ma\~n\'e together with the following new theorem of independent interest: the existence of minimal closed geodesics, in the sense of Aubry-Mather theory, implies the existence of a transverse homoclinic, and thus of a horseshoe, for the geodesic flow of a suitable $C^\infty$-close Riemannian metric.</description>

      <title>A scaling characterization of nc-rank via unbounded gradient flow</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05412v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a tuple of $n \times n$ complex matrices ${\cal A} = (A_1,A_2,\ldots, A_m)$, the linear symbolic matrix $A = A_1x_1 + A_2x_2 + \cdots + A_m x_m$ is nonsingular in the noncommutative sense if and only if the completely positive operators $T_{\cal A} (X) = \sum_{i=1}^m A_i X A_i^{\dagger}$ and $T_{\cal A}^*(X) = \sum_{i=1}^m A_i^{\dagger} X A_i$ can be scaled to be doubly stochastic: For every $\epsilon &gt; 0$ there are $g,h \in GL(n,\mathbb{C})$ such that $\|T_{g^{\dagger}{\cal A}h}(I)- I\| &lt; \epsilon$, $\| T^*_{g^\dagger{\cal A}h}(I) - I\| &lt; \epsilon$. In this paper, we show a refinement: The noncommutative corank of $A$ is equal to one-half of the minimum residual $\|T_{g^{\dagger}{\cal A}h}(I) - I\|_1 + \|T^*_{g^{\dagger}{\cal A}h}(I) - I\|_1$ over all possible scalings $g^{\dagger}{\cal A}h$, where $\|\cdot \|_1$ is the trace norm. To show this, we interpret the residuals as gradients of a convex function on symmetric space $GL(n,\mathbb{C})/U_n$, and establish a general duality relation of the minimum gradient-norm of a lower-unbounded convex function $f$ on $GL(n,\mathbb{C})/U_n$ with an invariant Finsler metric, by utilizing the unbounded gradient flow of $f$ at infinity.</description>

      <title>Extension principles for the Einstein Yang--Mills system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19403v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove the local existence theorem and establish an extension principle for the spherically symmetric Einstein Yang--Mills system (SSEYM) with $H^1$ data. This in addition implies Cauchy stability for the system.
  In contrast to a massless scalar field, the purely magnetic Yang--Mills field in spherical symmetry satisfies a wave-type equation with a singular potential. As a consequence, the proof of Christodoulou [10], based on an $L^\infty-L^\infty$ estimate, fails in the Yang--Mills context. Instead, we employ an $L^2$-based method, which is valid for both massless and massive scalar matter fields as well.</description>
