      <title>Entanglement dynamics from universal low-lying modes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Information-theoretic quantities such as Renyi entropies show a remarkable universality in their late-time behaviour across a variety of chaotic quantum many-body systems. Understanding how such common features emerge from very different microscopic dynamics remains an important challenge. In this work, we address this question in a class of Brownian models with random time-dependent Hamiltonians and a variety of different microscopic couplings. In any such model, the Lorentzian time-evolution of the $n$-th Renyi entropy can be mapped to evolution by a Euclidean Hamiltonian on 2$n$ copies of the system. We provide evidence that in systems with no symmetries, the low-energy excitations of the Euclidean Hamiltonian are universally given by a gapped quasiparticle-like band. The eigenstates in this band are plane waves of locally dressed domain walls between ferromagnetic ground states associated with two permutations in the symmetric group $S_n$. These excitations give rise to the membrane picture of entanglement growth, with the membrane tension determined by their dispersion relation. We establish this structure in a variety of cases using analytical perturbative methods and numerical variational techniques, and extract the associated dispersion relations and membrane tensions for the second and third Renyi entropies. For the third Renyi entropy, we argue that phase transitions in the membrane tension as a function of velocity are needed to ensure that physical constraints on the membrane tension are satisfied. Overall, this structure provides an understanding of entanglement dynamics in terms of a universal set of gapped low-lying modes, which may also apply to systems with time-independent Hamiltonians.</description>

      <title>Fading ergodicity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) represents a breakthrough in many-body physics since it allows to link thermalization of physical observables with the applicability of random matrix theory (RMT). Recent years were also extremely fruitful in exploring possible counterexamples to thermalization, ranging, among others, from integrability, single-particle chaos, many-body localization, many-body scars, to Hilbert-space fragmentation. In all these cases the conventional ETH is violated. However, it remains elusive how the conventional ETH breaks down when one approaches the boundaries of ergodicity, and whether the range of validity of the conventional ETH coincides with the validity of RMT-like spectral statistics. Here we bridge this gap and we introduce a scenario of the ETH breakdown in many-body quantum systems, which establishes a link between the conventional ETH and non-ergodic behavior. We conjecture this scenario to be relevant for the description of finite many-body systems at the boundaries of ergodicity, and we provide numerical and analytical arguments for its validity in the quantum sun model of ergodicity breaking phase transition. For the latter, we provide evidence that the breakdown of the conventional ETH is not associated with the breakdown of the RMT-like spectral statistics.</description>

      <title>Fluids with power-law repulsion: Hyperuniformity and energy fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the equilibrium statistical mechanics of a classical fluid of point-like particles with repulsive power-law pair interactions, focusing on density and energy fluctuations. Such long-range interactions, decaying with inter-particle distance $r$ as $1/r^s$ in $d$ dimensions, are known to fall into two qualitatively different categories. For $s&lt;d$ ("strongly" long-range interactions) there are screening of correlations and suppression of large-wavelength density fluctuations (hyperuniformity). These effects eliminate density modes with arbitrarily large energy. For $s&gt;d$ ("weakly" long-range interactions) screening and hyperuniformity do not occur. Using scaling arguments, variational analysis, and Monte Carlo simulations, we find another qualitative distinction. For $s \geq d/2$ the strong repulsion at short distances suppresses small-wavelength density fluctuations. This "small-scale hyperuniformity" prevents indefinitely negative entropy and large energy fluctuations. The distinct behaviors for $s \geq d/2$ and $s&lt;d/2$ give rise to qualitatively different dependencies of the entropy, heat capacity, and energy fluctuations on temperature and density. We investigate the effect of introducing an upper cutoff distance in the pair-potential. The effect of the cutoff on energy fluctuations is strong for $s&lt;d/2$ and negligible for $s \geq d/2$.</description>

      <title>The Ground State of the S=1 Antiferromagnetic Heisenberg Chain is Topologically Nontrivial if Gapped</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17041v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Under the widely accepted but unproven assumption that the one-dimensional $S=1$ antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model has a unique gapped ground state, we prove that the model belongs to a nontrivial symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phase. In other words, we rigorously rule out the possibility that the model has a unique gapped ground state that is topologically trivial. To be precise, we assume that the models on open finite chains with boundary magnetic field have unique ground states with a uniform gap and prove that the ground state of the infinite chain has a nontrivial topological index.</description>

      <title>Conserved densities of hard rods: microscopic to hydrodynamic solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a system of many hard rods moving in one-dimension. As it is an integrable system, it possesses an extensive number of conserved quantities and its evolution on macroscopic scale can be described by generalised hydrodynamics. Using a microscopic approach, we compute the evolution of the conserved densities starting from non-equilibrium initial conditions of both quenched and annealed type. In addition to getting reduced to the Euler solutions of the hydrodynamics in the thermodynamic limit, the microscopic solutions can also capture effects of the Navier-Stokes terms and thus go beyond the Euler solutions. We demonstrate this feature in two problems - first, tracer diffusion in a background of hard rods and second, the evolution from a domain wall initial condition in which the velocity distribution of the rods are different on the two sides of the interface. We supplement our analytical results using extensive numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Exact and asymptotic dissipative spectral form factor for elliptic Ginibre unitary ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dissipative spectral form factor (DSFF) has recently emerged as a diagnostic tool for assessing non-integrability or chaos in non-Hermitian systems. It extends the concept of the spectral form factor (SFF), a widely used measure for similar investigations in Hermitian systems. In this study, we concentrate on the elliptic Ginibre unitary ensemble (eGinUE), which interpolates between the non-Hermitian limit of Ginibre unitary ensemble (GinUE) and the Hermitian limit of Gaussian unitary ensemble (GUE) by varying a symmetry parameter. We derive exact finite-dimension expression and large-dimension approximation for the DSFF of eGinUE. A key finding of this work is a compelling ``scaling relationship" between the DSFF of eGinUE and that of the GUE or GinUE. This scaling relationship also reveals a previously unobserved connection between the DSFF of GinUE and the SFF of GUE. The DSFF for eGinUE displays a \emph{dip-ramp-plateau} structure in the GinUE and GUE limits, as well as in the crossover region, with differences in time scales that are well-explained by the aforementioned scaling relationship. Additionally, depending on the symmetry regime within the crossover, we provide various estimates for the Thouless time ($T_\mathrm{Th}$) and Heisenberg time ($T_\mathrm{H}$), which correspond to the dip-ramp and ramp-plateau transitions, respectively. Our analytical results are compared with Monte Carlo simulations of the eGinUE random matrix model, showing excellent agreement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within its range of applicability, the Boltzmann equation seems unique in its capacity to accurately describe the transition from almost any initial state to a self-equilibrated thermal state. Using information-theoretic methods to rephrase the key idea of Maxwell and Boltzmann, the Sto{\ss}zahlansatz, a far more general, abstract ansatz is developed. An increase of the Gibbs-Shannon-von Neumann entropy results without the usual coarse-graining. The mathematical structure of the ansatz also provides avenues for efficient computation and simulation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the thermodynamic properties of an information engine that uses feedback control to extract work from a manipulated mechanical oscillator. The feedback is triggered by the first passage of the system across a fixed threshold. In this setting, we derive and experimentally verify two distinct fluctuation theorems that involve the information associated with the feedback-controlled stochastic trajectories. Our experimental setup consists of a cantilever submitted to an electrostatic feedback force, and our protocol improves the thermodynamic performances of the engine by a factor of 5, compared with previously proposed protocols.</description>

      <title>Re-routing game: The inadequacy of mean-field approach in modeling the herd behavior in path switching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coordination of vehicle routes is a feasible way to ease traffic congestions amid a fixed road infrastructure. Nevertheless, even the optimal route configurations are provided to individual drivers, it is hard to achieve as greedy drivers may switch to other routes for a lower individual cost. Recent research uses mean-field cavity approach from the studies of spin glasses to analyze the impact of path switching in optimized transportation networks. However, this method only provides a mean-field approximation, which does not take into account the collective herd behavior in path switching due to un-coordinated individual decisions. In this study, we propose an exhaustive cavity approach to investigate the impact of un-coordinated path switching in a re-routing game and reveal that greedy drivers' decision can be highly correlated which leads to the failure of mean-fielded approaches. Our theoretical results fits well with simulations, and our developed framework can be generalized to analyze other games with multiple players and rounds. Our results shed light on the impact of herd behavior of un-coordinated human drivers in suppressing congestions through path coordination.</description>

Abstract: Active particles under soft confinement such as droplets or vesicles present intriguing phenomena, as collective motion emerges alongside the deformation of the environment. A model is employed to systematically investigate droplet morphology and particle distribution in relation to activity and concentration,revealing that active particles have the capacity to induce enhanced shape fluctuations in the droplet interface with respect to the thermal fluctuations, aligning with recent experimental observations. A rich phase behaviour can be identified with two different mechanism of droplet breakage.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the theoretical description of electrical noise and fluctuation-induced effects in electrolytes has gained a renewed interest, enabled by stochastic field theories like stochastic density functional theory (SDFT). Such models, however, treat solvents implicitly, ignoring their generally polar nature. In the present study, starting from microscopic principles, we derive a fully explicit SDFT theory that applies to ions in a polar solvent. These equations are solved to compute observables like dynamic charge structure factors and dielectric susceptibilities. We unveil the relative importance of the different contributions (solvent, ions, cross terms) to the dynamics of electrolytes, which are key to understand the couplings between ions and the fluctuations of their microscopic environment.</description>

      <title>The Devil is in the Details: Complexity Powered Machine Intelligent Classification of Quantum Many-Body Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Identifying and classifying quantum phases from measurable time series in many-body dynamics have significant values, yet face formidable challenges, requiring profound knowledge of physicists. Here, to achieve a pure data-driven machine intelligent classification, we introduce a complexity boosted distance measure that captures the inherent complexity of dynamic evolution series in different quantum many-body phases. Significantly, the introduction of complexity-boosted distance leads to remarkable improvements of unsupervised manifold learning of quantum many-body dynamics, which are exemplified in discrete time crystal model, Aubry-Andr\'e model, and quantum east model. Our method does not require any prior knowledge and exhibits effectiveness even in imperfect, disordered, and noisy situations that are challenging for human scientists. Successful classification of dynamic phases in many-body systems holds the potential to enable crucial applications, including identification of tsunamis, earthquakes, catastrophes and future trends in finance.</description>

      <title>Learning a phenomenological theory for contact-interactions between motile cells from collision experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The migration behavior of colliding cells is critically determined by transient contact-interactions. During these interactions, the motility machinery, including the front-rear polarization of the cell, dynamically responds to surface protein-mediated transmission of forces and biochemical signals between cells. While biomolecular details of such contact-interactions are increasingly well understood, it remains unclear what biophysical interaction mechanisms govern the cell-level dynamics of colliding cells and how these mechanisms vary across cell types. Here, we develop a phenomenological theory based on eleven candidate contact-interaction mechanisms coupling cell position, shape, and polarity. Using high-throughput micropattern experiments, we detect which of these phenomenological contact-interactions captures the interaction behaviors of cells. We find that various cell types - ranging from mesenchymal to epithelial cells - are accurately captured by a single model with only two interaction mechanisms: polarity-protrusion coupling and polarity-polarity coupling. The qualitatively different interaction behaviors of distinct cells, as well as cells subject to molecular perturbations of surface protein-mediated signaling, can all be quantitatively captured by varying the strength and sign of the polarity-polarity coupling mechanism. Altogether, our data-driven phenomenological theory of cell-cell interactions reveals polarity-polarity coupling as a versatile and general contact-interaction mechanism, which may underlie diverse collective migration behavior of motile cells.</description>

      <title>Dissipation induced ergodic-nonergodic transitions in finite-height mosaic Wannier-Stark lattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent research has observed the occurrence of pseudo-mobility edge (ME) within a modulated mosaic model incorporating the Wannier-Stark potential. This pseudo-ME, which signifies the critical energy that distinguishes between ergodic and weakly ergodic, or weakly ergodic and nonergodic states, is a crucial concept in comprehending the transport and localization phenomena in Wannier-Stark systems. Here we investigate the influence of dissipation on a finite-height mosaic Wannier-Stark lattice that features such pseudo-MEs by computing the steady state density matrix. Our findings indicate that particular dissipation can steer the system into specific states, regardless of its initial state, predominantly characterized by either ergodic or nonergodic states. This suggests that dissipation can be harnessed as a novel method for inducing transitions between these states and manipulating particle localization behaviors in disorder-free systems.</description>

      <title>Upscaling transport in heterogeneous media featuring local-scale dispersion: flow channeling, macro-retardation and parameter prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17351v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many theoretical treatments of transport in heterogeneous Darcy flows consider advection only. When local-scale dispersion is neglected, flux-weighting persists over time; mean Lagrangian and Eulerian flow velocity distributions relate simply to each other and to the variance of the underlying hydraulic conductivity field. Local-scale dispersion complicates this relationship, potentially causing initially flux-weighted solute to experience lower-velocity regions as well as Taylor-type macrodispersion due to transverse solute movement between adjacent streamlines. To investigate the interplay of local-scale dispersion with conductivity log-variance, correlation length, and anisotropy, we perform a Monte Carlo study of flow and advective-dispersive transport in spatially-periodic 2D Darcy flows in large-scale, high-resolution multivariate Gaussian random conductivity fields. We observe flow channeling at all heterogeneity levels and quantify its extent. We find evidence for substantial effective retardation in the upscaled system, associated with increased flow channeling, and observe limited Taylor-type macrodispersion, which we physically explain. A quasi-constant Lagrangian velocity is achieved within a short distance of release, allowing usage of a simplified continuous-time random walk (CTRW) model we previously proposed in which the transition time distribution is understood as a temporal mapping of unit time in an equivalent system with no flow heterogeneity. The numerical data set is modeled with such a CTRW; we show how dimensionless parameters defining the CTRW transition time distribution are predicted by dimensionless heterogeneity statistics and provide empirical equations for this purpose.</description>

      <title>Markovian description of a wide class of feedback-controlled systems: Application to the feedback flashing ratchet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04195v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In feedback-controlled systems, an external agent -- the feedback controller -- measures the state of the system and modifies its subsequent dynamics depending on the outcome of the measurement. In this paper, we build a Markovian description for the joint stochastic process that comprises both the system and the controller variables. This Markovian description is valid for a wide class of feedback-controlled systems, allowing for the inclusion of errors in the measurement. The general framework is motivated and illustrated with the paradigmatic example of the feedback flashing ratchet.</description>

      <title>Ratchet-mediated resetting: Current, efficiency, and exact solution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10698v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We model an overdamped Brownian particle that is subject to resetting facilitated by a ratchet potential on a spatially periodic domain. This asymmetric potential switches on with a constant rate, but switches off again only upon the particle's first passage to a resetting point at the minimum of the potential. Repeating this cycle sustains a non-equilibrium steady-state, as well as a directed steady-state current which can be harnessed to perform useful work. We derive exact analytic expressions for the probability densities of the free-diffusion and resetting phases, the associated currents for each phase, and an efficiency parameter that quantifies the return in current for given power input. These expressions allow us to fully characterise the system and obtain experimentally relevant results such as the optimal current and efficiency. Our results are corroborated by simulations, and have implications for experimentally viable finite-time resetting protocols.</description>

      <title>Privacy-preserving machine learning with tensor networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2202.12319v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tensor networks, widely used for providing efficient representations of low-energy states of local quantum many-body systems, have been recently proposed as machine learning architectures which could present advantages with respect to traditional ones. In this work we show that tensor network architectures have especially prospective properties for privacy-preserving machine learning, which is important in tasks such as the processing of medical records. First, we describe a new privacy vulnerability that is present in feedforward neural networks, illustrating it in synthetic and real-world datasets. Then, we develop well-defined conditions to guarantee robustness to such vulnerability, which involve the characterization of models equivalent under gauge symmetry. We rigorously prove that such conditions are satisfied by tensor-network architectures. In doing so, we define a novel canonical form for matrix product states, which has a high degree of regularity and fixes the residual gauge that is left in the canonical forms based on singular value decompositions. We supplement the analytical findings with practical examples where matrix product states are trained on datasets of medical records, which show large reductions on the probability of an attacker extracting information about the training dataset from the model's parameters. Given the growing expertise in training tensor-network architectures, these results imply that one may not have to be forced to make a choice between accuracy in prediction and ensuring the privacy of the information processed.</description>

      <title>Quantum battery with non-Hermitian charging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2203.09497v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a design of a quantum battery exploiting the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian as a charger. In particular, starting with the ground or the thermal state of the interacting (non-interacting) Hamiltonian as the battery, the charging of the battery is performed via parity-time (PT)- and rotational-time (RT)-symmetric Hamiltonian to store energy. We report that such a quenching with a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian leads to an enhanced power output compared to a battery with a Hermitian charger. We identify the region in the parameter space which provides the gain in performance. We also demonstrate that the improvements persist with the increase of system size for batteries with both PT- and RT-symmetric chargers. In the PT-symmetric case, although the anisotropy of the XY model does not help in the performance, we show that the XXZ model as a battery with a non-Hermitian charger performs better than that of the XX model having certain interaction strengths. We also exhibit that the advantage of non-Hermiticity remains valid even at finite temperatures in the initial states.</description>

      <title>Quantum reservoir probing: an inverse paradigm of quantum reservoir computing for exploring quantum many-body physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.00898v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum reservoir computing (QRC) is a brain-inspired computational paradigm, exploiting natural dynamics of a quantum system for information processing. To date, a multitude of quantum systems have been utilized in the QRC, with diverse computational capabilities demonstrated accordingly. This study proposes a reciprocal research direction: probing quantum systems themselves through their information processing performance in the QRC framework. Building upon this concept, here we develop quantum reservoir probing (QRP), an inverse extension of the QRC. The QRP establishes an operator-level linkage between physical properties and performance in computing. A systematic scan of this correspondence reveals intrinsic quantum dynamics of the reservoir system from computational and informational perspectives. Unifying quantum information and quantum matter, the QRP holds great promise as a potent tool for exploring various aspects of quantum many-body physics. In this study, we specifically apply it to analyze information propagation in a one-dimensional quantum Ising chain. We demonstrate that the QRP not only distinguishes between ballistic and diffusive information propagation, reflecting the system's dynamical characteristics, but also identifies system-specific information propagation channels, a distinct advantage over conventional methods.</description>

Abstract: We revisit Brownian Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model and argue that it has emergent energy conservation overlooked in the literature before. We solve this model in the double-scaled regime and demonstrate hyperfast scrambling, exponential decay of correlation functions, bounded spectrum and unexpected factorization of higher-point functions. We comment on how these results are related to de Sitter holography.</description>

      <title>Exponential mixing of all orders for Arnol'd cat map lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08521v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the recently introduced classical Arnol'd cat map lattice field theories, which are chaotic, are exponentially mixing to all orders. Their mixing times are well-defined and are expressed in terms of the Lyapunov exponents, more precisely by the combination that defines the inverse of the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy of these systems. We prove by an explicit recursive construction of correlation functions, that these exhibit $l-$fold mixing for any $l= 3,4,5,\ldots$. This computation is relevant for Rokhlin's conjecture, which states that 2-fold mixing induces $l-$fold mixing for any $l&gt;2$. Our results show that 2-fold exponential mixing, while being necessary for any $l-$fold mixing to hold it is nevertheless not sufficient for Arnol'd cat map lattice field theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04274v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the framework of the AdS/CFT correspondence, we find a neutral complex scalar field dynamics in a $2+1$ dimensional black hole background which can provide a scheme for studying the pattern formation process in $1+1$ dimensional reaction-diffusion systems. The patterns include plane wave, defect turbulence, phase turbulence, spatio-temporal intermittency where defect chaos coexists with stable plane wave, and coherent structures. A phase diagram is obtained by studying the linear instability of the plane wave solutions to determine the onset of the holographic version of the BFN instability. Near the critical temperature the holographic model is dual to the one-dimensional complex Ginzburg-Landau equation (CGLE), which has been studied extensively in reaction-diffusion systems. While at low temperature the holographic theory is different from CGLE.</description>

      <title>Using rare event algorithms to understand the statistics and dynamics of extreme heatwave seasons in South Asia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07791v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Computing the return times of extreme events and assessing the impact of climate change on such return times is fundamental to extreme event attribution studies. However, the rarity of such events in the observational record makes this task a challenging one, even more so for "record-shattering" events that have not been previously observed at all. While climate models could be used to simulate such extremely rare events, such an approach entails a huge computational cost: gathering robust statistics for events with return time of centuries would require a few thousand years of simulation.
  In this study, we use an innovative tool, rare event algorithm, that allows to sample numerous extremely rare events at a much lower cost than direct simulations. We employ the algorithm to sample extreme heatwave seasons, corresponding to large anomalies of the seasonal average temperature, in a heatwave hotspot of South Asia using the global climate model Plasim. We show that the algorithm estimates the return levels of extremely rare events with much greater precision than traditional statistical fits. It also enables the computation of various composite statistics, whose accuracy is demonstrated through comparison with a very long control run. In particular, our results reveal that extreme heatwave seasons are associated with an anticyclonic anomaly embedded within a large-scale hemispheric quasi-stationary wave-pattern. Additionally, the algorithm accurately represents the intensity-duration-frequency statistics of sub-seasonal heatwaves, offering insights into both seasonal and sub-seasonal aspects of extreme heatwave seasons. This innovative approach could be used in extreme event attribution studies to better constrain the changes in event's probability and intensity with global warming, particularly for events with return times spanning centuries or millennia.</description>

      <title>A minimal scenario for the origin of non-equilibrium order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10911v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Extant life contains numerous non-equilibrium mechanisms to create order not achievable at equilibrium; it is generally assumed that these mechanisms evolved because the resulting order was sufficiently beneficial to overcome associated costs of time and energy. Here, we identify a broad range of conditions under which non-equilibrium order-creating mechanisms will evolve as an inevitable consequence of self-replication, even if the order is not directly functional. We show that models of polymerases, when expanded to include known stalling effects, can evolve kinetic proofreading through selection for fast replication alone, consistent with data from recent mutational screens. Similarly, replication contingent on fast self-assembly can select for non-equilibrium instabilities and result in more ordered structures without any direct selection for order. We abstract these results into a framework that predicts that self-replication intrinsically amplifies dissipative order-enhancing mechanisms if the distribution of replication times is wide enough. Our work suggests the intriguing possibility that non-equilibrium order can arise more easily than assumed, even before that order is directly functional, with consequences impacting such diverse phenomena as the evolution of mutation rates, kinetic traps in self-assembly, and the origin of life.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02082v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Marginal optima are minima or maxima of a function with many nearly flat directions. In settings with many competing optima, marginal ones tend to attract algorithms and physical dynamics. Often, the important family of marginal attractors are a vanishing minority compared with nonmarginal optima and other unstable stationary points. We introduce a generic technique for conditioning the statistics of stationary points in random landscapes on their marginality, and apply it in three isotropic settings with qualitatively different structure: in the spherical spin-glasses, where the energy is Gaussian and its Hessian is GOE; in multispherical spin glasses, which are Gaussian but non-GOE; and in sums of squared spherical random functions, which are non-Gaussian. In these problems we are able to fully characterize the distribution of marginal optima in the landscape, including when they are in the minority.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02092v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optimization seeks extremal points in a function. When there are superextensively many optima, optimization algorithms are liable to get stuck. Under these conditions, generic algorithms tend to find marginal optima, which have many nearly flat directions. In a companion paper, we introduce a technique to count marginal optima in random landscapes. Here, we use the statistics of marginal optima calculated using this technique to produce generic bounds on optimization, based on the simple principle that algorithms will overwhelmingly tend to get stuck only where marginal optima are found. We demonstrate the idea on a simple non-Gaussian problem of maximizing the sum of squared random functions on a compact space. Numeric experiments using both gradient descent and generalized approximate message passing algorithms fall inside the expected bounds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15231v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the information loss at the cosmological apparent horizon in an expanding universe has a direct correspondence with the Landauer principle of information dynamics. We show that the Landauer limit is satisfied in this case, which implies that the information erasure at the cosmological apparent horizon happens in the most efficient way possible. We also show that our results hold for extensions of the standard entropy formulations. We also discuss about the connections this result provides between information loss at black holes and that at the cosmological apparent horizon, and we term the "Cosmological Information Paradox". This is the first work which directly provides a correspondence between information dynamics and expanding cosmic horizons, and we discuss several interesting implications of this result.</description>

      <title>Studying the 3d Ising surface CFTs on the fuzzy sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15914v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Boundaries not only are fundamental elements in nearly all realistic physical systems, but also greatly enrich the structure of quantum field theories. In this paper, we demonstrate that conformal field theory (CFT) with a boundary, known as surface CFT in three dimensions, can be studied with the setup of fuzzy sphere. We consider the example of surface criticality of the 3D Ising CFT. We propose two schemes by cutting a boundary in the orbital space or the real space to realise the ordinary and the normal surface CFTs on the fuzzy sphere. We obtain the operator spectra through state-operator correspondence. We observe integer spacing of the conformal multiplets, and thus provide direct evidence of conformal symmetry. We identify the ordinary surface primary $o$, the displacement operator $\mathrm{D}$ and their conformal descendants and extract their scaling dimensions. We also study the one-point and two-point correlation functions and extract the bulk-to-surface OPE coefficients, some of which are reported for the first time. In addition, using the overlap of the bulk CFT state and the polarised state, we calculate the boundary central charges of the 3D Ising surface CFTs non-perturbatively. Other conformal data obtained in this way also agrees with prior methods.</description>
