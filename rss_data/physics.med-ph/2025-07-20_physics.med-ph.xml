      <title>Quantification of head and neck cancer patients' anatomical changes during radiotherapy: prediction of replanning need</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Head and neck cancer (HNC) patients who undergo radiotherapy (RT) may experience anatomical changes during treatment, compromising the validity of the initial treatment plan, necessitating replanning. However, replanning disrupts clinical workflows, creating a stressful environment. Currently, no standardized method exists to determine the total amount of anatomical change that necessitates replanning. This project aimed to create metrics to describe anatomical changes HNC patients may experience during RT and develop machine learning (ML) models to predict RT replanning. We included a cohort of 150 HNC patients treated at the McGill University Health Centre. Based on the shape of the RT structures, we created metrics and developed an extraction pipeline, called HNGeoNatomyX, to automatically calculate them. A univariate metric analysis using linear regression was conducted to obtain the rate of change of each metric. We also obtained the relative variation of each metric between the pre-treatment scan and the fraction at which replanning was requested. Fraction-specific ML models (models that incorporated information available up to and including the specific fraction) for fractions 5, 10, and 15 were built using the metrics, clinical data, and feature selection techniques. To estimate models' performance, we used a repeated stratified 5-fold cross-validation resampling technique and the Area Under the Curve (AUC) of the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve. The best specific multivariate models for fractions 5, 10, and 15 yielded testing scores of 0.82, 0.70, and 0.79, respectively. Our models early predicted replanning for 76% of the true positives. The created metrics have the potential to characterize and distinguish which patients will necessitate RT replanning. They show promise in guiding clinicians to evaluate RT replanning for HNC patients and streamline workflows.</description>

      <title>GPU Accelerated Transducer-Field Calculation using the Traditional Born Series Formulation for Realistic Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study numerically solves inhomogeneous Helmholtz equations modeling acoustic wave propagation in homogeneous and lossless, absorbing and dispersive, inhomogeneous and nonlinear media. The traditional Born series (TBS) method has been employed to solve such equations. The full wave solution in this methodology is expressed as an infinite sum of the solution of the unperturbed equation weighted by increasing power of the potential. Simulated pressure field patterns for a linear array of acoustic sources (a line source) estimated by the TBS procedure exhibit excellent agreement with that of a standard time domain approach (k-Wave toolbox). The TBS scheme though iterative but is a very fast method. For example, GPU enabled CUDA C code implementing the TBS procedure takes 5 s to calculate the pressure field for the homogeneous and lossless medium whereas nearly 500 s is taken by the later module. The execution time for the corresponding CPU code is about 20 s. The findings of this study demonstrate the effectiveness of the TBS method for solving inhomogeneous Helmholtz equation, while the GPU-based implementation significantly reduces the computation time. This method can be explored in practice for calculation of pressure fields generated by real transducers designed for diverse applications.</description>

      <title>Advanced X-rays techniques for research-oriented high-resolution imaging of articular cartilage: a scoping review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Articular cartilage is a musculoskeletal soft tissue renowned for its unique mechanical properties. Understanding both its hierarchical structure and the interplay between its constituents could shed light on the mechanical competence of the tissue. Therefore, rheologic approaches based on high-resolution non-destructive imaging techniques are desired. In this context, X-ray imaging could ideally accomplish this task. Nevertheless, the nature of articular cartilage translates into poor contrast using conventional absorption modality. To overcome this limitation, several approaches can be embraced. X-ray visibility of articular cartilage can be increased with the use of radiopaque contrast agents. Therefore, further discrimination of structures could be provided by spectral techniques, pivoting on either multi-energy acquisitions or photon-counting technology. Alternatively, phase-contrast techniques unveil details typically undetected with conventional approaches. Phase-contrast imaging, based on the intrinsic decrement in the refractive index of the tissue, can be achieved with different configurations and implementations, including distinct X-ray sources and optical elements. Additionally, some phase-contrast techniques retrieve the small-angle scattering-based dark-field signal, relatable to sub-pixel structures. This scoping review aims to catalogue the application of these advanced X-ray techniques to articular cartilage imaging, following PRISMA guidelines. It discusses their advantages, limitations, and includes an overview of rheologic applications to articular cartilage.</description>

      <title>Coupled Modeling of External Pressure and Capillary Blood Flow: Nonlinear Dynamics of Vascular Elasticity and Collapse Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: External pressure significantly influences microcirculatory capillary blood flow, yet current studies lack quantitative modeling. This work proposes a nonlinear segmented coupling model between external pressure and capillary flow, incorporating vascular elasticity and collapse effects. The pressure-flow response is divided into three phases: elastic compression under low pressure (less than 30 mmHg), elliptical collapse in the transition zone (30 to 40 mmHg), and closure-induced attenuation under high pressure (above 40 mmHg), with explicit expressions derived for each. Parameter sensitivity analysis and comparison with literature demonstrate the model's capability in capturing key determinants. The proposed framework supports dose-response assessment and individualized parameter tuning in pressure-based therapies such as tourniquets and compression garments.</description>

      <title>Solving Blind Inverse Problems: Adaptive Diffusion Models for Motion-corrected Sparse-view 4DCT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12249v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Four-dimensional computed tomography (4DCT) is essential for medical imaging applications like radiotherapy, which demand precise respiratory motion representation. Traditional methods for reconstructing 4DCT data suffer from artifacts and noise, especially in sparse-view, low-dose contexts. Motion-corrected (MC) reconstruction is a blind inverse problem that we propose to solve with a novel diffusion model (DM) framework that calibrates an adaptive unknown forward model for motion correction. Furthermore, we used a wavelet diffusion model (WDM) to address computational cost and memory usage. By leveraging the prior probability distribution function (PDF) from the DMs, we enhance the joint reconstruction and motion estimation (JRM) process, improving image quality and preserving resolution. Experiments on extended cardiac-torso (XCAT) phantom data demonstrate that our method outperforms existing techniques, yielding artifact-free, high-resolution reconstructions even under irregular breathing conditions. These results showcase the potential of combining DMs with motion correction to advance sparse-view 4DCT imaging.</description>

      <title>GATE 10 Monte Carlo particle transport simulation -- Part II: architecture and innovations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09840v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Over the past years, we have developed GATE version 10, a major re-implementation of the long-standing Geant4-based Monte Carlo application for particle and radiation transport simulation in medical physics. This release introduces many new features and significant improvements, most notably a Python-based user interface replacing the legacy static input files. The new functionality of GATE version 10 is described in the part 1 companion paper. The development brought significant challenges. In this paper, we present the solutions that we have developed to overcome these challenges. In particular, we present a modular design that robustly manages the core components of a simulation: particle sources, geometry, physics processes, and data acquisition. The architecture consists of parts written in C++ and Python, which needed to be coupled. We explain how this framework allows for the precise, time-aware generation of primary particles, a critical requirement for accurately modeling positron emission tomography (PET), radionuclide therapies, and prompt-gamma timing systems. We present how GATE 10 handles complex Geant4 physics settings while exposing a simple interface to the user. Furthermore, we describe the technical solutions that facilitate the seamless integration of advanced physics models and variance reduction techniques. The architecture supports sophisticated scoring of physical quantities (such as Linear Energy Transfer and Relative Biological Effectiveness) and is designed for multithreaded execution. The new user interface allows researchers to script complex simulation workflows and directly couple external tools, such as artificial intelligence models for source generation or detector response. By detailing these architectural innovations, we demonstrate how GATE 10 provides a more powerful and flexible tool for research and innovation in medical physics.</description>

      <title>Analytic Model of Radial Sensitivity in Cylindrical PET Systems Based on First Principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13118v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In cylindrical positron emission tomography (PET) systems, the center of the field of view (FOV) is typically assumed to have the highest system sensitivity. This assumption underlies standardized protocols such as NEMA NU 2-2018, which specify measurements at the CFOV, and influences how systems are characterized and compared. However, experimental studies report varying radial sensitivity trends, some showing comparable or higher sensitivity off center, while others reveal more complex, non-monotonic patterns. Despite these observations, a first-principles theoretical model describing radial plane sensitivity has not been clearly established. In this work, we derive an analytic model for the radial sensitivity distribution in a cylindrical PET system, based solely on ideal scanner geometry and basic detection physics. To our knowledge, this is the first closed-form theoretical formulation of its kind, offering a foundational description of radial sensitivity variation under idealized conditions. The model excludes system-specific factors such as detector efficiency or crystal shape, and thus provides a generalizable baseline for conceptual understanding and practical reference. To evaluate the model's relevance in real-world systems, we perform both Monte Carlo simulations and physical experiments using a representative PET system. The measured and simulated sensitivity profiles align well with theoretical predictions, with deviations attributable to system-specific factors. Beyond serving as a reference for interpreting empirical inconsistencies, this work contributes fundamental insight that may support system design, quantitative modeling, and educational materials on PET instrumentation.</description>
