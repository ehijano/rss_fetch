      <title>The quantum Mpemba effect in free-fermionic mixed states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, a novel probe to study symmetry breaking, known as entanglement asymmetry, has emerged and has been utilized to explore how symmetry is dynamically restored following quantum quenches. Interestingly, it has been shown that, in certain scenarios, greater initial symmetry breaking leads to faster restoration, akin to a quantum Mpemba effect. This study focuses on investigating the effect of mixed initial states and non-unitary dynamics on symmetry restoration. The mixedness of a state can arise from different sources. We consider dephasing or dissipative processes affecting initial pure states or unitary dynamics of initially thermal states. In the former case, the stationary state after the quench is independent of the initial configuration, resembling the phenomenology of the classical Mpemba effect. Investigating the XY spin chain model, through a combination of analytical calculations and numerical simulations, we identify the conditions for the occurrence of the quantum Mpemba effect. It turns out that this phenomenon still occurs in the presence of dissipation or at finite temperature, even though it will be eventually suppressed as the state becomes more mixed.</description>

      <title>Exact analysis of the two-dimensional asymmetric simple exclusion process with attachment and detachment of particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP) is a paradigmatic driven-diffusive system that describes the asymmetric diffusion of particles with hardcore interactions in a lattice. Although the ASEP is known as an exactly solvable model, most exact results are limited to one-dimensional systems. Recently, the exact steady state in the multi-dimensional ASEP has been proposed [1]. The research focused on the situation where the number of particles is conserved. In this paper, we consider the two-dimensional ASEP with the attachment and detachment of particles (ASEP-LK), where particle number conservation is violated. By employing the result in Ref. [1], we construct the exact steady state of the ASEP-LK and reveal its properties through the exact computation of physical quantities.</description>

      <title>Recurrence solution of monomer-polymer models on two-dimensional rectangular lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of counting polymer coverings on the rectangular lattices is investigated. In this model, a linear rigid polymer covers $k$ adjacent lattice sites such that no two polymers occupy a common site. Those unoccupied lattice sites are considered as monomers. We prove that for a given number of polymers ($k$-mers), the number of arrangements for the polymers on two-dimensional rectangular lattices satisfies simple recurrence relations. These recurrence relations are quite general and apply for arbitrary polymer length ($k$) and the width of the lattices ($n$). The well-studied monomer-dimer problem is a special case of the monomer-polymer model when $k=2$. It is known the enumeration of monomer-dimer configurations in planar lattices is #P-complete. The recurrence relations shown here have the potential for hints for the solution of long-standing problems in this class of computational complexity.</description>

      <title>The OU$^2$ process: Characterising dissipative confinement in noisy traps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process describes the dynamics of Brownian particles in a confining harmonic potential, thereby constituting the paradigmatic model of overdamped, mean-reverting Langevin dynamics. Despite its widespread applicability, this model falls short when describing physical systems where the confining potential is itself subjected to stochastic fluctuations. However, such stochastic fluctuations generically emerge in numerous situations, including in the context of colloidal manipulation by optical tweezers, leading to inherently out-of-equilibrium trapped dynamics. To explore the consequences of stochasticity at this level, we introduce a natural extension of the OU process, in which the stiffness of the harmonic potential is itself subjected to OU-like fluctuations. We call this model the OU$^2$ process. We examine its statistical, dynamic, and thermodynamic properties through a combination of analytical and numerical methods. Importantly, we show that the probability density for the particle position presents power-law tails, in contrast to the Gaussian decay of the standard OU process. In turn, this causes the trapping behavior, extreme value statistics, first passage statistics, and entropy production of the OU$^2$ process to differ qualitatively from their standard OU counterpart. Due to the wide applicability of the standard OU process and of the proposed OU$^2$ generalisation, our study sheds light on the peculiar properties of stochastic dynamics in random potentials and lays the foundation for the refined analysis of the dynamics and thermodynamics of numerous experimental systems.</description>

      <title>Dominating Lengthscales of Zebrafish Collective Behaviour</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collective behaviour in living systems is observed across many scales, from bacteria to insects, to fish shoals. Zebrafish have emerged as a model system amenable to laboratory study. Here we report a three-dimensional study of the collective dynamics of fifty zebrafish. We observed the emergence of collective behaviour changing between \yy{ordered} to randomised, upon \yy{adaptation} to new environmental conditions. We quantify the spatial and temporal correlation functions of the fish and identify two length scales, the persistence length and the nearest neighbour distance, that capture the essence of the behavioural changes. The ratio of the two length scales correlates robustly with the polarisation of collective motion that we explain with a reductionist model of self--propelled particles with alignment interactions.</description>

      <title>Measurement-induced phase transitions in systems with diffusive dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The competition between scrambling and projective measurements can lead to measurement-induced entanglement phase transitions (MIPT). In this work, we show that the universality class of the MIPT is drastically altered when the system is coupled to a diffusing conserved density. Specifically, we consider a 1+1d random Clifford circuit locally monitored by classically diffusing particles (``measurers''). The resulting diffusive correlations in the measurement density are a relevant perturbation to the usual space-time random MIPT critical point, producing a new universality class for this phase transition. We find ``Griffiths-like'' effects due to rare space-time regions where, e.g., the diffusive measurers have a low or high density, but these are considerably weaker than the Griffiths effects that occur with quenched randomness that produce rare spatial regions with infinite lifetime.</description>

      <title>On the quantum origin of limit cycles, fixed points, and critical slowing down</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Among the most iconic features of classical dissipative dynamics are persistent limit-cycle oscillations and critical slowing down at the onset of such oscillations, where the system relaxes purely algebraically in time. On the other hand, quantum systems subject to generic Markovian dissipation decohere exponentially in time, approaching a unique steady state. Here we show how coherent limit-cycle oscillations and algebraic decay can emerge in a quantum system governed by a Markovian master equation as one approaches the classical limit, illustrating general mechanisms using a single-spin model and a two-site lossy Bose-Hubbard model. In particular, we demonstrate that the fingerprint of a limit cycle is a slow-decaying branch with vanishing decoherence rates in the Liouville spectrum, while a power-law decay is realized by a spectral collapse at the bifurcation point. We also show how these are distinct from the case of a classical fixed point, for which the quantum spectrum is gapped and can be generated from the linearized classical dynamics.</description>

      <title>The Interplay of Finite and Infinite Size Stability in Quadratic Bosonic Lindbladians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a framework for understanding dynamical metastability in open many-body systems of free bosons, whereby the dynamical stability properties of the system in the infinite-size (thermodynamic) limit may sharply differ from those of any finite-size truncation, and anomalous transient dynamics may arise. By leveraging pseudospectral techniques, we trace the discrepancy between asymptotic and transient dynamics to the non-normality of the underlying quadratic bosonic Lindbladian (QBL) generator, and show that two distinct flavors of dynamical metastability can arise. QBLs exhibiting type I dynamical metastability, previously discussed in the context of anomalous transient amplification [Phys. Rev. Lett. 127, 245701 (2021)], are dynamically unstable in the infinite-size limit, yet stable once open boundaries are imposed. Type II-dynamically metastable QBLs, which we uncover in this work, are dynamically stable for infinite size, but become unstable under open boundary conditions for arbitrary finite system size. We exhibit representative models for both types of metastability in the dissipative, as well as the limiting closed-system (Hamiltonian) settings, and analyze distinctive physical behavior they can engender. We show that dynamical metastability manifests itself in the generation of entanglement entropy, by way of a transient which reflects the stability phase of the infinite (rather than the actual finite) system and, as a result, is directly tied to the emergence of super-volume scaling in type I systems. Finally, we demonstrate how, even in Hermitian, and especially in highly non-normal regimes, the spectral properties of an infinite-size QBL are reflected in the linear response functions of the corresponding finite QBLs, by way of resonant pseudospectral modes.</description>

      <title>Dynamic constraints predict the relaxation of granular materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Granular materials such as sand, powders, and food grains are ubiquitous in civil engineering, geoscience, agriculture, and medicine. While the influence of friction between the grains on the static structure of these systems is well understood, its impact on the dynamics is an open problem. Here we use particle-based simulations of a granular pack under cyclic shear and discover that the relaxation time of the system is a non-monotonic function of friction. By introducing the concept of dynamic constraints, we reveal that this re-entrant dynamics is due to the competition between increasing frictional coupling and a concurrent change in the structure of the granular pack. Our theoretical approach, which unifies the dynamics of friction-less systems with frictional ones, is applicable to other systems that have a complex free energy landscape and a dynamics which involves time-dependent constraints, thus setting the stage for a description of the dynamic behavior of a large class of complex systems.</description>

      <title>On the analyticity of the lightest particle mass of Ising field theory in a magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the scaling functions associated with the lightest particle mass $M_1$ in 2d Ising field theory in external magnetic field. The scaling functions depend on the scaling parameter $\xi = h/|m|^{\frac{15}{8}}$, or related parameter $\eta = m / h^{\frac{8}{15}}$. Analytic properties of $M_1$ in the high-T domain were discussed in arXiv:2203.11262. In this work, we study analyticity of $M_1$ in the low-T domain. Important feature of this analytic structure is represented by the Fisher-Langer's branch cut. The discontinuity across this branch cut determines the behavior of $M_1$ at all complex $\xi$ via associated low-T dispersion relation. Also, we put forward the "extended analyticity" conjecture for $M_1$ in the complex $\eta$-plane, similar to the analyticity of the free energy density previously proposed in arXiv:hep-th/0112167. The extended analyticity implies the "extended dispersion relation", which we verify against the numerics from the Truncated Free Fermion Approach (TFFSA), giving strong support to the conjecture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A procedure to find optimal regimes for quantum thermal engines (QTMs) is described and demonstrated. The QTMs are modelled as the periodically-driven non-equilibrium steady states of open quantum systems, whose dynamics is approximated in this work with Markovian master equations. The action of the external agent, and the couplings to the heat reservoirs can be modulated with control functions, and it is the time-dependent shape of these control functions the object of optimisation. Those functions can be freely parameterised, which permits to constrain the solutions according to experimental or physical requirements.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics and kinetics of state switching for the asymptotically flat black hole in a cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose that the thermodynamics and the kinetics of state switching for the asymptotically flat black hole enclosed by a cavity can be studied in terms of the free energy landscape formalism. The generalized free energy for the black hole enclosed by a cavity in the canonical ensemble is derived by using the York's approach, where the temperature on the cavity and the charges inside the cavity are kept as the fixed parameters. By quantifying the corresponding free energy landscape, we obtain the phase diagrams for the black hole in cavity, which reveal a Hawking-Page type transition for the uncharged black hole and a Van der Waals type transition for the charged black hole. We further assume that the dynamics of black hole state switching is mutually determined by the gradient force and the stochastic force arising from the free energy landscape and the thermal noises respectively. We then derive a recurrence relation for the $n$-momentum of the first passage time distribution function, which enables the calculation of the kinetic times characterized by the mean first passage time and its relative fluctuation. Our analysis illustrates that the kinetics of black hole state switching is determined by the ensemble temperature and the barrier height on the free energy landscape.</description>

      <title>Dynamics after quenches in one-dimensional quantum Ising-like systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2007.09041v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of one-dimensional quantum Ising-like systems, arising from sudden quenches of the Hamiltonian parameter $g$ driving quantum transitions between disordered and ordered phases. In particular, we consider quenches to values of $g$ around the critical value $g_c$, and mainly address the question whether, and how, the quantum transition leaves traces in the evolution of the transverse and longitudinal magnetizations during such a deep out-of-equilibrium dynamics. We shed light on the emergence of singularities in the thermodynamic infinite-size limit, likely related to the integrability of the model. Finite systems in periodic and open boundary conditions develop peculiar power-law finite-size scaling laws related to revival phenomena, but apparently unrelated to the quantum transition, because their main features are generally observed in quenches to generic values of $g$. We also investigate the effects of dissipative interactions with an environment, modeled by a Lindblad equation with local decay and pumping dissipation operators within the quadratic fermionic model obtainable by a Jordan-Wigner mapping. Dissipation tends to suppress the main features of the unitary dynamics of closed systems. We finally address the effects of integrability breaking, due to further lattice interactions, such as in anisotropic next-to-nearest neighbor Ising (ANNNI) models. We show that some qualitative features of the post-quench dynamics persist, in particular the different behaviors when quenching to quantum ferromagnetic and paramagnetic phases, and the revival phenomena due to the finite size of the system.</description>

      <title>Information gain at the onset of habituation to repeated stimuli</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.12812v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Biological and living systems process information across spatiotemporal scales, exhibiting the hallmark ability to constantly modulate their behavior to ever-changing and complex environments. In the presence of repeated stimuli, a distinctive response is the progressive reduction of the activity at both sensory and molecular levels, known as habituation. Here, we solve a minimal microscopic model devoid of biological details to show that habituation is driven by negative feedback provided by a slow storage mechanism. Crucially, an intermediate level of habituation is associated with a steep increase in the information that the system collects on the external input over time. We find that the region characterized both by maximal information gain and by the onset of habituation can be retrieved if the system tunes its parameters to minimize dissipation and maximize information at the same time. We test our dynamical predictions against experimentally recorded neural responses in a zebrafish larva subjected to repeated looming stimulation. Our work makes a fundamental step towards uncovering the core mechanisms that shape habituation in biological systems, elucidating its information-theoretic and functional role.</description>

      <title>On the implementation of zero-determinant strategies in repeated games</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.05597v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Zero-determinant strategies are a class of strategies in repeated games which unilaterally control payoffs. Zero-determinant strategies have attracted much attention in studies of social dilemma, particularly in the context of evolution of cooperation. So far, not only general properties of zero-determinant strategies have been investigated, but zero-determinant strategies have been applied to control in the fields of information and communications technology and analysis of imitation. Here, we further deepen our understanding on general mathematical properties of zero-determinant strategies. We first prove that zero-determinant strategies, if exist, can be implemented by some one-dimensional transition probability. Next, we prove that, if a two-player game has a non-trivial potential function, a zero-determinant strategy exists in its repeated version. These results assist us to implement zero-determinant strategies in broader situations.</description>

Abstract: The tradeoff relation between speed and cost is a central issue in designing fast and efficient information processing devices. We derive an achievable bound on thermodynamic cost for obtaining information through finite-time (non-quasi-static) measurements. Our proof is based on optimal transport theory, which enables us to identify the explicit protocol to achieve the obtained bound. Moreover, we demonstrate that the optimal protocol can be approximately implemented by an experimentally feasible setup with quantum dots. Our results would lead to design principles of high-speed and low-energy-cost information processing.</description>

Abstract: Based on the direct method of molecular dynamics, the temperature dependence of energy, partition function, entropy and free energy, describing the first-order phase transition, is calculated for the classical Peyrard-Bishop-Dauxois model of the DNA molecule. It is shown that without taking into account the quantum freezing of the degrees of freedom at low temperatures, the relationship between these quantities is not determined. An estimation was given for the number of bubbles in homogeneous DNA chains: PolyA/PolyT and PolyG/PolyC.</description>

      <title>Unveiling nonequilibrium from multifilar events</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.00837v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Closely related to the laws of thermodynamics, the detection and quantification of disequilibria are crucial in unraveling the complexities of nature, particularly those beneath observable layers. Theoretical developments in nonequilibrium thermodynamics employ coarse-graining methods to consider a diversity of partial information scenarios that mimic experimental limitations, allowing the inference of properties such as the entropy production rate. A ubiquitous but rather unexplored scenario involves observing events that can possibly arise from many transitions in the underlying Markov process--which we dub $\textit{multifilar events}$--as in the cases of exchanges measured at particle reservoirs, hidden Markov models, mixed chemical and mechanical transformations in biological function, composite systems, and more. We relax one of the main assumptions in a previously developed framework, based on first-passage problems, to assess the non-Markovian statistics of mutifilar events. By using the asymmetry of event distributions and their waiting-times, we put forward model-free tools to detect nonequilibrium behavior and estimate entropy production, while discussing their suitability for different classes of systems and regimes where they provide no new information, evidence of nonequilibrium, a lower bound for entropy production, or even its exact value. The results are illustrated in reference models through analytics and numerics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.19324v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Catalysis plays a key role in many scientific areas, most notably in chemistry and biology. Here we present a catalytic process in a paradigmatic quantum optics setup, namely the Jaynes-Cummings model, where an atom interacts with an optical cavity. The atom plays the role of the catalyst, and allows for the deterministic generation of non-classical light in the cavity. Considering a cavity prepared in a ``classical'' coherent state, and choosing appropriately the atomic state and the interaction time, we obtain an evolution with the following properties. First, the state of the cavity has been modified, and now features non-classicality, as witnessed by sub-Poissonian statistics or Wigner negativity. Second, the process is catalytic, in the sense that the atom is deterministically returned to its initial state exactly, and can be re-used multiple times. What is more, we also show that our findings are robust under dissipation and can be applied to scenarios featuring cavity loss and atomic decay. Finally, we investigate the mechanism of this catalytic process, in particular highlighting the key role of correlations and quantum coherence.</description>

      <title>Caustic formation in a non-Gaussian model for turbulent aerosols</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.10689v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Caustics in the dynamics of heavy particles in turbulence accelerate particle collisions. The rate $\mathscr{J}$ at which these singularities form depends sensitively on the Stokes number St, the non-dimensional inertia parameter. Exact results for this sensitive dependence have been obtained using Gaussian statistical models for turbulent aerosols. However, direct numerical simulations of heavy particles in turbulence yield much larger caustic-formation rates than predicted by the Gaussian theory. In order to understand possible mechanisms explaining this difference, we analyse a non-Gaussian statistical model for caustic formation in the limit of small St. We show that at small St, $\mathscr{J}$ depends sensitively on the tails of the distribution of Lagrangian fluid-velocity gradients. This explains why different authors obtained different St-dependencies of $\mathscr{J}$ in numerical-simulation studies. The most-likely gradient fluctuation that induces caustics at small St, by contrast, is the same in the non-Gaussian and Gaussian models. Direct-numerical simulation results for particles in turbulence show that the optimal fluctuation is similar, but not identical, to that obtained by the model calculations.</description>

      <title>The Bethe Ansatz as a Quantum Circuit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.14430v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Bethe ansatz represents an analytical method enabling the exact solution of numerous models in condensed matter physics and statistical mechanics. When a global symmetry is present, the trial wavefunctions of the Bethe ansatz consist of plane wave superpositions. Previously, it has been shown that the Bethe ansatz can be recast as a deterministic quantum circuit. An analytical derivation of the quantum gates that form the circuit was lacking however. Here we present a comprehensive study of the transformation that brings the Bethe ansatz into a quantum circuit, which leads us to determine the analytical expression of the circuit gates. As a crucial step of the derivation, we present a simple set of diagrammatic rules that define a novel Matrix Product State network building Bethe wavefunctions. Remarkably, this provides a new perspective on the equivalence between the coordinate and algebraic versions of the Bethe ansatz.</description>

      <title>Sampling reduced density matrix to extract fine levels of entanglement spectrum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.16709v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Low-lying entanglement spectrum provides the quintessential fingerprint to identify the highly entangled quantum matter with topological and conformal field-theoretical properties. However, when the entangling region acquires long boundary with the environment, such as that between long coupled chains or in two or higher dimensions, there unfortunately exists no universal yet practical method to compute the entanglement spectra with affordable computational cost. Here we propose a new scheme to overcome such difficulty and successfully extract the low-lying fine entanglement spectrum (ES). We trace out the environment via quantum Monte Carlo simulation and diagonalize the reduced density matrix to gain the ES. We demonstrate the strength and reliability of our method through long coupled spin chains and answer its long-standing controversy. Our simulation results, with unprecedentedly large system sizes, establish the practical computation scheme of the entanglement spectrum with a huge freedom degree of environment.</description>

      <title>Detecting Quantum Anomalies in Open Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.11188v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Symmetries and quantum anomalies serve as powerful tools for constraining complicated quantum many-body systems, offering valuable insights into low-energy characteristics based on their ultraviolet structure. Nevertheless, their applicability has traditionally been confined to closed quantum systems, rendering them largely unexplored for open quantum systems described by density matrices. In this work, we introduce a novel and experimentally feasible approach to detect quantum anomalies in open systems. Specifically, we claim that, when coupled with an external environment, the mixed 't Hooft anomaly between spin rotation symmetry and lattice translation symmetry gives distinctive characteristics for half-integer and integer spin chains in measurements of $\exp(\rm{i}\theta S^z_{\rm tot})$ as a function of $\theta$. Notably, the half-integer spin chain manifests a topological phenomenon akin to the ``level crossing" observed in closed systems. To substantiate our assertion, we develop a lattice-level spacetime rotation to analyze the aforementioned measurements. Based on the matrix product density operator and transfer matrix formalism, we analytically establish and numerically demonstrate the unavoidable singular behavior of $\exp(\rm{i}\theta S^z_{\rm tot})$ for half-integer spin chains. Conceptually, our work demonstrates a way to discuss notions like ``spectral flow'' and ``flux threading'' in open systems not necessarily with a Hamiltonian.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.01938v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Molecular anisotropy plays an important role in the glass transition of a liquid. Recently, a novel bulk glass state has been discovered by optical microscopy experiments on suspensions of ellipsoidal colloids. 'Liquid glass' is a disordered analog of a nematic liquid crystal, in which rotation motion is hindered but particles diffuse freely. Global nematic order is suppressed as clusters of aligned particles intertwine. We perform Brownian dynamics simulations to test the structure and dynamics of a dense system of soft ellipsoidal particles. As seen in experiments and in accordance with predictions from mode coupling theory, on the time scale of our simulations rotation motion is frozen but translation motion persists in liquid glass. Analyses of the dynamic structure functions for translation and rotation corroborates the presence of two separate glass transitions for rotation and translation, respectively. Even though the equilibrium state should be a nematic, aligned structures remain small and orientational order rapidly decays with increasing size. Long-wavelength fluctuations are remnants of the isotropic-nematic transition.</description>

      <title>Bi-Hamiltonian in Semiflexible Polymer as Strongly Coupled System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13655v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When many body system in Classical Mechanics is described using bi-Hamiltonian for its group of particles which forms a coarse grained bead, the damping energy from the heat bath perturbs the motion of a particle which is along the trajectory of multiple Hamiltonian system simultaneously. As managing the coarse grained modeling of the suspended semiflexible polymer like single walled carbon nanotubes(SWCNT) in vacuum, the authors discovered that such interconnection between Hamiltonian systems as sharing a heat bath builds a strongly coupled system. The consequence of this interconnection is revealed to form certain form of cross correlated momentum in coarsed grained system as well as in the original atomic scales. In this paper, we adapt the framework of Stochastic Thermodynamics to describe the cross correlation of bi-Hamiltonian system which replicates the macroscopic behaviour of SWCNT under the Smoluchowski picture for cross correlation between Hamiltonian systems. The numerical experiments using collision between tubes confirms the derivation and the justification of the usage of the heat diffusion to compensate the abnormaly from cross correlated momentum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.03044v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Materials typically fail under complex stress states, essentially involving dilatational (volumetric) components that eventually lead to material decohesion/separation. It is therefore important to understand dilatational irreversible deformation -- i.e., dilatational plasticity -- en route to failure. In the context of glasses, much focus has been given to shear (volume-preserving) plasticity, both in terms of the stress states considered and the corresponding material response. Here, using a recently-developed methodology and extensive computer simulations, we shed basic light on the elementary processes mediating dilatational plasticity in glasses. We show that plastic instabilities, corresponding to singularities of the glass Hessian, generically feature both dilatational and shear irreversible strain components. The relative magnitude and statistics of the strain components depend both on the symmetry of the driving stress (e.g., shear vs.~hydrostatic tension) and on the cohesive (attractive) part of the interatomic interaction. We further show that the tensorial shear component of the plastic strain is generally non-planar and also extract the characteristic volume of plastic instabilities. Elucidating the fundamental properties of the elementary micro-mechanical building blocks of plasticity in glasses sets the stage for addressing larger-scale, collective phenomena in dilatational plasticity such as topological changes in the form of cavitation and ductile-to-brittle transitions. As a first step in this direction, we show that the elastic moduli markedly soften during dilatational plastic deformation approaching cavitation.</description>

      <title>Quantum entropy couples matter with geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08556v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a theory for coupling matter fields with discrete geometry on higher-order networks, i.e. cell complexes. The key idea of the approach is to associate to a higher-order network the quantum entropy of its metric. Specifically we propose an action having two contributions. The first contribution is proportional to the logarithm of the volume associated to the higher-order network by the metric. In the vacuum this contribution determines the entropy of the geometry. The second contribution is the quantum relative entropy between the metric of the higher-order network and the metric induced by the matter and gauge fields. The induced metric is defined in terms of the topological spinors and the discrete Dirac operators. The topological spinors, defined on nodes, edges and higher-dimensional cells, encode for the matter fields. The discrete Dirac operators act on topological spinors, and depend on the metric of the higher-order network as well as on the gauge fields via a discrete version of the minimal substitution. We derive the coupled dynamical equations for the metric, the matter and the gauge fields, providing an information theory principle to obtain the field theory equations in discrete curved space.</description>

      <title>The atomizing pulsed jet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01959v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Direct Numerical Simulations of the injection of a pulsed round liquid jet in a stagnant gas are performed. The Reynolds and Weber numbers and the density ratio are sufficiently large for reaching a complex high-speed atomization regime. The Weber number based on grid size is small, an indication that the simulations are very well resolved. Computations are performed using octree adaptive mesh refinement using the Basilisk free-code platform, down to a specified minimum grid size $\Delta$. Qualitative analysis of the flow and its topology reveal a complex structure of ligaments, sheets, droplets and bubbles that evolve and interact through impacts, ligament breakup, sheet rupture and engulfment of air bubbles in the liquid. A rich gallery of images of entangled structures is produced. Most processes occurring in this type of atomization are reproduced in detail, except at the instant of thin sheet perforation or breakup. We analyze drop statistics, showing that as the grid resolution is increased, the small-scale part of the distribution does not converge, and contains a large number of droplets close in order of magnitude to the minimum grid size with a significant peak at $d = 3\Delta$ . This non-convergence arises from the numerical sheet breakup effect, in which the interface becomes rough just before it breaks. The rough appearance of the interface is associated to a high-wavenumber oscillation of the curvature. To recover convergence, we apply the controlled "manifold death" numerical procedure, in which thin sheets are detected, and then pierced by fiat before they reach a set critical thickness $h_c$ that is always larger than $6 \Delta$. This allows convergence of the droplet frequency above a certain critical diameter $d_c$ above and close to $h_c$. A unimodal distribution is observed in the converged range.</description>

      <title>Fusion rule in conformal field theories and topological orders: A unified view of correspondence and (fractional) supersymmetry and their relation to topological holography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05178v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generalized symmetry, including non-invertible and categorical symmetry, plays a central role in contemporary studies on topological orders (TOs) and the corresponding conformal field theories (CFTs). The generators of such symmetries have a close connection to non-abelian anyonic objects in a bulk CFT or chiral CFT (CCFT), but it has been known that the construction of a CCFT contains theoretical difficulties in general. In this work, we revisit the structure of the fusion rule in $Z_{N}$ symmetric chiral and bulk conformal field theories and the corresponding TOs. We propose a nontrivial expression of subalgebra structure in the fusion rule of a bulk CFT. We name this subalgebra ``bulk semion" which corresponds to the fusion rule of the CCFTs and categorical symmetry of the TOs. This is a bulk-edge correspondence based on the symmetry analysis and can be interpreted as a version of topological holography in the recent literature. The topological holography has been expected to be applicable to the systems in general space-time dimensions. Moreover, we give a concise way of unifying duality (or fractional supersymmetry), generalized or categorical symmetry, and Lagrangian subalgebra. Our method is potentially useful to formulate and study general TOs, fundamentally only from the data of bulk CFTs or vice versa, and gives a clue in understanding CCFT (or ancillary CFT more generally).</description>

Abstract: The correlation dimension of natural language is measured by applying the Grassberger-Procaccia algorithm to high-dimensional sequences produced by a large-scale language model. This method, previously studied only in a Euclidean space, is reformulated in a statistical manifold via the Fisher-Rao distance. Language exhibits a multifractal, with global self-similarity and a universal dimension around 6.5, which is smaller than those of simple discrete random sequences and larger than that of a Barab\'asi-Albert process. Long memory is the key to producing self-similarity. Our method is applicable to any probabilistic model of real-world discrete sequences, and we show an application to music data.</description>
