      <title>Evaluating Anisotropy-based Monin-Obukhov Similarity Theory over Canopies and Complex Terrain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monin Obukhov Similarity Theory (MOST) has long served as the basis for parameterizations of turbulence exchange between the surface and the atmospheric boundary layer in models for weather and climate prediction. Decades of research, however, has illuminated some of the limitations of MOST based surface layer parameterizations, particularly when MOST's foundational assumptions of flat and horizontally homogeneous terrain are violated. Recent work has leveraged the anisotropy of turbulence as an additional non-dimensional term to extend and generalize MOST to complex terrain. In this work, we examine the performance of this generalized MOST for the scaling of velocity variances, refit these scalings, and study key characteristics of turbulence anisotropy across the 47 towers in the wide ranging National Ecological Observation Network (NEON). NEON in particular covers a diverse selection of ecosystems, from the arctic circle to tropical islands, and as such expands the previous generalized MOST to vegetated canopies and other environments not examined in previous studies. The work finds that anisotropy generalized MOST readily extends to these new environments, with robust performance over a wide range of canopy and terrain configurations. Results also further illuminate velocity variance scaling across degrees and forms (one-component and two-component) of anisotropy, relate the degree of anisotropy to key environmental characteristics, and evaluate scaling differences between canopies and non-vegetated surfaces. Overall, this study expands our understanding of the complexity of turbulence while paving the way for improved surface layer parameterizations.</description>

      <title>High-level, high-resolution ocean modeling at all scales with Oceananigans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe the vision, user interface, governing equations, and numerical methods that underpin new ocean modeling software called ``Oceananigans''. Oceananigans is being developed by the Climate Modeling Alliance as part of a larger project to build a trainable climate model with quantifiable uncertainty. We argue that Oceananigans status as a popular, capable modeling system realizes a vision for accelerating progress in Earth system modeling that balances demands for model accuracy and performance, needed for state-of-the-art science, against accessibility, which is needed to accelerate development. This vision combines three cooperative elements: (i) a relatively simple finite volume algorithm (ii) optimized for high-resolution simulations on GPUs which is (iii) exposed behind an expressive, high-level user interface (using the Julia programming language in our case). We offer evidence for the vision's potential by illustrating the creative potential of our user interface, showcasing Oceananigans physics with example simulations that range from simple classroom problems to a realistic global ocean simulation spanning all scales of oceanic fluid motion, and describing advances in parameterization, numerical methods, and computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Bolide infrasound signal morphology and yield estimates: A case study of two events detected by a dense acoustic sensor network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two bolides (2 June 2016 and 4 April 2019) were detected at multiple regional infrasound stations with many of the locations receiving multiple detections. Analysis of the received signals was used to estimate the yield, location and trajectory, and the type of shock that produced the received signal. The results from the infrasound analysis were compared with ground truth information that was collected through other sensing modalities. This multi-modal framework offers an expanded perspective on the processes governing bolide shock generation and propagation. The majority of signal features showed reasonable agreement between the infrasound-based interpretation and the other observational modalities, though the yield estimate from the 2019 bolide was significantly lower using the infrasound detections. There was also evidence suggesting that one of the detections was from a cylindrical shock that was initially propagating upward, which is unusual though not impossible.</description>

      <title>Near-inertial echoes of ageostrophic instability in submesoscale filaments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16059v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ocean submesoscales, flows with characteristic size around 10 m - 10 km, are transitional between the larger, rotationally-constrained mesoscale and three-dimensional turbulence. In this paper we present simulations of a submesoscale ocean filament. In our case, the filament is strongly sheared in both vertical and cross-filament directions and is unstable. Instability indeed dominates the early behaviour with a fast extraction of kinetic energy from the vertically sheared thermal wind. The filament is expected to be subject to instabilities, including symmetric and Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities. However, the instability that emerges does not exhibit characteristics that match either, and appears to be non-normal in nature. The action of the instability is sufficiently rapid - with energy extraction from the mean flow emerging and peaking within the first inertial period (~ 18 hr) - that the filament does not respond in a geostrophically balanced sense. Instead, it later exhibits vertically sheared near-inertial oscillations with higher amplitude as the initial minimum Richardson number decreases and at all initial noise levels. Horizontal gradients strengthen only briefly as the fronts restratify. These unstable filaments can be generated by strong mixing events at pre-existing stable structures; we also caution against inadvertently triggering this response in idealised studies that start in a very unstable state.</description>
