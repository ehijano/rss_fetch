      <title>MRP-LLM: Multitask Reflective Large Language Models for Privacy-Preserving Next POI Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising potential for next Point-of-Interest (POI) recommendation. However, existing methods only perform direct zero-shot prompting, leading to ineffective extraction of user preferences, insufficient injection of collaborative signals, and a lack of user privacy protection. As such, we propose a novel Multitask Reflective Large Language Model for Privacy-preserving Next POI Recommendation (MRP-LLM), aiming to exploit LLMs for better next POI recommendation while preserving user privacy. Specifically, the Multitask Reflective Preference Extraction Module first utilizes LLMs to distill each user's fine-grained (i.e., categorical, temporal, and spatial) preferences into a knowledge base (KB). The Neighbor Preference Retrieval Module retrieves and summarizes the preferences of similar users from the KB to obtain collaborative signals. Subsequently, aggregating the user's preferences with those of similar users, the Multitask Next POI Recommendation Module generates the next POI recommendations via multitask prompting. Meanwhile, during data collection, a Privacy Transmission Module is specifically devised to preserve sensitive POI data. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed MRP-LLM in providing more accurate next POI recommendations with user privacy preserved.</description>

      <title>RALI@TREC iKAT 2024: Achieving Personalization via Retrieval Fusion in Conversational Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Recherche Appliquee en Linguistique Informatique (RALI) team participated in the 2024 TREC Interactive Knowledge Assistance (iKAT) Track. In personalized conversational search, effectively capturing a user's complex search intent requires incorporating both contextual information and key elements from the user profile into query reformulation. The user profile often contains many relevant pieces, and each could potentially complement the user's information needs. It is difficult to disregard any of them, whereas introducing an excessive number of these pieces risks drifting from the original query and hinders search performance. This is a challenge we denote as over-personalization. To address this, we propose different strategies by fusing ranking lists generated from the queries with different levels of personalization.</description>

      <title>A Tutorial of Personalized Federated Recommender Systems: Recent Advances and Future Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Personalization stands as the cornerstone of recommender systems (RecSys), striving to sift out redundant information and offer tailor-made services for users. However, the conventional cloud-based RecSys necessitates centralized data collection, posing significant risks of user privacy breaches. In response to this challenge, federated recommender systems (FedRecSys) have emerged, garnering considerable attention. FedRecSys enable users to retain personal data locally and solely share model parameters with low privacy sensitivity for global model training, significantly bolstering the system's privacy protection capabilities. Within the distributed learning framework, the pronounced non-iid nature of user behavior data introduces fresh hurdles to federated optimization. Meanwhile, the ability of federated learning to concurrently learn multiple models presents an opportunity for personalized user modeling. Consequently, the development of personalized FedRecSys (PFedRecSys) is crucial and holds substantial significance. This tutorial seeks to provide an introduction to PFedRecSys, encompassing (1) an overview of existing studies on PFedRecSys, (2) a comprehensive taxonomy of PFedRecSys spanning four pivotal research directions-client-side adaptation, server-side aggregation, communication efficiency, privacy and protection, and (3) exploration of open challenges and promising future directions in PFedRecSys. This tutorial aims to establish a robust foundation and spark new perspectives for subsequent exploration and practical implementations in the evolving realm of RecSys.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Difference Learning for Sequential Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sequential recommendations have drawn significant attention in modeling the user's historical behaviors to predict the next item. With the booming development of multimodal data (e.g., image, text) on internet platforms, sequential recommendation also benefits from the incorporation of multimodal data. Most methods introduce modal features of items as side information and simply concatenates them to learn unified user interests. Nevertheless, these methods encounter the limitation in modeling multimodal differences. We argue that user interests and item relationships vary across different modalities. To address this problem, we propose a novel Multimodal Difference Learning framework for Sequential Recommendation, MDSRec for brevity. Specifically, we first explore the differences in item relationships by constructing modal-aware item relation graphs with behavior signal to enhance item representations. Then, to capture the differences in user interests across modalities, we design a interest-centralized attention mechanism to independently model user sequence representations in different modalities. Finally, we fuse the user embeddings from multiple modalities to achieve accurate item recommendation. Experimental results on five real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of MDSRec over state-of-the-art baselines and the efficacy of multimodal difference learning.</description>

      <title>Augmenting Sequential Recommendation with Balanced Relevance and Diversity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By generating new yet effective data, data augmentation has become a promising method to mitigate the data sparsity problem in sequential recommendation. Existing works focus on augmenting the original data but rarely explore the issue of imbalanced relevance and diversity for augmented data, leading to semantic drift problems or limited performance improvements. In this paper, we propose a novel Balanced data Augmentation Plugin for Sequential Recommendation (BASRec) to generate data that balance relevance and diversity. BASRec consists of two modules: Single-sequence Augmentation and Cross-sequence Augmentation. The former leverages the randomness of the heuristic operators to generate diverse sequences for a single user, after which the diverse and the original sequences are fused at the representation level to obtain relevance. Further, we devise a reweighting strategy to enable the model to learn the preferences based on the two properties adaptively. The Cross-sequence Augmentation performs nonlinear mixing between different sequence representations from two directions. It produces virtual sequence representations that are diverse enough but retain the vital semantics of the original sequences. These two modules enhance the model to discover fine-grained preferences knowledge from single-user and cross-user perspectives. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of BASRec. The average improvement is up to 72.0% on GRU4Rec, 33.8% on SASRec, and 68.5% on FMLP-Rec. We demonstrate that BASRec generates data with a better balance between relevance and diversity than existing methods.

      <title>AltFS: Agency-light Feature Selection with Large Language Models in Deep Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Feature selection is crucial in recommender systems for improving model efficiency and predictive performance. Traditional methods rely on agency models, such as decision trees or neural networks, to estimate feature importance. However, this approach is inherently limited, as the agency models may fail to learn effectively in all scenarios due to suboptimal training conditions (e.g., feature collinearity, high-dimensional sparsity, and data insufficiency). In this paper, we propose AltFS, an Agency-light Feature Selection method for deep recommender systems. AltFS integrates semantic reasoning from Large Language Models (LLMs) with task-specific learning from agency models. Initially, LLMs will generate a semantic ranking of feature importance, which is then refined by an agency model, combining world knowledge with task-specific insights. Extensive experiments on three public datasets from real-world recommender platforms demonstrate the effectiveness of AltFS. Our code is publicly available for reproducibility.</description>

      <title>Preference Discerning with LLM-Enhanced Generative Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sequential recommendation systems aim to provide personalized recommendations for users based on their interaction history. To achieve this, they often incorporate auxiliary information, such as textual descriptions of items and auxiliary tasks, like predicting user preferences and intent. Despite numerous efforts to enhance these models, they still suffer from limited personalization. To address this issue, we propose a new paradigm, which we term preference discerning. In preference dscerning, we explicitly condition a generative sequential recommendation system on user preferences within its context. To this end, we generate user preferences using Large Language Models (LLMs) based on user reviews and item-specific data. To evaluate preference discerning capabilities of sequential recommendation systems, we introduce a novel benchmark that provides a holistic evaluation across various scenarios, including preference steering and sentiment following. We assess current state-of-the-art methods using our benchmark and show that they struggle to accurately discern user preferences. Therefore, we propose a new method named Mender ($\textbf{M}$ultimodal Prefer$\textbf{en}$ce $\textbf{d}$iscern$\textbf{er}$), which improves upon existing methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance on our benchmark. Our results show that Mender can be effectively guided by human preferences even though they have not been observed during training, paving the way toward more personalized sequential recommendation systems. We will open-source the code and benchmarks upon publication.</description>

      <title>Cluster-Enhanced Federated Graph Neural Network for Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Personal interaction data can be effectively modeled as individual graphs for each user in recommender systems.Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)-based recommendation techniques have become extremely popular since they can capture high-order collaborative signals between users and items by aggregating the individual graph into a global interactive graph.However, this centralized approach inherently poses a threat to user privacy and security. Recently, federated GNN-based recommendation techniques have emerged as a promising solution to mitigate privacy concerns. Nevertheless, current implementations either limit on-device training to an unaccompanied individual graphs or necessitate reliance on an extra third-party server to touch other individual graphs, which also increases the risk of privacy leakage. To address this challenge, we propose a Cluster-enhanced Federated Graph Neural Network framework for Recommendation, named CFedGR, which introduces high-order collaborative signals to augment individual graphs in a privacy preserving manner. Specifically, the server clusters the pretrained user representations to identify high-order collaborative signals. In addition, two efficient strategies are devised to reduce communication between devices and the server. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of our proposed methods.</description>

      <title>Exploring Multidimensional Checkworthiness: Designing AI-assisted Claim Prioritization for Human Fact-checkers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08185v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given the massive volume of potentially false claims circulating online, claim prioritization is essential in allocating limited human resources available for fact-checking. In this study, we perceive claim prioritization as an information retrieval (IR) task: just as multidimensional IR relevance, with many factors influencing which search results a user deems relevant, checkworthiness is also multi-faceted, subjective, and even personal, with many factors influencing how fact-checkers triage and select which claims to check. Our study investigates both the multidimensional nature of checkworthiness and effective tool support to assist fact-checkers in claim prioritization. Methodologically, we pursue Research through Design combined with mixed-method evaluation. We develop an AI-assisted claim prioritization prototype as a probe to explore how fact-checkers use multidimensional checkworthiness factors in claim prioritization, simultaneously probing fact-checker needs while also exploring the design space to meet those needs.
  Our study with 16 professional fact-checkers investigates: 1) how participants assessed the relative importance of different checkworthy dimensions and apply different priorities in claim selection; 2) how they created customized GPT-based search filters and the corresponding benefits and limitations; and 3) their overall user experiences with our prototype. Our work makes a conceptual contribution between multidimensional IR relevance and fact-checking checkworthiness, with findings demonstrating the value of corresponding tooling support. Specifically, we uncovered a hierarchical prioritization strategy fact-checkers implicitly use, revealing an underexplored aspect of their workflow, with actionable design recommendations for improving claim triage across multi-dimensional checkworthiness and tailoring this process with LLM integration.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models for Scholarly Ontology Generation: An Extensive Analysis in the Engineering Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ontologies of research topics are crucial for structuring scientific knowledge, enabling scientists to navigate vast amounts of research, and forming the backbone of intelligent systems such as search engines and recommendation systems. However, manual creation of these ontologies is expensive, slow, and often results in outdated and overly general representations. As a solution, researchers have been investigating ways to automate or semi-automate the process of generating these ontologies. This paper offers a comprehensive analysis of the ability of large language models (LLMs) to identify semantic relationships between different research topics, which is a critical step in the development of such ontologies. To this end, we developed a gold standard based on the IEEE Thesaurus to evaluate the task of identifying four types of relationships between pairs of topics: broader, narrower, same-as, and other. Our study evaluates the performance of seventeen LLMs, which differ in scale, accessibility (open vs. proprietary), and model type (full vs. quantised), while also assessing four zero-shot reasoning strategies. Several models have achieved outstanding results, including Mixtral-8x7B, Dolphin-Mistral-7B, and Claude 3 Sonnet, with F1-scores of 0.847, 0.920, and 0.967, respectively. Furthermore, our findings demonstrate that smaller, quantised models, when optimised through prompt engineering, can deliver performance comparable to much larger proprietary models, while requiring significantly fewer computational resources.</description>

      <title>NyayaAnumana &amp; INLegalLlama: The Largest Indian Legal Judgment Prediction Dataset and Specialized Language Model for Enhanced Decision Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in legal judgment prediction (LJP) has the potential to transform the legal landscape, particularly in jurisdictions like India, where a significant backlog of cases burdens the legal system. This paper introduces NyayaAnumana, the largest and most diverse corpus of Indian legal cases compiled for LJP, encompassing a total of 7,02,945 preprocessed cases. NyayaAnumana, which combines the words "Nyay" (judgment) and "Anuman" (prediction or inference) respectively for most major Indian languages, includes a wide range of cases from the Supreme Court, High Courts, Tribunal Courts, District Courts, and Daily Orders and, thus, provides unparalleled diversity and coverage. Our dataset surpasses existing datasets like PredEx and ILDC, offering a comprehensive foundation for advanced AI research in the legal domain.
  In addition to the dataset, we present INLegalLlama, a domain-specific generative large language model (LLM) tailored to the intricacies of the Indian legal system. It is developed through a two-phase training approach over a base LLaMa model. First, Indian legal documents are injected using continual pretraining. Second, task-specific supervised finetuning is done. This method allows the model to achieve a deeper understanding of legal contexts.
  Our experiments demonstrate that incorporating diverse court data significantly boosts model accuracy, achieving approximately 90% F1-score in prediction tasks. INLegalLlama not only improves prediction accuracy but also offers comprehensible explanations, addressing the need for explainability in AI-assisted legal decisions.</description>

      <title>InvDiff: Invariant Guidance for Bias Mitigation in Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As one of the most successful generative models, diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable efficacy in synthesizing high-quality images. These models learn the underlying high-dimensional data distribution in an unsupervised manner. Despite their success, diffusion models are highly data-driven and prone to inheriting the imbalances and biases present in real-world data. Some studies have attempted to address these issues by designing text prompts for known biases or using bias labels to construct unbiased data. While these methods have shown improved results, real-world scenarios often contain various unknown biases, and obtaining bias labels is particularly challenging. In this paper, we emphasize the necessity of mitigating bias in pre-trained diffusion models without relying on auxiliary bias annotations. To tackle this problem, we propose a framework, InvDiff, which aims to learn invariant semantic information for diffusion guidance. Specifically, we propose identifying underlying biases in the training data and designing a novel debiasing training objective. Then, we employ a lightweight trainable module that automatically preserves invariant semantic information and uses it to guide the diffusion model's sampling process toward unbiased outcomes simultaneously. Notably, we only need to learn a small number of parameters in the lightweight learnable module without altering the pre-trained diffusion model. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical guarantee that the implementation of InvDiff is equivalent to reducing the error upper bound of generalization. Extensive experimental results on three publicly available benchmarks demonstrate that InvDiff effectively reduces biases while maintaining the quality of image generation. Our code is available at https://github.com/Hundredl/InvDiff.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Graph-RAG and Prompt Engineering to Enhance LLM-Based Automated Requirement Traceability and Compliance Checks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ensuring that Software Requirements Specifications (SRS) align with higher-level organizational or national requirements is vital, particularly in regulated environments such as finance and aerospace. In these domains, maintaining consistency, adhering to regulatory frameworks, minimizing errors, and meeting critical expectations are essential for the reliable functioning of systems. The widespread adoption of large language models (LLMs) highlights their immense potential, yet there remains considerable scope for improvement in retrieving relevant information and enhancing reasoning capabilities. This study demonstrates that integrating a robust Graph-RAG framework with advanced prompt engineering techniques, such as Chain of Thought and Tree of Thought, can significantly enhance performance. Compared to baseline RAG methods and simple prompting strategies, this approach delivers more accurate and context-aware results. While this method demonstrates significant improvements in performance, it comes with challenges. It is both costly and more complex to implement across diverse contexts, requiring careful adaptation to specific scenarios. Additionally, its effectiveness heavily relies on having complete and accurate input data, which may not always be readily available, posing further limitations to its scalability and practicality.</description>

Abstract: Recommender systems have seen significant advancements with the influence of deep learning and graph neural networks, particularly in capturing complex user-item relationships. However, these graph-based recommenders heavily depend on ID-based data, potentially disregarding valuable textual information associated with users and items, resulting in less informative learned representations. Moreover, the utilization of implicit feedback data introduces potential noise and bias, posing challenges for the effectiveness of user preference learning. While the integration of large language models (LLMs) into traditional ID-based recommenders has gained attention, challenges such as scalability issues, limitations in text-only reliance, and prompt input constraints need to be addressed for effective implementation in practical recommender systems. To address these challenges, we propose a model-agnostic framework RLMRec that aims to enhance existing recommenders with LLM-empowered representation learning. It proposes a recommendation paradigm that integrates representation learning with LLMs to capture intricate semantic aspects of user behaviors and preferences. RLMRec incorporates auxiliary textual signals, develops a user/item profiling paradigm empowered by LLMs, and aligns the semantic space of LLMs with the representation space of collaborative relational signals through a cross-view alignment framework. This work further establish a theoretical foundation demonstrating that incorporating textual signals through mutual information maximization enhances the quality of representations. In our evaluation, we integrate RLMRec with state-of-the-art recommender models, while also analyzing its efficiency and robustness to noise data.

      <title>MARec: Metadata Alignment for cold-start Recommendation</title>

Abstract: For many recommender systems, the primary data source is a historical record of user clicks. The associated click matrix is often very sparse, as the number of users x products can be far larger than the number of clicks. Such sparsity is accentuated in cold-start settings, which makes the efficient use of metadata information of paramount importance. In this work, we propose a simple approach to address cold-start recommendations by leveraging content metadata, Metadata Alignment for cold-start Recommendation. We show that this approach can readily augment existing matrix factorization and autoencoder approaches, enabling a smooth transition to top performing algorithms in warmer set-ups. Our experimental results indicate three separate contributions: first, we show that our proposed framework largely beats SOTA results on 4 cold-start datasets with different sparsity and scale characteristics, with gains ranging from +8.4% to +53.8% on reported ranking metrics; second, we provide an ablation study on the utility of semantic features, and proves the additional gain obtained by leveraging such features ranges between +46.8% and +105.5%; and third, our approach is by construction highly competitive in warm set-ups, and we propose a closed-form solution outperformed by SOTA results by only 0.8% on average.</description>

      <title>CURE: A dataset for Clinical Understanding &amp; Retrieval Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06954</link>

Abstract: Given the dominance of dense retrievers that do not generalize well beyond their training dataset distributions, domain-specific test sets are essential in evaluating retrieval. There are few test datasets for retrieval systems intended for use by healthcare providers in a point-of-care setting. To fill this gap we have collaborated with medical professionals to create CURE, an ad-hoc retrieval test dataset for passage ranking with 2000 queries spanning 10 medical domains with a monolingual (English) and two cross-lingual (French/Spanish -&gt; English) conditions. In this paper, we describe how CURE was constructed and provide baseline results to showcase its effectiveness as an evaluation tool.

      <title>Spatial-Temporal Federated Learning for Lifelong Person Re-identification on Distributed Edges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.11759</link>

Abstract: Data drift is a thorny challenge when deploying person re-identification (ReID) models into real-world devices, where the data distribution is significantly different from that of the training environment and keeps changing. To tackle this issue, we propose a federated spatial-temporal incremental learning approach, named FedSTIL, which leverages both lifelong learning and federated learning to continuously optimize models deployed on many distributed edge clients. Unlike previous efforts, FedSTIL aims to mine spatial-temporal correlations among the knowledge learnt from different edge clients. Specifically, the edge clients first periodically extract general representations of drifted data to optimize their local models. Then, the learnt knowledge from edge clients will be aggregated by centralized parameter server, where the knowledge will be selectively and attentively distilled from spatial- and temporal-dimension with carefully designed mechanisms. Finally, the distilled informative spatial-temporal knowledge will be sent back to correlated edge clients to further improve the recognition accuracy of each edge client with a lifelong learning method. Extensive experiments on a mixture of five real-world datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms others by nearly 4% in Rank-1 accuracy, while reducing communication cost by 62%.
