      <title>An "Opinion Reproduction Number" for Infodemics in a Bounded-Confidence Content-Spreading Process on Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the spreading dynamics of content on networks. To do this, we use a model in which content spreads through a bounded-confidence mechanism. In a bounded-confidence model (BCM) of opinion dynamics, the agents of a network have continuous-valued opinions, which they adjust when they interact with agents whose opinions are sufficiently close to theirs. The employed content-spread model introduces a twist into BCMs by using bounded confidence for the content spread itself. To study the spread of content, we define an analogue of the basic reproduction number from disease dynamics that we call an \emph{opinion reproduction number}. A critical value of the opinion reproduction number indicates whether or not there is an ``infodemic'' (i.e., a large content-spreading cascade) of content that reflects a particular opinion. By determining this critical value, one can determine whether or not an opinion will die off or propagate widely as a cascade in a population of agents. Using configuration-model networks, we quantify the size and shape of content dissemination using a variety of summary statistics, and we illustrate how network structure and spreading model parameters affect these statistics. We find that content spreads most widely when the agents have large expected mean degree or large receptiveness to content. When the amount of content spread only slightly exceeds the critical opinion reproduction number (i.e., the infodemic threshold), there can be longer dissemination trees than when the expected mean degree or receptiveness is larger, even though the total number of content shares is smaller.</description>

      <title>A Generalized Theory of Interactions -- I. The General Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding realistic complex systems requires confronting significant conceptual, theoretical and experimental limitations rooted in the persistence of views that originated in the mechanics of simple moving bodies. We define the category of complex multiscale stochastic systems as a useful device for capturing the minimally required complexity of many types of phenomena. In doing so, we provide evidence indicating that determinism, continuity and reversibility can lead to theoretical inadequacies that manifest as intractability, inaccuracies or non-representativeness when applied to complex systems. We take the view that interactions are fundamental and summarize their portrayal across many disciplines. Despite their centrality, interactions remain largely neglected as subjects of research interest of their own. We hypothesize that a generalized theory of interactions may help organize evidence from multiple scientific domains towards a more unified realistic view of systems.</description>

      <title>A Generalised Theory of Interactions -- II. The Theoretical Construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: After discussing the significance of interactions to understand complex multiscale stochastic systems (CMSS), we turn our attention to the construction of a Generalised Theory of Interactions (GToI). We define interactions as discrete, localised events where the thermodynamically irreversible exchange of degrees of freedom involves signal propagation and relaxation phenomena. We proceed to define the mechanics of such space, as well as how these approximately map onto dynamical manifolds. By characterising various systems through the effect of transformations across interaction space, we develop a view of systems where features such as emergence and information representation become apparent. Our theory appears to capture structural and dynamical features of CMSS efficiently by making explicit the extent of the dynamical range of action in them; we identify the boundaries of such range with statistical limits corresponding to physical laws, and derive a generalised form of the Correspondence Principle.</description>

      <title>On the use of associative memory in Hopfield networks designed to solve propositional satisfiability problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.16807v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hopfield networks are an attractive choice for solving many types of computational problems because they provide a biologically plausible mechanism. The Self-Optimization (SO) model adds to the Hopfield network by using a biologically founded Hebbian learning rule, in combination with repeated network resets to arbitrary initial states, for optimizing its own behavior towards some desirable goal state encoded in the network. In order to better understand that process, we demonstrate first that the SO model can solve concrete combinatorial problems in SAT form, using two examples of the Liars problem and the map coloring problem. In addition, we show how under some conditions critical information might get lost forever with the learned network producing seemingly optimal solutions that are in fact inappropriate for the problem it was tasked to solve. What appears to be an undesirable side-effect of the SO model, can provide insight into its process for solving intractable problems.</description>

      <title>Moments of undersampled distributions: Application to the size of epidemics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16652v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The total number of fatalities of an epidemic outbreak is a dramatic but extremely informative quantity. Knowledge of the statistics of this quantity allows the calculation of the mean total number of fatalities conditioned to the fact that the outbreak has surpassed a given number of fatalities, which is very relevant for risk assessment. However, the fact that the total number of fatalities seems to be characterized by a power-law tailed distribution with exponent (of the survival function) smaller than one poses an important theoretical difficulty, due to the non-existence of a mean value for such distributions. Cirillo and Taleb [Nature Phys. 16, 606 (2020)] propose a transformation from a so-called dual variable, which displays a power-law tail, to the total number of fatalities, which becomes bounded by the total world population. Here, we (i) show that such a transformation is ad hoc and unphysical; (ii) propose alternative transformations and distributions (also ad hoc); (iii) argue that the right framework for this problem is statistical physics, through finite-size scaling; and (iv) demonstrate that the real problem is not the non-existence of the mean value for power-law tailed distributions but the fact that the tail of the different theoretical distributions (which is what distinguishes one model from the other) is far from being well sampled with the available number of empirical data. Our results are also valid for many other hazards displaying (apparent) power-law tails in their size.</description>
