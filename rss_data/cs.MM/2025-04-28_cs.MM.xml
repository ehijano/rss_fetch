      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal music emotion recognition (MMER) is an emerging discipline in music information retrieval that has experienced a surge in interest in recent years. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of the current state-of-the-art in MMER. Discussing the different approaches and techniques used in this field, the paper introduces a four-stage MMER framework, including multimodal data selection, feature extraction, feature processing, and final emotion prediction. The survey further reveals significant advancements in deep learning methods and the increasing importance of feature fusion techniques. Despite these advancements, challenges such as the need for large annotated datasets, datasets with more modalities, and real-time processing capabilities remain. This paper also contributes to the field by identifying critical gaps in current research and suggesting potential directions for future research. The gaps underscore the importance of developing robust, scalable, a interpretable models for MMER, with implications for applications in music recommendation systems, therapeutic tools, and entertainment.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Modality Bias in Multi-modal Entity Alignment from a Causal Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-Modal Entity Alignment (MMEA) aims to retrieve equivalent entities from different Multi-Modal Knowledge Graphs (MMKGs), a critical information retrieval task. Existing studies have explored various fusion paradigms and consistency constraints to improve the alignment of equivalent entities, while overlooking that the visual modality may not always contribute positively. Empirically, entities with low-similarity images usually generate unsatisfactory performance, highlighting the limitation of overly relying on visual features. We believe the model can be biased toward the visual modality, leading to a shortcut image-matching task. To address this, we propose a counterfactual debiasing framework for MMEA, termed CDMEA, which investigates visual modality bias from a causal perspective. Our approach aims to leverage both visual and graph modalities to enhance MMEA while suppressing the direct causal effect of the visual modality on model predictions. By estimating the Total Effect (TE) of both modalities and excluding the Natural Direct Effect (NDE) of the visual modality, we ensure that the model predicts based on the Total Indirect Effect (TIE), effectively utilizing both modalities and reducing visual modality bias. Extensive experiments on 9 benchmark datasets show that CDMEA outperforms 14 state-of-the-art methods, especially in low-similarity, high-noise, and low-resource data scenarios.</description>

      <title>WILD: a new in-the-Wild Image Linkage Dataset for synthetic image attribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synthetic image source attribution is an open challenge, with an increasing number of image generators being released yearly. The complexity and the sheer number of available generative techniques, as well as the scarcity of high-quality open source datasets of diverse nature for this task, make training and benchmarking synthetic image source attribution models very challenging. WILD is a new in-the-Wild Image Linkage Dataset designed to provide a powerful training and benchmarking tool for synthetic image attribution models. The dataset is built out of a closed set of 10 popular commercial generators, which constitutes the training base of attribution models, and an open set of 10 additional generators, simulating a real-world in-the-wild scenario. Each generator is represented by 1,000 images, for a total of 10,000 images in the closed set and 10,000 images in the open set. Half of the images are post-processed with a wide range of operators. WILD allows benchmarking attribution models in a wide range of tasks, including closed and open set identification and verification, and robust attribution with respect to post-processing and adversarial attacks. Models trained on WILD are expected to benefit from the challenging scenario represented by the dataset itself. Moreover, an assessment of seven baseline methodologies on closed and open set attribution is presented, including robustness tests with respect to post-processing.</description>

      <title>CAMeL: Cross-modality Adaptive Meta-Learning for Text-based Person Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Text-based person retrieval aims to identify specific individuals within an image database using textual descriptions. Due to the high cost of annotation and privacy protection, researchers resort to synthesized data for the paradigm of pretraining and fine-tuning. However, these generated data often exhibit domain biases in both images and textual annotations, which largely compromise the scalability of the pre-trained model. Therefore, we introduce a domain-agnostic pretraining framework based on Cross-modality Adaptive Meta-Learning (CAMeL) to enhance the model generalization capability during pretraining to facilitate the subsequent downstream tasks. In particular, we develop a series of tasks that reflect the diversity and complexity of real-world scenarios, and introduce a dynamic error sample memory unit to memorize the history for errors encountered within multiple tasks. To further ensure multi-task adaptation, we also adopt an adaptive dual-speed update strategy, balancing fast adaptation to new tasks and slow weight updates for historical tasks. Albeit simple, our proposed model not only surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods on real-world benchmarks, including CUHK-PEDES, ICFG-PEDES, and RSTPReid, but also showcases robustness and scalability in handling biased synthetic images and noisy text annotations. Our code is available at https://github.com/Jahawn-Wen/CAMeL-reID.</description>

      <title>Generative AI for Character Animation: A Comprehensive Survey of Techniques, Applications, and Future Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative AI is reshaping art, gaming, and most notably animation. Recent breakthroughs in foundation and diffusion models have reduced the time and cost of producing animated content. Characters are central animation components, involving motion, emotions, gestures, and facial expressions. The pace and breadth of advances in recent months make it difficult to maintain a coherent view of the field, motivating the need for an integrative review. Unlike earlier overviews that treat avatars, gestures, or facial animation in isolation, this survey offers a single, comprehensive perspective on all the main generative AI applications for character animation. We begin by examining the state-of-the-art in facial animation, expression rendering, image synthesis, avatar creation, gesture modeling, motion synthesis, object generation, and texture synthesis. We highlight leading research, practical deployments, commonly used datasets, and emerging trends for each area. To support newcomers, we also provide a comprehensive background section that introduces foundational models and evaluation metrics, equipping readers with the knowledge needed to enter the field. We discuss open challenges and map future research directions, providing a roadmap to advance AI-driven character-animation technologies. This survey is intended as a resource for researchers and developers entering the field of generative AI animation or adjacent fields. Resources are available at: https://github.com/llm-lab-org/Generative-AI-for-Character-Animation-Survey.</description>

      <title>DeepSPG: Exploring Deep Semantic Prior Guidance for Low-light Image Enhancement with Multimodal Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There has long been a belief that high-level semantics learning can benefit various downstream computer vision tasks. However, in the low-light image enhancement (LLIE) community, existing methods learn a brutal mapping between low-light and normal-light domains without considering the semantic information of different regions, especially in those extremely dark regions that suffer from severe information loss. To address this issue, we propose a new deep semantic prior-guided framework (DeepSPG) based on Retinex image decomposition for LLIE to explore informative semantic knowledge via a pre-trained semantic segmentation model and multimodal learning. Notably, we incorporate both image-level semantic prior and text-level semantic prior and thus formulate a multimodal learning framework with combinatorial deep semantic prior guidance for LLIE. Specifically, we incorporate semantic knowledge to guide the enhancement process via three designs: an image-level semantic prior guidance by leveraging hierarchical semantic features from a pre-trained semantic segmentation model; a text-level semantic prior guidance by integrating natural language semantic constraints via a pre-trained vision-language model; a multi-scale semantic-aware structure that facilitates effective semantic feature incorporation. Eventually, our proposed DeepSPG demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods across five benchmark datasets. The implementation details and code are publicly available at https://github.com/Wenyuzhy/DeepSPG.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Shallow Watermarking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in digital watermarking make use of deep neural networks for message embedding and extraction. They typically follow the ``encoder-noise layer-decoder''-based architecture. By deliberately establishing a differentiable noise layer to simulate the distortion of the watermarked signal, they jointly train the deep encoder and decoder to fit the noise layer to guarantee robustness. As a result, they are usually weak against unknown distortions that are not used in their training pipeline. In this paper, we propose a novel watermarking framework to resist unknown distortions, namely Adversarial Shallow Watermarking (ASW). ASW utilizes only a shallow decoder that is randomly parameterized and designed to be insensitive to distortions for watermarking extraction. During the watermark embedding, ASW freezes the shallow decoder and adversarially optimizes a host image until its updated version (i.e., the watermarked image) stably triggers the shallow decoder to output the watermark message. During the watermark extraction, it accurately recovers the message from the watermarked image by leveraging the insensitive nature of the shallow decoder against arbitrary distortions. Our ASW is training-free, encoder-free, and noise layer-free. Experiments indicate that the watermarked images created by ASW have strong robustness against various unknown distortions. Compared to the existing ``encoder-noise layer-decoder'' approaches, ASW achieves comparable results on known distortions and better robustness on unknown distortions.</description>

      <title>Memento: Augmenting Personalized Memory via Practical Multimodal Wearable Sensing in Visual Search and Wayfinding Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Working memory involves the temporary retention of information over short periods. It is a critical cognitive function that enables humans to perform various online processing tasks, such as dialing a phone number, recalling misplaced items' locations, or navigating through a store. However, inherent limitations in an individual's capacity to retain information often result in forgetting important details during such tasks. Although previous research has successfully utilized wearable and assistive technologies to enhance long-term memory functions (e.g., episodic memory), their application to supporting short-term recall in daily activities remains underexplored. To address this gap, we present Memento, a framework that uses multimodal wearable sensor data to detect significant changes in cognitive state and provide intelligent in situ cues to enhance recall. Through two user studies involving 15 and 25 participants in visual search navigation tasks, we demonstrate that participants receiving visual cues from Memento achieved significantly better route recall, improving approximately 20-23% compared to free recall. Furthermore, Memento reduced cognitive load and review time by 46% while also substantially reducing computation time (3.86 seconds vs. 15.35 seconds), offering an average of 75% effectiveness compared to computer vision-based cue selection approaches.</description>

      <title>Applying LLM-Powered Virtual Humans to Child Interviews in Child-Centered Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In child-centered design, directly engaging children is crucial for deeply understanding their experiences. However, current research often prioritizes adult perspectives, as interviewing children involves unique challenges such as environmental sensitivities and the need for trust-building. AI-powered virtual humans (VHs) offer a promising approach to facilitate engaging and multimodal interactions with children. This study establishes key design guidelines for LLM-powered virtual humans tailored to child interviews, standardizing multimodal elements including color schemes, voice characteristics, facial features, expressions, head movements, and gestures. Using ChatGPT-based prompt engineering, we developed three distinct Human-AI workflows (LLM-Auto, LLM-Interview, and LLM-Analyze) and conducted a user study involving 15 children aged 6 to 12. The results indicated that the LLM-Analyze workflow outperformed the others by eliciting longer responses, achieving higher user experience ratings, and promoting more effective child engagement.</description>

      <title>FineVQ: Fine-Grained User Generated Content Video Quality Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19238v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid growth of user-generated content (UGC) videos has produced an urgent need for effective video quality assessment (VQA) algorithms to monitor video quality and guide optimization and recommendation procedures. However, current VQA models generally only give an overall rating for a UGC video, which lacks fine-grained labels for serving video processing and recommendation applications. To address the challenges and promote the development of UGC videos, we establish the first large-scale Fine-grained Video quality assessment Database, termed FineVD, which comprises 6104 UGC videos with fine-grained quality scores and descriptions across multiple dimensions. Based on this database, we propose a Fine-grained Video Quality assessment (FineVQ) model to learn the fine-grained quality of UGC videos, with the capabilities of quality rating, quality scoring, and quality attribution. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed FineVQ can produce fine-grained video-quality results and achieve state-of-the-art performance on FineVD and other commonly used UGC-VQA datasets.</description>
