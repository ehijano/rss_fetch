      <title>Role of inclusiveness of learning environment in predicting students' outcomes in courses in which women are not underrepresented</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Student beliefs in introductory physics courses can influence their course outcomes and retention in STEM disciplines and future career aspirations. This study used survey data from 501 students in the first of two-semester algebra-based introductory physics courses primarily taken by bioscience majors, in which women make up approximately 65% of the class. We investigated how the learning environment including perceived recognition, peer interaction, and sense of belonging correlate with students' physics outcomes, including their physics self-efficacy, interest, and identity. We found that in general, women had lower physics beliefs than men and the learning environment plays a major role in explaining student outcomes. We also found that perceived recognition played an important role in predicting students' physics identity and students' sense of belonging played an important role in predicting students' physics self-efficacy in the first algebra-based introductory physics course investigated. These findings can be useful to contemplate strategies to create an equitable and inclusive learning environment to help all students to excel in these physics courses.</description>

      <title>How to make your research group more inclusive for autistic trainees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a university professor, one of my most important responsibilities is mentoring the junior members of my research group and creating an inclusive environment in which they can thrive. Since my autism diagnosis two years ago, colleagues have asked me how they can make their research groups more welcoming to autistic trainees. This short guide, based on conversations with autistic students and academics, intense reflection on my own lived experience, and a deep dive into the literature, provides five concrete steps toward this goal.</description>

      <title>The Conservation of Mechanical Energy simulator -- SimuF\'isica</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Currently, the benefits of using computer simulations in the school environment are widely recognized by educators. The encouragement to use these simulations in classrooms is supported by the National Common Curricular Base, a normative document that defines essential learning for basic education. This article focuses on the exploration of the Mechanical Energy Conservation simulator, a free simulator developed with the purpose of illustrating the transformations between kinetic, gravitational potential, and elastic potential energies. This application is part of SimuF\'isica\textsuperscript{\textregistered}, a multilingual and multiplatform software that offers computer simulations for teaching physics, which operates both online and offline. Throughout the article, some features of the SimuF\'isic\textsuperscript{\textregistered} platform and the details of how the Mechanical Energy Conservation simulator works are objectively presented. Two illustrative examples are provided, demonstrating the application in action for solving mechanics problems.</description>

      <title>Opinion dynamics model of collaborative learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a simple model to explore an educational phenomenon where the correct answer emerges from group discussion. We construct our model based on several plausible assumptions: (i) We tend to follow peers' opinions. However, if a peer's opinion is too different from yours, you are not much influenced. In other words, your opinion tends to align with peers' opinions, weighted by the similarity to yours. (ii) Discussion among group members helps the opinion to shift toward the correct answer even when the group members do not know it clearly. However, if everyone tells exactly the same, you often get lost and it becomes more difficult to find the correct answer. In other words, you can find the correct answer when everyone has largely different voices. (iii) We are sometimes stuck to our past. If you keep one opinion for a long time, such a memory works like an inertia in classical mechanics. We use our model to perform numerical investigations and find that the performance of a group is enhanced when initial opinions are diverse, that a lower memory capacity makes consensus occur faster, and that a small group size, typically three or four, is beneficial for better group performance.</description>

      <title>Evaluating vision-capable chatbots in interpreting kinematics graphs: a comparative study of free and subscription-based models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14685v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the performance of eight large multimodal model (LMM)-based chatbots on the Test of Understanding Graphs in Kinematics (TUG-K), a research-based concept inventory. Graphs are a widely used representation in STEM and medical fields, making them a relevant topic for exploring LMM-based chatbots' visual interpretation abilities. We evaluated both freely available chatbots (Gemini 1.0 Pro, Claude 3 Sonnet, Microsoft Copilot, and ChatGPT-4o) and subscription-based ones (Gemini 1.0 Ultra, Gemini 1.5 Pro API, Claude 3 Opus, and ChatGPT-4). We found that OpenAI's chatbots outperform all the others, with ChatGPT-4o showing the overall best performance. Contrary to expectations, we found no notable differences in the overall performance between freely available and subscription-based versions of Gemini and Claude 3 chatbots, with the exception of Gemini 1.5 Pro, available via API. In addition, we found that tasks relying more heavily on linguistic input were generally easier for chatbots than those requiring visual interpretation. The study provides a basis for considerations of LMM-based chatbot applications in STEM and medical education, and suggests directions for future research.</description>
