      <title>Rethinking cryptophane A for methane gas sensing: cross sensitivity to N2 and CO2 at ambient conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the affinity of Cryptophane-A for methane was first reported in 1993, cryptophane-doped polymer films have been extensively studied as enrichment cladding layers in plasmonic, fiber-optic, and integrated waveguide-based optical sensors. While the use of cryptophane-doped layers has improved methane sensitivity compared to undoped claddings, controversy has grown over the years regarding their claimed selectivity and practical applicability. Key questions remain unresolved, including the extent of true methane enrichment at room temperature, cross-sensitivity to other gases, and the proportion of active cryptophane molecules within the polymer matrix. In this work, we employ Raman spectroscopy to provide direct and unambiguous evidence that Cryptophane-A exhibits measurable affinity for major ambient gases other than methane at room temperature. Notably, both nitrogen and carbon dioxide are shown to enter the cryptophane cavity and compete with methane for binding sites. This study underscores the value of Raman spectroscopy as a benchmark technique for investigating gas capture within host molecules at ambient conditions. It offers deeper insight into the binding behavior of Cryptophane-A and enables quantification of its relative affinities to atmospheric gases, thereby revealing both the limitations and the potential of cryptophane for future sensing applications.</description>

      <title>Space-filling efficiency and optical properties of hemoglycin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The empty, extensive low-density lattice topology of hemoglycin is examined to understand how in space, and possibly as early as 800M years into cosmic time a rod-like polymer of glycine and iron came into dominance. A central question to be answered is whether the hemoglycin rod lattice with diamond 2H symmetry represents the most efficient covering of space by a regular arrangement of identical rods. Starting from the tetrahedral symmetry of every hemoglycin lattice vertex we find that the regular truncated tetrahedron of Archimedes may be expanded until neighboring hexagon faces are coincident, at which point space filling is 23/24 or 95.8333% complete. We describe the unit cells of the diamond 2H rod lattice and its conforming near-complete space-filling structure, which has identical symmetry. Maximum space filling via a minimum of molecular material can allow hemoglycin to drive accretion in molecular clouds, contributing to the composition of dust, and providing a background for its widespread presence in meteoritic samples and in cometary material that falls to Earth. The optical properties of hemoglycin lattice entities are derived from quantum calculations of ultraviolet and visible transition energies and strengths. The hemoglycin extinction curve duplicates the nominal 218nm ultraviolet absorption feature known as the UV bump, together with two visible absorption features present in a generic compilation of astronomical extinction data.</description>

      <title>Unifying Chemical and Electrochemical Thermodynamics of Electrodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Batteries are critical for electrified transportation and aviation, yet thermodynamic understanding of electrode materials remains lacking, as indicated by the often-seen violation of the second law of thermodynamics of open-circuit voltage (OCV) models. On the other hand, thermodynamic modeling rarely utilizes electrochemical data such as OCV, entropic heat (dOCV/dT), which contains rich thermodynamic information. This work introduces a framework of thermodynamic modeling of materials for electrochemical energy storage, using differentiable programming and gradient-based optimization of thermodynamic parameters. Using a modified Debye model that accounts for the phonon density of states, the thermodynamics of pure substances is modeled from experimental measurements of specific heat ($c_p$) as well as the phonon density of states $g(\omega)$. Thermodynamics of mixing is modeled with measured entropic heat and OCV data. We demonstrate the differentiable thermodynamic modeling framework with forward and inverse problems. In the forward problem, i.e. determining phase diagram of graphite anode given thermochemical and electrochemical data, we show that in addition to accurate reproduction of phase diagram of LixC6, the fitted temperature-dependent OCV of graphite reaches 3.8 mV mean absolute error (MAE) for test set data measured at 10$^\circ$C, compared with 2.9-3.6 mV MAE for training set data measured at 25$^\circ$C - 57$^\circ$C. In the inverse problem, i.e. determining OCV of lithium iron phosphate (LFP) cathode from phase diagram constrained by thermochemical and electrochemical data, we demonstrate accurate reproduction of LFP OCV as well as phase diagram. This framework offers a unified treatment of chemical and electrochemical thermodynamic data for electrode materials.</description>

      <title>BioScore: A Foundational Scoring Function For Diverse Biomolecular Complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structural assessment of biomolecular complexes is vital for translating molecular models into functional insights, shaping our understanding of biology and aiding drug discovery. However, current structure-based scoring functions often lack generalizability across diverse biomolecular systems. We present BioScore, a foundational scoring function that addresses key challenges -- data sparsity, cross-system representation, and task compatibility -- through a dual-scale geometric graph learning framework with tailored modules for structure assessment and affinity prediction. BioScore supports a wide range of tasks, including affinity prediction, conformation ranking, and structure-based virtual screening. Evaluated on 16 benchmarks spanning proteins, nucleic acids, small molecules, and carbohydrates, BioScore consistently outperforms or matches 70 traditional and deep learning methods. Our newly proposed PPI Benchmark further enables comprehensive evaluation of protein-protein complex scoring. BioScore demonstrates broad applicability: (1) pretraining on mixed-structure data boosts protein-protein affinity prediction by up to 40% and antigen-antibody binding correlation by over 90%; (2) cross-system generalizability enables zero- and few-shot prediction with up to 71% correlation gain; and (3) its unified representation captures chemically challenging systems such as cyclic peptides, improving affinity prediction by over 60%. BioScore establishes a robust and generalizable framework for structural assessment across complex biomolecular landscapes.</description>

      <title>Disordered Photosynthetic Aggregates Can Host Functional Vibronic Couplings At Room Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photosynthesis relies on a network of chlorophyll-like molecules which together lead to efficient long-range energy funneling. Evidence at cryogenic temperatures suggests that mechanistic details of energy/charge transfer must invoke delocalized vibronic states. Whether these survive at physiological temperature in large photosynthetic aggregates is an open question. Parallel research on artificial templates has relied on cyanines which are unlike chlorophylls. We report two-dimensional electronic spectra of porphyrin nanotubes where we selectively probe mixed Qx-Qy states through polarization control. Early time cross-peaks, their rapid broadening and survival of anisotropic Qx-Qy quantum beats conclusively demonstrate that overlapping vibrational-electronic bands of photosynthetic aggregates indeed host functional vibronic couplings at room temperature. Calculations reveal that disorder is the vital ingredient that dramatically enhances Qx-Qy vibronic mixing across the entire Q band. The parameter regime where energetic disorder is of the order of dense Raman-active vibrations with weak reorganization energies may be the key design principle.</description>

      <title>Improved boundary homogenization for a sphere with an absorbing cap of arbitrary size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finding accurate approximations for the effective reactivity of a structured spherical target with a circular absorbing patch of arbitrary size is a long-standing problem in chemical physics. In this Communication, we reveal limitations of the empirical approximation proposed in [J. Chem. Phys. 145, 214101 (2016)]. We show that the original approximation fails at large patch surface fractions $\sigma$ and propose a simple amendment. The improved approximation is validated against a semi-analytical solution and is shown to be accurate over the entire range of $\sigma$ from $0$ to $1$. This approximation also determines the probability of reaction on the patch and the capacitance of such a structured target.</description>

      <title>Photoemission Chronoscopy of the Iodoalkanes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time delays in photoemission are on the order of attoseconds and have been experimentally determined in atoms, molecules and solids. Their magnitude and energy dependence are expected to yield fundamental insights into the properties of the systems in which they're measured. In a recent study Biswas \textsl{et al.} (Biswas, S., F\"org, B., Ortmann, L. et al. Probing molecular environment through photoemission delays. Nat. Phys. 16, 778-783 (2020)) determined the absolute photoemission time of the I$4d$ level in iodoethane via attosecond streaking spectroscopy, finding the presence of a functional group to increase the photoemission time delay, suggesting a correlation between the size of the functional group and time delay based on a semi-classical calculation. Here we experimentally study the dependence of the I$4d$ photoemission time on the functional group in the iodoalkanes from iodomethane up to 2-iodobutane at three photon energies across the giant resonance in the I$4d\to\varepsilon f$ photoemission channel, finding that the presence alone of a functional group does not necessarily increase the photoemission delay, and that overall no clear correlation between its size and the photoemission time delay can be established.</description>

      <title>Diverse polymorphism in Ruddlesden-Popper chalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11300v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) chalcogenides are stable, non-toxic candidates for optoelectronic or thermoelectric applications. The structural diversity of RP oxides is already exploited to tune properties or achieve more advanced functionalities like multiferroicity, however, little is known about the structural evolution of RP chalcogenides. In this work, we develop a high-accuracy machine-learned interatomic potential to run large-scale molecular dynamics simulations on $Ba_{n+1}Zr_nS_{3n+1}$ for $n=1$ to $n=6$. We predict new polymorphs for each $n$-value, calculate their corresponding phase transition temperatures, and validate our approach through comparison to published experimental results. We find that the $n=1$ phase exhibits negative thermal expansion, that $n=1$ and $n=3$ undergo unusual ascending symmetry breaking, and that phases with $n\geq4$ form layer-dependent tilt patterns previously unreported for inorganic RP materials. This unique behaviour results from competition between octahedral rotations and rumpling at the rocksalt interface, and suggests new strategies for accessing advanced functionalities.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Zn incorporation in CuInS$_2$ quantum dots: X-ray and optical analysis of doping effects, structural modifications and surface passivation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum dots (QDs) exhibit unique properties arising from their reduced size and quantum confinement effects, including exceptionally bright and tunable photoluminescence. Among these, CuInS$_{2}$ QDs have gained significant attention owing to their remarkable broadband emission, making them highly desirable for various optoelectronic applications requiring efficient luminescent nanomaterials. However, maximizing radiative recombination in CuInS$_{2}$ QDs often necessitates minimizing intragap trap states. A common approach involves the introduction of Zn during the synthesis, which typically promotes the formation of a ZnS shell that passivates the QD surface.
  Despite its importance, the characterization and quantification of Zn incorporation using conventional techniques, such as optical spectroscopy or electron microscopy, remains challenging. In this study, we utilized X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), in both X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectral ranges, to investigate Zn incorporation into CuInS$_{2}$ QDs with element-specific precision. This approach allowed us to detect the formation of a ZnS surface shell and to resolve the spatial distribution of Zn atoms within the QD lattice, distinguishing between Zn as a substituent, or as an interstitial defect.
  Additionally, we explored the optical and dynamical properties of CuInS$_{2}$ QDs using time-resolved optical spectroscopies, particularly in the presence of electron and hole acceptors. These results provide deeper insights into the role and effectiveness of the Zn-induced passivating layer, paving the way for optimizing QD performance in photoluminescence applications.</description>

      <title>Timescales for stochastic barrier crossing: inferring the potential from nonequilibrium data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11456v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kramers' rate theory forms a cornerstone for thermally activated barrier crossing. However, its reliance on equilibrium quantities excludes analysis of nonequilibrium dynamics at early times. Most works have thus focused on obtaining rates and transition time and path distributions in equilibrium. Instead, here we consider early-time nonequilibrium dynamics in a model system of a particle with overdamped dynamics hopping over the barrier in a double-well potential, using the Smoluchowski equation (SE) and stochastic path integral (SPI) mapping of the Langevin equation. We identify several key timescales relevant to nonequilibrium dynamics and quantify them using the SE and SPI approaches. The shortest timescale corresponds to equilibration in a well at time $t \ll \tau_{\rm B}$, where $\tau_{\rm B}$ is the Brownian diffusion time. The second important timescale is when an inflexion point appears in the effective potential constructed from the density at $t \lessapprox \tau_{\rm B}$. Shortly after, the existence of a second potential well can be inferred from sufficient sampling of the dynamics. Interestingly, this timescale decreases with increasing barrier height. We find significant deviations from the equilibrium limit unless $t \gg \tau_{\rm B}$. We further calculate \red{the} density current at the barrier for bistable and asymmetric potentials and find that it crosses over to that from equilibrium rate theory at a time that does not appear to depend on the barrier height. Our results have important implications for controlling activated processes at finite times and demonstrate the importance of reaching long enough times to faithfully construct potential landscapes from experimental or simulation data.</description>

      <title>Navigating Chemical Space: Multi-Level Bayesian Optimization with Hierarchical Coarse-Graining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04169v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Molecular discovery within the vast chemical space remains a significant challenge due to the immense number of possible molecules and limited scalability of conventional screening methods. To approach chemical space exploration more effectively, we have developed an active learning-based method that uses transferable coarse-grained models to compress chemical space into varying levels of resolution. By using multiple representations of chemical space with different coarse-graining resolutions, we balance combinatorial complexity and chemical detail. To identify target compounds, we first transform the discrete molecular spaces into smooth latent representations. We then perform Bayesian optimization within these latent spaces, using molecular dynamics simulations to calculate target free energies of the coarse-grained compounds. This multi-level approach effectively balances exploration and exploitation at lower and higher resolutions, respectively. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by optimizing molecules to enhance phase separation in phospholipid bilayers. Our funnel-like strategy not only suggests optimal compounds but also provides insight into relevant neighborhoods in chemical space. We show how this neighborhood information from lower resolutions can guide the optimization at higher resolutions, thereby providing an efficient way to navigate large chemical spaces for free energy-based molecular optimization.</description>

      <title>Apax: A Flexible and Performant Framework For The Development of Machine-Learned Interatomic Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22168v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce Atomistic learned potentials in JAX (apax), a flexible and efficient open source software package for training and inference of machine-learned interatomic potentials. Built on the JAX framework, apax supports GPU acceleration and implements flexible model abstractions for fast development. With features such as kernel-based data selection, well-calibrated uncertainty estimation, and enhanced sampling, it is tailored to active learning applications and ease of use. The features and design decisions made in apax are discussed before demonstrating some of its capabilities. First, a data set for the room-temperature ionic liquid EMIM+BF4- is created using active learning. It is highlighted how continuously learning models between iterations can reduce training times up to 85 % with only a minor reduction of the models' accuracy. Second, we show good scalability in a data-parallel training setting. We report that a Gaussian Moment Neural Network model, as implemented in apax, achieves higher accuracy and up to 10 times faster inference times than a performance-optimized Allegro model. A recently published Li3PO4 dataset, reported with comparable accuracy and inference performance metrics, is used as a point of comparison. Moreover, the inference speeds of the available simulation engines are compared. Finally, to highlight the modularity of apax, an equivariant message-passing model is trained as a shallow ensemble and used to perform uncertainty-driven dynamics.</description>

      <title>Quantum block Krylov subspace projector algorithm for computing low-lying eigenenergies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09971v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Computing eigenvalues is a computationally intensive task central to numerous applications in the natural sciences. Toward this end, we investigate the quantum block Krylov subspace projector (QBKSP) algorithm - a multireference quantum Lanczos method designed to accurately compute low-lying eigenenergies, including degenerate ones, of quantum systems. We present three compact quantum circuits tailored to different problem settings for evaluating the required expectation values. To assess the impact of the number and fidelity of initial reference states, as well as time evolution duration, we perform error-free and limited-precision numerical simulations and quantum circuit simulations. Our results show that using multiple reference states significantly enhances convergence, particularly in precision-limited scenarios and in cases where a single reference state fails to capture all target eigenvalues. Additionally, the QBKSP algorithm allows for the determination of degenerate eigenstates and their multiplicities through appropriate convergence conditions.</description>
