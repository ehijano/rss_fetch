      <title>Precise Asteroseismic Ages for the Helmi Streams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Helmi streams are remnants of a dwarf galaxy that was accreted by the Milky Way and whose stars now form a distinct kinematic and chemical substructure in the Galactic halo. Precisely age-dating these typically faint stars of extragalactic origin has been notoriously difficult due to the limitations of using only spectroscopic data, interferometry, or coarse asteroseismic measurements. Using observations from NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, we report the detailed asteroseismic modeling of two of the brightest red giants within the Helmi streams, HD 175305 and HD 128279. By modeling the individual oscillation mode frequencies and the spectroscopic properties of both stars, we determine their fundamental properties including mass, radius, and age ($\tau$). We report $\tau = 11.16 \pm 0.91$ Gyr for HD 175305 and $\tau = 12.52 \pm 1.05$ Gyr for HD 128279, consistent with previously inferred star-formation histories for the Helmi streams and the differential chemical abundances between the two stars. With precise ages for individual stream members, our results reinforce the hypothesis that the Helmi streams' progenitor must have existed at least 12 Gyr ago. Our results also highlight that the ages of metal-poor, $\alpha$-enhanced red giants can be severely underestimated when inferred using global asteroseismic parameters instead of individual mode frequencies.</description>

      <title>The ODYSSEUS Survey. Characterizing magnetospheric geometries and hotspot structures in T Tauri stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetospheric accretion is a key process that shapes the inner disks of T Tauri stars, controlling mass and angular momentum evolution. It produces strong ultraviolet and optical emission that irradiates the planet-forming environment. In this work, we characterize the magnetospheric geometries, accretion rates, extinction properties, and hotspot structures of 67 T Tauri stars in the largest and most consistent study of ultraviolet and optical accretion signatures to date. To do so, we apply an accretion flow model to velocity-resolved H$\alpha$ profiles for T Tauri stars from the HST/ULLYSES program with consistently-derived stellar parameters. We find typical magnetospheric truncation radii to be almost half of the usually-assumed value of 5 stellar radii. We then model the same stars' HST/STIS spectra with an accretion shock model, finding a diverse range of hotspot structures. Phase-folding multi-epoch shock models reveals rotational modulation of observed hotspot energy flux densities, indicative of hotspots that persist for at least 3 stellar rotation periods. For the first time, we perform a large-scale, self-consistent comparison of accretion rates measured using accretion flow and shock models, finding them to be consistent within $\sim$0.16 dex for contemporaneous observations. Finally, we find that up to 50% of the total accretion luminosity is at short wavelengths accessible only from space, highlighting the crucial role of ultraviolet spectra in constraining accretion spectral energy distributions, hotspot structure, and extinction.</description>

      <title>Multi-wavelength observations of substructures in solar flare ribbons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar flare ribbons are features in the lower atmosphere that show enhanced emission intensity, particularly noticeable in H$\alpha$ and EUV images of the transition region and upper chromosphere. In this study, we provide observational evidence that the flare ribbons are composed of a large number of coherent sub-structures that we call \textit{riblets}. Our observations, taken with the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope / CRisp Imaging Spectro-Polarimeter (SST/CRISP) instrument, focused on an X1.5-class flare that occurred on June 10, 2014. Using data obtained from SST/CRISP, we utilize CRISPEX, an interactive graphical user interface tool, to individually track and analyze the dynamic evolution of these riblets, gaining initial insights into their characteristics. Our investigation reveals the existence of two distinct categories of riblets within the flare ribbons. The first category comprises riblets that evolve perpendicular to the ribbon towards the solar surface at a constant velocity over their lifespan. We present one such riblet with a velocity of 18.04 km/s, persisting for a duration of 67 seconds. The second category includes riblets with varying velocities, indicating a more complex and non-linear evolution pattern. We present one such riblet with an average acceleration of 0.70 km/s$^2$ and a duration of 22.8 seconds. Riblets, with their distinct characteristics, provide an opportunity to study the chromospheric response to a solar flare in a more detailed manner.</description>

      <title>Surface Waves at Switchback Boundaries in the Young Solar Wind from Parker Solar Probe Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Switchbacks (SBs) are localized magnetic field deflections in the solar wind, marked by abrupt changes in the magnetic field direction relative to the ambient solar wind. Observations onboard Parker Solar Probe (PSP) at heliocentric distances below 50 Solar Radii (Rs) showed that within SBs, perturbations in the magnetic field ({\Delta}B) and the bulk solar wind velocity ({\Delta}V) align, i.e., {\Delta}B~{\Delta}V, producing enhanced radial velocity spikes. In this study, we examine the characteristics of SB boundaries, with particular attention to the role of boundary shear flow instabilities (Kelvin-Helmholtz instability - KHI) for surface wave phenomena based on the in situ magnetic field, plasma speed, and plasma density measurements from PSP. The results indicate that SB boundaries can be unstable for generating KHI-driven surface waves, suggesting that the wave activity observed at SB boundaries is caused by shear flow instabilities. In addition, the continued development of KHI may lead to boundary erosion, contributing to the radial evolution of SBs via structural weakening or broadening. However, when {\Delta}B and {\Delta}V are closely aligned, the boundary remains stable unless the velocity shear significantly exceeds the magnetic shear. Since the observed velocity shear typically ranges from 40% to 90% of magnetic shear, the instability condition is generally not satisfied. Thus, the configuration leading to the instability arises from deviations from precise alignment of {\Delta}B and {\Delta}V in the young solar wind, and the release of the KHI presumably leads to the formation of the {\Delta}B and {\Delta}V alignment observed at SB boundaries located at 35-55 Rs.</description>

      <title>47 Tuc in Rubin Data Preview 1: Exploring Early LSST Data and Science Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present analyses of the early data from Rubin Observatory's Data Preview 1 (DP1) for the globular cluster 47 Tuc field. The DP1 dataset for 47 Tuc includes four nights of observations from the Rubin Commissioning Camera (LSSTComCam), covering multiple bands (ugriy). We address challenges of crowding near the cluster core and toward the SMC in DP1, and demonstrate improved star-galaxy separation by fitting fifth-degree polynomials to the stellar loci in color-color diagrams and applying multi-dimensional sigma clipping. We compile a catalog of 3,576 probable 47 Tuc member stars selected via a combination of isochrone, Gaia proper-motion, and color-color space matched filtering. We explore the sources of photometric scatter in the 47 Tuc color-color sequence, evaluating contributions from various potential sources, including differential extinction within the cluster. Finally, we recover five known variable stars, including three RR Lyrae and two eclipsing binaries. Although the DP1 lightcurves have sparse temporal sampling, they appear to follow the patterns of densely-sampled literature lightcurves well. Despite some data limitations for crowded-field stellar analysis, DP1 demonstrates the promising scientific potential for future LSST data releases.</description>

      <title>Type II radio bursts and space weather phenomena: A statistical study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present for the first time a comprehensive statistical study between type II radio bursts from the metric (m) to the dekameric-hectometric (DH) domain and their associated solar and space weather (SW) phenomena, namely, solar flares (SFs), sunspot (SN) configurations, filament eruptions, coronal mass ejections (CMEs), their interplanetary (IP) counterparts (ICMEs) and shocks, in situ detected particles and geomagnetic storms (GSs). The m-only and m+DH radio signatures are identified from dynamic spectra provided by the ground-based RSTN stations distributed over the globe together with Wind/WAVES satellite data. The DH-only type IIs are adopted from a ready catalog based on Wind/WAVES spacecraft data. We perform the temporal and spatial association between the radio emission and the listed above activity events during solar cycle (SC) 24, separately for the three sub-categories, m-only, m+DH and DH-only type IIs. A quantitative assessment on the occurrence rates is presented as a function of the strength of the specific SW phenomena: highest rates are obtained with CMEs, SFs, filament eruptions, and SN configurations, whereas a much weaker relationship is found with ICMEs, IP shocks, energetic particles, and GSs. The potential of the obtained rates to be used in empirical or physics-based models for SW forecasting is discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an investigation of the Extreme-Ultraviolet (EUV) wave linked to the flare that occurred on 28 October 2021, along with the associated coronal loop oscillation and type II radio burst. The EUV wave was observed by multi-viewpoint with Solar Dynamics Observatory and Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory - A. The associated coronal mass ejection (CME) was observed by Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO) as well by COR1 coronagraph. From the multi-view observation, we found that the EUV wave is propagated ahead of the connected CME. The coronal magnetic field measurement was performed by the coronal loop oscillations as well by the associated m-type II radio burst observations. We found the magnetic field strength values computed by both methods are consistence and are in the range of ~ 5 to 10 G.</description>

      <title>On the source sizes of type II radio bursts with LOFAR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar radio bursts can provide important insights into the underlying physical mechanisms that drive the small and large-scale eruptions on the Sun. Since metric radio observations can give us direct observational access to the inner and middle corona, they are often used as an important tool to monitor and understand the coronal dynamics. While the sizes of the radio sources that can be observed in the solar corona is essential for understanding the nature of density turbulence within the solar corona and its subsequent influence on the angular broadening observed in radio source measurements, the smallest radio sources associated with solar radio bursts have so far been limited by observational techniques and the radio instrument's baselines. We selected three type II bursts that were observed with the LOFAR core and remote stations in the Solar Cycle 24. We estimated the sizes and shapes (ellipticity) of the radio sources between $20-200$ MHz using a two-dimensional Gaussian approximation. Our analysis shows that the smallest radio source size for type II bursts in the solar corona which can be observed in the solar atmosphere at low frequencies is $1.5^\prime \pm 0.5^\prime$ at 150 MHz. However, even though the observations were taken with remote baselines (with a maximum distance of $\sim 85~km$), the effective baselines were much shorter ($\sim 35~km$) likely due to snapshot imaging of the Sun. Our results show that the radio source sizes are less affected by scattering than suggested in previous studies. Our measurements indicate a smaller source sizes at frequencies below 95 MHz compared to previous reports, though some overlap exists with measurements at higher frequencies, using smaller baselines.</description>

      <title>Extraction of Physical Parameters of RRab Variables using Neural Network based Interpolator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Determining the physical parameters of pulsating variable stars such as RR Lyrae is essential for understanding their internal structure, pulsation mechanisms, and evolutionary state. In this study, we present a machine learning framework that uses feedforward artificial neural networks (ANNs) to infer stellar parameters-mass ($M$), luminosity (log($L/L_\odot$)), effective temperature (log($T_{\rm eff}$)), and metallicity ($Z$)-directly from Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) light curves. The network is trained on a synthetic grid of RRab light curves generated from hydrodynamical pulsation models spanning a broad range of physical parameters. We validate the model using synthetic self-inversion tests and demonstrate that the ANN accurately recovers the input parameters with minimal bias. We then apply the trained model to RRab stars observed by the TESS. The observed light curves are phase-folded, corrected for extinction, and passed through the ANN to derive physical parameters. Based on these results, we construct an empirical period-luminosity-metallicity (PLZ) relation: log($L/L_\odot$) = (1.458 $\pm$ 0.028) log($P$/days) + (-0.068 $\pm$ 0.007) [Fe/H] + (2.040 $\pm$ 0.007). This work shows that ANN-based light-curve inversion offers an alternative method for extracting stellar parameters from single-band photometry. The approach can be extended to other classes of pulsators such as Cepheids and Miras.</description>

      <title>Two Cases of Non-Radial Filament Eruption and Associated CME Deflection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to analyze the multi-wavelength and multi-instrument observations of two quiescent filament eruptions as well as the deflection of associated CMEs from the radial direction. The events occurred on 18 October 2017 and 9 May 2021, respectively, in the southern solar hemisphere. Both of them and associated flares were registered by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) aboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) and the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory-Ahead (STEREO-A) Observatory in different EUV wavebands. Using data from STEREO A COR1 and COR2 instruments and the Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO) onboard the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO), we investigated morphology and kinematics of the eruptions and the latitudinal offset of the related CMEs with respect to the erupting filaments. Our observations provide the evidence that the two filament eruptions were highly non-radial. The observed deviations are attributed to the presence of low-latitude coronal holes.</description>

      <title>Protoplanetary Disk Survival Time-scales: A Blind Survey of Young Clusters up to 100 Myr in the Solar Vicinity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the protoplanetary disk lifetimes using a large sample of young stellar objects in nearby clusters. To investigate the final phase of disk dissipation, we selected 32 clusters, located within 500 pc and aged between 1 and 100 Myr, with membership determined using Gaia data. The Age and mass information of the sources are obtained through spectral energy distribution (SED) analysis and using evolutionary models of various ages. Using the IR data from 2MASS and WISE catalogues, we employ three methods to identify disks across the different wavelength regimes (1.1- 22 $\mu$m). We find that disk fraction consistently decreases as stellar systems age, a trend observed across all wavelengths included in this study. However, there is an increase in the time scale of disk decay as wavelength increases, with characteristic timescales of $\tau_{\text{short}}$ = 1.6 $\pm$ 0.1 Myr for shorter wavelengths (1.6-4.6 $\mu$m) versus $\tau_{\text{W3}}$ = 4.4 $\pm$ 0.3 Myr for 12 $\mu$m. This supports the idea that outer disk regions evolve more slowly. Notably, we detect infrared excesses at 12 $\mu$m and 22 $\mu$m in relatively older systems ($&gt;$10 Myr), with some disks with estimated ages up to $\sim$ 100 Myr. Among these, we identify a population of full disks that persist beyond the typical dissipation timescale. We also observe that the median mass of disk-hosting stars decreases from 0.62 $M_\odot$ to 0.27 $M_\odot$ in clusters younger and older than 40 Myr, respectively, indicating slower disk dissipation around lower-mass stars. We identify 33 transitional disk candidates using various color-color diagrams. Using LAMOST DR8 optical spectra and H-alpha equivalent widths, we identify possible accretors and estimate their mass accretion rates, finding most are younger than 10 Myr.</description>

      <title>The SOFIA Massive (SOMA) Star Formation Q-band Follow-up. II. Hydrogen Recombination Lines Toward High-Mass Protostars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrogen recombination lines (HRLs) are valuable diagnostics of the physical conditions in ionized regions around high-mass stars. Understanding their broadening mechanisms and intensity trends can provide insights into the densities, temperatures, and kinematics of HII regions. We investigate the properties of ionized gas around massive protostars by analyzing hydrogen recombination lines (H-alpha and H-beta) in the Q-band. Observations were conducted using the Yebes 40m radio telescope in the Q-band (30.5~50 GHz) toward six high-mass protostars selected from the SOMA Survey (G45.12+0.13, G45.47+0.05, G28.20-0.05, G35.20-0.74, G19.08-0.29, and G31.28+0.06). The line profiles were analyzed to assess broadening mechanisms, from which electron densities and temperatures were derived. We compared our results with Q-band data from the TianMa 65m Radio Telescope (TMRT) and ALMA Band 1 Science Verification observations of Orion KL. A total of eight H-alpha (n = 51 to 58) and ten H-beta (n = 64 to 73) lines were detected toward G45.12+0.13, G45.47+0.05, and G28.20-0.05, with non-detections in the other sources. Electron densities of \sim \mathrm{1\text{--}5 \times 10^{6}~cm^{-3}} and temperatures of 8000-10000 K were derived. Orion KL shows one order of magnitude lower electron density, but a similar temperature. Notably, G45.12 and G28.20 show increasing intensity with frequency for both H-alpha and H-beta, in contrast to the decreasing trend in Orion KL. The observed line widths indicate contributions from both thermal and dynamical broadening, suggesting high-temperature ionized gas affected by turbulence, outflows, rotation, or stellar winds. Pressure broadening may also play a minor role. The contrasting intensity trends likely reflect differences in local physical conditions or radiative transfer effects, warranting further study through higher-resolution observations and modeling.</description>

      <title>Six-yr SPIRou monitoring of the young planet-host dwarf AU Mic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we revisit our spectropolarimetric and velocimetric analysis of the young M dwarf AU Mic based on data collected with SPIRou at the Canada-France-Hawaii telescope, over a monitoring period of 2041 d from 2019 to 2024. The longitudinal magnetic field, the small-scale magnetic field, and the differential temperature of AU Mic, derived from the unpolarized and circularly-polarized spectra, were clearly modulated with the stellar rotation period, with a pattern that evolved over time. The magnetic modeling with Zeeman-Doppler imaging provides a consistent description of the global field of AU Mic that agrees not only with the Least-Squares Deconvolved profiles of the circularly-polarized and unpolarized spectral lines, but also with the small-scale field measurements derived from the broadening of spectral lines, for each of the 11 subsets of the full data. We find that the large-scale field was mostly poloidal, with a dominant dipole component slightly tilted to the rotation axis which decreased from 1.4 to 1.1 kG before increasing at the end of the campaign. The average small-scale field followed a similar trend, decreasing from 2.8 to 2.6 kG then rising. The long-term magnetic evolution we report for AU Mic suggests that, if cyclic, the cycle period is significantly longer than 6 yr. From velocimetric data, we derived improved mass estimates for the two transiting planets, respectively equal to M_b = 6.3+2.5-1.8 M_earth and M_c = 11.6+3.3-2.7 M_earth, yielding very contrasting densities of 0.32+0.13-0.10 and 2.9+1.1-0.8 g/cm3, and a new 90% confidence upper limit of 4.9 M_earth for candidate planet d (period 12.7 d) suspected to induce the transit-timing variations of b and c. We also confirm our claim regarding candidate planet e orbiting with a period of 33.11+-0.06 d, albeit with a smaller mass of M_e = 21.1+5.4-4.3 M_earth.</description>

      <title>Full Stokes magnetometry of the active M dwarfs AU Mic and EV Lac with SPIRou</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report in this paper circularly and linearly polarized observations of the young active M dwarfs AU Mic and EV Lac with the near-infrared SPIRou spectropolarimeter at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope, collected from August to October 2023 over a few rotation cycles of both stars. Applying Least-Squares Deconvolution (LSD) to our spectra, we detected Zeeman signatures in circular (Stokes V) and linear (Stokes QU) polarization, and Zeeman broadening in unpolarized (Stokes I) LSD profiles, all exhibiting clear rotational modulation. Using the stellar surface tomographic technique of Zeeman-Doppler imaging on our sets of observations, along with a simple parametric description of how the small-scale and large-scale fields relate to each other, we recovered the magnetic topologies of AU Mic and EV Lac successively from LSD Stokes V, Stokes IV and Stokes IVQU profiles, to investigate how the reconstructed maps evolve as we provide more information, and ultimately infer reliable magnetic maps of both stars. We find that AU Mic hosts a fairly simple and mostly poloidal large-scale field aligned with the rotation axis within about 10deg, whereas that of EV Lac is more complex, stronger and less axisymmetric. Both stars feature intense small-scale fields, of about 4 kG for AU Mic and 6 kG for EV Lac when averaged over the whole stellar surface. Stokes QU Zeeman signatures allow one to reconstruct stellar magnetic fields more reliably, and are especially useful for stars with more complex fields and low vsini's like EV Lac.</description>

      <title>From Photospheric Footpoint Motion to Plasmoid Ejection: A Two-Stage Reconnection Process in a Small-scale Chromospheric Jet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using high spatiotemporal resolution, multi-wavelength observations from the New Vacuum Solar Telescope (NVST) and the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), we present a detailed analysis of a small-scale chromospheric jet driven by plasmoid-mediated magnetic reconnection. Our results reveal that the entire process is governed by the dynamic evolution of photospheric magnetic footpoints, which proceeds in two distinct stages. An initial separating motion of the footpoints corresponds to a mild reconnection phase, characterized by a short current sheet and the eruption of a cool H$\alpha$ jet. Subsequently, a converging motion of the footpoints triggers an intense reconnection phase. During this intense stage, the current sheet rapidly elongates, and the resulting decrease in its aspect ratio initiates a tearing-mode instability, forming a plasmoid. The appearance of this plasmoid mediates the onset of fast magnetic reconnection, which produces a hot EUV jet and is concurrent with significant magnetic flux cancellation. We interpret this cancellation as the submergence of newly formed, post-reconnection loops. Furthermore, we identify a distinct, high-temperature plasma blob in the jet spire, significantly hotter than the surrounding jet plasma. We attribute this feature to a secondary heating process, likely caused by reconnection between the upward-propagating plasmoid and the overlying magnetic cusp structure. These observations provide a comprehensive, observationally driven picture (from the initial photospheric triggers to the multi-stage, plasmoid-mediated reconnection) that forms chromospheric jets, highlighting the critical role of footpoint motions in solar atmospheric dynamics.</description>

      <title>Effect of symmetry energy on properties of rapidly rotating neutron stars and universal relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigated universal relations for compact stars rotating at the Keplerian (mass-shedding) limit, which is
  highly relevant for understanding the rapidly rotating objects formed in the aftermath of a neutron star-neutron
  star merger. Our analysis is based on a set of nucleonic EoS featuring systematic variations in the symmetry
  energy slope parameter $L_{\rm sym}$ and the isoscalar skewness parameter $Q_{\rm sat}$, varied within ranges
  that are broadly consistent with current laboratory and astrophysical constraints. The global observable
  properties of isolated maximally rotating stars are examined, focusing on the mass-radius relation,
  moment of inertia, quadrupole moment, and the Keplerian (maximum) rotation frequency, as well as their
  variations in the $L_{\rm sym}$-$Q_{\rm sat}$ parameter space. Next, we demonstrate that, in the limit of Keplerian
  rotation, universal relations remain valid across the same set of EoSs characterized by varying $L_{\rm sym}$ and $Q_{\rm sat}$.
  In particular, we present explicit results for the moment of inertia and quadrupole moment as functions of compactness,
  as well as for the moment of inertia - quadrupole moment relation. All of these relations exhibit excellent universality,
  with deviations typically within a few percent and rarely exceeding 10\% across a wide range of parameters.
  These findings support the applicability of $I$-Love-$Q$-type universal relations in observational modeling
  of maximally rotating compact stars and the gravitational wave emitted by them, when accounting for significant
  variation in the symmetry energy and high-density behavior of the nuclear EoS.</description>

      <title>The Effect of the Collisional Flavor Instability on Core-Collapse Supernova Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the effects of the neutrino collisional flavor instability (CFI) based on 1D and 2D core-collapse supernova (CCSN) simulations done using the sophisticated radiation-hydrodynamic code F{\sc ornax}. We compare the growth rates of homogeneous CFI {(hCFI)} modes calculated by numerically solving the multi-group dispersion relation to those calculated using the monochromatic approximation. We find that the widely-used monochromatic approximation {leads to incorrect growth rates} when applied in multi-group scenarios. {As opposed to the $\sim10^5$ s$^{-1}$ values given by the monochromatic approximation,} the actual growth rates of non-resonance multi-group {hCFI} are at most $\sim$200 s$^{-1}$ in all our models and they are too slow to affect CCSN outcomes. We adopt a BGK flavor conversion scheme in the simulations to include the effects of resonance-like {hCFI}. We find that the CCSN dynamics and neutrino emission properties are only weakly influenced, and the intrinsic stochasticity due to convection and neutrino-driven turbulence can naturally lead to comparable effects. Hence, our analysis of the non-resonance and resonance-like {hCFI} into CCSN simulations suggests that the effects of neutrino flavor conversion triggered by {hCFI} modes are in general small.</description>

      <title>The environment of TeV halo progenitors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01495v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: TeV halos are extended very-high-energy gamma-ray sources found around some middle-aged pulsars. The emission spanning several tens of parsecs suggests an efficient confinement of the ultra-relativistic lepton pairs produced by pulsars in their vicinity. The physical mechanism responsible for this suppressed transport has not yet been identified. In some scenarios, pair confinement may be linked to the medium the pulsars are located in. We aim at understanding which type of medium pulsars are probing over their lifetime. We developed a model for the environment probed by moving pulsars, from their birth in core-collapse explosions, where they receive a natal kick, until their entry into the interstellar medium. The model involves: (i) a Monte-Carlo sampling of the properties of the massive-star progenitors of pulsars; (ii) a calculation of the structure of the surrounding medium shaped by these progenitors, for the two cases of isolated stars and star clusters; (iii) a computation of the evolution of supernova remnants in these parent environments. Ultimately, from a distribution of neutron star kick velocities, we assess in which medium pulsars are located as a function of time. We first derive the statistical properties of a fully synthetic Galactic population, and then apply the model to a selection of known pulsars to assess the likely nature of their environment. We show that pulsars escape into the ISM at around 200 kyr, significantly later than the values most commonly used in the literature. The majority of known pulsars with a confirmed TeV halo have high probabilities of still being in their parent environment, which suggests that efficient pair confinement is connected to the region influenced by progenitor stars. In order to test this idea, we provide the probability of still residing in the parent environment for a list of known pulsars.</description>

      <title>SpecCLIP: Aligning and Translating Spectroscopic Measurements for Stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have transformed natural language understanding through vast datasets and large-scale parameterization. Inspired by this success, we present SpecCLIP, a foundation model framework that extends LLM-inspired methodologies to stellar spectral analysis. Stellar spectra, akin to structured language, encode rich physical and chemical information about stars. By training foundation models on large-scale spectral datasets, our goal is to learn robust and informative embeddings that support diverse downstream applications. As a proof of concept, SpecCLIP involves pre-training on two spectral types--LAMOST low-resolution and Gaia XP--followed by contrastive alignment using the CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training) framework, adapted to associate spectra from different instruments. This alignment is complemented by auxiliary decoders that preserve spectrum-specific information and enable translation (prediction) between spectral types, with the former achieved by maximizing mutual information between embeddings and input spectra. The result is a cross-spectrum framework enabling intrinsic calibration and flexible applications across instruments. We demonstrate that fine-tuning these models on moderate-sized labeled datasets improves adaptability to tasks such as stellar-parameter estimation and chemical-abundance determination. SpecCLIP also enhances the accuracy and precision of parameter estimates benchmarked against external survey data. Additionally, its similarity search and cross-spectrum prediction capabilities offer potential for anomaly detection. Our results suggest that contrastively trained foundation models enriched with spectrum-aware decoders can advance precision stellar spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Modeling YSO Jets in 3D I: Highly Variable Asymmetric Magnetic Pressure-Driven Jets in the Polar Cavity from Toroidal Fields Generated by Inner Disk Accretion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20495v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Jets and outflows are commonly observed in young stellar objects (YSOs), yet their origins remain debated. Using 3D non-ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of a circumstellar disk threaded by a large-scale open poloidal magnetic field, we identify three components in the disk-driven outflow: (1) a fast, collimated jet, (2) a less collimated, slower laminar disk wind, and (3) a magneto-rotational instability (MRI)-active turbulent disk wind that separates the former two. At high altitudes, the MRI-active wind merges with the laminar disk wind, leaving only the jet and disk wind as distinct components. The jet is powered by a novel mechanism in the star formation context: a lightly mass-loaded outflow driven by toroidal magnetic pressure in the low-density polar funnel near the system's rotation axis. A geometric analysis of the magnetic field structure confirms that magnetic tension does not contribute to the outflow acceleration, with magnetic pressure acting as the dominant driver. While the outflow in our model shares similarities with the magneto-centrifugal model-such as angular momentum extraction from the accreting disk-centrifugal forces play a negligible role in jet acceleration. In particular, the flow near the jet base does not satisfy the conditions for magneto-centrifugal wind launching. Additionally, the jet in our simulation exhibits strong spatial and temporal variability. These differences challenge the applicability of rotation-outflow velocity relations derived from steady-state, axisymmetric magneto-centrifugal jet models for estimating the jet's launching radius. For the slower disk wind, vertical motion is driven by toroidal magnetic pressure, while centrifugal forces widen the wind's opening angle.</description>

Abstract: The majority of core-collapse supernova (CCSN) progenitors are massive stars in multiple systems, and their evolution and final fate are affected by interactions with their companions. These interactions can explain the presence of circumstellar material in many CCSNe, and the inferred low mass in stripped-envelope supernova progenitors. Through binary interactions, stars can gain mass, lose mass, or merge, impacting their final properties. Specific sub-types of binary interaction products have been investigated but few detailed full population models exist. Using thousands of detailed simulations with updated prescriptions for binary interactions and winds at Milky Way and Magellanic Clouds metallicities, we follow the evolution of single massive stars, primaries in interacting binaries and coalescence products following common envelope evolution. We also follow the evolution of the surviving secondary star, with a compact companion formed from the evolutionary end of the primary star or alone if the system was disrupted in the first supernova. The endpoints of our simulations map the rich landscape of CCSN progenitors, and provide detailed mass-loss history and progenitor structures. We identify an important evolutionary phase for stripped-envelope supernova progenitors, in which the wind mass-loss rate of stars stripped by binary interaction rapidly increases in their final evolutionary stages, after core helium burning. These strong winds would give rise to a Wolf-Rayet (WR) spectral appearance, though only for a few millennia, in contrast to hundreds of millennia for their more massive WR counterparts. Such lightweight WR stars in binaries can account for observed properties of type Ib/c supernovae.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04999v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Galactic Bulge Time Domain Survey (GBTDS) of the Roman Space Telescope will take high cadence data of the Galactic bulge. We investigate the asteroseismic potential of this survey for red giants. We simulate the detectability of global asteroseismic frequencies, $\nu_{\mathrm{max}}$ and $\Delta\nu$, by modify ing Kepler data to match nominal GBTDS observing strategies, considering different noise models, observing cadences, and detection algorithms. Our baseline case, using conservative assumptions, consistently leads to asteroseismic $\nu_{\mathrm{max}}$ detection probabilities above 80% for red clump and red giant branch stars brighter than 16th magnitude in Roman's F146 filter. We then inject these detection probabilities into a Galaxia model of the bulge to estimate asteroseismic yields. For our nominal case, we detect 290,000 stars in total, with 185,000 detections in the bulge. Different assumptions give bulge yields from 135,000 to 349,000 stars. For stars with measured $\nu_{\mathrm{max}}$, we find that we can recover $\Delta\nu$ in 21% to 42% of red clump stars, and 69% to 92% of RGB stars. Implications for survey strategy and asteroseismic population studies are discussed more.</description>

      <title>Common envelopes in massive stars III. The obstructive role of radiation transport in envelope ejection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20506v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present 3D radiation hydrodynamics simulations of common-envelope (CE) evolution involving a 12 solar mass red supergiant donor and a 3 solar mass companion. Existing 3D simulations are predominantly adiabatic, focusing strongly on low-mass donors on the red giant and asymptotic giant branches. However, the adiabatic assumption breaks down once the perturbed CE material becomes optically thin or when entering a longer-timescale evolutionary phase after the dynamical plunge-in. This is especially important for high-mass red supergiant donors, which have short thermal timescales, adding significant uncertainty to our understanding of how massive binary stars evolve into gravitational-wave sources, X-ray binaries, stripped-envelope supernovae, and more. We compare our radiation hydrodynamics simulations with an adiabatic simulation from Paper I that is otherwise identical, finding that radiative diffusion strongly inhibits CE ejection. The fraction of ejected mass is roughly half that of the adiabatic case without accounting for recombination energy release. Almost no material is ejected during the dynamical plunge-in, and longer-timescale ejection during the slow spiral-in is suppressed. However, the orbital separation reached at the end of the dynamical plunge-in does not differ significantly. The large amount of remaining bound mass tentatively supports the emerging view that the dynamical plunge-in is followed by a non-adiabatic phase, during which a substantial fraction of the envelope is ejected and the binary orbit may continue to evolve.</description>

Abstract: The 1.3 mm CAMPOS survey has resolved 90 protostellar disks with ~15 au resolution across the Ophiuchus, Corona Australis, and Chamaeleon star-forming regions. To address the fundamental question, `When does planet formation begin?', we combined the CAMPOS sample with literature observations of Class 0-II disks (bolometric temperature, $T_{bol} \le 1900 K$). To investigate substructure detection rates as a function of $T_{bol}$, we restricted the sample to disks observed at the 1.3 mm wavelength, with inclinations below 75$^\circ$, linear resolution $\le 20$ au and resolved with at least 4 resolution elements ($\theta_{disk}/\theta_{res} \ge 4$). We also considered the effects of extinction correction and the inclusion of Herschel Space Telescope data on the $T_{bol}$ measurements to constrain the lower and upper limits of $T_{bol}$ for each source. We find that by $T_{bol}$ ~200-400 K, substructure detection rates increased sharply to ~60%, corresponding to an age of ~0.2-0.4 Myr. No substructures are detected in Class 0 disks. The ratio of disk-averaged brightness temperature to predicted dust temperature shows a trend of increasing values toward the youngest Class 0 disks, suggesting higher optical depths in these early stages. Our statistical analysis confirms that substructures similar to those in Class II disks are already common by the Class I stage, and the emergence of structures at early Class I could represent only an upper limit. Classifying disks with substructures into those with and without large central cavities, we find both populations coexisting across evolutionary stages, suggesting they are not necessarily evolutionarily linked. If protostellar disk substructures do follow an evolutionary sequence, then our results imply that disk substructures evolve very rapidly and thus can be present in all Class I/II stages and/or that they can be triggered at different times.</description>

      <title>Flickers, Bursts, and Dips: Detecting Rapid Variability with the g(2) Autocorrelation Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21157</link>

Abstract: Rapid optical transient events can be hard to detect because of the limited number of photons they produce. I discuss a method of inferring the presence of fast, chaotic variability in photometry using the normalized autocorrelation function, what is called $g^{(2)}$ in quantum optics. The variability's signature is a bump in the function at short lags. No periodicity is needed for the method to work. Versions of this method are attested in stellar variability studies, but its uses in some other subfields apparently have not been realized. I calculate expected signal-to-noise ratios with shot noise and scintillation. This method could be used to find unknown phenomena, particularly sub-millisecond optical variability. I present simple models of three example use cases: a flickering artificial "lantern" near a host sun, optical microbursts from the Crab pulsar, and frequent irregular transits of a star by cometary bodies.</description>

      <title>An Eccentric Sub-Neptune Moving Into the Evaporation Desert</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10324v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Though missions such as Kepler, K2, and TESS have discovered $&gt;$2,000 sub-Neptune and Neptunian planets, there is a dearth of such planets at close-in (P$\lesssim$3 days) orbits. This feature, called the Neptune desert or the evaporation desert, is believed to be primarily shaped by planetary migration and photoevaporation. However, this region is not completely devoid of planets--a small number of very hot Neptunes reside within the desert. These planets provide an opportunity to directly probe the effects of migration and photoevaporation. We present confirmation of TOI-5800 b, an eccentric sub-Neptune on a $\approx$2.6 day period that is likely actively undergoing tidal migration. We use radial velocity measurements from the Carnegie Planet Finder Spectrograph (PFS) to constrain TOI-5800 b's mass and eccentricity. We find that it has an unusually high eccentricity (0.39$\pm$0.07) for its short orbit. TOI-5800 is therefore currently experiencing high levels of tidal heating as it moves into the desert. Ranked as a top candidate for transmission and emission spectroscopy within its temperature and radius regime, TOI-5800 b is a prime target for atmospheric characterization with JWST. TOI-5800 b presents a unique opportunity to study the atmosphere of a planet undergoing tidal heating and to probe the composition of sub-Neptune planets.</description>

      <title>Evolution of star clusters with initial bulk rotation via N-body simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20432v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Young star clusters can inherit bulk rotation from the molecular clouds from which they have formed. This rotation can affect the long-term evolution of a star cluster and its constituent stellar populations. In this study, we aim to characterize the effects of different degrees of initial rotation on star clusters with primordial binaries. The simulations are performed using NBODY6++GPU. We find that initial rotation strongly affects the early evolution of star clusters. Rapidly rotating clusters show angular momentum transport from the inner parts to the outskirts, resulting in a core collapse. Angular momentum transport is accompanied by a highly elongated bar-like structure morphology. The effects of bulk rotation are reduced on the timescale of two-body relaxation. Rotating and non-rotating clusters experience changes in the direction of angular momentum near the dissolution and early evolution due to the tidal field, respectively. We present synthetic observations of simulated clusters for comparison with future observations in filters of Gaia, CSST, and HST. This work shows the effects of bulk rotation on systems with primordial binaries and could be used for the identification of rotation signatures in observed open clusters.</description>
