      <title>Local wind speed forecasting at short time horizons relying on both Numerical Weather Prediction and observations from surrounding station</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a hybrid neural network model for short-term (1-6 hours ahead) surface wind speed forecasting, combining Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) with observational data from ground weather stations. It relies on the MeteoNet dataset, which includes data from global (ARPEGE) and regional (AROME) NWP models of the French weather service and meteorological observations from ground stations in the French Mediterranean. The proposed neural network architecture integrates recent past station observations (over last few hours) and AROME and ARPEGE predictions on a small subgrid around the target location. The model is designed to provide both deterministic and probabilistic forecasts, with the latter predicting the parameters of a suitable probability distribution that notably allows us to capture extreme wind events. Our results demonstrate that the hybrid model significantly outperforms baseline methods, including raw NWP predictions, persistence models, and linear regression, across all forecast horizons. For instance, the model reduces RMSE by up 30\% compared to AROME predictions. Probabilistic forecasting further enhances performance, particularly for extreme quantiles, by estimating conditional quantiles rather than relying solely on the conditional mean. Fine-tuning the model for specific stations, such as those in the Mediterranean island of Corsica, further improves forecasting accuracy. Our study highlights the importance of integrating multiple data sources and probabilistic approaches to improve short-term wind speed forecasting. It defines an effective approach, even in a complex terrain like Corsica where localized wind variations are significant</description>

      <title>Causal Links Between Anthropogenic Emissions and Air Pollution Dynamics in Delhi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Air pollution poses significant health and environmental challenges, particularly in rapidly urbanizing regions. Delhi-National Capital Region experiences air pollution episodes due to complex interactions between anthropogenic emissions and meteorological conditions. Understanding the causal drivers of key pollutants such as $PM_{2.5}$ and ground $O_3$ is crucial for developing effective mitigation strategies. This study investigates the causal links of anthropogenic emissions on $PM_{2.5}$ and $O_3$ concentrations using predictive modeling and causal inference techniques. Integrating high-resolution air quality data from Jan 2018 to Aug 2023 across 32 monitoring stations, we develop predictive regression models that incorporate meteorological variables (temperature and relative humidity), pollutant concentrations ($NO_2, SO_2, CO$), and seasonal harmonic components to capture both diurnal and annual cycles. Here, we show that reductions in anthropogenic emissions lead to significant decreases in $PM_{2.5}$ levels, whereas their effect on $O_3$ remains marginal and statistically insignificant. To address spatial heterogeneity, we employ Gaussian Process modeling. Further, we use Granger causality analysis and counterfactual simulation to establish direct causal links. Validation using real-world data from the COVID-19 lockdown confirms that reduced emissions led to a substantial drop in $PM_{2.5}$ but only a slight, insignificant change in $O_3$. The findings highlight the necessity of targeted emission reduction policies while emphasizing the need for integrated strategies addressing both particulate and ozone pollution. These insights are crucial for policymakers designing air pollution interventions in other megacities, and offer a scalable methodology for tackling complex urban air pollution through data-driven decision-making.</description>

      <title>Samudra: An AI Global Ocean Emulator for Climate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03795v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: AI emulators for forecasting have emerged as powerful tools that can outperform conventional numerical predictions. The next frontier is to build emulators for long climate simulations with skill across a range of spatiotemporal scales, a particularly important goal for the ocean. Our work builds a skillful global emulator of the ocean component of a state-of-the-art climate model. We emulate key ocean variables, sea surface height, horizontal velocities, temperature, and salinity, across their full depth. We use a modified ConvNeXt UNet architecture trained on multidepth levels of ocean data. We show that the ocean emulator - Samudra - which exhibits no drift relative to the truth, can reproduce the depth structure of ocean variables and their interannual variability. Samudra is stable for centuries and 150 times faster than the original ocean model. Samudra struggles to capture the correct magnitude of the forcing trends and simultaneously remain stable, requiring further work.</description>

      <title>Clear skies ahead: characterizing atmospheric gravity gradient noise for vertical atom interferometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05379v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Terrestrial long-baseline atom interferometer experiments are emerging as powerful tools for probing new fundamental physics, including searches for dark matter and gravitational waves. In the frequency range relevant to these signals, gravity gradient noise (GGN) poses a significant challenge. While previous studies for vertical instruments have focused on GGN induced by seismic waves, atmospheric fluctuations in pressure and temperature also lead to variations in local gravity. In this work, we advance the understanding of atmospheric GGN in vertical atom interferometers, formulating a robust characterization of its impact. We evaluate the effectiveness of underground placement of atom interferometers as a passive noise mitigation strategy. Additionally, we empirically derive global high- and low-noise models for atmospheric pressure GGN and estimate an analogous range for atmospheric temperature GGN. To highlight the variability of temperature-induced noise, we compare data from three prospective experimental sites. Our findings establish atmospheric GGN as comparable to seismic noise in its impact and underscore the importance of including these effects in site selection and active noise monitoring for future experiments.</description>
