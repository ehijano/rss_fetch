      <title>Contrastive Knowledge Distillation for Robust Multimodal Sentiment Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal sentiment analysis (MSA) systems leverage information from different modalities to predict human sentiment intensities. Incomplete modality is an important issue that may cause a significant performance drop in MSA systems. By generative imputation, i.e., recovering the missing data from available data, systems may achieve robust performance but will lead to high computational costs. This paper introduces a knowledge distillation method, called `Multi-Modal Contrastive Knowledge Distillation' (MM-CKD), to address the issue of incomplete modality in video sentiment analysis with lower computation cost, as a novel non-imputation-based method. We employ Multi-view Supervised Contrastive Learning (MVSC) to transfer knowledge from a teacher model to student models. This approach not only leverages cross-modal knowledge but also introduces cross-sample knowledge with supervision, jointly improving the performance of both teacher and student models through online learning. Our method gives competitive results with significantly lower computational costs than state-of-the-art imputation-based methods.</description>

      <title>A Recurrent Neural Network Approach to the Answering Machine Detection Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the field of telecommunications and cloud communications, accurately and in real-time detecting whether a human or an answering machine has answered an outbound call is of paramount importance. This problem is of particular significance during campaigns as it enhances service quality, efficiency and cost reduction through precise caller identification. Despite the significance of the field, it remains inadequately explored in the existing literature. This paper presents an innovative approach to answering machine detection that leverages transfer learning through the YAMNet model for feature extraction. The YAMNet architecture facilitates the training of a recurrent-based classifier, enabling real-time processing of audio streams, as opposed to fixed-length recordings. The results demonstrate an accuracy of over 96% on the test set. Furthermore, we conduct an in-depth analysis of misclassified samples and reveal that an accuracy exceeding 98% can be achieved with the integration of a silence detection algorithm, such as the one provided by FFmpeg.</description>

      <title>Symbolic Music Generation with Fine-grained Interactive Textural Guidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The problem of symbolic music generation presents unique challenges due to the combination of limited data availability and the need for high precision in note pitch. To overcome these difficulties, we introduce Fine-grained Textural Guidance (FTG) within diffusion models to correct errors in the learned distributions. By incorporating FTG, the diffusion models improve the accuracy of music generation, which makes them well-suited for advanced tasks such as progressive music generation, improvisation and interactive music creation. We derive theoretical characterizations for both the challenges in symbolic music generation and the effect of the FTG approach. We provide numerical experiments and a demo page for interactive music generation with user input to showcase the effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <title>Ego3DT: Tracking Every 3D Object in Ego-centric Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growing interest in embodied intelligence has brought ego-centric perspectives to contemporary research. One significant challenge within this realm is the accurate localization and tracking of objects in ego-centric videos, primarily due to the substantial variability in viewing angles. Addressing this issue, this paper introduces a novel zero-shot approach for the 3D reconstruction and tracking of all objects from the ego-centric video. We present Ego3DT, a novel framework that initially identifies and extracts detection and segmentation information of objects within the ego environment. Utilizing information from adjacent video frames, Ego3DT dynamically constructs a 3D scene of the ego view using a pre-trained 3D scene reconstruction model. Additionally, we have innovated a dynamic hierarchical association mechanism for creating stable 3D tracking trajectories of objects in ego-centric videos. Moreover, the efficacy of our approach is corroborated by extensive experiments on two newly compiled datasets, with 1.04x - 2.90x in HOTA, showcasing the robustness and accuracy of our method in diverse ego-centric scenarios.</description>

      <title>Natural Language Induced Adversarial Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Research of adversarial attacks is important for AI security because it shows the vulnerability of deep learning models and helps to build more robust models. Adversarial attacks on images are most widely studied, which include noise-based attacks, image editing-based attacks, and latent space-based attacks. However, the adversarial examples crafted by these methods often lack sufficient semantic information, making it challenging for humans to understand the failure modes of deep learning models under natural conditions. To address this limitation, we propose a natural language induced adversarial image attack method. The core idea is to leverage a text-to-image model to generate adversarial images given input prompts, which are maliciously constructed to lead to misclassification for a target model. To adopt commercial text-to-image models for synthesizing more natural adversarial images, we propose an adaptive genetic algorithm (GA) for optimizing discrete adversarial prompts without requiring gradients and an adaptive word space reduction method for improving query efficiency. We further used CLIP to maintain the semantic consistency of the generated images. In our experiments, we found that some high-frequency semantic information such as "foggy", "humid", "stretching", etc. can easily cause classifier errors. This adversarial semantic information exists not only in generated images but also in photos captured in the real world. We also found that some adversarial semantic information can be transferred to unknown classification tasks. Furthermore, our attack method can transfer to different text-to-image models (e.g., Midjourney, DALL-E 3, etc.) and image classifiers. Our code is available at: https://github.com/zxp555/Natural-Language-Induced-Adversarial-Images.</description>

      <title>More than Memes: A Multimodal Topic Modeling Approach to Conspiracy Theories on Telegram</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Research on conspiracy theories and related content online has traditionally focused on textual data. To address the increasing prevalence of (audio-)visual data on social media, and to capture the evolving and dynamic nature of this communication, researchers have begun to explore the potential of unsupervised approaches for analyzing multimodal online content. Our research contributes to this field by exploring the potential of multimodal topic modeling for analyzing conspiracy theories in German-language Telegram channels. Our work uses the BERTopic topic modeling approach in combination with CLIP for the analysis of textual and visual data. We analyze a corpus of ~40, 000 Telegram messages posted in October 2023 in 571 German-language Telegram channels known for disseminating conspiracy theories and other deceptive content. We explore the potentials and challenges of this approach for studying a medium-sized corpus of user-generated, text-image online content. We offer insights into the dominant topics across modalities, different text and image genres discovered during the analysis, quantitative inter-modal topic analyses, and a qualitative case study of textual, visual, and multimodal narrative strategies in the communication of conspiracy theories.</description>

      <title>Interdependency Matters: Graph Alignment for Multivariate Time Series Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Anomaly detection in multivariate time series (MTS) is crucial for various applications in data mining and industry. Current industrial methods typically approach anomaly detection as an unsupervised learning task, aiming to identify deviations by estimating the normal distribution in noisy, label-free datasets. These methods increasingly incorporate interdependencies between channels through graph structures to enhance accuracy. However, the role of interdependencies is more critical than previously understood, as shifts in interdependencies between MTS channels from normal to anomalous data are significant. This observation suggests that \textit{anomalies could be detected by changes in these interdependency graph series}. To capitalize on this insight, we introduce MADGA (MTS Anomaly Detection via Graph Alignment), which redefines anomaly detection as a graph alignment (GA) problem that explicitly utilizes interdependencies for anomaly detection. MADGA dynamically transforms subsequences into graphs to capture the evolving interdependencies, and Graph alignment is performed between these graphs, optimizing an alignment plan that minimizes cost, effectively minimizing the distance for normal data and maximizing it for anomalous data. Uniquely, our GA approach involves explicit alignment of both nodes and edges, employing Wasserstein distance for nodes and Gromov-Wasserstein distance for edges. To our knowledge, this is the first application of GA to MTS anomaly detection that explicitly leverages interdependency for this purpose. Extensive experiments on diverse real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of MADGA, demonstrating its capability to detect anomalies and differentiate interdependencies, consistently achieving state-of-the-art across various scenarios.</description>

      <title>Low-complexity Image and Video Coding Based on an Approximate Discrete Tchebichef Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.07630</link>
      <description>arXiv:1609.07630v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The usage of linear transformations has great relevance for data decorrelation applications, like image and video compression. In that sense, the discrete Tchebichef transform (DTT) possesses useful coding and decorrelation properties. The DTT transform kernel does not depend on the input data and fast algorithms can be developed to real time applications. However, the DTT fast algorithm presented in literature possess high computational complexity. In this work, we introduce a new low-complexity approximation for the DTT. The fast algorithm of the proposed transform is multiplication-free and requires a reduced number of additions and bit-shifting operations. Image and video compression simulations in popular standards shows good performance of the proposed transform. Regarding hardware resource consumption for FPGA shows 43.1% reduction of configurable logic blocks and ASIC place and route realization shows 57.7% reduction in the area-time figure when compared with the 2-D version of the exact DTT.</description>

      <title>Food Portion Estimation via 3D Object Scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12257v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Image-based methods to analyze food images have alleviated the user burden and biases associated with traditional methods. However, accurate portion estimation remains a major challenge due to the loss of 3D information in the 2D representation of foods captured by smartphone cameras or wearable devices. In this paper, we propose a new framework to estimate both food volume and energy from 2D images by leveraging the power of 3D food models and physical reference in the eating scene. Our method estimates the pose of the camera and the food object in the input image and recreates the eating occasion by rendering an image of a 3D model of the food with the estimated poses. We also introduce a new dataset, SimpleFood45, which contains 2D images of 45 food items and associated annotations including food volume, weight, and energy. Our method achieves an average error of 31.10 kCal (17.67%) on this dataset, outperforming existing portion estimation methods. The dataset can be accessed at: https://lorenz.ecn.purdue.edu/~gvinod/simplefood45/ and the code can be accessed at: https://gitlab.com/viper-purdue/monocular-food-volume-3d</description>
