      <title>Many body gravity and the galaxy rotation curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel theory was proposed earlier to model systems with thermal gradients, based on the postulate that the spatial and temporal variation in temperature can be recast as a variation in the metric. Combining the variation in the metric due to the thermal variations and gravity, leads to the concept of thermal gravity in a 5-D space-time-temperature setting. When the 5-D Einstein field equations are projected to a 4-D space, they result in additional terms in the field equations. This may lead to unique phenomena such as the spontaneous symmetry breaking of scalar particles in the presence of a strong gravitational field. This theory, originally conceived in a quantum mechanical framework, is now adapted to explain the galaxy rotation curves. A galaxy is not in a state of thermal equilibrium. A parameter called the "degree of thermalization" is introduced to model partially thermalized systems. The generalization of thermal gravity to partially thermalized systems, leads to the theory of many-body gravity. The theory of many-body gravity is now shown to be able to explain the rotation curves of the Milky Way and the M31 (Andromeda) galaxies, to a fair extent. The radial acceleration relation (RAR) for 21 galaxies, with variations spanning three orders of magnitude in galactic mass, is also reproduced.</description>

      <title>Dynamical systems analysis of a cosmological model with interacting Umami Chaplygin fluid in adiabatic particle creation mechanism: Some bouncing features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present work aims to investigate an interacting Umami Chaplygin gas in the background dynamics of a spatially flat Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) universe when adiabatic particle creation is allowed. Here, the universe is taken to be an open thermodynamical model where the particle is created irreversibly and consequently, the creation pressure comes into the energy-momentum tensor of the material content. The rate at which the particle created is assumed to have a linear relation with the Hubble parameter and the created particle is dark matter (pressureless). The Umami Chaplygin gas is considered dark energy, pressureless dust is taken as dark matter and a phenomenological interaction term is taken for mathematical simplicity. Dynamical analysis is performed to obtain an overall evolution of the model we consider. The autonomous system is obtained by considering dimensionless variables in terms of cosmological variables. The local stability of the critical points and the classical stability of the model are also performed at each critical point. This study explores some cosmologically viable scenarios when we constrain the model parameters. Some critical points exhibit the accelerated de Sitter expansion of the universe at both the early phase as well as the late phase of evolution which is characterized by completely Umami Chaplygin fluid equation of state. Scaling solutions are also described by some other critical points showing late-time accelerated attractors in phase space satisfying present observational data, and solving the coincidence problem. A unified cosmic evolution is also achieved within this model describing the evolution of the universe starting from inflation to late time acceleration connecting through a matter-dominated intermediate phase. Finally, the non-singular bouncing behavior of the universe is also investigated for this model numerically.</description>

      <title>Rotating Fermion-Boson Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rotating fermion-boson stars are hypothetical celestial objects that consist of both fermionic and bosonic matter interacting exclusively through gravity. Bosonic fields are believed to arise in certain models of particle physics describing dark matter and could accumulate within neutron stars, modifying some of their properties and gravitational wave emission. Fermion-boson stars have been extensively studied in the static non-rotating case, exploring their combined stability and their gravitational radiation in binary mergers. However, stationary rotating configurations were yet to be found and investigated. The presence of a bosonic component could impact the development of the bar-mode instability in differentially rotating neutron stars. Therefore, the study of rotating fermion-boson stars has important implications for astrophysics, as they could provide a new avenue for the detection of gravitational waves. In addition, these objects may shed light on the behavior of matter under extreme conditions, such as those found in the cores of neutron stars, and explain any tension in the determination of the dense-matter equation of state from multi-messenger observations. In this work we study a new consistent method of constructing uniformly rotating fermion-boson stars and we analyse some of their main properties. These objects might offer alternative explanations for current observations populating the lower black-hole mass gap, as the $2.6 M_\odot$ compact object involved in GW190814.</description>

      <title>Perturbative photon escape cones in the Kerr spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the perturbative, fully explicit, analytical behaviour of photon escape cones in the Kerr spacetime. When one conducts the fully general non-perturbative Kerr analysis, one quickly finds that one must at some point appeal to numerical and/or graphical methods. Herein we find that we are able to say much more if we look at the slow rotation limit (i.e., $a \ll m$). Indeed we give explicit and tractable expressions for the first and second order (in $a$) contributions to both the shape of the escape cone, and the solid angle subtended by the escape cone. We then look at a few special cases at each order, thereby leading to explicit expressions for the black hole silhouette, expressions which are of great interest to the observational community when studying images of black hole silhouettes ("shadows'').</description>

      <title>Shadows of black holes in dynamical Chern-Simons modified gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit and extend the study of null geodesics around a slowly rotating black hole in Chern-Simons modified gravity. We employ the Hamilton-Jacobi formalism to derive the equations for the shadow profile and determine its shape. We compare our results with numerical ray tracing, finding good agreement within the validity of our approximations for slow rotation and small Chern-Simons coupling. We constrain the model parameters using data from the observed shadow of SgrA$^*$.</description>

      <title>Calculating quasinormal modes of extremal and non-extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes with the continued fraction method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the numerical continued fraction method to investigate quasinormal mode spectra of extremal and non-extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes in the low and intermediate damping regions. In the extremal case, we develop techniques that significantly expand the calculated spectrum from what had previously appeared in the literature. This allows us to determine the asymptotic behavior of the extremal spectrum in the high damping limit, where there are conflicting published results. Our investigation further supports the idea that the extremal limit of the non-extremal case, where the charge approaches the mass of the black hole in natural units, leads to the same vibrational spectrum as in the extremal case despite the qualitative differences in their topology. In addition, we numerically explore the quasinormal mode spectrum for a Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole in the small charge limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the relativistic quantum motions of spin--zero scalar bosons via the Duffin--Kemmer--Petiau (DKP) equation with a position--dependent mass (PDM) system in the background of the topological defect space--time produced by a cosmic string. We determine the radial wave equation and obtain the exact analytical solutions of the wave equation for the linear and Cornell--type potential through the Bi--Confluent Heun differential equation. In fact, we have obtained the ground state energy for both potentials.</description>

      <title>When gravitational decoupling and quantum gravity (re)unite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effective action for quantum gravity coupled to matter contains corrections arising from the functional measure. We analyse the effect of such corrections for anisotropic self-gravitating compact objects described by means of the gravitational decoupling method applied to isotropic solutions of the Einstein field equations. In particular, we consider the Tolman IV solution of general relativity and show that quantum gravity effects can modify the effective energy density as well as the effective tangential and radial pressures. For a suitable choice of the mimicking constant, upper bounds on the quantum corrections can be driven by the surface redshift of the anisotropic compact stellar system obtained with the gravitational decoupling.</description>

      <title>Recent Efforts Towards Understanding the Early Universe from a Fundamental Quantum Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The observable universe is fundamentally inhomogeneous and anisotropic. Quantum description of the generation of these inhomogeneities and anisotropies is ill-understood and unsatisfactory. After providing a brief account of the standard approach of the generation of the classical density perturbations starting from the quantum fluctuations of inflaton field, I critically review various assumptions which are crucial for the success of this description, and point out various shortcomings around it. I also discuss the basic ideas and recent works by using an alternative path to overcome those shortcomings which is motivated by the so-called Collapse Model interpretation of quantum mechanics. Inspired by these works, I argue the necessity of constructing a class of manifestly inhomogeneous and anisotropic quantum states after inflation and discuss my recent works which provide one such prescription of building such a state, called the $T-$vacuum, defined in the radiation dominated stage of the early universe.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmic censorship protects the outside world from black hole singularities and paves the way for assigning entropy to gravity at the event horizons. We point out a tension between cosmic censorship and the quantum backreacted geometry of Schwarzschild black holes, induced by vacuum polarization and driven by the conformal anomaly. A similar tension appears for the Weyl curvature hypothesis at the Big Bang singularity. We argue that the requirement of exact conformal symmetry resolves both conflicts and has major implications for constraining the set of fundamental constituents of the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Hubble Tension in Power-Law f(R) Gravity and Generalized Brans-Dicke Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a theoretical framework to alleviate the Hubble tension. This framework is based on dynamics of a minimally coupled scalar field which either belongs to the Brans-Dicke theory with a self-interacting potential or is the scalar partner of f(R) gravity. These two theories are dynamically equivalent when the Brans-Dicke parameter is zero. We will use this dynamical equivalence to interpret the Hubble tension in the same theoretical framework. For both theories, we write one set of field equations in which the value of a parameter distinguishes between the two theories. We will show that H0 actually evolves with redshift so that its value is consistent with that measured from the local distance ladder and it drops to the value measured from CMB at high redshift. We argue that even though both theories exhibit this behaviour, Brans-Dicke theory with an exponential potential is more successful than power-law f(R) gravity to relieve the Hubble tension.</description>

      <title>A binary black hole metric approximation from inspiral to merger</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a semi-analytic binary black hole (BBH) metric approximation that models the entire evolution of the system from inspiral to merger. The metric is constructed as a boosted Kerr-Schild superposition following post-Newtonian (PN) trajectories at the fourth PN order in the inspiral phase. During merger, we interpolate the binary metric in time to a single black hole remnant with properties obtained from numerical relativity (NR) fittings. Different from previous approaches, the new metric can model binary black holes with arbitrary spin direction, mass ratio, and eccentricity at any stage of their evolution in a fast and computationally efficient way. We analyze the properties of our new metric and we compare it with a full numerical relativity evolution. We show that Hamiltonian constraints are well-behaved even at merger and that the mass and spin of the black holes deviate in average only $\sim 5 \%$ compared to the full numerical evolution. We perform a General Relativistic magneto-hydrodynamical (GRMHD) simulation of uniform gas evolving on top of our approximate metric. We compare it with a full numerical relativity evolution of the fluid and Einstein's equations. We show that the properties of the gas such as the accretion rate are remarkably similar between the two approaches, exhibiting only $\sim 10 \%$ differences in average. The approximate metric is five times more efficient among other computational advantages. The numerical implementation of the metric is now open-source and optimized for numerical work. We have also implemented this spacetime in the widely used GRMHD codes Athena++ and EinsteinToolkit.</description>

      <title>Hawking radiation from a hot NUT-Kerr-Newman-Kasuya-Anti-de Sitter black hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the tunneling phenomenon of a charged Dirac particle emerging from a thermal horizon of a hot NUT-Kerr-Newman-Kasuya-Anti-de Sitter (HNKNK-AdS) black hole. Considering the tunneling formalism, we report the Hawking temperature of the charged Dirac particle through the horizon and the heat capacity of the HNKNK-AdS black hole. It is found that the effective Hawking temperature for the black hole depends on the black hole's parameters, such as electric and magnetic charges, magnetic mass, the cosmological constant, and the angular momentum of the black hole. The Hawking radiation for the Kerr-Newman black hole is reduced. It is shown that there is a small correction to the Hawking thermal spectrum. The heat capacity for the HNKNK-AdS black hole is found different from the previous work, and for the Kerr-Newman black hole is also reduced.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study tidal forces in the Schwarzschild black hole whose metric includes explicitly a generalized uncertainty principle (GUP) effect. We also investigate interesting features of the geodesic equations and tidal effects dependent on the GUP parameter $\alpha$ related to a minimum length. Then, by solving geodesic deviation equations explicitly with appropriate boundary conditions, we show that $\alpha$ in the effective metric affects both the radial and angular components of the geodesic equation, particularly near the singularities.</description>

      <title>Modified gravity theories from the Barrow hypothesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Barrow proposed that quantum gravity effects might introduce fractal corrections to the area of the event horizon of black holes. The area law gets modified as $S \propto A^{1+\Delta/2}$, with $0\leq\Delta\leq 1$. It was so far unclear whether this assumption could lead to meaningful quantum gravity theories beyond general relativity. In this paper, we argue that this is indeed the case. In particular, assuming $\Delta$ to be a radial function, we show that the Barrow hypothesis, together with the Jacobson's approach can generate non-trivial modified gravity theories.</description>

      <title>Non-fluid like Boltzmann code architecture for early times f(T) cosmologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There have been several works that have studied scalar cosmological perturbations in $f(T)$ teleparallel gravity theories to understand early cosmic times dynamics. In this direction, the perturbations presented have been performed by considering $f(T)$ extensions as an effective fluid-like scheme, where the equation-of-state contains extra terms due to the torsion. In this work, we discuss introducing a non-fluid-like approach as a direct consequence of $f(T)$ extensions, particularly for $f(T)$ power law model scenarios. This approach will be compared using CMB constraints data from Planck 2018 and SDSS catalogs, showing a change in about 17% in $C_{l}$ at $l&lt; 10^{1}$ from the ones reported in the literature as a fluid-like approach, which will bring significant changes in the analysis on cosmological tensions at early cosmic times.</description>

      <title>Generation and effects of primordial magnetic fields during inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this thesis, we aim to investigate the mechanisms underlying the genesis of magnetic fields in the Universe and explore their potential in addressing the matter-antimatter asymmetry. We construct consistent models that generate the helical magnetic field consistent with observations. We also develop an effective field theory approach to magnetogenesis, where the choice of EFT parameters describes the magnetogenesis scenario in the early Universe, and different choices of parameters correspond to different models. Our EFT explicitly shows that generating primordial magnetic fields requires two necessary conditions: conformal invariance breaking and causal propagation. Furthermore, we establish that the presence of a strong magnetic field near compact objects, such as neutron stars, aids in understanding the phenomenon of Fast radio bursts through the conversion of gravitational waves to electromagnetic waves in the background of a strong transverse magnetic field.</description>

      <title>The Surprising Effectiveness of Weyl Gravity in Probing Quantum Corrections to AdS Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computing leading higher curvature contributions to thermodynamic quantities of AdS black hole is drastically simplified once the higher curvature terms are expressed in terms of powers of Weyl tensor by applying proper field redefinitions, avoiding the usual complications caused by higher derivative Gibbons-Hawking-York (GHY) term or surface counterterms. We establish the method by computing the Euclidean action of general rotating AdS black holes in five dimensional quadratic curvature theories with or without supersymmetry and verifying the results numerically. Our result is the state of the art for charged rotating AdS black holes in five dimensional minimal gauged supergravity including corrections from all three supersymmetric curvature squared terms. Our approach facilitates precision tests in the AdS/CFT correspondence and should be applicable in diverse dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper reviews the physics of stars, the type, structure, evolution and stability. Simple thermodynamics and statistical mechanics are used to show the inner working of white dwarf and neutron stars. The major concentration of the paper will be on white dwarf stars although in some places references will also be made to neutron stars where the relations can be extended easily. It can be shown that a maximum mass limit is attached to each type of star which can be derived rigorously. Maximum entropy can be used to show that the gravitational contraction is balanced by the degeneracy pressure created by the electrons in the case of white dwarfs, and neutrons and protons which constitute the matter of the neutron star. Finally the kinetic equations which describe the luminosity of the star and the radiative transfer are introduced.</description>

      <title>Closed universes, factorization, and ensemble averaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study closed universes in holographic theories of quantum gravity. We argue that within any fixed theory, factorization implies there is one unique closed universe state. The wave function of any state that can be prepared by the path integral is proportional to the Hartle-Hawking wave function. This unique wave function depends on the properties of the underlying holographic theory such as the energy spectrum. We show these properties explicitly in JT gravity, which is known to be dual to an ensemble of random Hamiltonians. For each member of the ensemble, the corresponding wave function is erratic as a result of the spectrum being chaotic. After ensemble averaging, we obtain smooth semi-classical wave functions as well as different closed universe states.</description>

      <title>Criticality and thermodynamic geometry of quantum BTZ black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Within the framework of extended black hole thermodynamics, where the cosmological constant acts as the thermodynamic pressure and its conjugate as the thermodynamic volume, we analyze the phase structure and thermodynamic geometry of the three-dimensional quantum-corrected BTZ (qBTZ) black hole. Our results uncover two-phase transitions in the $T-S$ plane across all pressures except at a critical value. Numerical analysis reveals continuous critical phenomena along the coexistence curve, with critical exponents of 2 and 3 for the heat capacity at constant pressure and the NTG curvature, respectively. Importantly, these values notably deviate from the well-known critical exponents observed in mean-field Van der Waals (VdW) fluids, where the NTG curvature and heat capacity demonstrate discontinuous criticality. To our knowledge, our investigation is the first exploration of critical behavior in black holes incorporating consistent semiclassical backreaction.</description>

Abstract: Primordially formed extended dark objects would accrete baryonic matter and impact the ionisation history of the Universe. Insisting on consistency with the anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background, we derive constraints on the dark matter fraction for various classes of objects, of different sizes. We introduce a novel scaling technique to speed up numerical calculations and release our calculation framework in the form of a Mathematica notebook. Conservatively, we focus on spherical accretion and collisional ionisation. We find strong constraints limiting the dark matter fraction to subpercent level for objects of up to $10^4$ AU in size.</description>

      <title>Phenomenology of Horndeski Gravity under Positivity Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A set of conditions that any effective field theory needs to satisfy in order to allow for the existence of a viable UV completion has recently gained attention in the cosmological context under the name of $\textit{positivity bounds}$. In this paper we revisit the derivation of such bounds for Horndeski gravity and translate them into a complete set of viability conditions in the language of effective field theory of dark energy. We implement the latter into $\texttt{EFTCAMB}$ and explore the large scale structure phenomenology of Horndeski gravity under positivity bounds. We build a statistically significant sample of viable Horndeski models, and derive the corresponding predictions for the background evolution, in terms of $w_{\rm DE}$, and the dynamics of linear perturbations, in terms of the phenomenological functions $\mu$ and $\Sigma$, associated to clustering and weak lensing, respectively. We find that the addition of positivity bounds to the traditional no-ghost and no-gradient conditions considerably tightens the theoretical constraints on all these functions. The most significant feature is a strengthening of the correlation $\mu\simeq\Sigma$, and a related tight constraint on the luminal speed of gravitational waves $c^2_T\simeq1$. In anticipation of a more complete formulation of positivity conditions in cosmology, this work demonstrates the strong potential of such bounds in shaping the viable parameter space of scalar-tensor theories.</description>

      <title>Towards complexity in de Sitter space from the doubled-scaled Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How can we define complexity in dS space from microscopic principles? Based on recent developments pointing towards a correspondence between a pair of double-scaled Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (DSSYK) models/ 2D Liouville-de Sitter (LdS$_2$) field theory/ 3D Schwarzschild de Sitter (SdS$_3$) space in arXiv:2310.16994, arXiv:2402.00635, arXiv:2402.02584, we study concrete complexity proposals in the microscopic models and their dual descriptions. First, we examine the spread complexity of the maximal entropy state of the doubled DSSYK model. We show that it counts the number of entangled chord states in its doubled Hilbert space. We interpret spread complexity in terms of a time difference between antipodal observers in SdS$_3$ space, and a boundary time difference of the dual LdS$_2$ CFTs. This provides a new connection between entanglement and geometry in dS space. Second, Krylov complexity, which describes operator growth, is computed for physical operators on all sides of the correspondence. Their late time evolution behaves as expected for chaotic systems. Later, we define the query complexity in the LdS$_2$ model as the number of steps in an algorithm computing n-point correlation functions of boundary operators of the corresponding antipodal points in SdS$_3$ space. We interpret query complexity as the number of matter operator chord insertions in a cylinder amplitude in the DSSYK, and the number of junctions of Wilson lines between antipodal static patch observers in SdS$_3$ space. Finally, we evaluate a specific proposal of Nielsen complexity for the DSSYK model and comment on its possible dual manifestations.</description>

      <title>The Schwarzschild Black Hole from Perturbation Theory to all Orders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Applying the quantum field theoretic perturbiner approach to Einstein gravity, we compute the metric of a Schwarzschild black hole order by order in perturbation theory. Using recursion, this calculation can be carried out in de Donder gauge to all orders in Newton's constant. The result is a geometric series which is convergent outside a disk of finite radius, and it agrees within its region of convergence with the known de Donder gauge metric of a Schwarzschild black hole. It thus provides a first all-order perturbative computation in Einstein gravity with a matter source, and this series converges to the known non-perturbative expression in the expected range of convergence.</description>

      <title>Primordial extreme mass-ratio inspirals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13278v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The coalescence of stellar-mass primordial black holes (PBHs) might explain some of the gravitation waves (GWs) events detected by LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA. On the other hand, observational hints for supermassive PBHs (SMPBHs) have been accumulated. Thus it can be expected that stellar-mass PBHs might be gravitationally bounded to SMPBHs ($\sim10^{6}-10^9M_\odot$) in the early Universe, and both constituted primordial extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs). In this work, we initiate the study of the merger rate for primordial EMRIs. The corresponding intrinsic EMRI rate at low redshift may be comparable to that of astrophysical model, $10-10^4$yr$^{-1}$, which the space-based detector LISA has the capability to detect, but significantly raises with redshift. Though equal mass binaries also inevitably form, we find that under certain conditions the primordial EMRIs can be the most prevalent GW sources, and thus potentially a new probe to PBH.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Holes from Effective Field Theory of Stochastic Single Field Inflation at NNNLO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a study of the Effective Field Theory (EFT) generalization of stochastic inflation in a model-independent single-field framework and its impact on primordial black hole (PBH) formation. We show how the Langevin equations for the "soft" modes in quasi de Sitter background is described by the Infra-Red (IR) contributions of scalar perturbations, and the subsequent Fokker-Planck equation driving the probability distribution for the stochastic duration ${\cal N}$, significantly modify in the present EFT picture. An explicit perturbative analysis of the distribution function by implementing the stochastic-$\delta N$ formalism is performed up to the next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order (NNNLO) for both the classical-drift and quantum-diffusion dominated regimes. In the drift-dominated limit, we perturbatively analyse the local non-Gaussianity parameters $(f_{\rm NL}, g_{\rm NL}, \tau_{\rm NL})$ with the EFT-induced modifications. In the diffusion-dominated limit, we numerically compute the probability distribution featuring exponential tails at each order of perturbative treatment.</description>

      <title>Heavy States in 3d Gravity and 2d CFT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss correlators of light fields in heavy states in 3d gravity and holographic 2d CFTs. In the bulk, the propagator of free fields in AdS backgrounds containing a conical defect or a BTZ black hole can be obtained by solving the wave equation, as well as by the method of images. On the boundary, these geometries are sourced by heavy operator insertions, and the propagator is dual to a heavy-light (HHLL) correlator. By matching its expansion in Virasoro blocks to our bulk results, we determine the OPE coefficients of all contributing states in both the s and t channels. In the s channel, these states are excitations of the light field on top of the heavy state, and their OPE coefficients are the amplitudes to create them. The t-channel OPE is dominated by the Virasoro vacuum block, but there is also an infinite family of light two-particle states that contribute to the correlator. The OPE coefficients that couple these states to heavy operators represent their expectation values in heavy backgrounds. We determine them exactly, derive their asymptotic form at large twist, and discuss their behavior near and above the BTZ threshold, where they become thermal one-point functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2203.04824v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The spacetime short-distance structure at the Planck scale is governed by the Planck length, usually interpreted as a three-dimensional Euclidian length. As such, it is not Lorentz invariant and clashes with Einstein's special relativity, which is thus unable to describe the Planck scale kinematics. The solution to this problem is twofold. First, one has to re-interpret the Planck length as a Lorentz invariant four-dimensional pseudo-length. Second, to comply with a non-vanishing cosmological term~$\Lambda$, one has to replace the standard Poincar\'e-invariant special relativity with the de Sitter-invariant special relativity. Since the Planck pseudo-length does not clash with the de Sitter-invariant special relativity, it provides a consistent description of the Planck scale kinematics in the presence of~$\Lambda$. Under the above replacement, general relativity changes to the de Sitter-invariant general relativity, in which~$\Lambda$ is constitutive. In this paper, the ensuing Friedmann equations are derived, and some implications for cosmology are explored and discussed.</description>

      <title>Beyond (and back to) Palatini quadratic gravity and inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.11869v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study single-field slow-roll inflation embedded in Palatini $F(R)$ gravity where $F(R)$ grows faster than $R^2$. Surprisingly, the consistency of the theory requires the Jordan frame inflaton potential to be unbounded from below. Even more surprisingly, this corresponds to an Einstein frame inflaton potential bounded from below and positive definite. We prove that for all such Palatini $F(R)$'s, there exists a universal strong coupling limit corresponding to a quadratic $F(R)$ with the wrong sign for the linear term and a cosmological constant in the Jordan frame. In such a limit, the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ does not depend on the original inflaton potential, while the scalar spectral index $n_s$ does. Unfortunately, the system is ill-defined out of the slow-roll regime. A possible way out is to upgrade to a $F(R,X)$ model, with $X$ the Jordan frame inflaton kinetic term. Such a modification essentially leaves the inflationary predictions unaffected.</description>

Abstract: We study linear-perturbation equations for the two-body system of a charged dilaton black hole, of which dilaton coupling constant is $\alpha$, and a static particle with mass $m$, electric charge $q$, and dilatonic charge $\beta m$. We find that a consistent condition for the coupled equations corresponds to the equilibrium condition of the test particle. The expressions of classical fields are given in closed analytical formulas in the most interesting case with $\beta=\alpha$. We examine the electrical field around a charged dilaton black hole especially in the limit of the maximum electric charge and we find the electric Meissner effect which has been found for the Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole in the Einstein-Maxwell system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.02914v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new model of cosmology based on an anisotropic background and a specific $f(R)$ theory of gravity. It is shown that field equations of $f(R)$ gravity in a Bianchi type I background give rise to a modified Friedmann equation. This model contains two important parameters: $\gamma$ and $\delta$. We, thus, simply call our model $\gamma\delta$CDM. It is distinguished in two important aspects from the $\Lambda$CDM model: firstly, the contribution of different energy densities to the Hubble parameter are weighted with different weights, and then, dependence of energy densities to redshift is modified as well. This unorthodox relation of energy content to Hubble parameter brings forth a new way of interpreting the cosmological history. This solution does not allow the existence of a cosmological constant component, however, a dark energy contribution with dependence on redshift is possible. We tested observational relevance of the new solution by best fitting to different data sets. We found that our model could accommodate the idea of cosmological coupling of black holes.</description>

      <title>About the ability of agnostic X-ray tests of the Kerr Hypothesis to discover new physics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.18962v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the past decade, we have seen an unprecedented progress in our ability of testing general relativity in the strong field regime with black hole observations. Most studies have focused on the so-called tests of the Kerr hypothesis: they have tried to verify whether the spacetime geometry around black holes is described by the Kerr solution as expected in general relativity. One can follow either a theory-specific analysis or an agnostic approach. Each strategy has its advantages and disadvantages. In this work, we study the ability of agnostic X-ray tests of the Kerr hypothesis to discover new physics. We simulate X-ray observations of bright Galactic black holes of specific theories of gravity and we analyze the simulated data with a reflection model employing the correct theory of gravity and another reflection model for agnostic tests of the Kerr hypothesis. Our results suggest that agnostic X-ray tests are valid tools to discover new physics, but their constraining power may be lower than a theory-specific analysis.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction the scalar-torsion gravity version from the frame of exact cosmological solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.01145v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the cosmological models based on the scalar-torsion gravity implying non-minimal coupling between torsion and the scalar field as modification of teleparallel equivalent of general relativity. Based on generalized exact solutions of the equations of cosmological dynamics, the type of scalar-torsion gravity was reconstructed. Also, based on observational constraints on the values of the parameters of cosmological perturbations, the type of the coupling function was determined. It was noted that any models of cosmological inflation obtained on the basis of the proposed approach can be verified by observational constraints.</description>

      <title>Exploring Self-Gravitating Cylindrical Structures in Modified Gravity: Insights from Scalar-Vector-Tensor Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09852v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate static cylindrical solutions within an extended theory of modified gravity. By incorporating various coupling functions through a straightforward boost symmetry approach, we establish the equations of motion in a self-consistent manner and subsequently determine the linear scalar field profile. Utilizing analytical methods, we solve the system of equations for the metric functions and the $U(1)$ gauge field, revealing their dependence on Bessel's functions. To comprehend gravito-objects exhibiting cylindrical symmetry, we develop a perturbative framework aimed at identifying all nontrivial solutions for the scalar profiles. Introducing first-order truncated perturbation equations for the gauge field, synchronized with metric gauges and electromagnetic field considerations, we demonstrate their integrability and obtain solutions through quadrature. Our findings suggest the feasibility of obtaining self-gravitating cylindrical structures within the scalar-vector-tensor theory.</description>

      <title>Can nonlocal gravity really explain dark energy?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11301v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In view to scrutinize the idea that nonlocal modifications of General Relativity could dynamically address the dark energy problem, we investigate the evolution of the Universe at infrared scales as an Infinite Derivative Gravity model of the Ricci scalar, without introducing the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ or any scalar field. The accelerated expansion of the late Universe is shown to be compatible with the emergence of nonlocal gravitational effects at sufficiently low energies. A technique for circumventing the mathematical complexity of the nonlocal cosmological equations is developed and, after drawing a connection with the Starobinsky gravity, verifiable predictions are considered, like a possible decreasing in the strength of the effective gravitational constant. In conclusion, the emergence of nonlocal gravity corrections at given scales could be an efficient mechanism to address the dark energy problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.07212v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define and analyze the fermionic entanglement entropy of a Schwarz\-schild black hole horizon for the regularized vacuum state of an observer at infinity. Using separation of variables and an integral representation of the Dirac propagator, the entanglement entropy is computed to be a prefactor times the number of occupied angular momentum modes on the event horizon.</description>

      <title>Kerr binary dynamics from minimal coupling and double copy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.12784v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a new Yang-Mills Lagrangian based on a notion of minimal coupling that incorporates classical spin effects. The construction relies on the introduction of a new covariant derivative, which we name "classical spin covariant derivative", that is compatible with the three-point interaction of the $\sqrt{\mathrm{Kerr}}$ solution with the gauge field. The resulting Lagrangian, beside the correct three-point coupling, predicts a unique choice for contact terms and therefore it can be used to compute higher-point amplitudes such as the Compton, unaffected by spurious poles. Using double-copy techniques we use this theory to extract gravity amplitudes and observables that are relevant to describe Kerr binary dynamics to all orders in the spin. In particular, we compute the 2PM ($\mathcal{O}(G^2_N)$) $2\rightarrow 2$ scattering amplitude between two classically spinning objects to all orders in the spin and use it to extract the 2PM scattering angle.</description>

      <title>Near horizon linearized gravity and soft theorem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.03773v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the linearized gravity theory in the near horizon region of the Schwarzschild black hole in four dimensional spacetime. Under the Newman-Unti gauge, we derive the most general near horizon symmetry and solution space without any near horizon fall-off condition. There are four towers of surface charges that are generic functions on the horizon associated to the near horizon symmetry. With suitable near horizon fall-off conditions, we reveal a soft graviton theorem from the Ward identity of the near horizon supertranslation in both coordinates space and momentum space.</description>

      <title>Enhanced power spectra from multi-field inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.04090v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the enhancement of the power spectra in models with multiple scalar fields large enough to produce primordial black holes. We present analytic solutions for the perturbations in the case of constant turns without the need for an effective field theory for the first time and clarify the role of the Hubble friction that has been overlooked previously. For an arbitrary number of fields we derive the criteria that can lead to an exponential amplification of the curvature perturbation on subhorizon scales, while leaving the perturbations stable on superhorizon scales. Finally, we apply our results on a three-field generalization of the "ultra-light" scenario and show how the presence of field-space torsion can yield distinct observables compared to the two-field case.</description>

      <title>Ruling out models of vector dark matter in asymptotically safe quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02086v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The nature of dark matter is a problem with too many potential solutions. We investigate whether a consistent embedding into quantum gravity can decimate the number of solutions to the dark-matter problem. Concretely, we focus on a hidden sector composed of a gauge field and a charged scalar, with gauge group U(1)$_{\textmd{D}}$ or SU(2)$_\textmd{D}$. The gauge field is the dark matter candidate, if the gauge symmetry is broken spontaneously. Phenomenological constraints on the couplings in this model arise from requiring that the correct dark matter relic density is produced via thermal freeze-out and that recent bounds from direct-detection experiments are respected. We find that the consistent embedding into asymptotically safe quantum gravity gives rise to additional constraints on the couplings at the Planck scale, from which we calculate corresponding constraints at low energy scales. We discover that phenomenological constraints cannot be satisfied simultaneously with theoretical constraints from asymptotically safe quantum gravity, ruling out these dark matter models.</description>

      <title>Revisiting kink-like parametrization and constraints using OHD/Pantheon+/BAO samples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06464v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We reexamine the kink-like parameterization of the deceleration parameter to derive constraints on the transition redshift from cosmic deceleration to acceleration. This is achieved using observational Hubble data, Type Ia Supernovae Pantheon+ samples and Baryon acoustic oscillations. In this parametrization, the value of the initial $q$ parameter is $q_{i}$, the final value is $q_f$, the present value is denoted by $q_{0}$, and the transition duration is given by $\alpha$. We perform our calculations using the Monte Carlo Markov Chain method, utilizing the emcee package. Under the assumption of a flat geometry, we constrain the range of possible values for three scenarios: when $q_{f}$ is unrestricted, when $q_{f}$ is equal to $-1$, and when $\alpha$ is $1/3$. This is done assuming that $q_{i}=1/2$. Here, we achieve that the $SN$ data fixes the free parameters tightly as in the flat $\Lambda$CDM for unrestricted $q_{f}$. In addition, if we fix $q_{f}=-1$, the model behaves well as the $\Lambda$CDM for the combined dataset. We also acquire the current value of the deceleration parameter, which is consistent with the latest results that assume the $\Lambda$CDM model. Furthermore, we observe a deviation from the standard $\Lambda$CDM model in the current model based on the evolution of $j(z)$, and it is evident that the universe transitions from deceleration to acceleration and will eventually reach the $\Lambda$CDM model in the near future.</description>

      <title>Cryptographic Censorship</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03425v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We formulate and take two large strides towards proving a quantum version of the weak cosmic censorship conjecture. We first prove "Cryptographic Censorship": a theorem showing that when the time evolution operator of a holographic CFT is approximately pseudorandom (or Haar random) on some code subspace, then there must be an event horizon in the corresponding bulk dual. This result provides a general condition that guarantees (in finite time) event horizon formation, with minimal assumptions about the global spacetime structure. Our theorem relies on an extension of a recent quantum learning no-go theorem and is proved using new techniques of pseudorandom measure concentration. To apply this result to cosmic censorship, we separate singularities into classical, semi-Planckian, and Planckian types. We illustrate that classical and semi-Planckian singularities are compatible with approximately pseudorandom CFT time evolution; thus, if such singularities are indeed approximately pseudorandom, by Cryptographic Censorship, they cannot exist in the absence of event horizons. This result provides a sufficient condition guaranteeing that seminal holographic results on quantum chaos and thermalization, whose general applicability relies on typicality of horizons, will not be invalidated by the formation of naked singularities in AdS/CFT.</description>
