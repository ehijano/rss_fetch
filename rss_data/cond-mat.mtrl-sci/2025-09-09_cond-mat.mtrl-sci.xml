      <title>Modifying the Optical Emission of Vanadyl Phthalocyanine via Molecular Self-Assembly on van der Waals Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vanadyl phthalocyanine (VOPc) is a promising organic molecule for applications in quantum information because of its thermal stability, efficient processing, and potential as a spin qubit. The deposition of VOPc in different molecular orientations allows the properties to be customized for integration into various devices. However, such customization has yet to be fully leveraged to alter its intrinsic properties, particularly optical emission. Normally, VOPc films on dielectric substrates emit a broad photoluminescence peak in the near-infrared range, attributed to transitions in the Pc ring from its pi orbital structure. In this work, we demonstrate that the dominant optical transition of VOPc can be shifted by over 250 meV through the controlled deposition of thin films on van der Waals material substrates. The weak interactions with van der Waals materials allow the molecules to uniquely self-assemble, resulting in modified optical behavior modulated by molecular phase and thickness. This work connects the self-assembling properties of molecules with their altered electronic structures and the resulting optical emission.</description>

      <title>Accelerated Design of Mechanically Hard Magnetically Soft High-entropy Alloys via Multi-objective Bayesian Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing high-entropy alloys (HEAs) that are both mechanically hard and possess soft magnetic properties is inherently challenging, as a trade-off is needed for mechanical and magnetic properties. In this study, we optimize HEA compositions using a multi-objective Bayesian optimization (MOBO) framework to achieve simultaneous optimal mechanical and magnetic properties. An ensemble surrogate model is constructed to enhance the accuracy of machine learning surrogate models, while an efficient sampling strategy combining Monte Carlo sampling and acquisition function is applied to explore the high-dimensional compositional space. The implemented MOBO strategy successfully identifies Pareto-optimal compositions with enhanced mechanical and magnetic properties. The ensemble model provides robust and reliable predictions, and the sampling approach reduces the likelihood of entrapment in local optima. Our findings highlight specific elemental combinations that meet the dual design objectives, offering guidance for the synthesis of next-generation HEAs.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the critical factors in crystal structure graph representation: a comparative analysis using streamlined MLPSets frameworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks have rapidly advanced in materials science and chemistry,with their performance critically dependent on comprehensive representations of crystal or molecular structures across five dimensions: elemental information, geometric topology, electronic interactions, symmetry, and long-range interactions. Existing models still exhibit limitations in representing electronic interactions, symmetry, and long-range information. This study compares physics-based site feature calculators with data-driven graph representation strategies. We find that the latter achieve superior performance in representation completeness, convergence speed, and extrapolation capability by incorporating electronic structure generation models-such as variational autoencoders (VAEs) that compress Kohn-Sham wave functions and leveraging multi-task learning. Notably, the CHGNet-V1/V2 strategies, when integrated into the DenseGNN model,significantly outperform state-of-the-art models across 35 datasets from Matbench and JARVIS-DFT, yielding predictions with accuracy close to that of DFT calculations. Furthermore, applying a pre-training and fine-tuning strategy substantially reduces the prediction error for band gaps of complex disordered materials, demonstrating the superiority and potential of data-driven graph representations in accelerating materials discovery.</description>

      <title>Depth Profiling of Oxygen Migration in Ta/HfO2 Stacks During Ionic Liquid Gating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ionic liquid (IL) gating has emerged as a powerful tool to control the structural, electronic, optical, and magnetic properties of materials by driving ion motion at solid interfaces. In magneto-ionic systems, electric fields are used to move ions, typically oxygen, from a donor layer into an underlying magnetic metal. Although oxygen distribution is key to enabling precise and stable control in magneto-ionic systems, the spatial distribution and voltage-dependence of oxygen incorporation in such nanoscale stacks remain unknown. Here, we quantify oxygen depth profiles and oxide formation in Si/ SiO2/ Ta (15)/ HfO2 (t) films after IL gating as a function of the gate voltage and HfO2 capping thickness (2 and 3 nm). X-ray reflectivity and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements revealed a threshold electric field of ~ -2.8 MV/cm to initiate oxygen migration from HfO2 into metallic Ta. The resulting Ta2O5 thickness increases linearly with gate voltage, reaching up to 4 nm at -3 V gating. Notably, the required electric field rises with oxide thickness, indicating a progressively growing barrier for thicker oxide films. The Ta/Ta2O5 interface remains atomically sharp for all gate voltages. This suggests that complete Ta2O5 layers form sequentially before further oxygen penetration, with no sign of deeper diffusion into bulk Ta. Thinner capping layers enhance oxidation, relevant for optimized stack design. Additionally, indium migration from the indium tin oxide electrode to the sample surface was observed, which should be considered for surface-sensitive applications. These insights advance design principles for magneto-ionic and nanoionic devices requiring precise interface engineering.</description>

      <title>Machine learning magnetism from simple global descriptors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The reliable identification of magnetic ground states remains a major challenge in high-throughput materials databases, where density functional theory (DFT) workflows often converge to ferromagnetic (FM) solutions. Here, we partially address this challenge by developing machine learning classifiers trained on experimentally validated MAGNDATA magnetic materials leveraging a limited number of simple compositional, structural, and electronic descriptors sourced from the Materials Project database. Our propagation vector classifiers achieve accuracies above 92%, outperforming recent studies in reliably distinguishing zero from nonzero propagation vector structures, and exposing a systematic ferromagnetic bias inherent to the Materials Project database for more than 7,843 materials. In parallel, LightGBM and XGBoost models trained directly on the Materials Project labels achieve accuracies of 84-86% (with macro F1 average scores of 63-66%), which proves useful for large-scale screening for magnetic classes, if refined by MAGNDATA-trained classifiers. These results underscore the role of machine learning techniques as corrective and exploratory tools, enabling more trustworthy databases and accelerating progress toward the identification of materials with various properties.</description>

      <title>Skyrmion manipulation and logic gate functionality in transition metal multilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic skyrmions, due to their topological stability and high mobility, are strong candidates for information carriers in spintronic devices. To advance their practical applications, a detailed understanding of their nucleation and current-driven dynamics is essential. We investigate the formation and manipulation of skyrmions in a square nano structure (200 $\times$ 200 nm$^{2}$, 1 nm thick) of PdFe/Ir(111) multilayers subjected to nano second current pulses with magnitude ranging from (1-5)$\times$10$^{11}$ A/m$^2$. Using micromagnetic simulations, we demonstrate controlled motion of skyrmion under different types of spin-transfer torque (STT). The calculated skyrmion Hall angle (SkH) for Slonczewski type STT is ${\theta_{SkH}^{SL}} = 89.53^{\circ}$ for PdFe/Ir(111) multilayers which ensures the edge accululation of skyrmion like a track within the nano structure and we extend this idea further for different shape engineering of skyrmion in 4d tranisition metal multilayers by manipulating the magnitude and direction of current pulses. Next, we investigate the influence of voltage-controlled magnetic anisotropy ranging from (1.4 - 4.2) $\times$ 10$^6$ J/m$^3$ with external magnetic field B$_{ext}$ = 2 T, and (0 - 2.8) $\times$ 10$^6$ J/m$^3$ with B$_{ext}$ = 3 T respectively, on skyrmion dynamics for designing anisotropy-engineered barriers to guide their trajectories in PdFe/Ir(111) multilayers. We use further these barriers to implement basic logic operations, including OR and AND gates, with skyrmions representing binary states. The calculatd skyrmion Hall angle for Zhang-Li type STT in PdFe/Ir(111) multilayers is ${\theta_{SkH}^{ZL}} = 3.26^{\circ}$. Consequently, the skyrmions propagate predominantly along the direction of the applied current with minimal deflection, a feature that renders them highly suitable for logic operations.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Topological Dice Flat Band in Yttrium Monochloride Electrides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recent experiment [arXiv:2508.21311] the long-sought dice lattice and its characteristic flat band has been discovered for the first time in the two-dimensional layered electride yttrium monochloride (YCl), in which the interstitial anionic electrons of the electride self-organize into a dice lattice geometry. In this Letter, combining symmetry analysis, relativistic density-functional theory and realistic tight-binding model calculations, we predict that the dice flat band in YCl is intrinsically topological and characterized by a high Chern number of $\mathcal{C} = \pm 4$. In particular, the intrinsic atomic spin-orbit coupling (SOC) from $4d$-electrons of yttrium atoms creates topological gaps on the scale of 20 meV near $\pm K$ and leads to the emergence of nontrivial Berry curvatures and band topology. Displacement fields applied across the layered electride architecture can easily drive topological phase transitions. Our findings establish the newly discovered YCl electride as the first natural material hosting a dice flat Chern band without any extrinsic band engineering.</description>

      <title>Extracting Phonon Quasiparticles from Molecular Dynamics Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phonon anharmonicity are ubiquitous in real materials, creating finite phonon lifetimes. These effects are crucial for understanding thermal properties and phase stability. In this work, we define optimal phonon quasiparticles as those that maximize their lifetimes, and prove that the information about these quasiparticles is contained in two small matrices $\mathcal{S}$ and $\mathcal{Q}$, which can be constructed directly from molecular dynamics simulations. Based on these knowledge, we proposed an optimization scheme, which allows us to efficiently determine temperature-dependent phonon modes, frequencies and lifetimes. We applied this method to silicon and cubic CaSiO$_3$, revealing their temperature-dependent phonon behaviors and obtaining the well-known phonon softening in cubic CaSiO$_3$. This theory provides a convenient tool for investigating phonon quasiparticles and can be extended to study other quasiparticles, such as electrons and magnons.</description>

      <title>Exploring PdCrAs Half-Heusler Alloy for Sustainable Energy Solutions: An Ab-initio Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a comprehensive investigation of the HH alloy PdCrAs using first - principles methods, highlighting its potential applications in various fields, including spintronics, thermoelectrics, and optoelectronics. We employed density functional theory (DFT) within the full potential linearized augmented plane wave (FLAPW) framework. Structural optimizations indicate that the alloy stabilizes in the ferromagnetic phase. Both mechanical and dynamical stability have been confirmed through analyses of elastic constants and phonon dispersion. Our calculations of the electronic band structure and density of states (DOS) reveal that PdCrAs exhibits half-metallic behavior, with a spin-polarized band gap of 0.670 eV in the minority spin channel. The magnetic moment aligns with the Slater Pauling (SP) rule, indicating robust ferromagnetism. Mechanical analysis shows that the material is ductile in nature. Thermodynamic analysis highlights the alloy's resilience, supported by consistent trends in entropy, heat capacity, and Debye temperature.Its optical response demonstrates strong absorption in the visible and ultraviolet (UV) regions, along with pronounced dielectric and plasmonic features, suggesting potential applications in optoelectronics and refracective coatings. Furthermore, evaluations of the transport properties reveal high Seebeck coefficients and a significantly tunable figure of merit (ZT), with values approaching 0.9 across the temperature range of 300 - 1500 K, indicating excellent thermoelectric characteristics. Overall, these findings position PdCrAs as a promising multifunctional material suitable sustainable energy solutions.</description>

      <title>A facile vector substrate platform via BaTiO3 membrane transfer enables high quality solution processed epitaxial PZT on silicon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The direct integration of high-performance ferroelectric oxides with silicon remains challenging due to lattice mismatch, thermal incompatibility, and the need for high-temperature epitaxial growth. Here, a hybrid integration approach is demonstrated in which crystalline BaTiO3 (BTO) membranes are first transferred onto Pt coated Si substrates and subsequently used as vector substrates (VS) for the growth of epitaxial (001) Pb(Zr0.52Ti0.48)O3 (PZT) thin films via chemical solution deposition (CSD). A KI and HCl based etchant enables rapid and complete dissolution of the SrVO3 sacrificial layer in about 30 minutes, reducing the release time from days to minutes compared with conventional water based approaches to dissolve AVO3 and AMoO3 (A is Ca, Sr, Ba). The BTO VS imposes dominant (00l) out of plane orientation and in plane cube on cube epitaxy in the overlying PZT. Devices exhibit remnant polarization 10 to 12 micro coulomb/cm2 and coercive field of 100 kV/cm, with stable switching to 10^8 cycles on the VS. From piezoelectric butterfly loops, we extract effective d33 of 70 pm/V for PZT on VS, and 54 pm/V for PZT grown on conventional Pt Si substrates. This approach demonstrates a scalable and cost effective route for integrating functional ferroelectric materials onto silicon and offers a promising platform for future CMOS compatible oxide electronics.</description>

      <title>Electric-field Control of Giant Ferronics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ferrons are quantum excitations of electric polarization in ferroelectrics and electric analogues of magnons but have lacked direct experimental verification at room temperature. We harness the coupling of soft phonons and ferroelectric order in layered NbOX2 (X = I, Br, Cl) to generate, detect, and control giant ferrons, creating a new class of ultralow-power, chip-scale terahertz (THz) sources. Multiple ferron modes produce intense, narrowband THz emission with quality factors up to 228 and radiation efficiencies up to five orders of magnitude greater than state of the art semiconductor emitters. Resonant excitation of a high-Q ferron mode achieves efficiencies two orders of magnitude higher than intense lithium niobate THz sources. We further demonstrate direct, non-volatile electric-field control of ferron oscillations. These findings provide evidence for multiple ferrons and establish Ferronics as a foundational platform for light- and field-driven control of quantum order, with broad impact on ultrafast electronics, photonics, quantum technologies, and next-generation wireless communication.</description>

      <title>Modulation of structural short-range order due to chemical patterning in multi-component amorphous interfacial complexions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Amorphous interfacial complexions have been shown to restrict grain growth and improve damage tolerance in nanocrystalline alloys, with increased chemical complexity stabilizing the complexions themselves. Here, we investigate local chemical composition and structural short-range order in Cu-rich, multi-component nanocrystalline alloys to understand how dopants self-organize within these amorphous complexions and how local structure is altered. High resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy and elemental analysis are used to study both grain boundaries and interphase boundaries, with chemical partitioning observed for both. Notably, the amorphous-crystalline transition region is observed to be enriched in certain dopant species and depleted of others as compared to the interior of the amorphous complexions. This chemical patterning can be explained in terms of the elemental preference for ordered or disordered grain boundary environments. As only a qualitative measure of structural short-range order can be obtained with nanobeam electron diffraction for these specimens, atomistic simulations with a custom-built machine learning interatomic potential are then used to probe how dopant patterning affects local structural state. Increased grain boundary chemical complexity is found to result in a more disordered complexion structure, with segregation to the amorphous-crystalline transition regions driving changes in local structure that are sensitive to dopant ratios. As a whole, the intimate connection between local chemistry and order in amorphous interfacial complexions is demonstrated, opening the door for microstructural engineering within the amorphous complexions themselves.</description>

      <title>Bulk Ferroelectric Heterostructures: Imprinted Actuators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Domain switching is the cornerstone of ferroelectric materials. Most associated functionalities can be tuned via domain switching, including but not limited to piezoelectricity, thermal conductivity, domain wall conductivity and topological structures. However, achieving the full potential of reversible ferroelectric domain switching is restricted by the incomplete access to the entire ferroelectric texture space, as well as the memory effects and energy dissipation associated with the hysteretic nature of ferroelectrics. The manipulation of domain switching behaviour is moderately attainable in epitaxial heterostructures by exploiting the valence or lattice mismatch at heterointerfaces, which is generally constrained by the necessity for two dimensional architectures. In this study, domain-engineered bulk ferroelectric heterostructures (DE-BFH), constructed via elemental partitioning, are employed to unleash full potential of bulk ferroelectrics, providing comprehensive control of domain switching characteristics and adjustable reversibility within the entire range of ferroelectric texture space. Exemplar DE-BFH ceramics exhibit unprecedented enhancement in reversible electrostrain and stability in both axial and shear modes, including a record high peak to peak shear strain up to 0.9% at intermediate field levels, confirmed by digital image correlation measurements and in-situ synchrotron XRD studies. The advancement of domain switching behaviour in DE-BFH could also promote development of new types of lead-free piezoelectric devices, including actuators, energy harvesters, multiple state memory devices, and domain wall switch. Moreover, design concept of DE-BFH could contribute to the creation of distinctive ferroelastic, ferromagnetic, and multiferroic materials by broadening its scope to the entire ferroic family, encompassing polycrystalline, single-crystal, and thin-film forms.</description>

      <title>Harnessing the polar vortex motion in oxide heterostructures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polar topology, an analogue of the magnetic topology, serves as a large playground for exotic physical phenomena with a wide range of multifunctional applications. Polar vortices and skyrmions are representative polar topologies that have been predicted to significantly enhance the functionality and information density of nanoelectronic devices due to their ultrasmall dimensions. Despite these advantages, the practical realization of polar topologies in devices is impeded by the intrinsic challenges associated with their controlled motion and manipulation. Therefore, harnessing vortex manipulation-such as motion, on demand creation, annihilation, and shape transformation-is essential for practical device integration. However, vortex motion is often challenged by intrinsic physical limitations in collective lattice distortions and strong pinning effects from the surrounding environment, which remains elusive. In this study, we present real time observation of vortex motion in PbTiO3/SrTiO3 heterostructures, achieved through the application of localized pulsed electric fields and trailing bias fields from a conductive tip. Notably, the vortices exhibit reversible motion in response to the field direction. Furthermore, by precisely manoeuvring the conductive Atomic-Force-Microscopy tip along specific trajectories, we achieved controlled vortex reshaping, with reconfigured vortices showing remarkable stability over extended periods. This underline physical mechanism is further pinpointed by phase-field simulations, which revealed that the motion of the vortex boundary is controlled through the switching of the zigzag patterns of the vortex core. This study highlights the feasibility of harnessing vortex dynamics through external stimuli, advancing the fundamental physical understanding and prospects for next-generation polar vortex-based nanoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Low-temperature-compatible iron garnet films grown by liquid phase epitaxy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-crystalline yttrium iron garnet (YIG) thin films (&lt; 100 nm) form the backbone of magnonics, owing to the record-low losses affecting their magnetization dynamics. However, thin epitaxial YIG has mostly been investigated under ambient temperatures, limited by the paramagnetic losses occurring at low temperatures due to the gadolinium gallium garnet (GGG) substrates required for epitaxial growth. Driven by a growing interest in magnonic devices that can operate in cryogenic conditions and address quantum information applications, there is a strong need for iron garnet epitaxial films grown on diamagnetic substrates that can maintain low losses at low temperatures. In this work, we use liquid phase epitaxy (LPE) to grow ultrathin films of strained YIG on a commercial diamagnetic substrate, yttrium scandium gallium garnet (YSGG). We investigate their magnetization dynamics in the 3-300 K temperature range, and compare them to equivalent films grown on paramagnetic GGG. We demonstrate for LPE YIG on YSGG substrates a ferromagnetic resonance linewidth below 1 mT at 3 K, together with a very weak temperature and frequency dependence of the losses. The growth of YIG/YSGG by LPE provides a straightforward approach to producing iron garnet thin films for use in low-temperature investigations.</description>

      <title>Topological Origin of Intrinsic High Chern Numbers in Two-Dimensional M$_2$X$_2$ Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite sharing a common lattice structure, monolayer M$_2$X$_2$ compounds realize quantum anomalous Hall phases with distinct Chern numbers, a striking phenomenon that has not been fully exploared. Combining first-principles calculations with symmetry analysis and tight-binding models, we identify two generic band-inversion mechanisms governed by the orbital composition and symmetry representations of 3$d$ states near the Fermi level. When $d_{xz}/d_{yz}$ orbtials dominate, a doubly degenerate $\Gamma$-point inversion yields $C=1$; otherwise, inversions occur along $\Gamma$-X and $\Gamma$-Y at four $C_4$-related momenta, whose Berry-curvature contributions add to give $C=2$, distinct from scenarios relying on multiple bands inversions at a single $\mathbf{k}$ point. The same mechanism consistently explains related two-dimensional systems, including LiFeSe, KTiSb, MgFeP, and Janus M$_2$X$_2$ derivatives. The mechanism provide practical guidance for screening and engineering tunable high-Chern-number insulators.</description>

      <title>Hydrogen-induced fast fracture in a 1.5 GPa dual-phase steel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study clarifies the hydrogen embrittlement (HE) behavior in a 1.5 GPa ferrite-martensite dual-phase (DP) steel. Hydrogen pre-charging (3.8 mass ppm diffusible hydrogen), followed by slow strain tensile testing (10-4 s-1), resulted in a brittle fracture at 900 MPa within the elastic regime. Fractographic studies indicated that surface crack initiation consists of intergranular and quasi-cleavage morphology; site-specific transmission electron microscopy (TEM) investigations revealed sub-surface secondary crack blunting by ferrite. A mixed-mode morphology consisting of ductile and brittle features was observed adjacent to crack initiation. It differs from the previous investigation of uncharged DP steel, wherein a predominant brittle fracture was observed. Following significant crack growth, the pre-charged specimen exhibited predominant brittle fracture; site-specific TEM and transmission Kikuchi diffraction studies revealed {100} ferrite cleavage cracking. Electron backscatter diffraction studies were performed on the cross-sectional cracks. We explain the HE via hydrogen-induced fast fracture mechanism. During loading, hydrogen diffuses to the prior austenite grain boundary, resulting in hydrogen-induced decohesion. Subsequent hydrogen diffusion to the crack tip promotes brittle fracture at high crack velocity (&gt;Vcrit). The high crack velocity effectively inhibits crack blunting via dislocation emission, ensuring sustained brittle crack growth even after hydrogen depletion at the crack tip, resulting in {100} ferrite cleavage cracking. Based on TEM observations, we explain the formation of river pattern features on the {100} cleavage surface.</description>

      <title>Ferroelectricity in antiferromagnetic wurtzite nitrides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wurtzite-type nitrides have recently emerged as promising candidates for ferroelectric applications, yet their magnetic counterparts remain largely unexplored. Here, we establish MnSiN$_2$ and MnGeN$_2$ as aristotypes of a new multiferroic wurtzite family that simultaneously exhibits ferroelectricity and antiferromagnetism. These Mn(II)-based nitrides crystallize in polar structures and display robust G-type antiferromagnetism at room temperature. First-principles calculations reveal that nonmagnetic analogs incorporating Zn and Mg possess high polarization reversal barriers (0.735 and 0.683 eV per formula unit) and wide band gaps (4.0 and 4.8 eV), making them ideal ferroelectric candidates. In contrast, MnSiN$_2$ and MnGeN$_2$ exhibit strong antiferromagnetic exchange interactions (5--9 meV per Mn site) and moderate band gaps (1.6 and 1.0 eV), with reversal barriers of 0.963 and 0.460 eV per formula unit, respectively. Despite their limited magnetoelectric coupling, we show this family of Type-1 multiferroics exhibits altermagnetic spin splitting which reverses sign upon polarization switching. By strategically substituting alkaline-earth metals, we engineer multiple materials with coexisting switchable polarization, spin texture, and magnetic order. These findings open new avenues for the design of nitride-based altermagnetic multiferroics, offering a platform for integrated antiferromagnetic spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Coexistence of Two Types of Liquid Structures at Platinum-Water Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Platinum-water interfaces underpin many electrochemical energy conversion processes. However, despite decades of research, the real-space liquid structure of these interfaces remains elusive. Using three-dimensional atomic force microscopy (3D-AFM), we mapped Pt-water interface in real space with angstrom-level resolution. Topographic imaging revealed atomically flat (type I) and stripe-like (type II) surface nanodomains. Force-distance profiles above type I domains exhibited oscillatory decay patterns with periodicity of ~0.33 nm, consistent with water. In contrast, type II domains showed stronger oscillations with larger periodicity of ~0.45 nm and extended decay lengths, indicative of a different liquid structure with stronger correlation and ordering. Wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS) measurements of pure water and a series of liquid n-alkanes revealed peaks at ~0.31 nm and ~0.46 nm, in agreement with 3D-AFM observations of type I and type II structures, respectively. Our findings uncover the coexistence of two types of liquid structures at Pt-water interfaces modulated by surface heterogeneity, enabling new understandings and design principles for energy conversion applications.</description>

      <title>Quasidegenerate charge-density wave states in 1T-TiSe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transition metal dichalcogenides have been actively studied for their intriguing charge density wave (CDW) formations and their impacts on material properties. Among these, 1T-TiSe$_2$ is well-known to exhibit a 2$\times$2$\times$2 CDW state transition at 200 K, but its true ground state nature remains under debate. In this study, we investigate possible CDW states in 1T-TiSe$_2$ and their consequences for transport properties by employing first-principles electronic structure calculations and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. We identify seven distinct types of 2$\times$2$\times$2 CDW phases, most of which have not been reported previously. All of these phases are nearly degenerate in energy with each other ($&lt; 1.41$ meV per formula unit). Using the band unfolding technique, we compare the electronic band structures of these CDW phases with experimental angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy data. Our findings support the presence of a possible second phase transition at 165 K and suggest a new intermediate CDW order between 165 and 200 K that was previously unexplored. This result provides a possible resolution to the conflict between previous reports on the ground state symmetry of 1T-TiSe$_2$, and opens a viable route to phase engineering of 1T-TiSe$_2$ for functional applications.</description>

      <title>Time-resolved measurement of Seebeck effect for superionic metals during structural phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new time (t)-resolved method of both vertical- and horizontal-temperature gradients in an orthogonal configuration (t-resolved T(t)-HVOT) to have real interpretations of the enhancement in thermoelectric Seebeck effect (SE) observed during the structural phase transition. We apply our new method to superionic-state semiconductors of p-type Cu2Se and n-type Ag2S. The experimental data differentiate the two types of enhancements during the phase transition: a colossal SE (Scolossal), exhibiting an enormous value of up to 5 mV/K, and a slight enhancement in SE (Sstructure), approximately 1.5-2.0 times larger than those in the absence of the phase transition. We provide critical insights that both enhancements in SE arising during the structural phase transition are not intrinsic phenomena.</description>

      <title>Mexican hat-like valence band dispersion and quantum confinement in rhombohedral ferroelectric alpha-In2Se3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) ferroelectric (FE) materials offer a large variety of electronic properties depending on chemical composition, number of layers and stacking-order. Among them, alpha-In2Se3 has attracted much attention due to the promise of outstanding electronic properties, attractive quantum physics, in- and out-of-plane ferroelectricity and high photo-response. Precise experimental determination of the electronic structure of rhombohedral (3R) alpha-In2Se3 is needed for a better understanding of potential properties and device applications. Here, combining angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we demonstrate that 3R alpha-In2Se3 phase exhibits a robust inversion of the valence band parabolicity at the Gamma point forming a bow-shaped dispersion with a depth of 140 +- 10 meV between the valence band maximum (VBM) along the GammaK direction of the Brillouin zone (BZ). Moreover, we unveil an indirect band gap of about 1.25 eV, as well as a highly electron doping of approximatively 5.1012 electrons per cmsquare at the surface. This leads to surface band bending and the formation of a prominent electron accumulation layer. These findings allow a deeper understanding of the rhombohedral alpha-In2Se3 electronic properties underlying the potential of III/VI semiconductors for electronic and photonic technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ferroelectric thin films under epitaxial strain exhibit a variety of vortex-like topological polarization textures. To analyze them, we build on the Ginzburg-Landau-Devonshire framework and extend the previously introduced soft-domain approach. This formulation provides a compact variational theoretical description of polarization morphologies in strained PbTiO$_3$ films. It yields phase diagrams as a function of temperature, strain, and thickness, and clarifies the morphological structure of emergent topological states. The method is computationally efficient and offers practical guidance for experimental studies of ferroelectric nanostructures.</description>

      <title>Non-linear jog-dragging effect on the mobility law of edge dislocations in face-centered cubic nickel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dislocation jogs have strong effects on dislocation motion that governs the strain-hardening behavior of crystalline solids, but how to properly account for their effect in mesoscale models remains poorly understood. We develop a mobility model for jogged edge dislocations in FCC nickel, based on systematic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations across a range of jog configurations, stresses, and temperatures. At low stresses, jogged edge dislocations exhibit non-linear, thermally activated dragging and a higher Peierls barrier compared to straight dislocations. Surprisingly, stress-velocity curves for a given jog configuration across varying temperatures intersect at an invariant point ($\tau_{\rm c}$, $v_{\rm c}$), where $\tau_{\rm c}$ delineates thermally-activated and phonon-drag regimes and is close to the Peierls stress ($\tau_{\rm p}$). Motivated by this observation, we propose a simple three-section expression for jogged dislocation mobility, featuring minimal and physically interpretable parameters. This mobility law offers a realistic description of jog effects for dislocation dynamics (DD) simulations, improving their physical fidelity for crystal plasticity predictions.</description>

      <title>Sub-nanosecond structural dynamics of the martensitic transformation in Ni-Mn-Ga</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Martensitic transformations drive a multitude of emerging applications, which range from high stroke actuation and, mechanocaloric refrigeration, to thermoelastic energy harvesting. All these applications benefit from faster transformations, as a high cycle frequency is essential for achieving high power density. However, systematic investigations of the fast dynamics and fundamental speed limits of martensitic transformations are scarce. Especially for ultrashort time transformations, the temperature evolution throughout the transformation is not measured, which is a substantial shortcoming as temperature is the intrinsic force driving the transformation. Here, we present a synchrotron-based time-resolved X-ray diffraction study of a 270 fs laser-induced martensitic transformation in a Ni-Mn-Ga-based epitaxial thin film. We observe the transformation from martensite to austenite within about 100 ps, just limited by the synchrotron probe pulse duration. Furthermore, a full transformation cycle from martensite to austenite and back to martensite can almost be finished within 5 ns, which is the fastest martensitic transformation reported so far. Measurements and calculations of the temperature evolution allow us to analyse the influence of temperature on transformation time. By time-resolved strain measurements we demonstrate that in addition to temperature, thermal film stress must be considered as a competing influence on the martensitic transformation. Our experimental findings are supported by molecular dynamics simulations with machine learned force fields adapted to density functional theory calculations. These reveal that the huge distortion during a martensitic transformation requires the collective movement of many atoms within the microstructure, which delays the transformation.</description>

      <title>200 keV energy electron irradiation of single crystal diamond: Quantification of vacancy and nitrogen-vacancy production</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electron irradiation and annealing treatments are a method of colour centre/defect creation in diamond. The depth profile of defects created by low energy 200 keV electrons in single crystal high purity (type II) electronic grade diamond grown via chemical vapour deposition has been investigated. The depth profile of monovacancies created was found, using photoluminescence (PL), to decay exponentially, with decay length $12\pm1$ $\mu$m and production rate of $(1.1\pm0.2)\times 10 ^{-1}$ V/e$^{-}$/cm at the surface. The depth distribution of the neutral and negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV$^{0/-}$) centre, and the 733 nm zero phonon line defect formed during an isochronal annealing study have also been investigated by PL. The observed NV profiles, which do not match the vacancy profiles, can be qualitatively explained in terms of a simple model that includes the formation of vacancy clusters and the nitrogen-divacancy (NV$_{2}$) defect. The production of (NV$^{0/-}$) has been assumed to be nitrogen limited, but this paper has shown that this is not the case, with NVs lost to the production of NV$_{2}$ when the concentration of vacancies greatly exceeds that of substitutional nitrogen.</description>

      <title>GPUTB: Efficient Machine Learning Tight-Binding Method for Large-Scale Electronic Properties Calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The high computational cost of ab-initio methods limits their application in predicting electronic properties at the device scale. Therefore, an efficient method is needed to map the atomic structure to the electronic structure quickly. Here, we develop GPUTB, a GPU-accelerated tight-binding (TB) machine learning framework. GPUTB employs atomic environment descriptors, enabling the model parameters to incorporate environmental dependence. This allows the model to transfer to different basis, xc-functionals, and allotropes easily. Combined with the linear scaling quantum transport method, we have calculated the electronic density of states for up to 100 million atoms in pristine graphene. Trained on finite-temperature structures, the model can be easily extended to millions of atom finite-temperature systems. Furthermore, GPUTB can also successfully describe h-BN/graphene heterojunction systems, demonstrating its capability to handle complex material with high precision. We accurately reproduce the relationship between carrier concentration and room temperature mobility in graphene to verify the framework's accuracy. Therefore, our GPUTB framework presents a delicate balance between computational accuracy and efficiency, providing a powerful computational tool for investing electronic properties for large systems with millions of atoms.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocal magnons in layered antiferromagnets VPX3(X =S,Se,Te)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonreciprocal magnons, characterized by propagation with differing energies along the k and -k directions, are crucial for modern spintronics applications. However, their realization in van der Waals layered antiferromagnets remains elusive. In this letter, we report robust nonreciprocal magnon behavior in layered honeycomb antiferromagnets VPX3(X =S,Se,Te). Our results demonstrate that, in addition to their intrinsic Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI), the nonreciprocity of magnons is strongly influenced by the layer number, interlayer coupling, and magnon-magnon interactions. More importantly, in such layered antiferromagnets, the magnon nonreciprocity exhibits an asymmetric periodic dependence on the Neel vector, offering a novel route for experimentally probing antiferromagnetic order parameters in the 2D limit.</description>

      <title>Exciton Formation in Two-Dimensional Semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The optical properties of atomically thin semiconductors are dominated by excitons, tightly bound electron-hole pairs, which give rise to particularly rich and remarkable physics. Despite their importance, the microscopic formation mechanisms of excitons remain very poorly understood due to the complex interplay of concurrent phenomena occurring on an ultrafast timescale. Here, we investigate the exciton formation processes in 2D materials based on transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) monolayers using a technique based on the control of excitation light polarization. It allows us to distinguish between the two competing models of exciton formation: geminate and bimolecular formation. The geminate process is the direct formation of the exciton from the initially photogenerated electron hole pair before the loss of correlation between them, whereas the bimolecular process corresponds to the random binding of free electron hole-pairs from the initially photogenerated plasma. These processes control the exciton formation time. Our findings reveal that the luminescence intensity is higher by up to 40% for circularly polarized excitation compared to linearly polarized excitation for laser energy above the free carrier gap. We show that this spin-dependent exciton emission is a fingerprint of the bimolecular formation process. Importantly, we observe that exciton linear polarization (valley coherence) persists even for laser excitation energies exceeding the gap. We demonstrate that it is the result of a fraction of excitons formed by a geminate process. This shows that two formation processes coexist for excitation energies above the gap, where both mechanisms operate concurrently.</description>

      <title>Interlayer Coupling and Exciton Dynamics in 2D Hybrid Structures based on an InGaN Quantum Well coupled to a MoSe2 Monolayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hybrid structures incorpora1ng both III-nitride and Transi1on Metal Dichalcogenide (TMD) semiconductors have strong applica1on poten1al for light harves1ng and optoelectronics. Here we have inves1gated the proper1es of hybrid structures based on a MoSe2 monolayer coupled to an InGaN quantum well (QW). The coupling efficiency is controlled by a thin GaN barrier of variable thickness located between them. Time-integrated and 1me-resolved micro-photoluminescence experiments show a quenching of the InGaN QW exciton emission which increases with the decrease of the GaN barrier thickness d: the PL intensity is reduced by a factor 3 for d=1 nm as a consequence of carrier transfer to the MoSe2 monolayer. This interplay between the two semiconductors is confirmed by 1meresolved photoluminescence spectroscopy highligh1ng a clear reduc1on of the QW exciton life1me in the presence of the monolayer. Interes1ngly the coupling between the QW and the TMD monolayer is also demonstrated by measuring op1cally the excitonic transport proper1es in the quantum well: the exciton diffusion length decreases in the presence of the MoSe2 monolayer. The measured dependences as a func1on of temperature highlight the role played by localiza1on effects in the QW. All these results can be well interpreted by a type II band alignment between the InGaN QW and the MoSe2 monolayer and a tunneling process between the two semiconductors.</description>

      <title>Silicon-Compatible Ionic Control over Multi-State Magnetoelectric Phase Transformations in Correlated Oxide System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Realizing room-temperature ferromagnetic insulators, critical enablers for low-power spintronics, is fundamentally challenged by the long-standing trade-off between ferromagnetic ordering and indirect exchange interactions in insulators. Ionic evolution offers tempting opportunities for accessing exotic magnetoelectric states and physical functionality beyond conventional doping paradigm via tailoring the charge-lattice-orbital-spin interactions. Here, we showcase the precise magneto-ionic control over magnetoelectric states in LSMO system, delicately delivering silicon-compatible weakly ferromagnetic insulator state above room temperature. Of particular note is the decoupling of ion-charge-spin interplay in correlated LSMO system, a primary obstacle in clarifying underlying physical origin, with this process concurrently giving rise to an emergent intermediate state characterized by a weakly ferromagnetic half-metallic state. Benefiting from the SrTiO3 buffer layer as epitaxial template to promote interfacial heterogeneous nucleation, hydrogenation enables diverse magnetoelectric states in LSMO integrated on silicon, fully compatible with traditional semiconductor processing. Assisted by theoretical calculations and spectroscopic techniques, hydrogen-induced magnetoelectric transitions in LSMO are driven by band-filling control and suppression in double exchange interaction. Our work not only defines a novel design paradigm for exploring exotic quantum states in correlated system, with transformative potential for spintronics, but also fundamentally unveils the physical origin behind ionic evolution via disentangling the ion-charge-spin coupling.</description>

      <title>Towards Accurate and Scalable High-throughput MOF Adsorption Screening: Merging Classical Force Fields and Universal Machine Learned Interatomic Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-throughput computational screening (HTCS) of gas adsorption in metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) typically relies on classical generic force fields such as the Universal Force Field (UFF), which are efficient but often fail to capture complex host-guest interactions. Universal machine-learned interatomic potentials (u-MLIPs) offer near-quantum accuracy at far lower cost than density functional theory (DFT), yet their large-scale application in adsorption screening remains limited. Here, we present a hybrid screening strategy that merges Widom insertion Monte Carlo simulations performed with both UFF and the PreFerred Potential (PFP) u-MLIP to evaluate the adsorption performance of a large MOF database, using ethylene capture under humid conditions as a benchmark. From a curated set of MOFs, 88 promising candidates initially identified using UFF-based HTCS were re-evaluated with the PFP u-MLIP, benchmarked against DFT calculations to refine adsorption predictions and assess the role of framework flexibility. We show that PFP u-MLIP is essential to accurately assess the sorption performance of MOFs involving strong hydrogen bonding or confinement pockets within narrow pores, effects poorly captured using UFF. Notably, accounting for framework flexibility through full unit cell relaxation revealed deviations in ethylene affinity of up to 20 kJ mol-1, underscoring the impact of guest-induced structural changes. This HTCS workflow identified seven MOFs with optimal pore sizes, high ethylene affinity, and high C2H4/H2O selectivity, offering moisture-tolerant performance for applications from food packaging to trace ethylene removal. Our findings highlight the importance of accurately capturing host-guest energetics and framework flexibility, and demonstrate the practicality of incorporating u-MLIPs into scalable HTCS for identifying top MOF sorbents.</description>

      <title>Altermagnetic Proximity Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Proximity effects not only complement the conventional methods of designing materials, but also enable realizing properties that are not present in any constituent region of the considered heterostructure. Here we reveal an unexplored altermagnetic proximity effect (AMPE), distinct from its ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic counterparts. Using first-principles and model analyses of van der Waals heterostructures based on the prototypical altermagnet V$_2$Se$_2$O, we show that its hallmark momentum-alternating spin splitting can be directly imprinted onto adjacent nonmagnetic layers -- a process we term altermagnetization. This is demonstrated in a monolayer PbO through characteristic band splitting and real-space spin densities, with systematic dependence on interlayer spacing and magnetic configuration. We further predict broader AMPE manifestations: Valley-selective spin splitting in a monolayer PbS and a topological superconducting phase in monolayer NbSe$_2$, both inheriting the alternating $k$-space spin texture of the altermagnet. These results establish AMPE not only as a distinct proximity mechanism, but also as a powerful method of using altermagnetism in designing emergent phenomena and versatile applications.</description>

      <title>Spin-dependent transport in Fe${_3}$GaTe${_2}$ and Fe${_n}$GeTe${_2}$ ($n$=3-5) van der Waals ferromagnets for magnetic tunnel junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic first-principles investigation of linear-response spin-dependent quantum transport in the van der Waals ferromagnets Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$, Fe$_4$GeTe$_2$, Fe$_5$GeTe$_2$, and Fe$_3$GaTe$_2$. Using density functional theory combined with the non-equilibrium Green's function formalism, we compute their Fermi surfaces, transmission coefficients, and orbital-projected density of states. All compounds exhibit nearly half-metallic conductance along the out-of-plane direction. This is characterized by a finite transmission coefficient for one spin channel and a gap in the other, resulting in spin polarization values exceeding 90$\%$ in the bulk. Notably, Fe$_3$GaTe$_2$ displays the ideal half-metallic behavior, with the Fermi energy located deep in the spin-down transmission gap. We further show that this high spin polarization is preserved in bilayer magnetic tunnel junctions, which exhibit a large tunnel magnetoresistance of the order of several hundred percent. This findings underscore the promise of these materials, and in particular of Fe$_3$GaTe$_2$, for spintronics applications.</description>

      <title>Wetting Interactions Between Porous Carbon Hosts and Liquid Sodium-Potassium Alloys Toward Their Use in Negative Electrodes of Alkali-Metal Batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Batteries with liquid alkali-metal negative electrodes offer a route to compact, high-performance energy storage. Innovation in alkali-metal management, i.e., controlled storage, release and transport of liquid alkali metal, can enable simpler and cheaper cell designs. Porous carbons have emerged as potential host materials for liquid alkali metals. Here, we study the wetting interactions between porous carbon hosts and liquid sodium-potassium alloy (NaK) as a function of carbon host morphology and surface functionalization via X-ray computed tomography. While as-received carbon samples show no affinity towards NaK, heat-treated carbon is spontaneously infiltrated with NaK filling almost the entire pore volume. We explore how forced wetting partially fills pores of NaK-repellent hosts, showing large differences in pore filling based on the average pore size of the host material. In electrochemical discharge experiments, we show that both as-received and heat-treated carbon felt enable high areal capacities beyond 40 mAh cm-2. However, the heat-treated carbon shows ten times lower overpotential. Finally, we demonstrate how heat-treated carbon felt can enable capillary transport of NaK. In summary, this study elucidates important aspects of the interactions between liquid alkali metals and porous carbon hosts, generating insights into possible applications in liquid alkali-metal batteries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting the chemical resistance of polymers to organic solvents is a longstanding challenge in materials science, with significant implications for sustainable materials design and industrial applications. Here, we address the need for interpretable and generalizable frameworks to understand and predict polymer chemical resistance beyond conventional solubility models. We systematically analyze a large dataset of polymer solvent combinations using a data-driven approach. Our study reveals that polymer crystallinity and density, as well as solvent polarity, are key factors governing chemical resistance, and that these trends are consistent with established theoretical models. These findings provide a foundation for rational screening and design of polymer materials with tailored chemical resistance, advancing both fundamental understanding and practical applications.</description>

      <title>Critical Iridium Demands arising from future Expansion of Proton Exchange Membrane Electrolysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Proton exchange membrane electrolysis (PEMEL) is a key technology for producing green hydrogen, but its scalability is limited by the use of scarce materials, particularly iridium. Iridium oxide, the preferred anode catalyst in PEMEL, offers exceptional stability but is produced only as a by-product of platinum mining, with annual output around 7.5 tons. This study estimates future iridium demand for PEMEL under various deployment scenarios and technological advances. Results show that meeting net zero targets will require both significant improvements in catalyst efficiency and access to roughly 30\% of global iridium production annually. Supply shortages could arise as early as 2030, earlier than previously anticipated. The analysis also reveals that long-term iridium needs beyond 2040 are significantly underestimated. These findings underscore the urgent need for innovation in material efficiency and recycling, and the importance of integrating resource constraints into energy policy and technology planning to ensure a sustainable hydrogen transition.</description>

      <title>SasAgent: Multi-Agent AI System for Small-Angle Scattering Data Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce SasAgent, a multi-agent AI system powered by large language models (LLMs) that automates small-angle scattering (SAS) data analysis by leveraging tools from the SasView software and enables user interaction via text input. SasAgent features a coordinator agent that interprets user prompts and delegates tasks to three specialized agents for scattering length density (SLD) calculation, synthetic data generation, and experimental data fitting. These agents utilize LLM-friendly tools to execute tasks efficiently. These tools, including the model data tool, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) documentation tool, bump fitting tool, and SLD calculator tool, are derived from the SasView Python library. A user-friendly Gradio-based interface enhances user accessibility. Through diverse examples, we demonstrate SasAgent's ability to interpret complex prompts, calculate SLDs, generate accurate scattering data, and fit experimental datasets with high precision. This work showcases the potential of LLM-driven AI systems to streamline scientific workflows and enhance automation in SAS research.</description>

      <title>Metamaterials and Fluid Flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding and controlling the dynamic interactions between fluid flows and solid materials and structures-a field known as fluid-structure interaction -is central not only to established disciplines such as aerospace and naval engineering but also to emerging technologies such as energy harvesting, soft robotics, and biomedical devices. In recent years, the advent of metamaterials-rationally designed composites with properties beyond their constituents, often not found in conventional materials-has provided exciting opportunities for rethinking and redesigning fluid-structure interaction. The premise of engineering the internal structure of materials interfacing with fluid flows is opening a new horizon for precise and effective manipulation and control of coupled fluidic, acoustic, and elastodynamics responses. This review focuses on this relatively unexplored interdisciplinary theme with broad real-world technological significance. Key performance metrics, such as fuel consumption of transport systems, efficiency of renewable energy extraction, mitigation of noise emissions, and resilience to structural fatigue, depend on the control of interactions between flow, acoustic, and vibration mechanisms. Flow control, for example, which spans a wealth of regimes such as laminar, transitional, turbulent, and unsteady separated flows, is highly influenced by the ability to tailor fluid-structure interaction behavior. We survey and discuss theoretical frameworks that describe the interplay between fluids and elastic solids, with a focus on contemporary work and emerging concepts. The paper is organised into three main sections-flow-structure interactions, acoustic-structure interactions, and exotic metamaterial concepts with potential impact on fluid-structure interaction-and concludes with perspectives on current challenges and future directions in this rapidly expanding area of research.</description>

      <title>Room Temperature Single Photon Detection at 1550 nm using van der Waals Heterojunction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single-photon detectors (SPDs) are crucial in applications ranging from space, biological imaging to quantum communication and information processing. The SPDs that operate at room temperature are of particular interest to broader application space as the energy overhead introduced by the cryogenic cooling can be avoided. Although silicon-based single photon avalanche diodes (SPADs) are well matured and operate at room temperature, the bandgap limitation restricts their operation at telecommunication wavelength (1550 nm) and beyond. InGaAs-based SPADs, on the other hand, are sensitive to 1550 nm photons, but suffer from relatively lower efficiency, high dark count rate, afterpulsing probability, and pose hazards to the environment from the fabrication process. In this work, we demonstrate how we can leverage the properties of nanomaterials to address these challenges and realise a room temperature single-photon detector capable of operating at 1550 nm. We achieve this by coupling a low bandgap ($\sim 350~meV$) absorber (black phosphorus) to a sensitive van der Waals probe that is capable of detecting discrete electron fluctuation. We optimize the device for operation at $1550~nm$ and demonstrate an overall quantum efficiency of $21.4\%$ (estimated as $42.8\%$ for polarized light), and a minimum dark count of $\sim 720~Hz$ at room temperature.</description>

      <title>Stockmayer Fluid with a Shifted Dipole: Interfacial Behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the properties of the liquid-vapor interface in the shifted Stockmayer fluid using molecular dynamics simulations in the canonical ensemble. We study the role of the dipole moment strength and the degree of asymmmetry on equilibrium interfacial characteristics, including density profiles, polar order, nematic order, interfacial polarization, electric field, and electrostatic potential. In addition, we compute angular distribution functions across the interface to gain insight into how the dipole shift affects the molecular orientation. We find that the shift significantly effects angular distribution functions by altering the polar order while leaving the nematic order relatively unaffected, in comparison to the reference symmetric Stockmayer fluid. We find that these results are consistently explained using an image-dipole construction that has been previously applied to symmetric Stockmayer fluids but has never been extended to the shifted model. We find remarkable agreement between the simple theory and the simulations in the qualitative shape of the distribution functions for both the liquid and vapor phases in proximity to the interface. Unexpectedly, the spontaneous polarization at the interface, and therefore the generated electric field, changes sign as the dipole moment strength increases. This also leads to an inversion of the sign of the potential difference across the interface.</description>

      <title>Quantization of spin circular photogalvanic effect in altermagnetic Weyl semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically predict a spin-current analog of the quantized circular photogalvanic effect in Weyl semimetals. This phenomenon is forbidden in antiferromagnets by symmetry but uniquely allowed in altermagnets, highlighting a novel and intrinsic characteristic of altermagnetism. To systematically explore second-order spin current responses, we classify all symmetry-allowed responses based on spin point groups. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive classification of altermagnetic Weyl semimetals by identifying spin space groups that host symmetry-enforced Weyl points. Utilizing this classification, we construct a symmetry-guided tight-binding model and confirm our predictions. Finally, we identify Weyl crossings in a material candidate via first-principle calculations. Our work unveils a distinctive optical response of altermagnets, paving the way for a new frontier in altermagnetism.</description>

      <title>Giant Splitting of Folded Dirac Bands in Kekul\'{e}-ordered Graphene with Eu Intercalation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kekul\'{e}-ordered graphene on SiC realized by intercalating two-dimensional metal layers offers a versatile platform for exploring intriguing quantum states and phenomena. Here, we achieve the intercalation of $(\mathrm{\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}})\mathit{R}30^\circ$-ordered Eu layer between epitaxial graphene and SiC substrate, realizing a Kekul\'{e} graphene with large local magnetic moments of intercalated Eu atoms. Combining angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we revealed that the Kekul{\'{e}} order folds the Dirac cones of graphene from the corners to the Brillouin zone center via intervalley scattering, forming the replica Dirac bands with gap opening. More intriguingly, the Dirac fermions in the replica Dirac bands show a strong exchange coupling with the localized magnetic moments of Eu $4f$ orbitals, resulting in a giant splitting of the folded Dirac bands. The observation of strong coupling between Dirac fermions and local magnetic moments of Eu $4f$ electrons via Kekul\'{e} order pave a new way for generating Dirac band splitting in graphene, advancing the potential applications of Kekul\'{e}-ordered graphene in spintronics, as well as exploring intriguing physical properties and correlation states for quantum technology.</description>

      <title>Packing, Phase Separation and Interface Compatibility in Reversibly Crosslinked Polymers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vitrimers are a class of crosslinked polymer that are capable of undergoing bond exchange reactions, allowing structural reorganization while maintaining overall network integrity. Two key features that are particularly relevant when this vitrimer concept is used to compatibilize immiscible polymer blends are how they affect the (i) bulk polymer density and (ii) interfacial activity of the crosslink groups. To probe these issues, we model both a bulk polymer melt and a thin film of a polymer melt both with explicit small molecular crosslinkers, in the associative limit, i.e., when the number of crosslinks are fixed. We show that the bulk density and the distribution of stickers within a polymer matrix is strongly influenced by their size and interactions with the base polymer. Specifically, when the crosslinkers are chemically compatible with the base polymer, then the overall packing fraction increases, regardless of crosslinker size, while it decreases when crosslinkers are incompatible with the polymers. Similarly, the crosslinkers segregate preferentially to the polymer-air interface when they are incompatible with the polymer chains, leading to a reduction interfacial tension. Thus, these incompatible crosslinkers should help in affecting both the miscibility of polymer blends, and also their compatibility by creating copolymer structures at the interface. These results demonstrate the key role of crosslinker-polymer interactions and crosslinker size on the structural and interfacial properties of vitrimer melts.</description>

      <title>High-Quality Tomographic Image Reconstruction Integrating Neural Networks and Mathematical Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we develop a novel technique for reconstructing images from projection-based nano- and microtomography. Our contribution focuses on enhancing reconstruction quality, particularly for specimen composed of homogeneous material phases connected by sharp edges. This is accomplished by training a neural network to identify edges within subpictures. The trained network is then integrated into a mathematical optimization model, to reduce artifacts from previous reconstructions. To this end, the optimization approach favors solutions according to the learned predictions, however may also determine alternative solutions if these are strongly supported by the raw data. Hence, our technique successfully incorporates knowledge about the homogeneity and presence of sharp edges in the sample and thereby eliminates blurriness. Our results on experimental datasets show significant enhancements in interface sharpness and material homogeneity compared to benchmark algorithms. Thus, our technique produces high-quality reconstructions, showcasing its potential for advancing tomographic imaging techniques.</description>

      <title>Language Native Lightly Structured Databases for Large Language Model Driven Composite Materials Research</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chemical and materials research has traditionally relied heavily on knowledge narrative, with progress often driven by language-based descriptions of principles, mechanisms, and experimental experiences, rather than tables, limiting what conventional databases and ML can exploit. We present a language-native database for boron nitride nanosheet (BNNS) polymer thermally conductive composites that captures lightly structured information from papers across preparation, characterization, theory-computation, and mechanistic reasoning, with evidence-linked snippets. Records are organized in a heterogeneous database and queried via composite retrieval with semantics, key words and value filters. The system can synthesizes literature into accurate, verifiable, and expert style guidance. This substrate enables high fidelity efficient Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and tool augmented agents to interleave retrieval with reasoning and deliver actionable SOP. The framework supplies the language rich foundation required for LLM-driven materials discovery.</description>

      <title>An Approach to the Quantum Hall Effect in Three- Dimensional Electron Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a theoretical framework to describe the integer quantum Hall effect (IQHE) in three-dimensional (3D) electron systems. This extends our previous single-electron approach, which was successfully applied to two-dimensional (2D) systems such as semiconductor quantum wells and graphene, where insights provided into both the IQHE and the fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE). Starting from the graphene model, where the unconventional sequence of Hall plateaux, 2(2n+1), naturally emerges from Landau quantization, we generalize the formulation to 3D semimetals with low carrier density and high mobility, where recent experiments have reported signatures of the QHE. For 3D systems, the model accounts for strong band anisotropy by introducing an effective correction to the cyclotron frequency, and, also by considering large effective gyromagnetic factor, as observed in semimetallic materials. From the calculated density of states and carrier concentration, we derive semiclassical expressions for the diagonal and Hall conductivities. The resulting Hall conductivity exhibits quantized values in agreement with theoretical predictions and experimental observations of 3D quantum Hall states. Simulations reproduce both Hall plateaux and Shubnikov de Haas oscillations under realistic parameter sets. Our results demonstrate that the IQHE in 3D semimetals can be understood as a natural extension of the single-electron Landau quantization framework originally developed for 2D systems. This provides a unified picture of quantum magnetotransport across dimensions, highlighting the crucial role of low carrier density and high mobility. The model further suggests new avenues for analyzing thermodynamic and transport properties in 3D systems under quantum Hall conditions.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-enforced Moir\'e Topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological flat bands in two-dimensional (2D) moir\'e materials have emerged as promising platforms for exploring the interplay between topology and correlation effects. However, realistic calculations of moir\'e band topology using density functional theory (DFT) are computationally inefficient due to the large number of atoms in a single moir\'e unit cell. In this work, we propose a systematic scheme to predict the topology of moir\'e bands from atomic symmetry data and moir\'e symmetry group, both of which can be efficiently extracted from DFT. Specifically, for $\Gamma$-valley electron gases, we find that certain combinations of atomic symmetry data and moir\'e symmetry groups can enforce nontrivial band topology in the low-energy moir\'e bands, as long as the moir\'e band gap is smaller than the atomic band splitting at the moir\'e Brillouin zone boundary. This symmetry-enforced nontrivial moir\'e topology, including both topological insulators and topological semimetals, is robust against various material-specific details such as the precise form and strength of the moir\'e potential or the exact twist angle. By exhaustively scanning all 2D atomic symmetry data and moir\'e symmetry groups, we identify 197 combinations that can yield symmetry-enforced nontrivial moir\'e topology, and we verify one such combination using a moir\'e model with cubic Rashba spin-orbit coupling. Our approach is generalizable to other valleys and provides a useful guideline for experimental efforts to discover and design new topologically nontrivial moir\'e materials.</description>

      <title>Neutron Reflectometry by Gradient Descent</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutron reflectometry (NR) is a powerful technique to probe surfaces and interfaces. NR is inherently an indirect measurement technique, access to the physical quantities of interest (layer thickness, scattering length density, roughness), necessitate the solution of an inverse modelling problem, that is inefficient for large amounts of data or complex multiplayer structures (e.g. lithium batteries / electrodes). Recently, surrogate machine learning models have been proposed as an alternative to existing optimisation routines. Although such approaches have been successful, physical intuition is lost when replacing governing equations with fast neural networks. Instead, we propose a novel and efficient approach; to optimise reflectivity data analysis by performing gradient descent on the forward reflection model itself. Herein, automatic differentiation techniques are used to evaluate exact gradients of the error function with respect to the parameters of interest. Access to these quantities enables users of neutron reflectometry to harness a host of powerful modern optimisation and inference techniques that remain thus far unexploited in the context of neutron reflectometry. This paper presents two benchmark case studies; demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on a thick oxide quartz film, and robust co-fitting performance in the high complexity regime of organic LED multilayer devices. Additionally, we provide an open-source library of differentiable reflectometry kernels in the python programming language so that gradient based approaches can readily be applied to other NR datasets.</description>

Abstract: Intercalated van der Waals (vdW) magnetic materials host unique magnetic properties due to the interplay of competing interlayer and intralayer exchange couplings, which depend on the intercalant concentration within the van der Waals gaps. Magnetic vdW compound chromium telluride, Cr$_{1+x}$Te$_2$, has demonstrated rich magnetic phases at various Cr concentrations, such as the coexistence of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic phases in Cr$_{1.25}$Te$_2$ (equivalently, Cr$_{5}$Te$_8$). The compound is induced by intercalating 0.25 Cr atom per unit cell within the van der Waals gaps of CrTe$_2$. In this work, we report a notably increased Curie Temperature and an emergent in-plane spin fluctuation by slightly reducing the concentration of Cr intercalants in Cr$_{1.25}$Te$_2$. Moreover, the intercalated Cr atoms form a metastable 2$\times$2 supercell structure that can be manipulated by electron beam irradiation. This work offers a promising approach to tuning magnetic and structural properties by adjusting the concentration of intercalated magnetic atoms.</description>

      <title>Theory meets experiment: insights into structure and magnetic properties of Fe$_{1-x}$Ni$_{x}$B alloy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19029v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We studied the structural and magnetic properties of the solid solution Fe$_{1-x}$Ni$_{x}$B through theoretical and experimental approaches. Powder X-ray diffraction, X-ray Pair Distribution Function analysis, and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy reveal that the Fe$_{1-x}$Ni$_{x}$B solid solution crystallizes in the $\beta$-FeB structure type up to x = 0.6-0.7 and exhibits anisotropic unit cell volume contraction with increasing Ni concentration. Magnetic measurements showed a transition from ferromagnetism to paramagnetism around x = 0.7. For x = 0.5, the low (&lt; 0.3 $\mu_{B}$) magnetic moments suggest itinerant magnetism despite the relatively high Curie temperature (up to 225 K). Theoretical calculations indicated different types of magnetic orderings depending on the Fe/Ni atomic order, with the antiferromagnetic state being stable for ordered FeNiB$_{2}$, whereas the ground state is ferromagnetic for the disordered alloy. Calculations also predicted the coexistence of low- and high-spin states in Fe atoms around the composition with x=0.5, in line with the experimental evidence from $^{57}$Fe M\"ossbauer spectroscopy. The two magnetically distinct Fe sites for x = 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5 observed by $^{57}$Fe M\"ossbauer spectroscopy can also be interpreted as two magnetically different regions or clusters that could affect the critical behavior near a quantum magnetic transition based on a potential ferromagnetic quantum critical point identified computationally and experimentally near x=0.64. This work highlights the complex interplay between structure and magnetism in Fe$_{1-x}$Ni$_{x}$B alloys, suggesting areas for future research on quantum critical behavior.</description>

      <title>Mechanical Amorphization of Glass-Forming Systems Induced by Oscillatory Deformation: The Energy Absorption and Efficiency Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07798v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The kinetic process of mechanical amorphization plays a central role in tailoring material properties. Therefore, a quantitative understanding of how this process depends on loading parameters is critical for optimizing mechanical amorphization and tuning material performance. In this study, we employ molecular dynamics simulations to investigate oscillatory deformation-induced amorphization in three glass-forming intermetallic systems, addressing two unresolved challenges: (1) the relationship between amorphization efficiency and mechanical loading, and (2) energy absorption dynamics during crystal-to-amorphous (CTA) transitions. Our results demonstrate a decoupling between amorphization efficiency--governed by work rate and described by an effective temperature model--and energy absorption, which adheres to the Herschel-Bulkley constitutive relation. Crucially, the melting enthalpy emerges as a key determinant of the energy barrier, establishing a thermodynamic analogy between mechanical amorphization and thermally induced melting. This relationship provides a universally applicable metric to quantify amorphization kinetics. By unifying material properties and loading conditions, this work establishes a predictive framework for controlling amorphization processes. These findings advance the fundamental understanding of deformation-driven phase transitions and offer practical guidelines for designing materials with tailored properties for ultrafast fabrication, ball milling, and advanced mechanical processing techniques.</description>

Abstract: Unconditional crystal structure generation with diffusion models faces challenges in identifying symmetric crystals as the unit cell size increases. We present the Crystal Host-Guided Generation (CHGGen) framework to address this challenge through conditional generation using an inpainting method, which optimizes a fraction of atomic positions within a predefined and symmetrized host structure to improve the success rate for symmetric structure generation. By integrating inpainting structure generation with a foundation potential for structure optimization, we demonstrate the method on the ZnS-P$_2$S$_5$ and Li-Si chemical systems, where the inpainting method generates a higher fraction of symmetric structures than unconditional generation. The practical significance of CHGGen extends to enabling the structural modification of crystal structures, particularly for systems with partial occupancy or intercalation chemistry. The inpainting method also allows for seamless integration with other generative models, providing a versatile framework for accelerating materials discovery.</description>

      <title>Accelerating point defect photo-emission calculations with machine learning interatomic potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01403v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a computational framework leveraging universal machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) to dramatically accelerate the calculation of photoluminescence (PL) spectra of atomic or molecular emitters with ab initio accuracy. By replacing the costly density functional theory (DFT) computation of phonon modes with much faster MLIP phonon mode calculations, our approach achieves speed improvements exceeding an order of magnitude with minimal precision loss. We benchmark the approach using a dataset comprising ab initio emission spectra of 791 color centers spanning various types of crystal point defects in different charge and magnetic states. The method is also applied to a molecular emitter adsorbed on a hexagonal boron nitride surface. Across all the systems, we find excellent agreement for both the Huang-Rhys factor and the PL lineshapes. This application of universal MLIPs bridges the gap between computational efficiency and spectroscopic fidelity, opening pathways to high-throughput screening of defect-engineered materials. Our work not only demonstrates accelerated calculation of PL spectra with DFT accuracy, but also makes such calculations tractable for more complex materials.</description>

      <title>Early Stages of Self-Healing at Tungsten Grain Boundaries from Ab Initio Machine Learning Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13744v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nanostructured tungsten has been reported as a possible alternative plasma-facing material due to its potential ability to self-heal radiation-induced defects, a property that is attributed to its high density of grain boundaries (GB). Here, we study the initial stages of self-healing at tungsten interfaces with molecular dynamics simulations driven by a machine-learning interatomic potential tailored to one of the most common GBs found in experiments. Our model accurately reproduces the ab initio potential energy surface derived from density functional theory (DFT) calculations and outperforms previously reported empirical and machine learning interatomic potentials in predicting defect energetics. The simulations reveal low-temperature defect migration to GBs driven by rapid dumbbell-like ordering and subsequent accommodation along GB grooves. In contrast to empirical potentials, which predict unexpected GB degradation at high temperatures after defect migration, our model maintains stable GB motifs over the investigated temperature range. The temperature-dependent defect counts, evaluated using an Arrhenius-like fit, yield an average interstitial migration energy of 0.048 eV, in agreement with experiment.
  This work underscores the capabilities of ab initio machine learning simulations in accurately modeling defect-GB interactions and highlights their potential to contribute to the development of radiation tolerant materials.</description>

      <title>Tunability of the magnetic properties in Ni intercalated transition metal dichalcogenide NbSe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17916v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the magnetic and electronic properties of Ni-intercalated NbSe$_2$.We calculate the magnetic exchanges of Ni$_x$NbSe$_2$ ($x = 1/3, 1/4,$ and $1$) and find that the out-of-plane magnetic coupling depends on the Ni connectivity: it is ferromagnetic when Ni atoms stack on top of each other, and antiferromagnetic otherwise. Focusing on Ni$_{0.25}$NbSe$_2$, we identify a ground-state transition from a stripe antiferromagnetic phase with Kramers degeneracy to a ferromagnetic phase above a critical Coulomb interaction U$_C$. Spin--orbit coupling lowers U$_C$, aligns the easy axis along $z$, and stabilizes collinear AFM and FM states over the competing 120$^\circ$ phase. Ni intercalation also strongly modifies the electronic structure, replacing the $\Gamma$-point hole pocket of pristine NbSe$_2$ with an electron pocket and shifting the Van Hove singularity away from the Fermi level, thereby suppressing potential instabilities. Finally, we investigate the altermagnetic phase in the broader class T$_{0.25}$MX$_2$, finding that spin--orbit effects induce orbital antiferromagnetism with weak ferromagnetism or ferrimagnetism depending on the N\'eel vector orientation. Our results demonstrate that Ni-intercalated NbSe$_2$ provides a versatile platform to explore and tune multiple competing magnetic phases that lie close in energy.</description>

      <title>Direct determination of layer anomalous Hall conductivity using uniaxial Wannier functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01160v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a method for computing layer anomalous Hall conductivity (LAHC) in real space by integrating the Fukui-Hatsugai-Suzuki method with hybrid Wannier functions localized along a single axis. To validate the method, we calculated the LAHC of axion-insulating MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ and confirmed the agreement between the sum of LAHC on the surface and the surface AHC previously reported. We further applied the method to antiferromagnetic Mn$_2$Bi$_2$Te$_5$ and examined the dependence on the magnetic structure of LAHC, identifying cases with and without axion insulating behavior. This layer-resolved analysis offers a powerful tool for studying topological transport in complex materials, including heterostructures, and may guide the design of future devices based on the anomalous Hall effect with precise layer control.</description>

      <title>Emergent Multiferroic Altermagnets and Spin Control via Noncollinear Molecular Polarization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07039v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Altermagnets, with spin splitting and vanishing magnetization, have been attributed to many fascinating phenomena and potential applications. In particular, integrating ferroelectricity with altermagnetism to enable magnetoelectric coupling and electric control of spin has drawn significant attention. However, its experimental realization and precise spin manipulation remain elusive. Here, by focusing on molecular ferroelectrics, the first discovered ferroelectrics renowned for their highly controllable molecular polarizations and structural flexibility, we reveal that these obstacles can be removed by an emergent multiferroic altermagnets with tunable spin polarization in a large class of fabricated organic materials. Using a symmetry-based design and a tight-binding model, we uncover the underlying mechanism of such molecular ferroelectric altermagnets and demonstrate how noncollinear molecular polarization can switch the spin polarization on and off and even reverse its sign. From the first-principles calculations, we verify the feasibility of these materials in a series of well-established hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites and metal-organic frameworks. Our findings bridge molecular ferroelectrics and altermagnetic spintronics, highlighting an unexplored potential of multifunctional organic multiferroics.</description>

      <title>Nanoconfined Grain Boundaries Increase Conductivity of Polycrystalline Molecular Crystals</title>

Abstract: Soft-solid molecular crystals consist of crystalline grains and fluid grain boundaries (GB) that enhance the grain binding and transport of Li+ ions between the grains. The total ionic conductivity consists of ion migration in both the grains and GBs. To unravel these contributions in adiponitrile (Adpn)-LiPF6 molecular crystals, the GB volume fraction was varied by changing the size of the crystals and the adiponitrile-LiPF6 molar ratio. Molecular dynamic (MD) simulations indicate that ion motion was sub-diffusive in the grains and 'well-diffusive' in the GBs, with GBs characterized as disordered nano-confined regions of higher charge carrier concentration (~1M) than in saturated LiPF6-Adpn solutions (0.04M), and ions predominantly solvated by -CN groups with few contact ion pairs. The diffusivity in the GBs is at least an order of magnitude higher than in the crystalline grains. The emergent picture is the grains as a reservoir of ions that migrate to the faster-conducting GBs.</description>

      <title>Physically Interpretable Descriptors Drive the Materials Design of Metal Hydrides for Hydrogen Storage</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04039v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Designing metal hydrides for hydrogen storage remains a longstanding challenge due to the vast compositional space and complex structure-property relationships. Herein, for the first time, we present physically interpretable models for predicting two key performance metrics, gravimetric hydrogen density $w$ and equilibrium pressure $P_{\rm eq,RT}$ at room temperature, based on a minimal set of chemically meaningful descriptors. Using a rigorously curated dataset of $5,089$ metal hydride compositions from our recently developed Digital Hydrogen Platform (\it{DigHyd}) based on large-scale data mining from available experimental literature of solid-state hydrogen storage materials, we systematically constructed over $1.6$ million candidate models using combinations of scalar transformations and nonlinear link functions. The final closed-form models, derived from $2$-$3$ descriptors each, achieve predictive accuracies on par with state-of-the-art machine learning methods, while maintaining full physical transparency. Strikingly, descriptor-based design maps generated from these models reveal a fundamental trade-off between $w$ and $P_{\rm eq,RT}$: saline-type hydrides, composed of light electropositive elements, offer high $w$ but low $P_{\rm eq,RT}$, whereas interstitial-type hydrides based on heavier electronegative transition metals show the opposite trend. Notably, Be-based systems, such as Be-Na alloys, emerge as rare candidates that simultaneously satisfy both performance metrics, attributed to the unique combination of light mass and high molar density for Be. Our models indicate that Be-based systems may offer renewed prospects for approaching these benchmarks. These results provide chemically intuitive guidelines for materials design and establish a scalable framework for the rational discovery of materials in complex chemical spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10131v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Important advances have recently been made in the search for materials with complex multi-phase landscapes that host photoinduced metastable collective states with exotic functionalities. In almost all cases so far, the desired phases are accessed by exploiting light-matter interactions via the imaginary part of the dielectric function through above-bandgap or resonant mode excitation. Nonresonant Raman excitation of coherent modes has been experimentally observed and proposed for dynamic material control, but the resulting atomic excursion has been limited to perturbative levels. Here, this challenge is overcome by employing nonresonant ultrashort pulses with low photon energies well below the bandgap. Using mid-infrared pulses, ferroelectric reversal is induced in lithium niobate, and the large-amplitude mode displacements are characterized through femtosecond stimulated Raman scattering and second harmonic generation. This approach, validated by first-principle calculations, defines a novel method for synthesizing hidden phases with unique functional properties and manipulating complex energy landscapes at reduced energy consumption and ultrafast speeds.</description>

Abstract: Interface-induced superconductivity has recently been achieved by stacking a magnetic topological insulator layer on an antiferromagnetic FeTe layer. However, the mechanism driving this emergent superconductivity remains unclear. Here, we employ molecular beam epitaxy to grow a 1T-CrTe2 layer, a two-dimensional ferromagnet with a Curie temperature up to room temperature, on a FeTe layer. These 1T-CrTe2/FeTe heterostructures show superconductivity with a critical temperature of ~12 K. Through magnetic force microscopy measurements, we observe the Meissner effect on the surface of the 1T-CrTe2 layer. Our electrical transport measurements reveal that the 1T-CrTe2/FeTe heterostructures exhibit nonreciprocal charge transport behavior, characterized by a large magneto-chiral anisotropy coefficient. The enhanced nonreciprocal charge transport in 1T-CrTe2/FeTe heterostructures provides a promising platform for exploring the magnetically controllable superconducting diode effect.</description>

      <title>Exploring strong electronic correlations in the breathing kagome metal Fe$_3$Sn</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03039v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kagome metals have emerged as pivotal materials in condensed matter physics due to their unique geometric arrangement and intriguing electronic properties. Understanding the origin of magnetism in these materials, particularly in iron rich Fe-Sn binary compounds like Fe$_3$Sn, holds a significant importance, as they represent potential candidates for permanent magnets with a high Curie temperature and a strong magnetic anisotropy. In the present study, we employ density-functional theory and dynamical mean-field theory to analyze the electronic structure and magnetic properties of Fe$_3$Sn. Our investigation reveals the presence of several nearly-flat bands and Weyl nodes at low excitation energies. The inclusion of local correlation effects is shown to push these features even closer to the Fermi energy, which may be important for their manipulation via external stimuli. Regarding magnetism, the Hubbard-like interaction leads to an increase of orbital polarization at the expenses of a minor reduction of the spin moment. The magnetic anisotropy energy exhibits a strong dependence on the particular choice of the Coulomb interaction parameters. Additionally, our detailed analysis of the interatomic exchange interactions indicates a significant contribution from the antisymmetric exchange, i.e. the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, which showcases the existence of magnetic chirality in the system. Overall, our investigation highlights a strong interplay between the flat bands near the Fermi level, the local Coulomb interaction and the triangular geometry of the lattice, which plays a crucial role in driving the magnetic properties of this material.</description>

Abstract: Quantum spin liquids (QSLs) represent exotic states of matter where quantum spins interact strongly yet evade long-range magnetic order down to absolute zero. Characterized by non-local quantum entanglement and resultant fractionalized excitations, QSLs have emerged as a frontier in condensed matter physics, bolstered by the recent identification of several candidate materials. This field holds profound implications for understanding strong correlations, topological order, and emergent phenomena in quantum materials. Among them, the Kitaev model, featuring bond-directional Ising interactions, provides a rare exactly solvable QSL example. Its ground state is a topological QSL, with spin degrees of freedom fractionalized into emergent Majorana fermions. Under an applied magnetic field, the Kitaev QSL transitions to a topologically non-trivial chiral spin liquid state with non-Abelian anyons, offering potential resources for topological quantum computation. The non-Abelian character of these anyons in the Kitaev QSL demonstrates a profound connection to certain topological superconductors and even-denominator fractional quantum Hall states. Since the theoretical prediction that the Kitaev model could manifest in spin-orbit-coupled materials such as honeycomb iridates and ruthenates, research has focused on identifying candidate compounds. In particular, experimental evidence suggests spin fractionalization and topological phenomena akin to the Kitaev model in the spin-orbit Mott insulator RuCl3. However, results and interpretations remain actively debated. This review begins with a brief review on QSLs in other systems, followed by a comprehensive survey of existing studies on Kitaev candidate materials, with a particular focus on RuCl3. Rather than offering conclusive remarks, our aim is to inspire future research by examining several key aspects of the current literature and perspectives.</description>

Abstract: The exploration of electrides holds great promise for advancing both fundamental physics and chemistry, owing to their unique characteristics arising from loosely bound interstitial anionic electrons. Here we report a class of cross-chain electrides, distinguished by two distinct anionic electron subchannels forming alternating chains in real space. Through structural symmetry analysis and first-principles calculations, we identify two-dimensional $M_2$N ($M$ = Ti, Zr, Hf) materials as prototypical systems exhibiting these unique features. The anionic electron channels on the upper and lower surfaces of these materials display a vertically alternating pattern, with their projected bands revealing momentum-dependent splitting behavior in the reciprocal space, protected by a crystal symmetry operation $\mathcal{O}$. Notably, the cross-chain electride characteristic in the $M_2$N monoalyers is independent of the layer number and remains robust on the upper and lower surfaces of layered structures, presenting a pronounced and robust surface interstitial electronic state. Additionally, we have explored the superconductivity of these systems, and found that both Ti$_2$N and Zr$_2$N are intrinsic superconductors with superconducting transition temperatures below 1.0 K. Further results show that appropriate hole doping can significantly enhance their superconducting transition temperatures and can induce the Hf$_2$N monolayer to exhibit superconductivity. Our findings provide valuable insights into the design and tuning of novel electrides with enhanced superconducting properties, offering another pathway for deeply understanding the interplay between electride behavior and superconductivity in novel materials.</description>

      <title>Unconventional tunnel magnetoresistance scaling with altermagnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.17192v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In conventional magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs), the tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR) typically increases with barrier thickness as electron transmission in the antiparallel configuration decays faster than that of the parallel configuration. In this work, we reveal an anomalous scaling effect in altermagnetic tunnel junctions (AMTJs), where the TMR decreases anomalously with an increasing barrier thickness. The anomalous scaling originates from the overlapping spin-split branches form a transmission path that cannot be suppressed in the antiparallel state. Such phenomena is explained by adouble-barrier model and is further demonstrated using ab initio quantum transport simulations in 2D V2Te2O/Cr2Se2O/V2Te2O-based AMTJ, where the TMR anomalously decreases from 220% to 40% as the layer number of Cr2Se2O increases from 1 to 5. Our work identifies a peculiar unexpected transport characteristic of AMTJ, providing a fundamental limit on AMTJ device design and illustrating the potential optimal design of AMTJ at the ultrascaled monolayer limit.</description>

      <title>Uncovering relationships between the electronic self-energy and coupled-cluster doubles theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18910v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive the coupled-cluster doubles (CCD) amplitude equations by introduction of the particle-hole-time decoupled electronic self-energy. The resulting analysis leads to an expression for the ground state correlation energy that is exactly of the form obtained in coupled-cluster doubles theory. We demonstrate the relationship to the ionization potential/electron affinity equation-of-motion coupled-cluster doubles (IP/EA-EOM-CCD) eigenvalue problem by coupling the reverse-time self-energy contributions while maintaining particle-hole separability. The formal relationships established are demonstrated by exact solution of the Hubbard dimer.</description>

      <title>Light-Wave Engineering for Selective Polarization of a Single $\mathbf{Q}$ Valley in Transition Metal Dichalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07213v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The selective control of specific momentum valleys lies at the core of valleytronics, a field that has thus far focused primarily on the $\mathbf{K}$ and $\mathbf{K'}$ valleys in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). However, direct optical access to other low-lying yet conventionally inaccessible valleys such as the sixfold degenerate $\mathbf{Q}$ valleys has remained an outstanding challenge, fundamentally limiting the exploitation of the full valley degree of freedom for information processing. Here, we theoretically introduce an emergent light-wave valley selection rule that enables deterministic and high fidelity excitation of any single $\mathbf{Q}$ valley in monolayer TMDs. By coherently combining a circularly polarized pump pulse with a linearly polarized driver pulse, we engineer distinct quantum pathways that unambiguously excited electrons into a targeted $\mathbf{Q}$ valley, completely decoupled from the conventional $\mathbf{K}/\mathbf{K'}$ valleys. This all-optical scheme achieves near-unity ($\sim$100\%) valley polarization across an exceptionally broad ultrafast window, from the terahertz ($10^{12}$~Hz) to petahertz ($10^{15}$~Hz) regimes, enabling single $\mathbf{Q}$ valley polarization on femtosecond timescales. Our findings establish a new paradigm of light-wave quantum metrology in valleytronics, unlocking the $\mathbf{Q}$-valley subspace for scalable multi-state valley information processing.</description>

      <title>Edgetronics in Two-Dimensional Altermagnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.10451v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The coupling between real-space inhomogeneities coordinates and spin (r-s) provides an alternative route to achieve efficient spin manipulation in spintronics beyond the conventional momentum-spin (k-s) coupling paradigm. Here we demonstrate an unexpected manifestation of one-dimensional (1D) r-s coupling in two-dimensional (2D) altermagnetic second-order topological insulators, where the spin-split floating edge states -- energetically isolated within the bulk band gap -- emerge and exhibit both Neel-vector-dependent and electrically tunable behaviors. The 1D edge-spin r-s coupling ensures carrier transport to be exclusively carried by the edge states with quantized spin conductance, giving rise to an unconventional edge tunnel magnetoresistance (edge-TMR) effect that can be switched On or Off. As a proof of concept, we computationally design an edge-TMR device based on Cr_2Se_2O monolayer to demonstrate its edge transportation and controllability via the N\'eel order or electric field. Our findings propose a general prototype altermagnetic device for next-generation low-dimensional spintronics.</description>

      <title>Lessons from Chalcopyrites for Scaling Thin Film Perovskite Photovoltaic Technology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11638v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The growing demand for photovoltaic (PV) technologies that are lightweight, flexible, and seamlessly integrated into diverse applications has propelled interest in thin-film solar cells. Among these, Cu(In,Ga)(S,Se)2 (CIGS) and metal halide perovskites have garnered significant attention in the past and present, respectively. While CIGS reached commercial readiness after decades of refinement, their large-scale deployment was hindered by manufacturing complexity, scale-up challenges, and a lack of coordination between materials, device design, and production systems. Perovskite solar cells, despite setting record efficiencies at an unprecedented pace, now face similar challenges on their path to commercialization: ensuring long-term stability, translating laboratory performance to scalable architectures, and aligning with industrial realities. In this perspective, we revisit the CIGS experience not as a benchmark, but as a blueprint, highlighting how its successes and failures can inform a more deliberate and durable trajectory for perovskite PV. Bridging this historical perspective with the current frontier, we propose that the future of perovskites depends not only on continued innovation, but on learning from past thin-film PV experience to avoid its repetition.</description>

      <title>Deformation Driven Suction Cups: A Mechanics-Based Approach to Wearable Electronics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11838v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Wearable electronics are emerging as essential tools for health monitoring, haptic feedback, and human-computer interactions. While stable contact at the device-body interface is critical for these applications, it remains challenging due to the skin's softness, roughness, and mechanical variability. Existing methods, such as grounding structures or adhesive tapes, often suffer from contact loss, limited repeatability, and restrictions on the types of electronics they can support. Suction-based adhesives offer a promising alternative by generating negative pressure without requiring tight bands or chemical adhesives. However, most existing cup designs rely on rigid-surface assumptions and overlook mechanical interactions between suction cups and skin. Inspired by traditional cupping therapies, we present a suction-based adhesive system that attaches through elastic deformation and recovery. Using analytical modeling, numerical simulations, and experiments, we present a mechanics-based framework showing how suction performance depends on cup geometry, substrate compliance, and interfacial adhesion. We show that cup geometry should be tailored to substrate stiffness. Wide, flat suction cups perform well on rigid surfaces but fail on soft ones like skin due to substrate intrusion into the chamber. Narrow and tall domes better preserve recoverable volume and generate stronger suction. To improve sealing on rough, dry skin, we introduce a soft, tacky interfacial layer informed by a contact mechanics model. Using our design principles for skin suction adhesives, we demonstrate secure attachment of rigid and flexible components including motion sensors, haptic actuators, and electrophysiological electrodes across diverse anatomical regions. These findings provide a fundamental basis for designing the next generation of skin-friendly adhesives for wearable electronics.</description>
