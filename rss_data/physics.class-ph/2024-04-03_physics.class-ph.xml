      <title>Correlation and Spectral Density Functions in Mode-Stirred Reverberation -- I. Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Auto- and cross-spectral density functions for dynamic {random} fields and power are derived. These are based on first- and second-order Pad\'{e} approximants of correlation functions expanded in terms of spectral moments. The second-order approximant permits a characterization of stir noise observable {at high stir frequencies in the autospectral density}. A relationship between stir imperfection and spectral kurtosis is established. For the latter, lower bounds are established. A novel alternative measure of correlation time for mean-square differentiable fields is introduced as the lag at the first point of inflection in the autocorrelation function. A hierarchy of Pad\'{e} deviation coefficients is constructed that quantify imperfections of correlations and spectra with increasing accuracy and range of lags. Analytical models of the spectral densities are derived and their asymptotic behaviour is analyzed. The theoretical spectral density for the electric field as an input quantity is compared with that for power as the measurand. For the latter, its inverted-S shape conforms to experimentally observed stir-spectral power densities. The effect of additive noise on the stir autocorrelation and spectral density functions is quantified.</description>

      <title>Exact solution to Maxwell's equations for the infinite ideal solenoid with a time-dependent surface current</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Very little previous literature has considered the *exact* solution to Maxwell's equations for an infinite ideal cylindrical solenoid with an arbitrary time-dependent azimuthal surface current $K(t) \hat{\bf \phi}$. Most of the previous literature has focused on special cases and has approached the problem by calculating the magnetic vector potential ${\bf A}$, which requires performing some very complicated surface integrals over the cylinder. In this article, we take a simpler approach and directly tackle Maxwell's equations without ever invoking a vector potential. The high symmetry of the geometry allows us to reduce Maxwell's equations to just two coupled partial differential equations for two functions of two real variables, which can be readily solved numerically. We find the general analytic solution to these PDEs and derive the Green's functions for the electromagnetic fields, which allow us to calculate the fields directly from the surface current $K(t)$. We also briefly discuss a family of exact formal solutions that (the author believes) has not appeared in the previous literature because it corresponds to a current $K(t)$ that does not have a Fourier transform.</description>
