      <title>Statistical Equilibrium of Optimistic Beliefs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the Statistical Equilibrium of Optimistic Beliefs (SE-OB) for the mixed extension of finite normal-form games, drawing insights from discrete choice theory. Departing from the conventional best responders of Nash equilibrium and the better responders of quantal response equilibrium, we reconceptualize player behavior as that of optimistic better responders. In this setting, the players assume that their expected payoffs are subject to random perturbations, and form optimistic beliefs by selecting the distribution of perturbations that maximizes their highest anticipated payoffs among belief sets. In doing so, SE-OB subsumes and extends the existing equilibria concepts. The player's view of the existence of perturbations in their payoffs reflects an inherent risk sensitivity, and thus, each player is equipped with a risk-preference function for every action. We demonstrate that every Nash equilibrium of a game, where expected payoffs are regularized with the risk-preference functions of the players, corresponds to an SE-OB in the original game, provided that the belief sets coincide with the feasible set of a multi-marginal optimal transport problem with marginals determined by risk-preference functions. Building on this connection, we propose an algorithm for repeated games among risk-sensitive players under optimistic beliefs when only zeroth-order feedback is available. We prove that, under appropriate conditions, the algorithm converges to an SE-OB. Our convergence analysis offers key insights into the strategic behaviors for equilibrium attainment: a player's risk sensitivity enhances equilibrium stability, while forming optimistic beliefs in the face of ambiguity helps to mitigate overly aggressive strategies over time. As a byproduct, our approach delivers the first generic convergent algorithm for general-form structural QRE beyond the classical logit-QRE.</description>

      <title>Properties of Path-Independent Choice Correspondences and Their Applications to Efficient and Stable Matchings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Choice correspondences are crucial in decision-making, especially when faced with indifferences or ties. While tie-breaking can transform a choice correspondence into a choice function, it often introduces inefficiencies. This paper introduces a novel notion of path-independence (PI) for choice correspondences, extending the existing concept of PI for choice functions. Intuitively, a choice correspondence is PI if any consistent tie-breaking produces a PI choice function. This new notion yields several important properties. First, PI choice correspondences are rationalizabile, meaning they can be represented as the maximization of a utility function. This extends a core feature of PI in choice functions. Second, we demonstrate that the set of choices selected by a PI choice correspondence for any subset forms a generalized matroid. This property reveals that PI choice correspondences exhibit a nice structural property. Third, we establish that choice correspondences rationalized by ordinally concave functions inherently satisfy the PI condition. This aligns with recent findings that a choice function satisfies PI if and only if it can be rationalized by an ordinally concave function. Building on these theoretical foundations, we explore stable and efficient matchings under PI choice correspondences. Specifically, we investigate constrained efficient matchings, which are efficient (for one side of the market) within the set of stable matchings. Under responsive choice correspondences, such matchings are characterized by cycles. However, this cycle-based characterization fails in more general settings. We demonstrate that when the choice correspondence of each school satisfies both PI and monotonicity conditions, a similar cycle-based characterization is restored. These findings provide new insights into the matching theory and its practical applications.</description>
