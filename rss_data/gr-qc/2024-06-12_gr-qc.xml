      <title>Constraining extended teleparallel gravity via cosmography: A model-independent approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a classical approach, the dynamics of the Universe, influenced by its dark components, are unveiled through prior modifications of Einstein's equations. Cosmography, on the other hand, is a highly efficient tool for reconstructing any modified theory in a model-independent manner. By employing kinematic variables, it offers a profound explanation for cosmic expansion. Although the cosmographical approach has been highly successful in several geometric theories in recent years, it has not been extensively explored in coupled gravities. With this in mind, we intend to constrain an extended teleparallel gravity model, $f(T,\mathcal{T})$, through cosmographic parameters. We utilize Taylor series expansion, assuming a minimally coupled form, to constrain the unknowns involved in the series. To achieve this, we conduct a Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis (MCMC) using three different datasets (CC, BAO, and Pantheon+SH0ES). The constrained results obtained from MCMC are then compared and verified using various cosmological parameters. Finally, we compare the resulting models with \textbf{three} well-known $f(T,\mathcal{T})$ models.</description>

      <title>Geometry of Carrollian Stretched Horizons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a comprehensive toolbox for studying Carrollian stretched horizons, encompassing their geometry, dynamics, symplectic geometry, symmetries, and corresponding Noether charges. We introduce a precise definition of ruled stretched Carrollian structures (sCarrollian structures) on any surface, generalizing the conventional Carrollian structures of null surfaces, along with the notions of sCarrollian connection and sCarrollian stress tensor. Our approach unifies the sCarrollian (intrinsic) and stretched horizon (embedding) perspectives, providing a universal framework for any causal surface, whether timelike or null. We express the Einstein equations in sCarrollian variables and discuss the phase space symplectic structure of the sCarrollian geometry. Through Noether's theorem, we derive the Einstein equation and canonical charge and compute the evolution of the canonical charge along the transverse (radial) direction. The latter can be interpreted as a spin-2 symmetry charge.
  Our framework establishes a novel link between gravity on stretched horizons and Carrollian fluid dynamics and unifies various causal surfaces studied in the literature, including non-expanding and isolated horizons. We expect this work to provide insights into the hydrodynamical description of black holes and the quantization of null surfaces.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Radiation Power Spectrum of Garfinkle-Vachaspati Cosmic String Loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the power spectrum $P_n$ of the $n$th harmonic for Garfinkle-Vachaspati cosmic strings, which correspond to planar rectangular loops. While these loop tractories are self-intersecting, a slightly perturbed non-self-intersecting form of these trajectories has been suggested as a generic end state of cosmic string loop fragmentation. We find that $P_n$ scales as $n^{-2} \ln n$, rather than the expected $n^{-2}$ for kink-kink collisions. This result is demonstrated analytically for even $n$ in square loops and numerically for all other cases. At lowest order, the effect of loop decays is to further enhance $P_n$ at large $n$ relative to its value at small $n$. The consequences for relic stochastic background radiation along with the caveats pertaining to our results are discussed.</description>

      <title>Universal properties of the evolution of the Universe in modified loop quantum cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we systematically study the evolution of the Universe in the framework of a modified loop quantum cosmological model (mLQC-I) with various inflationary potentials, including chaotic, Starobinsky, generalized Starobinsky, polynomials of the first and second kinds, generalized T- models and natural inflation. In all these models, the big bang singularity is represented by a quantum bounce, and the evolution of the Universe both before and after the bounce is universal and weakly depends on the inflationary potentials, as long as the evolution is dominated by the kinetic energy of the inflaton at the bounce. In particular, the evolution in the pre-bounce region can be universally divided into three different phases: pre-bouncing, pre-transition, and pre-de Sitter. The pre-bouncing phase occurs immediately before the quantum bounce, during which the evolution of the Universe is dominated by the kinetic energy of the inflaton. Thus, the equation of state of the inflaton is about one, w = 1. Soon, the inflation potential takes over, so w rapidly falls from one to negative one. This pre-transition phase is very short and quickly turns into the pre-de Sitter phase, whereby the effective cosmological constant with a Planck size takes over and dominates the rest of the contracting phase. In the entire pre-bounce regime, the evolution of the expansion factor and the inflaton can be approximated by analytical solutions, which are universal and independent of the inflation potentials.</description>

      <title>Characterization of wormhole space-times supported by a covariant action-dependent Lagrangian theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we undertake an analysis of new wormhole solutions within an action-dependent Lagrangian framework. These geometries can be traversable and supported by a positive energy density. The modification of the gravitational field equations is produced by the inclusion in the gravitational Lagrangian linear of a background four-vector $\lambda_{\mu}$. This new term expands significantly the conventional description of gravity making it highly non-linear, and therefore drawing general conclusions about legitimate forms of $\lambda_{\mu}$ proves a formidable task in general. It is, then, customary to adopt an ansatz that strikes a balance between enabling new phenomenology while retaining a significant degree of generality on $\lambda_\mu$. Ours is given by the choice $\lambda_\mu=(0,\lambda_1(r), 0, 0)$, with an arbitrary $\lambda_1(r)$. By setting $\lambda_1(r)=-1/r$ we craft new families with physically desirable properties, but the wormholes thus generated turn out to be conical, as evidenced by an angle deficit, in a similar fashion to other known solution families. Under the general shape of $\lambda_1(r)$, we demonstrate that these solutions are not compatible with the Null Energy Condition (NEC) in general, as it happens to their General Relativity counterparts, except on specific occasions where the derivative of the redshift function of the metric diverges at the throat (however, in these latter cases, the traversability of the wormhole will be disrupted). On the other hand, it is possible to solve the conical character and satisfies the flatness condition for more general functions of $\lambda_1(r)$.</description>

      <title>The Study of the Canonical forms of Killing tensor in vacuum with {\Lambda}</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is the initial part of a comprehensive study of spacetimes that admit the canonical forms of Killing tensor in General Relativity. Our scope is to derive either new exact solutions of Einstein's equations or to determine the hidden symmetries of the already known ones. In this preliminary work we first introduce the canonical forms of Killing tensor. Subsequently, we employ the integrability conditions of each canonical form along with the Einstein field equations (in vacuum with {\Lambda}) and the Bianchi identities in an attempt to create a solvable yet overdetermined system of equations. Finally, we obtain multiple special algebraic solutions according to the Petrov classification (D, III, N, O). The latter becomes possible since our analysis is embodied with the usage of the Newman-Penrose formalism of null tetrads.</description>

      <title>Displacement versus velocity memory effects from a gravitational plane wave</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article demonstrates that additionally to the well-known velocity memory effect, a vacuum gravitational plane wave can also induce a displacement memory on a couple of test particles. A complete classification of the conditions under which a velocity or a displacement memory effect occur is established. These conditions depend both the initial conditions of the relative motion and on the wave profile. The two cases where the wave admits a pulse or a step profile are treated. Our analytical expressions are then compared to numerical integrations to exhibit either a velocity or a displacement memory, in the case of these two families of profiles. Additionally to this classification, the existence of a new symmetry of polarized vacuum gravitational plane wave under M\"{o}bius reparametrization of the null time is demonstrated. Finally, we discuss the resolution of the geodesic deviation equation by means of the underlying symmetries of vacuum gravitational plane wave.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the intrinsic geometry of compact cross-sections of an extremal horizon in four-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell theory must admit a Killing vector field or is static. This implies that any such horizon must be an extremal Kerr-Newman horizon and completes the classification of the associated near-horizon geometries. The same results hold with a cosmological constant.</description>

      <title>The representation and computational efficiency of the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations in isotropic coordinates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study aims to provide an analytical scheme for computing equilibrium configurations of relativistic stars by solving the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations directly in isotropic polar coordinates, as opposed to the commonly applied methods of rescaling the radial profile of corresponding solutions obtained in curvature coordinates. This study also provides evidence that the differential equation for gravitational mass may be replaced by an algebraic expression relating the metric potential to the energy density in the form of the quartic equation. Nevertheless, the greater computational expense of evaluating the algebraic equation renders its application less efficient. A further objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of the present computational scheme in the computational time and numerical accuracy. Our results indicate that the computational time increases with the stiffness of the constituent matter inside the star. Conversely, the absolute difference between the gravitational mass obtained by the proposed method and that computed via the use of LORENE packages initially increases rapidly with the central energy density, but the rate of growth subsequently declines as the maximum mass configuration is approached.</description>

      <title>Diversity in Fermi/GBM Gamma Ray Bursts: New insights from Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classification of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) has been a long-standing puzzle in high-energy astrophysics. Recent observations challenge the traditional short vs. long viewpoint, where long GRBs are thought to originate from the collapse of massive stars and short GRBs from compact binary mergers. Machine learning (ML) algorithms have been instrumental in addressing this problem, revealing five distinct GRB groups within the Swift/BAT light curve data, two of which are associated with kilonovae (KNe). We corroborate these five classes by extending this analysis to the Fermi/GBM data using unsupervised ML techniques. These five clusters are well separated in fluence-duration plane, hinting at a potential link between fluence, duration and complexities (or structures) in the light curves of GRBs. Further, we confirm two distinct classes of KN-associated GRBs. The presence of GRB 170817A in one of the two KNe-associated clusters lends evidence to the hypothesis that this class of GRBs could potentially be produced by binary neutron star (BNS) mergers. The second KN-associated GRB cluster could potentially originate from NS-BH mergers. Future multimessenger observations of compact binaries in gravitational waves (GWs) and electromagnetic waves can be paramount in understanding these clusters better.</description>

      <title>Relativistic Corrections to the CBF Effective Nuclear Hamiltonian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the inclusion of relativistic boost corrections into the CBF effective nuclear Hamiltonian, derived from a realistic model of two- and three-nucleon interactions using the formalism of correlated basis functions and the cluster expansion technique. Different procedures to take into account the effects of boost interactions are compared on the basis of the ability to reproduce the nuclear matter equation of state obtained from accurate many-body calculations. The results of our study show that the repulsive contribution of the boost interaction significantly depends on the underlying model of the non relativistic potential. On the other hand, the dominant relativistic correction turns out to be the corresponding reduction of the strength of repulsive three-nucleon interactions, leading to a significant softening of the equation of state at supranuclear densities.</description>

      <title>Transient dynamics of quasinormal mode sums</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quasinormal modes of spacetimes with event horizons are typically governed by a non-normal operator. This gives rise to spectral instabilities, a topic of recent interest in the black hole pseudospectrum programme. In this work we show that non-normality leads to the existence of arbitrarily long-lived sums of short-lived quasinormal modes, corresponding to localising packets of energy near the future horizon. There exist sums of $M$ quasinormal modes whose lifetimes scale as $\log{M}$. This transient behaviour results from large cancellations between non-orthogonal quasinormal modes. We provide simple closed-form examples for a massive scalar field in the static patch of dS$_{d+1}$ and the BTZ black hole. We also provide numerical examples for scalar perturbations of Schwarzschild-AdS$_{d+1}$, and gravitational perturbations of Schwarzschild in asymptotically flat spacetime, using hyperboloidal foliations. The existence of these perturbations is linked to certain properties of black hole pseudospectra. We comment on implications for thermalisation times in holographic plasmas.</description>

      <title>Using gauge invariance to symmetrize the energy-momentum tensor of electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is shown that using Noether's Theorem explicitly employing gauge invariance for variations of the electromagnetic four-potential $A^\mu$ straightforwardly ensures that the resulting electromagnetic energy-momentum tensor is symmetric. The Belinfante symmetrization procedure is not necessary. The method is based on Bessel-Hagen's 1921 clarification of Noether's original procedure, suggesting that the symmetry problem arises from an incomplete implementation of Noether's Theorem.</description>

Abstract: This paper is devoted to memory of late Professor V. G. Bagrov, who was my first teacher in theoretical physics. About 45 years later, theoretical physics has changed and me too. The subject of this paper relates some old ideas in cosmology with some recent ideas, as is reflected in the title. The current status of Starobinsky inflation is reviewed and compared to three main conjectures in the Swampland program. It is argued that the Starobinsky inflation model is not in conflict with those Swampland conjectures in their basic versions.</description>

Abstract: The corner symmetry algebra organises the physical charges induced by gravity on codimension-$2$ corners of a manifold. In this letter, we initiate a study of the quantum properties of this group. We first describe the central extensions and how the quantum corner symmetry group arises. We then classify the Casimirs and the induced unitary irreducible representation. We finally discuss the gluing of corners, achieved identifying the maximal commuting sub-algebra. This is a concrete implementation of the gravitational constraints at the quantum level, via the entangling product.</description>

      <title>Comparative Analysis of $k$-essence and Quintessence Scalar Field Models: A Data Analysis Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform a comparative analysis of quintessence and $k$-essence scalar field models in the data analysis perspective. We study the quintessence field with an exponential potential and the $k$-essence field with an inverse square potential in the present work. Before delving into data analysis, we provide a brief perspective on dynamical evolution on both of the models and obtain the stability constraints on the model parameters. We adopt Bayesian inference procedure to estimate the model parameters that best-fit the data. A comprehensive analysis utilizing Observational Hubble data (OHD) and Pantheon+ compilation of Type Ia supernovae (SNIa) shows that $k$-essence model fits the data slightly better than the quintessence model while the evidence of these models in comparison with the $\Lambda$CDM model is weak. The value of the Hubble constant predicted by both the models is in close agreement with the value obtained by the Planck2018 collaboration assuming the $\Lambda$CDM model.</description>

      <title>Exploring Waveform Variations among Neutron Star Ray-tracing Codes for Complex Emission Geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pulse Profile Modeling (PPM), the technique used to infer mass, radius and geometric parameters for rotation-powered millisecond pulsars using data from the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER), relies on relativistic ray-tracing of thermal X-ray photons from hot spots on the neutron star surface to the observer. To verify our ray-tracing codes we have in the past conducted cross-tests for simple hot spot geometries, focusing primarily on the implementation of the space-time model. In this paper, we present verification for test problems that explore the more complex hot spot geometries that are now being employed in the NICER PPM analyses. We conclude that the accuracy of our computed waveforms is in general sufficiently high for analyses of current NICER data sets. We have however identified some extreme configurations where extra care may be needed.</description>

      <title>Shadows, rings and optical appearance of a magnetically charged regular black hole illuminated by various accretion disks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07300v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) imaging of the supermassive black holes at the centers of Messier 87 galaxy and the Milky Way galaxy marks a significant step in observing the photon rings and central brightness depression that define the optical appearance of black holes with an accretion disk scenario. Inspired by this, we take into account a static and spherically symmetric magnetically charged regular black hole (MCRBH) metric characterized by its mass and an additional parameter q, which arises from the coupling of Einstein gravity and nonlinear electrodynamics (NLED) in the weak field approximation. This parameterized model offers a robust foundation for testing the coupling of Einstein gravity and NLED in the weak-field approximation, using the EHT observational results. In this study, we investigate the geodesic motion of particles around the solution, followed by a discussion of its fundamental geometrical characteristics such as scalar invariants. Using null geodesics, we examine how the model parameter influences the behavior of the photon sphere radius and the associated shadow silhouette. We seek constraints on q by applying the EHT results for supermassive black holes M87* and Sgr A*. Furthermore, it is observed that the geodesics of time-like particles are susceptible to variations in q, which can have an impact on the traits of the innermost stable circular orbit and the marginally bounded orbit. Our primary objective is to probe how the free parameter q affects various aspects of the accretion disk surrounding the MCRBH using the thin-disk approximation. Next, we discuss the physical characteristics of the thin accretion disk as well as the observed shadows and rings of the MCRBH, along with its luminosity, across various accretion models. Ultimately, variations in accretion models and the parameter q yield distinct shadow images and optical appearances of the MCRBH.</description>

      <title>Searching for gravitational waves from stellar-mass binary black holes early inspiral</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The early inspiral from stellar-mass binary black holes can emit milli-Hertz gravitational wave signals, making them detectable sources for space-borne gravitational wave missions like TianQin. However, the traditional matched filtering technique poses a significant challenge for analyzing this kind of signals, as it requires an impractically high number of templates ranging from $10^{31}$ to $10^{40}$. We propose a search strategy that involves two main parts: initially, we reduce the dimensionality of the simulated signals using incremental principal component analysis (IPCA). Subsequently we train the convolutional neural networks (CNNs) based on the compressed TianQin data obtained from IPCA, aiming to develop both a detection model and a point parameter estimation model. The compression efficiency for the trained IPCA model achieves a cumulative variance ratio of 95.6% when applied to $10^6$ simulated signals. To evaluate the performance of CNN we generate the receiver operating characteristic curve for the detection model which is applied to the test data with varying signal-to-noise ratios. At a false alarm probability of 5% the corresponding true alarm probability for signals with a signal-to-noise ratio of 50 is 86.5%. Subsequently, we introduce the point estimation model to evaluate the value of the chirp mass of corresponding sBBH signals with an error. For signals with a signal-to-noise ratio of 50, the trained point estimation CNN model can estimate the chirp mass of most test events, with a standard deviation error of 2.48 $M_{\odot}$ and a relative error precision of 0.12.</description>

      <title>Holographic reconstruction of black hole spacetime: machine learning and entanglement entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07395v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the bulk reconstruction of AdS black hole spacetime emergent from quantum entanglement within a machine learning framework. Utilizing neural ordinary differential equations alongside Monte-Carlo integration, we develop a method tailored for continuous training functions to extract the general isotropic bulk metric from entanglement entropy data. To validate our approach, we first apply our machine learning algorithm to holographic entanglement entropy data derived from the Gubser-Rocha and superconductor models, which serve as representative models of strongly coupled matters in holography. Our algorithm successfully extracts the corresponding bulk metrics from these data. Additionally, we extend our methodology to many-body systems by employing entanglement entropy data from a fermionic tight-binding chain at half filling, exemplifying critical one-dimensional systems, and derive the associated bulk metric. We find that the metrics for a tight-binding chain and the Gubser-Rocha model are similar. We speculate this similarity is due to the metallic property of these models.</description>

      <title>Holographic and Gravity-Thermodynamic Approaches in Entropic Cosmology: Bayesian Assessment using late-time Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07446v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the cosmological implications of entropy-based approaches in the context of Holographic Dark Energy (HDE) and Gravity-Thermodynamics (GT) formalisms. We utilise the extended Barrow entropy form, with the index parameter $\Delta$, representing the fractal dimension of the horizon. We also test implementing different parameter ranges for $\Delta$, which can be extended to Tsallis' interpretation within the same formal cosmology. We perform a Bayesian analysis to constrain the cosmological parameters using the Pantheon+, more recent DESy5, DESI, and, as a supplement, Quasar datasets. We find that the HDE model within almost all data combinations performs extremely well in comparison to the GT approach, which is usually strongly disfavored. Using the combination of DESy5+DESI alone, we find that the GT approaches are disfavored at $|\log \mathcal{B}| \sim 5.8$ and $|\log \mathcal{B}| \sim 6.2$ for the Barrow and Tsallis limits on $\Delta$, respectively, wrt $\Lambda$CDM model. While the HDE approach is statistically equivalent to $\Lambda$CDM when comparing the Bayesian evidence. We also investigate the evolution of the dark energy equation of state and place limits on the same, consistent with quintessence-like behaviour in the HDE approaches.</description>

      <title>Cosmological constraints on $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM scenario in a type II minimally modified gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The idea of a rapid sign-switching cosmological constant (mirror AdS-dS transition) in the late universe at $z\sim1.7$, known as the $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM model, has significantly improved the fit to observational data and provides a promising scenario for alleviating major cosmological tensions, such as the $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions. However, in the absence of a fully predictive model, implementing this fit required conjecturing that the dynamics of the linear perturbations are governed by general relativity. Recent work embedding the $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM model with the Lagrangian of a type-II minimally modified gravity known as VCDM has propelled $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM to a fully predictive model, removing the uncertainty related to the aforementioned assumption; we call this new model $\Lambda_{\rm s}$VCDM. In this work, we demonstrate that not only does $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM fit the data better than the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, but the new model, $\Lambda_{\rm s}$VCDM, performs even better in alleviating cosmological tensions while also providing a better fit to the data, including CMB, BAO, SNe Ia, and Cosmic Shear measurements. Our findings highlight the $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM framework, particularly the $\Lambda_{\rm s}$VCDM model, as a compelling alternative to the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, especially by successfully alleviating the $H_0$ tension. Additionally, these models predict higher values for $\sigma_8$, indicating enhanced structuring, albeit with lower present-day matter density parameter values and consequently reduced $S_8$ values, alleviating the $S_8$ tension as well. This demonstrates that the data are well fit by a combination of background and linear perturbations, both having dynamics differing from those of $\Lambda$CDM. This paves the way for further exploration of new ways for embedding the sign-switching cosmological constant into other models.</description>

      <title>Alleviating the cosmological constant problem from particle production</title>

      <description>arXiv:2206.14158v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore a toy model mechanism of geometric cancellation, alleviating the (classical) cosmological constant problem. To do so, we assume at primordial times that vacuum energy fuels an inflationary quadratic hilltop potential nonminimally coupled to gravity through a standard Yukawa-like interacting term, whose background lies on a perturbed Friedmann-Robertson-Walker metric. We demonstrate how vacuum energy release transforms into geometric particles, adopting a quasi-de Sitter phase where we compute the expected particle density and mass ranges. Perturbations are introduced by means of the usual external-field appproximation, so that the back-reaction of the created particles on the geometry is not considered here. We discuss the limitations of this approach and we also suggest possible refinements. We then propose the most suitable dark matter candidates, showing under which circumstances we can interpret dark matter as constituted by geometric quasiparticles. We confront our predictions with quantum particle production and constraints made using a Higgs portal. In addition, the role of the bare cosmological constant is reinterpreted to speed up the universe today. Thus, consequences on the standard $\Lambda$CDM paradigm are critically highlighted, showing how both coincidence and fine-tuning issues can be healed requiring the Israel-Darmois matching conditions between our involved inhomogeneous and homogeneous phases.</description>

      <title>Using massless fields for observing black hole features in the collapsed phase of Euclidean dynamical triangulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.07081v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on an old computation of propagators of massless scalar fields on an ensemble of configurations in the 4D path integral of Euclidean dynamical triangulations in the collapsed (crumpled) phase. The resulting quantum average is used to calculate the scale factor of a rotational invariant metric in a 4-dimensional space. This new scale factor is non-zero at the origin, which we assume to be caused by the presence of the well-known singular structure in the collapsed phase. It depends on an overall integration constant. A transformation to a metric in (1+3)-dimensions reveals Euclidean black hole features at an instant in time, with a horizon separating interior and exterior parts. Effective Einstein equations in the presence of a `geometric condensate' are assumed, and computed with the software OGRe. We find similarities with the energy density and pressure of gravastars, as well as remnants, and investigate their dependence on the integration constant.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave fluxes on generic orbits in near-extreme Kerr spacetime: higher spin and large eccentricity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.15295v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To obtain the waveform template of gravitational waves (GWs), substantial computational resources and exceedingly high precision are often required. In the previous study [JCAP 11 (2023) 070], we efficiently and accurately calculate GW fluxes of a particle in circular orbits around a Schwarzschild black hole using the confluent Heun function. We extend the previous method to calculate the asymptotic GW fluxes from a particle in generic orbits around a near-extreme Kerr black hole. Especially when dealing with the computational difficulties in large eccentricity $e=0.9$, higher spin $a=0.999$, higher harmonic modes, and strong-field regions, our results are much better than the results of the numerical integration method based on the Mano-Suzuki-Takasugi method.</description>

Abstract: A generation method of new metric in the case of static spherically symmetric space-time is derived. Using this approach, we construct a metric which describes Euler-Heisenberg black hole surrounded by perfect fluid dark matter and investigate its optical and thermodynamic properties. We found that radius of shadow will increase with the increase of dark matter effect, and more strong dark matter will diminish the light intensity of accretion disk generally. Moreover, in thermodynamics, when quantum electrodynamic parameter is positive, there will be a critical value of dark matter parameter, which determine the number of black hole's critical points.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.10406v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the intrinsic relations between thermodynamic phase transitions and quasinormal modes in regular AdS black holes, specifically in the Bardeen and Hayward AdS classes. To this end, we calculate the quasinormal modes of massless scalar field perturbations around small and large black holes via the Horowitz-Hubeny method. By investigating the isobaric and isothermal phase transitions for Bardeen and Hayward AdS black holes in detail, we observe that a dramatic change of quasinormal modes appears near the phase transition point of small and large black holes, and that it corresponds to the swallow tail structure in the plane of Gibbs free energy with respect to pressure. Moreover, by analyzing the evolution of black holes along the coexistence curve of small and large black hole phases, we also observe the dramatic change in quasinormal modes. Such a phenomenon confirms the signal of the phase transition in the quasinormal mode spectrum, which can be understood as a thermodynamic signal hidden in the dynamical spectrum.</description>

Abstract: This paper simplifies the induced four-dimensional gravitational equations originating from a five-dimensional bulk within the framework of Nash's embeddings, incorporating them into a well-known $\mu-\Sigma$ modified gravity (MG) parametrization. By leveraging data from Planck Public Release 4 (PR4), BICEP/Keck Array 2018, Planck cosmic microwave background lensing, and baryon acoustic oscillation observations, we establish a stringent lower limit for the tensor-to-scalar ratio parameter: $r &lt; 0.0303$ at a confidence level (CL) of 95\%. This finding suggests the presence of extrinsic dynamics influencing standard four-dimensional cosmology. Notably, this limit surpasses those typically obtained through Bayesian analysis using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques, which yield $r&lt;0.038$, or through the frequentist profile likelihood method, which yields $r&lt;0.037$ at 95\% CL.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01360v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This thesis is developed in the context of the spin-foam approach to quantum gravity; all results are concerned with the Lorentzian theory and with semiclassical methods. A correspondence is given between Majorana 2-spinors and time-like hypersurfaces in Minkowski 3-space based on complexified quaternions. It is shown that the former suggest a symplectic structure on the spinor phase space which, together with an area-matching constraint, yields a symplectomorphism to $T^*\mathrm{SU}(1,1)$. A complete 3-dimensional Lorentzian spin-foam amplitude for both space- and time-like triangles is proposed. It is shown to asymptote to Regge theory in the semiclassical regime. The asymptotic limit of the 4-dimensional Conrady-Hnybida model for general polytopes is scrutinized. Minkowski's theorem on convex polyhedra is generalized to Lorentzian signature, and new boundary states for time-like polygons are introduced. It is found that the semiclassical amplitude for such polygons is insufficiently constrained. A method for the asymptotic evaluation of integrals subject to external parameters is discussed. The method is developed in detail for the special problem of spin-foam gluing constraints away from their dominant critical points. A relation to the gluing constraints of effective spin-foams is suggested.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05269v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Some time ago, it has been suggested that gravitons can acquire mass in the process of spontaneous symmetry breaking of diffeomorphisms through the condensation of scalar fields [Chamseddine and Mukhanov, JHEP, 2010]. Taking this possibility into account, in the present paper, first we show how the graviton mass intricately reshapes the gravitational potential akin to a Yukawa-like potential at large distances. Notably, this long-range force modifies the Newton's law in large distances and might explain the phenomena of dark matter. The most important finding in the present paper is the derivation of a modified Newtons law of gravity by modifying the Verlindes entropic force relation due to the graviton contribution. The graviton contribution to the entropy basically measures the correlation of graviton and matter fields which then reproduces the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy at the horizon. This result shows the dual description of gravity: in the language of quantum information and entropy the gravity can be viewed as an entropic force, however in terms of particles and fields, it can be viewed as a longe range force. Further we have recovered the corrected Einstein field equations as well as the $\Lambda$CDM where dark matter emerges as an apparent effect.</description>

      <title>A comprehensive forecast for cosmological parameter estimation using joint observations of gravitational waves and short $\gamma$-ray bursts</title>

Abstract: In the third-generation (3G) gravitational-wave (GW) detector era, the multi-messenger GW observation for binary neutron star (BNS) merger events can exert great impacts on exploring the cosmic expansion history. In this work, we comprehensively explore the potential of 3G GW standard siren observations in cosmological parameter estimations by considering the 3G GW detectors and the future short $\gamma$-ray burst (GRB) detector THESEUS-like telescope joint observations. Based on the 10-year observation of different detection strategies, we predict that the numbers of detectable GW-GRB events are 334--674 with the redshifts $z&lt;3.5$ and the inclination angles $\iota&lt;15^{\circ}$. For the cosmological analysis, we consider the $\Lambda$CDM, $w$CDM, $w_0w_a$CDM models, and interacting dark energy (IDE) models. We find that GW can tightly constrain the Hubble constant with precisions of $0.345\%-0.065\%$, but perform not well in constraining other cosmological parameters. Fortunately, GW could effectively break the cosmological parameter degeneracies generated by the mainstream EM observations, CMB+BAO+SN (CBS). When combining the mock GW data with the CBS data, CBS+GW can tightly constrain the equation of state of dark energy $w$ with a precision of 1.26\%, close to the standard of precision cosmology. Meanwhile, the addition of GW to CBS could improve constraints on cosmological parameters by $34.2\%-94.9\%$. In conclusion, GW standard siren observations from 3G GW detectors could play a crucial role in helping solve the Hubble tension and probe the fundamental nature of dark energy.</description>

      <title>Representational conventions and invariant structure</title>

Abstract: In the philosophical literature, symmetries of physical theories are most often interpreted within the general doctrine called 'Sophistication'. Roughly speaking, it says that models related by symmetries can peacefully co-exist while representing the same physical possibility. But this interpretation still leaves open two main worries about Sophistication: (a) it allows the individuation of what I call 'structure-tokens' to remain intractable and thus of limited use, which is why practising physicists frequently invoke 'relational, symmetry-invariant observables'; and (b) it leaves us with no formal framework for expressing counterfactual statements about the world. Here, I will show that a new Desideratum to be satisfied by theories with symmetries answers these worries. The new Desideratum is that the theory admits what I will call representational conventions for its structure-tokens.</description>

      <title>Exploring Time Delay Interferometry Ranging as a Practical Ranging Approach in the Bayesian Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03060v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time Delay Interferometry (TDI) is an indispensable step in the whole data processing procedure of space-based gravitational wave detection, as it mitigates the overwhelming laser frequency noise, which would otherwise completely bury the gravitational wave signals. Knowledge on the inter-spacecraft optical paths (i.e. delays) is one of the key elements of TDI. Conventional method for inter-spacecraft ranging mainly relies on the pseudo-random noise (PRN) code signal modulated onto the lasers. To ensure the reliability and robustness of this ranging information, it would be highly beneficial to develop other methods which could serve as cross-validations or backups. This paper explores the practical implementation of an alternative data-driven approach - time delay interferometry ranging (TDIR) - as a ranging technique independent of the PRN signal. Distinguished from previous research, our TDIR algorithm significantly relaxes the stringent requirement for clock synchronization imposed by traditional TDI procedure. By framing TDIR as a Bayesian parameter estimation problem and employing a general polynomial parametrization, we demonstrate our algorithm with simulated data based on the numerical orbit of Taiji. In the presence of laser frequency noise and secondary noises, the estimated median values of delays are only 5.28 ns away from the ground truths, capable of suppressing laser frequency noise to the desired level. Additionally, we have also analysed the requirements of mitigating optical bench noise and clock noise on TDIR, and presented an illustrative example for the impact of laser locking.</description>

      <title>Unequal-mass, highly-spinning binary black hole mergers in the stable mass transfer formation channel</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12426v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The growing database of gravitational-wave (GW) detections with the binary black holes (BHs) merging in the distant Universe contains subtle insights into their formation scenarios. One of the puzzling properties of detected GW sources is the possible (anti)correlation between mass ratio q of BH-BH binaries and their effective spin. We use rapid binary evolution models to demonstrate that the isolated binary evolution followed by efficient tidal spin-up of stripped helium core produces a similar pattern in Xeff vs q distributions of BH-BH mergers. In our models, the progenitors of unequal BH-BH systems in the stable mass transfer formation scenario are more likely to efficiently shrink their orbits during the second Roche-lobe overflow than the binaries that evolve into nearly equal-mass component systems. This makes it easier for unequal-mass progenitors to enter the tidal spin-up regime and later merge due to GW emission. Our results are, however, sensitive to some input assumptions, especially, the stability of mass transfer and the angular momentum loss during non-conservative mass transfer. We note that mass transfer prescriptions widely adopted in rapid codes favor the formation of BH-BH merger progenitors with unequal masses and moderate separations. We compare our results with detailed stellar model grids and find reasonable agreement after appropriate calibration of the physics models. We anticipate that future detections of unequal-mass BH-BH mergers could provide valuable constraints on the role of the stable mass transfer formation channel. A significant fraction of BH-BH detections with mass ratio q in range (0.4 - 0.7) would be consistent with the mass ratio reversal scenario during the first, relatively conservative mass transfer, and a non-enhanced angular momentum loss during the second, highly non-conservative mass transfer phase.</description>

      <title>Renormalization of the nonprojectable Horava theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04708v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the proof of renormalization of the Horava theory, in the nonprojectable version. We obtain a form of the quantum action that exhibits a manifest BRST-symmetry structure. Previous analysis have shown that the divergences produced by irregular loops cancel completely between them. The remaining divergences are local. The renormalization is achieved by using the approach developed by Barvinsky et al. with the background-field formalism.</description>

      <title>Low angular momentum general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic accretion flow around rotating black holes with shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16326v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the global structure of general relativistic magneto-hydrodynamic (GRMHD) accretion flows around Kerr black holes containing shock waves, where the disk is threaded by radial and toroidal magnetic fields. We self-consistently solve the GRMHD equations that govern the flow motion inside the disk and for the first time to our knowledge, we obtain the shock-induced global GRMHD accretion solutions around weakly as well as rapidly rotating black holes for a set of fundamental flow parameters, such as energy ($E$), angular momentum ($L$), radial magnetic flux ($\Phi$), and iso-rotation parameter ($F$). We show that shock properties, namely shock radius ($r_{\rm sh}$), compression ratio ($R$) and shock strength ($\Psi$) strongly depends on $E$, $L$, $\Phi$, and $F$. We observe that shock in GRMHD flow continues to exist for wide range of the flow parameters, which allows us to identify the effective domain of parameter space in $L-E$ plane where shock solutions are feasible. Moreover, we examine the modification of the shock parameter space and find that it shifts towards the lower angular momentum values with increasing $\Phi$ and black hole spin ($a_{\rm k}$). Finally, we compute the critical radial magnetic flux ($\Phi^{\rm cri}$) that admits shocks in GRMHD flow and ascertain that $\Phi^{\rm cri}$ is higher (lower) for black hole of spin $a_{\rm k} = 0.99$ ($0.0$) and vice versa.</description>
