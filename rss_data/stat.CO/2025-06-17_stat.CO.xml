      <title>Assessing the Quality of Binomial Samplers: A Statistical Distance Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Randomized algorithms depend on accurate sampling from probability distributions, as their correctness and performance hinge on the quality of the generated samples. However, even for common distributions like Binomial, exact sampling is computationally challenging, leading standard library implementations to rely on heuristics. These heuristics, while efficient, suffer from approximation and system representation errors, causing deviations from the ideal distribution. Although seemingly minor, such deviations can accumulate in downstream applications requiring large-scale sampling, potentially undermining algorithmic guarantees. In this work, we propose statistical distance as a robust metric for analyzing the quality of Binomial samplers, quantifying deviations from the ideal distribution. We derive rigorous bounds on the statistical distance for standard implementations and demonstrate the practical utility of our framework by enhancing APSEst, a DNF model counter, with improved reliability and error guarantees. To support practical adoption, we propose an interface extension that allows users to control and monitor statistical distance via explicit input/output parameters. Our findings emphasize the critical need for thorough and systematic error analysis in sampler design. As the first work to focus exclusively on Binomial samplers, our approach lays the groundwork for extending rigorous analysis to other common distributions, opening avenues for more robust and reliable randomized algorithms.</description>

      <title>A Minimum Distance Estimator Approach for Misspecified Ergodic Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12432v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a minimum distance estimator (MDE) for parameter identification in misspecified models characterized by a sequence of ergodic stochastic processes that converge weakly to the model of interest. The data is generated by the sequence of processes, and we are interested in inferring parameters for the limiting processes. We define a general statistical setting for parameter estimation under such model misspecification and prove the robustness of the MDE. Furthermore, we prove the asymptotic normality of the MDE for multiscale diffusion processes with a well-defined homogenized limit. A tractable numerical implementation of the MDE is provided and realized in the programming language Julia.</description>

      <title>Efficient Implementation of a Semiparametric Joint Model for Multivariate Longitudinal Biomarkers and Competing Risks Time-to-Event Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Joint modeling has become increasingly popular for characterizing the association between one or more longitudinal biomarkers and competing risks time-to-event outcomes. However, semiparametric multivariate joint modeling for large-scale data encounter substantial statistical and computational challenges, primarily due to the high dimensionality of random effects and the complexity of estimating nonparametric baseline hazards. These challenges often lead to prolonged computation time and excessive memory usage, limiting the utility of joint modeling for biobank-scale datasets. In this article, we introduce an efficient implementation of a semiparametric multivariate joint model, supported by a normal approximation and customized linear scan algorithms within an expectation-maximization (EM) framework. Our method significantly reduces computation time and memory consumption, enabling the analysis of data from thousands of subjects. The scalability and estimation accuracy of our approach are demonstrated through two simulation studies. We also present an application to the Primary Biliary Cirrhosis (PBC) dataset involving five longitudinal biomarkers as an illustrative example. A user-friendly R package, \texttt{FastJM}, has been developed for the shared random effects joint model with efficient implementation. The package is publicly available on the Comprehensive R Archive Network: https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=FastJM.</description>

      <title>Exploring Discrete Factor Analysis with the discFA Package in R</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Literature suggested that using the traditional factor analysis for the count data may be inappropriate. With that in mind, discrete factor analysis builds on fitting systems of dependent discrete random variables to data. The data should be in the form of non-negative counts. Data may also be truncated at some positive integer value. The discFA package in R allows for two distributions: Poisson and Negative Binomial, in combination with possible zero inflation and possible truncation, hence, eight different alternatives. A forward search algorithm is employed to find the model optimal factor model with the lowest AIC. Several different illustrative examples from psychology, agriculture, car industry, and a simulated data will be analyzed at the end.</description>

      <title>Penalised spline estimation of covariate-specific time-dependent ROC curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The identification of biomarkers with high predictive accuracy is a crucial task in medical research, as it can aid clinicians in making early decisions, thereby reducing morbidity and mortality in high-risk populations. Time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves are the main tool used to assess the accuracy of prognostic biomarkers for outcomes that evolve over time. Recognising the need to account for patient heterogeneity when evaluating the accuracy of a prognostic biomarker, we introduce a novel penalised-based estimator of the time-dependent ROC curve that accommodates a possible modifying effect of covariates. We consider flexible models for both the hazard function of the event time given the covariates and biomarker and for the location-scale regression model of the biomarker given covariates, enabling the accommodation of non-proportional hazards and nonlinear effects through penalised splines, thus overcoming limitations of earlier methods. The simulation study demonstrates that our approach successfully recovers the true functional form of the covariate-specific time-dependent ROC curve and the corresponding area under the curve across a variety of scenarios. Comparisons with existing methods further show that our approach performs favourably in multiple settings. Our approach is applied to evaluating the Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events risk score's ability to predict mortality after discharge in patients who have suffered an acute coronary syndrome and how this ability may vary with the left ventricular ejection fraction. An R package, CondTimeROC, implementing the proposed method is provided.</description>

      <title>Simplifying debiased inference via automatic differentiation and probabilistic programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08675v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce an algorithm that simplifies the construction of efficient estimators, making them accessible to a broader audience. 'Dimple' takes as input computer code representing a parameter of interest and outputs an efficient estimator. Unlike standard approaches, it does not require users to derive a functional derivative known as the efficient influence function. Dimple avoids this task by applying automatic differentiation to the statistical functional of interest. Doing so requires expressing this functional as a composition of primitives satisfying a novel differentiability condition. Dimple also uses this composition to determine the nuisances it must estimate. In software, primitives can be implemented independently of one another and reused across different estimation problems. We provide a proof-of-concept Python implementation and showcase through examples how it allows users to go from parameter specification to efficient estimation with just a few lines of code.</description>

      <title>Amortized Bayesian Multilevel Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13230v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multilevel models (MLMs) are a central building block of the Bayesian workflow. They enable joint, interpretable modeling of data across hierarchical levels and provide a fully probabilistic quantification of uncertainty. Despite their well-recognized advantages, MLMs pose significant computational challenges, often rendering their estimation and evaluation intractable within reasonable time constraints. Recent advances in simulation-based inference offer promising solutions for addressing complex probabilistic models using deep generative networks. However, the utility and reliability of deep learning methods for estimating Bayesian MLMs remains largely unexplored, especially when compared with gold-standard samplers. To this end, we explore a family of neural network architectures that leverage the probabilistic factorization of multilevel models to facilitate efficient neural network training and subsequent near-instant posterior inference on unseen datasets. We test our method on several real-world case studies and provide comprehensive comparisons to Stan's gold standard sampler, where possible. Finally, we provide an open-source implementation of our methods to stimulate further research in the nascent field of amortized Bayesian inference.</description>

      <title>On the Equivalence of Gaussian Graphical Models Defined on Complete Bipartite Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02384v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces two Gaussian graphical models defined on complete bipartite graphs. We show that the determinants of the precision matrices associated with the models are equal up to scale, where the scale factor only depends on model parameters. In this context, we will introduce a notion of ``equivalence" between the two Gaussian graphical models. This equivalence has two key applications: first, it can significantly reduce the complexity of computing the exact value of the determinant, and second, it enables the derivation of closed-form expressions for the determinants in certain special cases.</description>
