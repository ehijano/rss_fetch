      <title>Teaching Mathematics for Economists</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this chapter, I discuss teaching mathematical tools specifically tailored for economics students. A typical one-semester course in this area seeks to blend a range of topics: from foundational elements of subjects such as linear algebra and multivariate calculus to intermediate areas like real and convex analysis and further into advanced topics such as dynamic optimization in both continuous and discrete time. This breadth of coverage corresponds to material usually spread across multiple years in traditional mathematics programs. Given the comprehensive nature of these courses, careful selection of topics is essential, balancing numerous trade-offs. I discuss potential course sequences and instructional design choices. I then focus on conceptualizing and explaining mathematical modeling in economics. I reflect on three years of teaching an advanced undergraduate course in mathematical methods online. The latter part of the chapter offers examples and visualizations I have found particularly beneficial for imparting intuition to economics students. They cover a range of topics at different degrees of difficulty and are meant as a resource for instructors in Mathematics for Economists. Among these, I use the Ramsey model as a recurring example, especially relevant when designing a mathematical tools course with an orientation towards preparing students for macroeconomic analysis.</description>

      <title>Parable of the Parabola</title>

Abstract: We study triangles and quadrilaterals which are inscribed in a circle and circumscribed about a parabola. Although these are particular cases of the celebrated Poncelet's Theorem, in this paper we {\it do not assume} the theorem but prove it along the way. Similarly, our arguments here \emph{are logically independent} from Cayley's condition, describing points of a finite order on an elliptic curve or any other use of the theory of elliptic curves. Instead, we use purely planimetric methods, including the Joachimsthal notation, to fully describe such polygons and associated circles and parabolas. We prove that a circle contains the focus of a parabola if and only if there is a triangle inscribed in the circle and circumscribed about the parabola. We prove that if the center of a circle coincides with the focus of a parabola, then there exists a quadrilateral inscribed in the circle and circumscribed about the parabola. We further prove that the quadrilaterals obtained in such a way are antiparallelograms. If the center of a circle does not coincide with the focus of a parabola, then a quadrilateral inscribed in the circle and circumscribed about the parabola exists if and only if the directrix of the parabola contains the point of intersection of the polar of the focus with respect to the circle with the line determined by the center and the focus. That point coincides with the intersection of the diagonals of any quadrilateral inscribed in the circle and circumscribed about the parabola. In particular, for a given circle and a confocal pencil of parabolas with the focus different than the center of the circle, there is a unique parabola for which there exists a quadrilateral circumscribed about it and inscribed in the circle.</description>
