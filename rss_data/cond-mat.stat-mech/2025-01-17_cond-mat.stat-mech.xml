      <title>Generative diffusion model with inverse renormalization group flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models represent a class of generative models that produce data by denoising a sample corrupted by white noise. Despite the success of diffusion models in computer vision, audio synthesis, and point cloud generation, so far they overlook inherent multiscale structures in data and have a slow generation process due to many iteration steps. In physics, the renormalization group offers a fundamental framework for linking different scales and giving an accurate coarse-grained model. Here we introduce a renormalization group-based diffusion model that leverages multiscale nature of data distributions for realizing a high-quality data generation. In the spirit of renormalization group procedures, we define a flow equation that progressively erases data information from fine-scale details to coarse-grained structures. Through reversing the renormalization group flows, our model is able to generate high-quality samples in a coarse-to-fine manner. We validate the versatility of the model through applications to protein structure prediction and image generation. Our model consistently outperforms conventional diffusion models across standard evaluation metrics, enhancing sample quality and/or accelerating sampling speed by an order of magnitude. The proposed method alleviates the need for data-dependent tuning of hyperparameters in the generative diffusion models, showing promise for systematically increasing sample efficiency based on the concept of the renormalization group.</description>

      <title>Critical relaxational dynamics at the continuous transitions of three-dimensional spin models with ${\mathbb Z}_2$ gauge symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterize the dynamic universality classes of a relaxational dynamics under equilibrium conditions at the continuous transitions of three-dimensional (3D) spin systems with a ${\mathbb Z}_2$-gauge symmetry. In particular, we consider the pure lattice ${\mathbb Z}_2$-gauge model and the lattice ${\mathbb Z}_2$-gauge XY model, which present various types of transitions: topological transitions without a local order parameter and transitions characterized by both gauge-invariant and non-gauge-invariant XY order parameters. We consider a standard relaxational (locally reversible) Metropolis dynamics and determine the dynamic critical exponent $z$ that characterizes the critical slowing down of the dynamics as the continuous transition is approached. At the topological ${\mathbb Z}_2$-gauge transitions we find $z=2.55(6)$. Therefore, the dynamics is significantly slower than in Ising systems -- $z\approx 2.02$ for the 3D Ising universality class -- although 3D ${\mathbb Z}_2$-gauge systems and Ising systems have the same static critical behavior because of duality. As for the nontopological transitions in the 3D ${\mathbb Z}_2$-gauge XY model, we find that their critical dynamics belong to the same dynamic universality class as the relaxational dynamics in ungauged XY systems, independently of the gauge-invariant or nongauge-invariant nature of the order parameter at the transition.</description>

      <title>A simple model of a sequence-reading diffusion: non-self-averaging and self-averaging properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by a question about the sensitivity of knots' diffusive motion to the actual sequence of nucleotides placed on a given DNA, here we study a simple model of a sequence-reading diffusion on a stretched chain with a frozen sequence of "letters" $A$ and $B$, having different interaction energies. The chain contains a single distortion - a hernia - which brings the two letters at its bottom together such that they interact. Due to interactions with the solvent, the hernia performs a random hopping motion along the chain with the transition rates dependent on its actual position. Our two focal questions are a) the dependence of various transport properties on the letters' interaction energy and b) whether these properties are self-averaging with respect to different realizations of sequences. We show that the current through a finite interval, the resistance of this interval and the splitting probabilities on this interval lack self-averaging. On the contrary, the mean first-passage time through a finite interval with $N$ sites and the diffusion coefficient in a periodic chain are self-averaging in the limit $N \to \infty$. Concurrently, two latter properties exhibit sample-to-sample fluctuations for finite $N$, as evidenced by numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Models for Tension-Dependent DNA Looping Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The influence of tension on DNA looping has been studied both experimentally and theoretically in the past. However, different theoretical models have yielded different predictions, leaving uncertainty about their validity. We briefly review the predictions of those models and propose a novel model that demonstrates exceptional agreement with simulations for long semiflexible chains. Additionally, we elucidate the relationship between our result and that of the previously proposed two-state model, highlighting the distinct interpretative approach that underpins our framework. Our findings offer predictive insights that pave the way for future experimental validation.</description>

      <title>Optimal paths and dynamical symmetry breaking in the current fluctuations of driven diffusive media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large deviation theory provides a framework to understand macroscopic fluctuations and collective phenomena in many-body nonequilibrium systems in terms of microscopic dynamics. In these lecture notes we discuss the large deviation statistics of the current, a central observable out of equilibrium, using mostly macroscopic fluctuation theory (MFT) but also microscopic spectral methods. Special emphasis is put on describing the optimal path leading to a rare fluctuation, as well as on different dynamical symmetry breaking phenomena that appear at the fluctuating level. We start with an overview of trajectory statistics in driven diffusive systems as described by MFT. We discuss the additivity principle, a simplifying conjecture to compute the current distribution in one-dimensional nonequilibrium systems, and extend this idea to higher dimensions, where the nonlocal structure of the optimal current vector field becomes crucial. Next we explore dynamical phase transitions (DPTs) in current fluctuations, which manifest as symmetry-breaking events in trajectory statistics. These include particle-hole symmetry-breaking DPTs in open channels, for which we work out a Landau-like theory as well as the joint statistics of the current and the order parameter. Time-translation symmetry-breaking DPTs in periodic systems are also discussed, where coherent traveling condensates emerge to facilitate current deviations. We also discuss the microscopic spectral mechanism leading to these DPTs, which is linked to an emerging degeneracy of the leading eigenspace. Using this spectral perspective, we find the signatures of the recently discovered time-crystal phases of matter in traveling-wave DPTs, and use Doob's transform to propose a packing-field mechanism to create programmable time-crystals in driven systems. Finally, we address open challenges and future directions in this rapidly evolving field.</description>

      <title>Chemical master equation parameter exploration using DMRG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Well-mixed chemical reaction networks (CRNs) contain many distinct chemical species with copy numbers that fluctuate in correlated ways. While those correlations are typically monitored via Monte Carlo sampling of stochastic trajectories, there is interest in systematically approximating the joint distribution over the exponentially large number of possible microstates using tensor networks or tensor trains. We exploit the tensor network strategy to determine when the steady state of a seven-species gene toggle switch CRN model supports bistability as a function of two decomposition rates, both parameters of the kinetic model. We highlight how the tensor network solution captures the effects of stochastic fluctuations, going beyond mean field and indeed deviating meaningfully from a mean-field analysis. The work furthermore develops and demonstrates several technical advances that will allow steady-states of broad classes of CRNs to be computed in a manner conducive to parameter exploration. We show that the steady-state distributions can be computed via the ordinary density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) algorithm despite having a non-Hermitian rate operator with a small spectral gap, we illustrate how that steady-state distribution can be efficiently projected to an order parameter that identifies bimodality, and we employ excited-state DMRG to calculate a relaxation timescale for the bistability.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of the Page curve in Markovian open quantum systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Typically, the von Neumann entropy of a subsystem increases until it plateaus at the thermal value. Under some circumstances, however, the intermediate value can dwarf the final value, even if the subsystem starts in a pure state. A famous example in the context of the black hole information paradox is the entropy of the Hawking radiation, where this behaviour is dubbed the Page curve. More generally, this is the case for excited systems weakly coupled to cold reservoirs. Here we study the entropy dynamics for Lindbladian evolution, i.e. open quantum systems in weak contact with Markovian reservoirs. This allows us to study the non-equilibrium thermodynamics of the subsystem entropy decrease and link it to Landauer's principle: the entropy decrease must be accompanied by a heat flow out of the system. We give an analytic expression of the entanglement dynamics for a decaying excitation in a two-level system and study it under equilibration of a localised oscillator. In both cases the Page time occurs when half the initial energy has left the system.</description>

      <title>At low temperatures, glass-forming liquids relax in a simple way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Glass-forming liquids have only a modest tendency to crystallize and hence their dynamics can be studied even below the melting temperature. The relaxation dynamics of most of these liquids shows at a temperature $T_c$, somewhat above the glass-transition temperature $T_g$, a crossover, which indicates the conjunction of two different dynamical regimes. For temperatures slightly above $T_c$, experiments and computer simulations have extensively probed this dynamics on the particle level and identified several universal scaling laws that are often compatible with theoretical predictions. Using large scale computer simulations we extend these studies to temperatures below $T_c$ and find that the relaxation mechanism is qualitatively different from the one found at higher temperatures. We identify new scaling laws that allow to give a simple description of the relaxation dynamics at very low $T$s. Specifically we reveal that the cage-escape process is related to rare but large particle displacements that give rise to a distinctive sub-diffusive power-law in the time correlation functions. This insight helps to advance our understanding on the relaxation dynamics of glass-forming systems at temperatures that are close to the experimental glass transition.</description>

      <title>Variational method for $\mathbb{Z}_K$ wavefunctions in spin-$J$ PXP model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the approach of time-dependent variational principle (TDVP) for the one-dimensional spin-$J$ PXP model with detuning, which is relevant for programmable Rydberg atom arrays. The variational manifold is chosen as the minimally entangled $\mathbb{Z}_K$ matrix-product-states (MPS). We demonstrate that variational dynamics and variational error can be expressed as rapidly convergent series in the thermodynamic limit. In particular, for $J=1/2$ and the limiting case $J\rightarrow \infty$, the TDVP results become exact and significantly simplified.</description>

      <title>Unpolarized prethermal discrete time crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Prethermal discrete time crystals (DTCs) are a class of nonequilibrium phases of matter that exhibit robust subharmonic responses to periodic driving without requiring disorder. Prior realizations of prethermal DTCs have relied on the presence of either spontaneous or induced finite polarization. Here, we introduce a new class of prethermal DTCs termed unpolarized prethermal discrete time crystals (UPDTCs) that do not require finite polarization. By studying a spin model of periodically driven trapped ions, we show that robust period-doubled dynamics can persist in the autocorrelation function of the staggered magnetization for paramagnetic initial states, even when the staggered magnetization itself vanishes. The key insight is that quantum fluctuations alone are sufficient to reveal coherent DTC-like dynamics. We demonstrate that UPDTCs are exponentially long-lived in the high-frequency driving regime, consistent with Floquet prethermalization. Our results expand the known phenomenology of prethermal time crystals and underscore the role of quantum effects in stabilizing novel nonequilibrium phases. We propose an experimental protocol to observe UPDTCs in trapped-ion simulators.</description>

      <title>From Complexification to Self-Similarity: New Aspects of Quantum Criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum phase transitions are a fascinating area of condensed matter physics. The extension through complexification not only broadens the scope of this field but also offers a new framework for understanding criticality and its statistical implications. This mini review provides a concise overview of recent developments in complexification, primarily covering finite temperature and equilibrium quantum phase transitions, as well as their connection with dynamical quantum phase transitions and non-Hermitian physics, with a particular focus on the significance of Fisher zeros. Starting from the newly discovered self-similarity phenomenon associated with complex partition functions, we further discuss research on self-similar systems briefly. Finally, we offer a perspective on these aspects.</description>

      <title>Detecting Many-Body Scars from Fisher Zeros</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The far-from-equilibrium dynamics of interacting quantum systems still defy precise understanding. One example is the so-called quantum many-body scars (QMBSs), where a set of energy eigenstates evade thermalization to give rise to long-lived oscillations. Despite the success of viewing scars from the perspectives of symmetry, commutant algebra and quasiparticles, it remains a challenge to elucidate the mechanism underlying all QMBS and to distinguish them from other forms of ergodicity breaking. In this work, we introduce an alternative route to detect and diagnose QMBS based on Fisher zeros, i.e. the patterns of zeros of the analytically continued partition function $Z$ on the complex $\beta$ (inverse temperature) plane. For systems with scars, a continuous line of Fisher zeros will appear off the imaginary $\beta$ axis and extend upward, separating the $\beta$ plane into regions with distinctive thermalization behaviors. This conjecture is motivated from interpreting the complex $Z$ as the survival amplitude of the thermofield double state, and it is validated by analyzing two models with QMBS, the $\bar{P}X\bar{P}$ model and the Ising chain in external fields. These models also illustrate another scenario of ergodicity breaking, where lines of Fisher zeros repeatedly intersect the imaginary $\beta$ axis. This ``statistical mechanics" approach places QMBS within the same framework of thermal and dynamical phase transitions. It has the advantage of easily spotting the emergence of scars without exhaustively examining each individual quantum state.</description>

      <title>The quantum relative entropy of the Schwarzschild black-hole and the area law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09491v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The area law obeyed by the thermodynamic entropy of black holes is one of the fundamental results relating gravity to statistical mechanics. In this work we provide a derivation of the area law for the quantum relative entropy of the Schwarzschild black-hole for arbitrary Schwarzschild radius. The quantum relative entropy between the metric of the manifold and the metric induced by the geometry and the matter field has been proposed in G. Bianconi ``Gravity from entropy" (2024) as the action for entropic quantum gravity leading to modified Einstein equations. The quantum relative entropy generalizes Araki entropy and treats the metrics between zero-forms, one-forms, and two-forms as quantum operators. Although the Schwarzschild metric is not an exact solution of the modified Einstein equations of the entropic quantum gravity, it is an approximate solution valid in the low coupling limit. Here we show that the quantum relative entropy associated to the Schwarzschild metric obeys the area law for large Schwarzschild radius. We provide a full statistical mechanics interpretation of the results.</description>

      <title>Unifying quantum stochastic methods using Wick's theorem on the Keldysh contour</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new method based on the Keldysh formalism to derive stochastic master equations for the non-Markovian evolution of a quantum system coupled to a Gaussian environment. Using this approach, we develop a compact expression for the propagator of the system's dynamics, naturally formulated on the Keldysh contour. This expression is shown to be equivalent to other formulations, such as the stochastic von Neumann equation (SVNE). A key advantage of our method is its flexibility, as it can be easily adapted to account for initial system-bath correlations, and its simplicity, as it does not rely on path integration techniques or superoperator representations, unlike previous approaches. The insight offered by our technique allows us to make some considerations on the nature of the noises appearing in the SVNE. We prove that the solution of the SVNE can be written in terms of a single physical noise without loss of information. We then envision a semiclassical scenario in which such noise can be interpreted in terms of an initial measurement process on the environment.</description>

      <title>Bridging conformal field theory and parton approaches to SU(n)_k chiral spin liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We employ the SU(n)_k Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) model in conformal field theory to construct lattice wave functions in both one and two dimensions. It is unveiled that these wave functions can be reinterpreted as parton states, which enables efficient conversion to matrix product states such that many physical properties can be evaluated directly. In one dimension, these wave functions describe critical spin chains whose universality classes are in one-to-one correspondence with the WZW models used in the construction. In two dimensions, our constructions yield model wave functions for chiral spin liquids, and we show how to find all topological sectors of them in a systematic way. Using the null vectors of Kac-Moody algebras, parent Hamiltonians of the SU(3)_k series are derived. The SU(3)_k chiral spin liquids are lattice analogs of non-Abelian spin-singlet fractional quantum Hall states, and the k = 2 member hosts Fibonacci anyons.</description>

      <title>Supersolid dipolar phases in planar geometry: effects of tilted polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The behavior of dipolar Bose-Einstein condensates in planar geometries is investigated, focusing on the effects of the polarization orientation. While perpendicular polarization produces a phase diagram with hexagonal, stripes, and honeycomb phases ending at a single critical point, the presence of an in-plane polarization component transforms the critical point into three critical lines, separating two phases at a time and changing radically the appearance of the phase diagram. All transition lines contain first- and second-order regions, while the phase diagram itself shows a resemblance with those displayed by quasi-one-dimensional dipolar systems. Finally, we investigate the effect of introducing an in-plane polarization on the structural properties of the phases and determine the superfluid fraction. Our results show that this process induces an axial deformation on the hexagonal and honeycomb phases, resulting in an anisotropic behavior in the long distance properties of the system like superfluidity. We expect that the rich phenomenology observed provides motivation for new experiments and theoretical works.</description>

Abstract: We compute analytically the probability distribution and moments of the sum and product of the non-zero eigenvalues and singular values of random matrices with (i) non-negative entries, (ii) fixed rank, and (iii) prescribed sums of the entries in each row. Applications of such matrices are discussed in the context of Markov chains, economics and social networks to name a few. All results are valid at finite matrix size and are given in terms of the statistics of vectors of general Dirichlet random variables. Analytical results are corroborated by numerical simulations throughout with excellent agreement.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic nature of irreversibility in active matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.03625v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Active matter describes systems whose constituents convert energy from their surroundings into directed motion, such as bacteria or catalytic colloids. We establish a thermodynamic law for dilute suspensions of interacting active particles in the form of a remarkable direct link between their dynamics and thermodynamics: The rate at which irreversibility is built up in the non-equilibrium steady state is a state function of the thermodynamic system parameters, namely the number of particles, the temperature and, as a distinctive characteristic of active matter, the swim pressure. Like in the famous fluctuation theorems of stochastic thermodynamics, irreversibility is a dynamical measure that quantifies the amount by which microscopic particle trajectories break time-reversal symmetry, without reference to the typically unobservable processes underlying self-propulsion. We derive the result for the paradigmatic model of active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck particles with short-ranged repulsive interactions. Based on numerical simulations and heuristic arguments, we furthermore present a refined relation whose validity extends from the dilute into the phase-separated (MIPS) regime.</description>

      <title>Nucleation transitions in polycontextural networks toward consensus</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16569v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, we proposed polycontextural networks as a model of evolving systems of interacting beliefs. Here, we present an analysis of the phase transition as well as the scaling properties. The model contains interacting agents that strive for consensus, each with only subjective perception. Depending on a parameter that governs how responsive the agents are to changing their belief systems the model exhibits a phase transition that mediates between an active phase where the agents constantly change their beliefs and a frozen phase, where almost no changes appear. We observe the build-up of convention-aligned clusters only in the intermediate regime of diverging susceptibility. Here, we analyze in detail the behavior of polycontextural networks close to this transition. We provide an analytical estimate of the critical point and show that the scaling properties and the space-time structure of these clusters show self-similar behavior. Our results not only contribute to a better understanding of the emergence of consensus in systems of distributed beliefs but also show that polycontextural networks are models, motivated by social systems, where susceptibility -- the sensitivity to change own beliefs -- drives the growth of consensus clusters.</description>

      <title>Rotations, Negative Eigenvalues, and Newton Method in Tensor Network Renormalization Group</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10312v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the tensor network approach to statistical physics, properties of the critical point of a 2D lattice model are encoded by a four-legged tensor which is a fixed point of an RG map. The traditional way to find the fixed point tensor consists in iterating the RG map after having tuned the temperature to criticality. Here we develop a different and more direct technique, which solves the fixed point equation via the Newton method. This is challenging due to the existence of marginal deformations -- linear transformations of the coordinate frame, which parametrize a two-dimensional family of fixed points. We address this challenge by including a 90 degree rotation into the RG map. This flips the sign of the problematic marginal eigenvalues, rendering the fixed point isolated and accessible via the Newton method. We demonstrate the power of this technique via explicit computations for the 2D Ising and 3-state Potts models. Using the Gilt-TNR algorithm at bond dimension $\chi=30$, we find the fixed point tensors with $10^{-9}$ accuracy, much higher than what was previously achieved.</description>

      <title>Competing structures in a minimal double-well potential model of condensed matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.17901v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The microscopic structure of several amorphous substances often reveals complex patterns such as medium- or long-range order, spatial heterogeneity, and even local polycrystallinity. To capture all these features, models usually incorporate a refined description of the particle interaction that includes an ad hoc design of the inside of the system constituents, and use temperature as a control parameter. We show that all these features can emerge from a minimal athermal two-dimensional model where particles interact isotropically by a double-well potential, which includes an excluded volume and a maximum coordination number. The rich variety of structural patterns shown by this simple geometrical model apply to a wide range of real systems including water, silicon, and different amorphous materials.</description>

      <title>Energy-filtered quantum states and the emergence of non-local correlations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02158v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Energy-filtered quantum states are promising candidates for efficiently simulating thermal states. We explore a protocol designed to transition a product state into an eigenstate located in the middle of the spectrum; this is achieved by gradually reducing its energy variance, which allows us to comprehensively understand the crossover phenomenon and the subsequent convergence towards thermal behavior. We introduce and discuss three energy-filtering regimes (short, medium and long), and we interpret them as stages of thermalization. We show that the properties of the filtered states are locally indistinguishable from those of time-averaged density matrices, routinely employed in the theory of thermalization. On the other hand, unexpected non-local quantum correlations are generated in the medium regimes and are witnessed by the R\'enyi entanglement entropies of subsystems, which we compute via replica methods. Specifically, two-point correlation functions break cluster decomposition and the entanglement entropy of large regions scales as the logarithm of the volume during the medium filter time.</description>

      <title>Free energy equivalence between mean-field models and nonsparsely diluted mean-field models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13245v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We studied nonsparsely diluted mean-field models that differ from sparsely diluted mean-field models, such as the Viana--Bray model. When the existence probability of each edge follows a Bernoulli distribution, we rigorously prove that the free energy of nonsparsely diluted mean-field models with appropriate parameterization coincides exactly with that of the corresponding mean-field models in ferromagnetic and spin-glass models composed of any discrete spin $S$ in the thermodynamic limit. Our results is a broad generalization of the result of a previous study [Bovier and Gayrard, J. Stat. Phys. 72, 643 (1993)], where the densely diluted mean-field ferromagnetic Ising model (diluted Curie--Weiss model) with appropriate parameterization was analyzed rigorously, and it was proven that its free energy was exactly equivalent to that of the corresponding mean-field model (Curie--Weiss model).</description>

      <title>Exact Fisher zeros and thermofield dynamics across a quantum critical point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18981v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By setting the inverse temperature $\beta$ loose to occupy the complex plane, Fisher showed that the zeros of the complex partition function $Z$, if approaching the real $\beta$ axis, reveal a thermodynamic phase transition. More recently, Fisher zeros were used to mark the dynamical phase transition in quench dynamics. It remains unclear, however, how Fisher zeros can be employed to better understand quantum phase transitions or the non-unitary dynamics of open quantum systems. Here we answer this question by a comprehensive analysis of the analytically continued one-dimensional transverse field Ising model. We exhaust all the Fisher zeros to show that in the thermodynamic limit they congregate into a remarkably simple pattern in the form of continuous open or closed lines. These Fisher lines evolve smoothly as the coupling constant is tuned, and a qualitative change identifies the quantum critical point. By exploiting the connection between $Z$ and the thermofield double states, we obtain analytical expressions for the short- and long-time dynamics of the survival amplitude, including its scaling behavior at the quantum critical point. We point out $Z$ can be realized and probed in monitored quantum circuits. The exact analytical results are corroborated by the numerical tensor renormalization group. We further show that similar patterns of Fisher zeros also emerge in other spin models. Therefore, the approach outlined may serve as a powerful tool for interacting quantum systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12752v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rydberg tweezer arrays provide a versatile platform to explore quantum magnets with dipolar XY or van-der-Waals Ising ZZ interactions. Here, we propose a scheme combining dipolar and van-der-Waals interactions between two Rydberg states, where the amplitude of the latter can be greater than that of the former, realizing an extended Hubbard model with long-range tunnelings in optical tweezer arrays. On the triangular lattice with repulsive interactions, we predict the existence of a robust supersolid phase with a critical entropy per particle $S/N \approx 0.19$ accessible in current Rydberg tweezer experiments supported by large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulations. We further demonstrate the experimental feasibility by identifying pairs of Rydberg states in ${}^{87}$Rb realizing the required interactions. Such a lattice supersolid is long-lived, found over a wide parameter range in an isotropic and flat two-dimensional geometry, and can be realized for 100s of particles allowing one to directly probe the defect-induced picture of supersolids. Its thermodynamical and dynamical properties can hence be studied at a far larger scale than hitherto possible.</description>

      <title>Robustness of quantum many-body scars in the presence of Markovian bath</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00886v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A generic closed quantum many-body system will inevitably tend to thermalization, whose local information encoded in the initial state eventually scrambles into the full space, known as quantum ergodicity. A paradigmatic exception in closed quantum systems for strong ergodicity breaking is known as many-body localization, where strong disorder-induced localization prevents the occurrence of thermalization. It is generally recognized that a localized quantum system would be delocalized under dissipation induced by the environment. However, this consequence recently has received challenges where an exotic dissipation-induced localization mechanism is proposed, and transitions between localized and extended phases are found. In this Letter, we promote this mechanism to systems for weak ergodicity breaking hosting quantum many-body scars (QMBS). We find that the system relaxes to a steady state dominated by QMBS, and the dissipative dynamics exhibit dynamic revivals by suitably preparing an initial state. We point out an experimental realization of the controlled dissipation with a cold atomic setup. This makes the signature of ergodicity breaking visible over dissipative dynamics and offers potential possibilities for experimentally preparing stable QMBS with associated coherent dynamics.</description>

Abstract: A compilation of new results on the asymptotic behaviour of the Humbert functions $\Psi_1$ and $\Psi_2$, and also on the Appell function $F_2$, is presented. As a by-product, we confirm a conjectured limit which appeared recently in the study of the $1D$ Glauber-Ising model. We also propose two elementary asymptotic methods and confirm through some illustrative examples that both methods have great potential and can be applied to a large class of problems of asymptotic analysis. Finally, some directions of future research are pointed out in order to suggest ideas for further study.</description>
