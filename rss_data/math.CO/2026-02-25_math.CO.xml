      <title>Recursive Patterns in the Chocolate Game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the recursive structure of P-positions in the chocolate game $C_{m,m}$, an impartial game played on an $m \times m$ chocolate bar. We show that the set of P-positions exhibits self-similar patterns that can be described and enumerated recursively. We further establish a correspondence between these patterns and the cross-sections of a three-dimensional Sierpi\'nski octahedron. Finally, we show that the P-positions can be generated by a second-order cellular automaton, analogous to the onedimensional Rule-60 automaton. Our results reveal deep connections between combinatorial games, fractal geometry, and discrete dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Incomplete Open Platonic Solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sol LeWitt famously enumerated all the incomplete open cubes, finding 122 of these connected, non-planar subsets of the edges of the cube.
  Since then, while several projects have revisited the cube enumeration, no such enumeration has been published for any other interesting solid.
  In this paper we present work on enumerating all the incomplete open platonic solids, finding 6 tetrahedra, 122 cubes (just like LeWitt), 185 octahedra, 2\,423\,206 dodecahedra and 16\,096\,166 icosahedra.</description>

      <title>Corrections to classical results on Independence and Covering numbers of the Splitting graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The splitting graph $S(G)$ of a finite simple graph $G$ was introduced by Sampathkumar and Walikar in 1980~\cite{SW1980} and has been extensively studied in relation to graph invariants of $G$. In their original work, several formulas relating the independence number and the vertex cover number of $S(G)$ to the corresponding parameters of $G$ were stated and subsequently cited in the literature. In this paper, we show that some of these classical equalities do not hold in general. We present explicit counterexamples disproving the published results concerning independence and vertex cover numbers of splitting graphs. Moreover, we establish the correct formulas and precisely characterize the cases in which the original statements are valid and those in which they fail. These results correct an error that has remained unnoticed for more than four decades and provide a clearer understanding of splitting graphs from the perspective of independence and vertex cover number.</description>

      <title>Quantizing Pythagorean triples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a $q$-deformation of the Pythagoras equation $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$, which is a polynomial version of it different from the standard one. We construct a polynomial analogue, or ``$q$-analogue'', of every primitive Pythagorean triple. We also construct such analogue for a larger class of Pythagorean triples called standard. Our approach is based on the notion of $q$-deformed rational numbers and the modular group $\mathrm{PSL}(2,\mathbb{Z})$.</description>

      <title>Generating functions for compositions with constrained even parts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study compositions of a positive integer $n$ in which the occurrence of even parts larger than a fixed threshold $k$ is controlled. More precisely, for each composition $m=(m_1,\dots,m_r)$ we consider the number of even parts strictly larger than $k$, and we introduce a two-variable generating function that encodes this statistic.  We show that this generating function is rational and obtain explicit closed forms, depending on the parity of $k$. As a consequence, we derive exact counting formulas and linear recurrence relations for the number of compositions of $n$ with a prescribed number of even parts greater than $k$. We also obtain explicit formulas for related refined quantities, such as the number of compositions with an even or odd number of such parts, the total number of their occurrences among all compositions of $n$, and positional statistics describing how late the first such part appears in a composition.  This combinatorial problem is motivated by questions arising from combinatorial expansions related to zeta functions of algebraic curves over finite fields, although the results of this paper are entirely combinatorial.</description>

      <title>Preserving Hodge Vectors of Lattice Polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given lattice polytopes $P_1, \ldots, P_k$ contained in a $k$-dimensional subspace $U \subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$ and a $d$-dimensional lattice polytope $Q \subset \mathbb{R}^d$, we compute the Hodge vector of the Cayley polytope $P_1 * \cdots * P_k * Q$, and show that it equals the mixed volume of $P_1, \ldots, P_k$ times the Hodge vector of the projection of $Q$ along $U$. Here, the Hodge vector of a lattice polytope is its local $h^*$-vector with leading and trailing zeroes removed. This result allows finding infinitely many high-dimensional lattice polytopes with the same Hodge vector that are not free joins. The proof relies on a closed formula for the Hodge-Deligne polynomial of generic complete intersections in the torus in terms of the bivariate/mixed $h^*$-polynomial. A special case of our construction is what we call Lawrence twists: extending the Gale transform by centrally-symmetric pairs of vectors. As applications, we can produce many new thin polytopes answering a question by Borger, Kretschmer and the second author, and we provide an alternative explanation of the thinness of $B_k$-polytopes answering a question of Selyanin.</description>

      <title>The $d$-dimensional realisation number of a rigid graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Determining the number of (complex) realisations of a rigid graph for a specific choice of edge lengths is a fundamental problem in discrete geometry. In this article we provide two new tools for determining realisation numbers in arbitrary dimensions: (i) we prove that subgraph inclusion translates to realisation number divisibility; and (ii) we provide lower bounds on realisation numbers under specific graph operations in all dimensions. We use these methods to prove that every triangulated sphere with $n$ vertices has at least $2^{n-4}$ edge-length equivalent realisations in 3-dimensions, extending a 2-dimensional result of Jackson and Owen in the case of planar graphs. Additionally, our tools solve a family of conjectures set by Grasegger regarding how 1-extensions, X-replacements, and V-replacements affect realisation numbers.</description>

      <title>Semi-magic dihedral squares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma$ be a group of order $n^2$ and $SMS_{\Gamma}(n)=(a_{i,j})_{n\times n}$ be an $n\times n$ array whose entries are all distinct elements of $\Gamma$. If there exists an element $\mu\in\Gamma$ such that for every row $i$, there exists an ordering of elements such that
  $$
  a_{i,j_1} a_{i,j_2} \dots a_{i,j_{n-1}} a_{i,j_n} = \mu
  $$
  and for every column $j$ there exists an ordering of elements such that
  $$
  a_{i_1,j} a_{i_2,j} \dots a_{i_{m-1},j} a_{i_m,j} = \mu,
  $$
  then $SMS_{\Gamma}(n)$ is called a \emph{$\Gamma$-semi-magic square of side $n$} and $\mu$ is called a \emph{magic constant}.
  We provide a complete characterization of semi-magic squares of side $n$ whose entries belong to a dihedral group $D_k$. Moreover, we show that in our constructions a single semi-magic square may admit two distinct magic constants, depending on the order in which the products are computed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.20783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we will give a structure theory for signed graphs with fixed smallest eigenvalue and investigate signed graphs with smallest eigenvalue greater than $-1-\sqrt{2}$. Given a real number $\lambda\leq -1$, we show that the following hold for each signed graph $(G,\sigma)$ with smallest eigenvalue at least $\lambda$ and large minimum valency: $\mathrm{(i)}$ there exist dense induced subgraphs $N_1, \dots, N_r$ in $(G,\sigma)$ such that each vertex lies in at most $\lfloor -\lambda\rfloor$ $N_i$'s and almost all edges of $(G,\sigma)$ lie in at least one of the $N_i$'s; $\mathrm{(ii)}$ if $\lambda&gt;-1-\sqrt{2}$, then $(G,\sigma)$ has smallest eigenvalue at least $-2$ and $(G,\sigma)$ is $1$-integrable.</description>

      <title>The maximum diameter of $d$-dimensional simplicial complexes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.20890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For every fixed dimension $d$ and sufficiently large $n$, we determine the maximum possible diameter of a strongly connected $d$-dimensional simplicial complex on $n$ vertices. This improves on a sequence of previous results and settles a problem of Santos from 2013. On the way, as a special case, we also characterise the existence of an extra-tight Euler tour in the complete $d$-uniform hypergraph on $n$ vertices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.20919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recent breakthrough, Kalmynin proved a conjecture of Lev--Sonn and a conjecture of S\'{a}rk\"{o}zy on additive decompositions of multiplicative subgroups of a prime field. In this paper, we prove a multiplicative analogue of Kalmynin's result on a generalization of the Lev--Sonn conjecture, inspired by a relevant conjecture of S\'{a}rk\"{o}zy. We show that all nonzero shifts of proper multiplicative subgroups (of size at least $3$) are not ratio sets of the form $A/A$. This in particular extends a result of Shkredov, where he showed the same for small multiplicative subgroups (of size $&lt;p^{6/7}$ in $\mathbb{F}_p$). We also prove an analogous statement over complex numbers for finite subgroups of the unit circle, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Robinson spaces and their representation in low-dimensional metric spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robinson spaces are structures equipped with a total order that encodes comparative dissimilarity relationships.
  We study the problem of representing Robinson dissimilarity spaces into low-dimensional metric spaces. These representations aim to preserve the relative dissimilarity relationships between elements rather than their exact values. While low dimensional Euclidean spaces such as $\mathbb{R}^1$ and $\mathbb{R}^2$ are natural candidates for such embeddings, previous work has shown that not all Robinson spaces admit a valid embedding in the real line that respects their structural constraints. Motivated by this limitation, we explore the broader class of real trees, which retain low-dimensional interpretability while allowing greater flexibility.
  To address the embedding problem, we develop two key tools: a combinatorial representation of Robinson spaces and a topological characterization of caterpillars, a restricted class of real trees. These tools enable a formulation of the embedding problem as a linear program, providing both computational and theoretical insights. We prove that some subclasses of Robinson spaces always admit embeddings in a caterpillar, and we establish the existence of Robinson spaces that cannot be embedded in any real tree. These results clarify the geometric limitations of representing ordered dissimilarity structures and open new directions for studying the interaction between dissimilarity, order, and metric geometry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.21067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterize linear lexicographic $p$-ary codes. Using this characterization, when $p \ge 3$, we determine the dimensions of linear lexicographic codes obtained from several bases including the standard basis, except for those of certain minimum distances. In these excluded cases, we may obtain linear codes of higher dimensions; for instance, when $p = 3$ and $d = 6$, the ternary Golay code is obtained.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.21194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The wavefunction of the universe, as studied in perturbative quantum field theory, is a rational function whose singularities and factorization properties encode a rich underlying combinatorial structure. We define and study a broad generalization of such wavefunctions that can be associated to any lattice. We obtain these wavefunctions as the Laplace transform of a polyhedral fan, the universe fan, whose cones are defined by positivity conditions reflecting a notion of causality in the lattice, and we describe its face lattice. In the matroid case, the universe fan projects to the nested set fan, and the wavefunctions we define recover the matroid amplitudes introduced by Lam as residues. Moreover, in the case relevant for physics, the positivity conditions give a novel way to study the wavefunction, and we show how it is related to the cosmological polytopes of Arkani-Hamed, Benincasa, Postnikov. Finally, we study refinements of the universe fan induced by piecewise linear (tropical) functions. The resulting subdivisions project to refinements of the nested set fan and correspond dually to blow-ups of matroid polytopes, generalizing the cosmohedron polytope.</description>

      <title>Sharp isoperimetric inequalities on the Hamming cube II: The critical exponent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A sharp isoperimetric inequality for the Hamming cube is proved at the critical exponent $\beta=\frac12$. This follows up on previous work, where such bounds were established for $\beta$ near $\frac12$. As a consequence, this result settles a conjecture of Kahn and Park on cube partitions and yields a sharp $L^1$ Poincar\'e inequality for Boolean-valued functions. It also confirms a low-noise limit for balanced functions predicted by the Hellinger conjecture on noisy Boolean channels in information theory.</description>

      <title>Kazhdan-Lusztig bases of parabolic Hecke algebras and applications to Schur-Weyl duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With an eye to applications to type A and Schur-Weyl duality, we study Kazhdan-Lusztig bases for a general parabolic Hecke algebra. Parabolic Hecke algebras are idempotent subalgebras of Hecke algebras corresponding to parabolic subgroups, and for type A they coincide with the fused Hecke algebras appearing in a generalisation of the Schur-Weyl duality with the quantum group of GL(N). In this paper we investigate two different Kazhdan-Lusztig bases for parabolic Hecke algebras, together with the associated cells and the corresponding representations. We quickly specialise to type A, for which we describe the cells in terms of the RSK correspondence generalising thus the well-known description for the symmetric group. As a first application we recover the classification of irreducible representations of parabolic Hecke algebras of type A and provide a new construction of these representations. Next we turn to the Schur-Weyl duality and describe the kernel in terms of one the basis studied precedently. Moreover, we formulate some conjectures about a generator of these kernels in terms of Kazhdan-Lusztig basis elements, give some evidence and prove these conjectures in some special cases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.11883v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is known that, if removing some $n$ edges from a graph $\Gamma$ destroys all subgraphs isomorphic to a given finite graph $K$, then all subgraphs isomorphic to $K$ can be destroyed by removing at most $|E(K)|\cdot n$ edges, which form a set invariant with respect to all automorphisms of $\Gamma$. We construct the first examples of (connected) graphs $K$ for which this estimate is not sharp. Our arguments are based on a ``weighted analogue'' of an earlier known estimate for the cost of symmetry.</description>

Abstract: The \textit{generalized Tur\'an number} $\mathrm{ex}(n, T, F)$ is the maximum possible number of copies of $T$ in an $F$-free graph on $n$ vertices for any two graphs $T$ and $F$. For the book graph $B_t$, there is a close connection between $\ex(n,K_3,B_t)$ and the Ruzsa-Szemer\'edi triangle removal lemma. Motivated by this, in this paper, we study the generalized Tur\'an problem for generalized theta graphs, a natural extension of book graphs. Our main result provides a complete characterization of the magnitude of $\ex(n,K_3,H)$ when $H$ is a generalized theta graph, indicating when it is quadratic, when it is nearly quadratic, and when it is subquadratic. Furthermore, as an application, we obtain the exact value of $\ex(n, K_r, kF)$, where $F$ is an edge-critical generalized theta graph, and $3\le r\le k+1$, extending several recent results.</description>

Abstract: We prove the Erd\H{o}s-Hajnal conjecture for the five-vertex path $P_5$; that is, there exists $c&gt;0$ such that every $n$-vertex graph with no induced $P_5$ has a clique or stable set of size at least $n^c$. This completes the verification of the Erd\H{o}s-Hajnal property of all five-vertex graphs. Our methods combine probabilistic and structural ideas with the iterative sparsification framework introduced in the third and fourth papers in the series.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09040v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This doctoral thesis covers several topics related to the construction and study of maximal determinant matrices with complex entries. The first three chapters are devoted to number-theoretic tools to prove the non-solvability of Gram matrix equations over certain fields, with a focus on combinatorial applications. Chapter 4 gives a survey on Butson-type Hadamard matrices, and shows an improved lower bound on primes $p$ for the existence of $BH(12p, p)$ matrices. Chapter 5 contains the main contributions of the thesis, where the maximal determinant problem for matrices over the m-th roots of unity is discussed, and where new upper and lower bounds, as well as constructions at small orders, are given. Chapter 6 studies maximal determinant matrices over association schemes. Chapter 7 gives an application of design theory to privacy in communications, and it is connected to the rest of the thesis by the use of the theory of quadratic forms.</description>

Abstract: The critical exponent of an infinite word $\bf x$ is the supremum, over all finite nonempty factors $f$, of the exponent of $f$. In this note we show that for all integers $k\geq 2,$ there is a binary infinite $k$-automatic sequence with critical exponent $\leq 7/3$. The same conclusion holds for Fibonacci-automatic and Tribonacci-automatic sequences.</description>

      <title>Identically vanishing $k$-generalized Fibonacci polynomials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11596v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recurrence for the $k$-Fibonacci polynomials is usually iterated upwards to positive values of $n$ only. When the recurrence is iterated downwards to $n&lt;0$, there are indices where the polynomials vanish identically. This fact does not seem to have been noted in the literature. We derive the set of such indices. We establish the connection of our results to the solution of the Skolem problem for the $k$-Fibonacci numbers. For $k\ge3$ and $n&lt;0$, we show that the degree of the polynomial does not increase monotonically with $|n|$. The so-called `left-justified $k$-nomial triangle' is extended to treat negative indices. We derive expressions for the individual polynomial coefficients (the elementary symmetric polynomials of the roots). We present results for the properties of the polynomials, for both $n&gt;0$ and $n&lt;0$, including factorization of the polynomials and properties of the roots. Results are also derived for real roots. We present new, tighter, bounds on the amplitudes of the nonzero roots. We derive new combinatorial sums for the polynomial coefficients, which are more concise and computationally efficient than previously published expressions.</description>

      <title>Characterizing $A_\alpha$-minimizer graphs: given order and independence number</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09770v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a given graph \( G \), let \( A(G) \), \( Q(G) \), and \( D(G) \) denote the adjacency matrix, signless Laplacian matrix, and diagonal degree matrix of \( G \), respectively. The \( A_\alpha(G) \) matrix, proposed by Nikiforov, is defined as \( A_\alpha(G)=\alpha D(G)+(1 - \alpha)A(G) \), where \( \alpha\in[0,1] \). This matrix captures the gradual transition from \( A(G) \) to \( Q(G) \). Let \( \mathcal{G}_{n,\gamma} \) denote the family of all connected graphs with \( n \) vertices and independence number \( \gamma \). A graph in \( \mathcal{G}_{n,\gamma} \) is referred to as an \( A_\alpha \)-minimizer graph if it achieves the minimum \( A_\alpha \) spectral radius. In this paper, we first demonstrate that the \( A_\alpha \)-minimizer graph in \( \mathcal{G}_{n,\gamma} \) must be a tree when \( \gamma\geq\left\lceil\frac{n}{2}\right\rceil \), and we provide several characterizations of such \( A_\alpha \)-minimizer graphs. We then specifically characterize the \( A_\alpha \)-minimizer graphs for the case \( \gamma = \left\lceil\frac{n}{2}\right\rceil + 1 \) when $n\geq 9$. Furthermore, we obtain a structural characterization for the \( A_\alpha \)-minimizer graph when \( \gamma=n - c \), where \( c\geq4 \) is an integer.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15342v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that for every $M,A,n \in \mathbb{N}$ there exists a graph $G$ that does not contain the $(154\times 154)$-grid as a $3$-fat minor and is not $(M,A)$-quasi-isometric to a graph with no $K_n$ minor. This refutes the conjectured coarse grid theorem by Georgakopoulos and Papasoglu and the weak fat minor conjecture of Davies, Hickingbotham, Illingworth, and McCarty.
  Our construction is a slight modification of the recent counterexample to the weak coarse Menger conjecture from Nguyen, Scott and Seymour.
  We further modify the construction to show that there are planar graphs that do not have the coarse Erd\H{o}s-P\'{o}sa property.</description>

Abstract: The geometric Tevelev degrees of projective space enumerate general, pointed algebraic curves interpolating through the maximal possible number of points.

Extending ideas of Gillespie--Reimer-Berg, we use the RSK correspondence to give a positive interpretation of these counts in terms of the combinatorics of words.</description>

      <title>Reconfiguration graph for vertex colorings for ($P_2$+$P_3$, $C_4$)-free graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03190v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a graph $G$, let $\chi(G)$ denote the chromatic number of $G$. Given a graph $G$, the $reconfiguration$ $graph$ $for$ $the$ $k$-$colorings$ of $G$, denoted by ${\cal R}_k(G)$, is the graph whose vertices are the $k$-colorings of $G$ and two $k$-colorings are joined by an edge if they differ on exactly one vertex of $G$. A graph $G$ is $k$-$mixing$ if ${\cal R}_k(G)$ is connected, and is $recolorable$ if it is $k$-mixing for all $k&gt; \chi(G)$. In this paper, we give a complete characterization of $(P_2+P_3, C_4)$-free graphs that are recolorable. Moreover, we show that if $G$ is a recolorable $(P_2+P_3, C_4)$-free graph, then for any $k &gt;\chi(G)$, the diameter of ${\cal R}_k(G)$ is at most 2$n^{2}$. Furthermore, we show that if $G$ is a ($P_2+P_3, C_4$)-free graph on $n$ vertices with degeneracy $\rho(G)$, then for all $k &gt; \rho(G)+ 1$, the diameter of ${\cal R}_k(G)$ is at most $O(n^2)$. This confirms a conjecture of Cereceda for the class of ($P_2+P_3, C_4$)-free graphs. These results generalize some known results available in the literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.09143v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we consider the multiparty equality problem in graphs, where every vertex of a graph $G$ is given an input, and the goal of the vertices is to decide whether all inputs are equal. We study this problem in the local broadcast model, where a message sent by a vertex is received by all its neighbors and the total cost of a protocol is the sum of the lengths of the messages sent by the vertices. This setting was studied by Khan and Vaidya, who gave in 2021 a protocol achieving a 4-approximation in the general case.
  We study this multiparty communication problem through the lens of network topology. We design a new protocol for 2-connected graphs, whose efficiency relies on the notion of total vertex cover in graph theory. This protocol outperforms the aforementioned 4-approximation in a number of cases. To demonstrate its applicability, we apply it to obtain optimal or asymptotically optimal protocols for several natural network topologies such as cycles, hypercubes, and grids. On the way we also provide new bounds of independent interest on the size of total vertex covers in regular graphs.</description>

      <title>Boosted second moment method in random regular graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12600v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Determining the asymptotic independence ratio of random regular graphs is a key challenge in the area of sparse random graphs. Due to the interpolation method, we have very good upper bounds at our disposal, which are actually known to be sharp for sufficiently large degrees. However, we are still in need of good explicit lower bounds for specific degrees.
  The classical approach by Frieze and {\L}uczak achieves a lower bound by first applying the second moment method to sparse Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi graphs, and then cleverly transitioning from that model to regular graphs. They obtain an asymptotic formula (as the degree tends to infinity) but no explicit lower bounds are derived for specific degrees.
  In contrast, in this paper, we apply the second moment method directly to random regular graphs. This approach has a number of advantages. First, we can numerically compute good explicit lower bounds for any given degree $d$. Moreover, we can even boost this lower bound by arguing that the obtained independent set has a certain spatial Markov property. One can then exploit this property by making local modifications to the independent set, resulting in substantial improvements, and beating the previous best bounds for any $d \geq 10$. Finally, this method gives finer asymptotics as $d \to \infty$ than the original Frieze--{\L}uczak approach.
  Moreover, these results can be useful even beyond the scope of the independence ratio due to the fact that independent sets with the Markov property may be used to construct other objects in random regular graphs. To demonstrate this, we consider the problem of decomposing random regular graphs into stars.</description>

Abstract: Sufficient conditions for a simple graph to be characterized up to isomorphism given its spectrum and the spectrum of its complement graph are known due to Wang and Xu. This note establishes a related sufficient condition in the presence of loops: if the walk matrix has square-free determinant, then the graph is characterized by its generalized spectrum. The proof includes a general result about symmetric integral matrices.</description>

Abstract: Let $C_{s,t}$ be the complete bipartite geometric graph, with $s$ and $t$ vertices on two distinct parallel lines respectively, and all $s t$ straight-line edges drawn between them. In this paper, we show that every complete bipartite simple topological graph, with parts of size $2(k-1)^4 + 1$ and $2^{k^{5k}}$, contains a topological subgraph weakly isomorphic to $C_{k,k}$. As a corollary, every $n$-vertex simple topological graph not containing a plane path of length $k$ has at most $O_k(n^{2 - 8/k^4})$ edges. When $k = 3$, we obtain a stronger bound by showing that every $n$-vertex simple topological graph not containing a plane path of length 3 has at most $O(n^{4/3})$ edges. We also prove that $x$-monotone simple topological graphs not containing a plane path of length 3 have at most a linear number of edges.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.17412v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using flag algebras, we prove that the minimum density of $8$-cliques in a large graph without an independent set of size $3$ is $491411/268435456+o(1)$, thus resolving a new case of an old problem of Erd\H{o}s [Magyar Tud. Akad. Mat. Kutat\'o Int. K\"ozl. 7 (1962) 459-464]. Also, we establish some other results of this type; for example, we show that the minimum $s$-clique density in a large graph with no independent set of size 3 nor an induced 5-cycle is $2^{1-s}+o(1)$ when $s=4,5,6$. For each of these results, we also describe the structure of all extremal and almost extremal graphs of large order $n$.
  These results are applied to give an asymptotic solution to a number of cases of the problem of Baumann and Briggs [Electronic J Comb 32 (2025) P1.22] which asks for the minimum number of $s$-cliques in an $n$-vertex graph in which every $k$-set spans a $t$-clique.</description>

      <title>Local certification of geometric graph classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16953v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The goal of local certification is to locally convince the vertices of a graph $G$ that $G$ satisfies a given property. A prover assigns short certificates to the vertices of the graph, then the vertices are allowed to check their certificates and the certificates of their neighbors, and based only on this local view, they must decide whether $G$ satisfies the given property. If the graph indeed satisfies the property, all vertices must accept the instance, and otherwise at least one vertex must reject the instance (for any possible assignment of certificates). The goal is to minimize the size of the certificates.
  In this paper we study the local certification of geometric and topological graph classes. While it is known that in $n$-vertex graphs, planarity can be certified locally with certificates of size $O(\log n)$, we show that several closely related graph classes require certificates of size $\Omega(n)$. This includes penny graphs, unit-distance graphs, (induced) subgraphs of the square grid, 1-planar graphs, and unit-square graphs. These bounds are tight up to a constant factor and give the first known examples of hereditary (and even monotone) graph classes for which the certificates must have linear size. For unit-disk graphs we obtain a lower bound of $\Omega(n^{1-\delta})$ for any $\delta&gt;0$ on the size of the certificates, and an upper bound of $O(n \log n)$. The lower bounds are obtained by proving rigidity properties of the considered graphs, which might be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>The adjacent Hindman's theorem and the $\mathbb Z$-Ramsey's theorem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14558v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the restriction of Ramsey's theorem that arises from considering only translation-invariant colourings of pairs, and show that this has the same strength (both from the viewpoint of Reverse Mathematics and from the viewpoint of Computability Theory) as the {\em Adjacent Hindman's Theorem}, proposed by L. Carlucci (Arch. Math. Log. {\bf 57} (2018), 381--359). We also investigate some higher dimensional versions of both of these statements.</description>

      <title>Permuton limits for some permutations avoiding a single pattern</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19541v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Permutons are probability measures on the unit square with uniform marginals that provide a natural way to describe limits of permutations. We are interested in the permuton limits for permutations sampled uniformly from certain pattern-avoiding classes that are in bijection with the class of permutations avoiding the increasing pattern of length $d+1$. In particular, we will look at a family of permutations whose permuton limit collapses to the unique permuton supported on the line $x + y = 1$ in the unit square, informally known as the anti-diagonal. We prove some general properties about permutons to aid our efforts, which may be useful for proving permuton limits that converge to the anti-diagonal for a broader range of permutation classes.</description>

      <title>On the analytic continuation of Dirichlet series with missing digits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19727v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the Dirichlet series associated with the integers whose radix-$b$ representation misses certain (fixed) digits. The existence of a meromorphic continuation to the entire complex plane, which was already well-known as a general fact valid for $b$-automatic Dirichlet series, is proven anew from a representation as an everywhere defined series with good convergence properties. A generating function related to the residues on the real axis is shown to be the multiplicative inverse of the moment generating function for the associated Cantor set in the unit interval. This makes the (normalized) residues some sort of generalized Bernoulli numbers.</description>
