      <title>LLM-Driven Feedback for Enhancing Conceptual Design Learning in Database Systems Courses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of LLM-generated feedback into educational settings has shown promise in enhancing student learning outcomes. This paper presents a novel LLM-driven system that provides targeted feedback for conceptual designs in a Database Systems course. The system converts student-created entity-relationship diagrams (ERDs) into JSON format, allows the student to prune the diagram by isolating a relationship, extracts relevant requirements for the selected relationship, and utilizes a large language model (LLM) to generate detailed feedback. Additionally, the system creates a tailored set of questions and answers to further aid student understanding. Our pilot implementation in a Database System course demonstrates effective feedback generation that helped the students improve their design skills.</description>

      <title>Extended Event Log: Towards a Unified Standard for Process Mining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Process mining has grown popular today given their ability to provide managers with insights into the actual business process as executed by employees. Process mining depends on event logs found in process aware information systems to model business processes. This has raised the need to develop event log standards given that event logs are the entry point to any process mining project. One of the main challenges of event logs and process mining in general as was mentioned by the IEEE task force on process mining deals with the finding, merging and cleaning event data.This resulted in having multiple event log standards with different features. This paper attempts to propose a new unified standard for event logs that enriches the results of process mining without the need to tailor event logs for each process mining project.</description>

      <title>Trustworthy and Efficient LLMs Meet Databases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the rapidly evolving AI era with large language models (LLMs) at the core, making LLMs more trustworthy and efficient, especially in output generation (inference), has gained significant attention. This is to reduce plausible but faulty LLM outputs (a.k.a hallucinations) and meet the highly increased inference demands. This tutorial explores such efforts and makes them transparent to the database community. Understanding these efforts is essential in harnessing LLMs in database tasks and adapting database techniques to LLMs. Furthermore, we delve into the synergy between LLMs and databases, highlighting new opportunities and challenges in their intersection. This tutorial aims to share with database researchers and practitioners essential concepts and strategies around LLMs, reduce the unfamiliarity of LLMs, and inspire joining in the intersection between LLMs and databases.</description>

      <title>NoSQL Graph Databases: an overview</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graphs are the most suitable structures for modeling objects and interactions in applications where component inter-connectivity is a key feature. There has been increased interest in graphs to represent domains such as social networks, web site link structures, and biology. Graph stores recently rose to prominence along the NoSQL movement. In this work we will focus on NOSQL graph databases, describing their peculiarities that sets them apart from other data storage and management solutions, and how they differ among themselves. We will also analyze in-depth two different graph database management systems - AllegroGraph and Neo4j that uses the most popular graph models used by NoSQL stores in practice: the resource description framework (RDF) and the labeled property graph (LPG), respectively.</description>

      <title>SHARQ: Explainability Framework for Association Rules on Relational Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Association rules are an important technique for gaining insights over large relational datasets consisting of tuples of elements (i.e. attribute-value pairs). However, it is difficult to explain the relative importance of data elements with respect to the rules in which they appear. This paper develops a measure of an element's contribution to a set of association rules based on Shapley values, denoted SHARQ (ShApley Rules Quantification). As is the case with many Shapely-based computations, the cost of a naive calculation of the score is exponential in the number of elements. To that end, we present an efficient framework for computing the exact SharQ value of a single element whose running time is practically linear in the number of rules. Going one step further, we develop an efficient multi-element SHARQ algorithm which amortizes the cost of the single element SHARQ calculation over a set of elements. Based on the definition of SHARQ for elements we describe two additional use cases for association rules explainability: rule importance and attribute importance. Extensive experiments over a novel benchmark dataset containing 45 instances of mined rule sets show the effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <title>Graph Structure Learning for Spatial-Temporal Imputation: Adapting to Node and Feature Scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatial-temporal data collected across different geographic locations often suffer from missing values, posing challenges to data analysis. Existing methods primarily leverage fixed spatial graphs to impute missing values, which implicitly assume that the spatial relationship is roughly the same for all features across different locations. However, they may overlook the different spatial relationships of diverse features recorded by sensors in different locations. To address this, we introduce the multi-scale Graph Structure Learning framework for spatial-temporal Imputation (GSLI) that dynamically adapts to the heterogeneous spatial correlations. Our framework encompasses node-scale graph structure learning to cater to the distinct global spatial correlations of different features, and feature-scale graph structure learning to unveil common spatial correlation across features within all stations. Integrated with prominence modeling, our framework emphasizes nodes and features with greater significance in the imputation process. Furthermore, GSLI incorporates cross-feature and cross-temporal representation learning to capture spatial-temporal dependencies. Evaluated on six real incomplete spatial-temporal datasets, GSLI showcases the improvement in data imputation.</description>
