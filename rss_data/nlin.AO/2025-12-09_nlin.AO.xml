      <title>Agency at the Interface: Distinguishing Teleological from Structural Self-Organization via Internal Coarse-Graining and Downward Causation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Agency is widely characterized as the capacity of a system to regulate its internal states toward self-generated goals, yet characterizing the functional basis of this autonomy requires a distinction between the system's own organization and an observer's interpretation. In this paper, we ground this capacity functionally in the generative process of intrinsic dynamics, characterized as a self-referential loop generated by internal coarse-graining and downward causation. This process allows the system to autonomously compress microscopic states into macroscopic variables that subsequently constrain microscopic temporal evolution. By distinguishing the intrinsic dynamics of the system from the external coarse-graining of an observer's interpretation, we define agency through the dynamics of the predictive gap. This gap constitutes the internal divergence between the system's anticipation and its realization, as well as the limited reducibility of the system's generated constraints within the observer's interpretive model. This framework outlines a spectrum of agency that distinguishes biological systems, whose teleological constraints are generated through their own regulatory dynamics, from artificial systems, whose organization is designed to satisfy externally specified objectives. Finally, we extend this interface to the social domain, proposing that these generative divergences underpin participatory sense-making and emergent coordination.</description>

      <title>How Conflict Aversion Can Enable Authoritarianism: An Evolutionary Dynamics Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use evolutionary game theory to examine how conflict-averse centrism can unintentionally facilitate authoritarian success in polarized political conflicts. Many such conflicts are asymmetric: authoritarian actors can employ norm-breaking or coercive tactics, while democratic resistance faces stronger constraints on what counts as normatively acceptable behavior. Yet formal models typically treat opposing sides symmetrically and rarely examine conflict-averse behavior. Drawing on empirical research on protest backlash, civility norms, and authoritarian resilience, we model these dynamics as a three-strategy evolutionary game in which resistance, authoritarianism, and conflict-averse centrism interact under replicator dynamics. This framework yields two distinct outcomes -- cyclic resurgence of authoritarian strength through a heteroclinic cycle and a stable centrist-authoritarian coalition that excludes resistance -- depending on how actors respond to confrontation. The analysis shows how payoff differences can reorganize long-run dynamics in asymmetric conflicts. Our contribution is to demonstrate how an established dynamical framework, combined with empirically grounded behavioral assumptions, clarifies the strategic conditions under which conflict aversion can diminish the effectiveness of democratic resistance.</description>

      <title>Social welfare optimisation in well-mixed and structured populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Research on promoting cooperation among autonomous, self-regarding agents has often focused on the bi-objective optimisation problem: minimising the total incentive cost while maximising the frequency of cooperation. However, the optimal value of social welfare under such constraints remains largely unexplored. In this work, we hypothesise that achieving maximal social welfare is not guaranteed at the minimal incentive cost required to drive agents to a desired cooperative state. To address this gap, we adopt to a single-objective approach focused on maximising social welfare, building upon foundational evolutionary game theory models that examined cost efficiency in finite populations, in both well-mixed and structured population settings. Our analytical model and agent-based simulations show how different interference strategies, including rewarding local versus global behavioural patterns, affect social welfare and dynamics of cooperation. Our results reveal a significant gap in the per-individual incentive cost between optimising for pure cost efficiency or cooperation frequency and optimising for maximal social welfare. Overall, our findings indicate that incentive design, policy, and benchmarking in multi-agent systems and human societies should prioritise welfare-centric objectives over proxy targets of cost or cooperation frequency.</description>

      <title>Distributed Traffic Signal Control of Interconnected Intersections: A Two-Lane Traffic Network Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11483v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate traffic signal control in a network of interconnected intersections, aiming to balance lane-level vehicle densities through optimal green-time allocation. We develop a two-lane traffic flow model that explicitly captures lane-specific propagation dynamics, addressing key limitations of conventional road-level formulations. The proposed model offers a more granular and flexible representation of urban traffic, enabling controllers to react more accurately to lane-specific congestion patterns. Building on this model, we design a distributed model predictive control (MPC) framework and integrate it with the efficient alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to enhance scalability and real-time performance. To accommodate time-varying traffic conditions, we further introduce a data-driven method for forecasting dynamic split ratios. Comprehensive VISSIM simulations on a six-intersection network in Dalian, China, demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms existing signal control strategies in both traffic efficiency and computational speed, showing its promise for real-time deployment.</description>

      <title>Dynamics on invariant tori emerging through forced symmetry breaking in phase oscillator networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02119v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider synchrony patterns in coupled phase oscillator networks that correspond to invariant tori. For specific nongeneric coupling, these tori are equilibria relative to a continuous symmetry action. We analyze how the invariant tori deform under forced symmetry breaking as more general network interaction terms are introduced. We first show in general that perturbed tori that are relative equilibria can be computed using a parametrization method; this yields an asymptotic expansion of an embedding of the perturbed torus, as well as the local dynamics on the torus. We then apply this result to a coupled oscillator network, and we numerically study the dynamics on the persisting tori in the network by looking for bifurcations of their periodic orbits in a boundary-value-problem setup. This way we find new bifurcating stable synchrony patterns that can be the building blocks of larger global structures such as heteroclinic cycles.</description>

      <title>Bidirectional Nonlinear Optical Tomography: Unbiased Characterization of Off- and On-Chip Coupling Efficiencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13110v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate evaluation of nonlinear photonic integrated circuits requires separating input and output coupling efficiencies (i.e., $\eta_1$ and $\eta_2$), yet the conventional linear-transmission calibration method recovers only their product (i.e., $\eta_1\,\eta_2$) and therefore introduces systematic bias when inferring on-chip performance from off-chip data. We present bidirectional nonlinear optical tomography (BNOT), a direction-aware metrology that uses forward and backward pumping of complementary nonlinear probes, with process-appropriate detection, to break the ``degeneracy'' of $\eta_1\,\eta_2$ and estimate individual interface efficiencies with tight confidence intervals. The method links off-chip measurements to on-chip quantities through a compact observation model that explicitly incorporates pump fluctuations and detector noise, and it frames efficiency extraction as a joint constrained optimization. Monte Carlo studies show unbiased convergence of the estimated efficiencies to ground truth with low error across realistic operating regimes. Using these efficiency estimates to reconstruct on-chip nonlinear figures of merit yields distributions centered on the true values with reduced variance, whereas conventional ``degenerate'' calibration is biased and can substantially misestimate on-chip performance. BNOT is hardware-compatible and platform-agnostic, and provides unbiased characterization of off- and on-chip coupling efficiencies across nonlinear processes, enabling reproducible, coupling-resolved benchmarking for scalable systems in quantum optics, frequency conversion, and precision metrology.</description>
