      <title>Beyond Worst-Case Subset Sum: An Adaptive, Structure-Aware Solver with Sub-$2^{n/2}$ Enumeration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Subset Sum problem, which asks whether a set of $n$ integers has a subset summing to a target $t$, is a fundamental NP-complete problem in cryptography and combinatorial optimization. The classical meet-in-the-middle (MIM) algorithm of Horowitz--Sahni runs in $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}\bigl(2^{n/2}\bigr)$, still the best-known deterministic bound. Yet many instances exhibit abundant collisions in partial sums, so actual hardness often depends on the number of unique sums ($U$).
  We present a structure-aware, adaptive solver that enumerates only distinct sums, pruning duplicates on the fly, thus running in $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(U)$ when $U \ll 2^n$. Its core is a unique-subset-sums enumerator combined with a double meet-in-the-middle strategy and lightweight dynamic programming, avoiding the classical MIM's expensive merge. We also introduce combinatorial tree compression to guarantee strictly sub-$2^{n/2}$ enumeration even on unstructured inputs, shaving a nontrivial constant from the exponent.
  Our solver supports anytime and online modes, producing partial solutions early and adapting to newly added elements. Theoretical analysis and experiments show that for structured instances -- e.g. with small doubling constants, high additive energy, or significant redundancy -- our method can far outperform classical approaches, often nearing dynamic-programming efficiency. Even in the worst case, it remains within $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}\bigl(2^{n/2}\bigr)$, and its compression-based pruning yields a real constant-factor speedup over naive MIM. We conclude by discussing how this instance-specific adaptivity refines the Subset Sum complexity landscape and suggesting future adaptive-exponential directions.</description>

      <title>Local obstructions in sequences revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we consider some simple combinatorial game and a winning strategy in this game. This game is then used to prove several known results about non-repetitive sequences and approximations with denominators from a lacunary sequence. In this way we simplify the proofs, improve the bounds and get for free the computable versions that required a separate treatment.</description>

      <title>On the order of the shortest solution sequences for the pebble motion problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a connected graph with $N$ vertices. Let $k$ be the number of vertices in a longest path of $G$ such that every vertex on the path is a cut vertex of $G$, and every intermediate vertex of the path is a degree-two vertex of $G$. %Let $k$ be the number of vertices of such a longest path of $T$ that every vertex of %the path is a cut vertex and that every intermediate vertex of the path is a degree-two vertex of $T$. Let $P=\{1,\ldots,n\}$ be a set of pebbles with $n+k &lt; N$. A \textit{configuration} of $P$ on $G$ is defined as a function $f$ from $V(G)$ to $\{0, 1, \ldots, n \}$ with $|f^{-1}(i)| = 1$ for $1 \le i \le n$, where $f^{-1}(i)$ is a vertex occupied with the $i$th pebble for $1 \le i \le n$ and $f^{-1}(0)$ is a set of unoccupied vertices. A \textit{move} is defined as shifting a pebble from a vertex to %its unoccupied neighbour. some unoccupied neighbor. The {\it pebble motion problem on the pair $(G,P)$} is to decide whether a given configuration of pebbles is reachable from another by executing a sequence of moves. In this paper, we show that the length of the shortest solution sequence of the pebble motion problem on the pair $(G,P)$ is in $O(Nn + n^2 \log(\min\{n,k\}))$ if $G$ is a $N$-vertex tree, and it is in $O(N^2 + \frac{n^3}{N-n} + n^2 \log(\min\{n,N-n\}))$ if $G$ is a connected general $N$-vertex graph. We provide an algorithm that can obtain a solution sequence of lengths that satisfy these orders, with the same computational complexity as the order of the length.
