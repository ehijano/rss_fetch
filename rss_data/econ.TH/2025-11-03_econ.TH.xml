      <title>Targeted Advertising Platforms: Data Sharing and Customer Poaching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: E-commerce platforms are rolling out ambitious targeted advertising initiatives that rely on merchants sharing customer data with each other via the platform. Yet current platform designs fail to address participating merchants' concerns about customer poaching. This paper proposes a model of designing targeted advertising platforms that incentivizes merchants to voluntarily share customer data despite poaching concerns. I characterize the optimal mechanism that maximizes a weighted sum of platform's revenues, customer engagement and merchants' surplus. In sufficiently large platforms, the optimal mechanism can be implemented through the design of three markets: $i)$ selling market, where merchants can sell all their data at a posted price $p$, $ii)$ exchange market, where merchants share all their data in exchange for high click-through rate (CTR) ads, and $iii)$ buying market, where high-value merchants buy high CTR ads at the full price. The model is broad in scope with applications in other market design settings like the greenhouse gas credit markets and reallocating public resources, and points toward new directions in combinatorial market exchange designs.</description>

      <title>Lexicographic Preferences over Random Availability Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12997v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide an axiomatic characterization of lexicographic preferences over the set of all random availability functions using two assumptions. The first assumption is strong monotonicity, which in our framework is equivalent to the strong dominance property in microeconomics. The second assumption is independence of worse alternatives and we show that a weaker version of the same suffices for our purpose.</description>

      <title>The Effect of Using Popular Mathematical Puzzles on The Mathematical Thinking of Syrian Schoolchildren</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26263v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we provide a good overview of the problems and the background of mathematics education in Syrian schools. We aimed to study the effect of using popular mathematical puzzles on the mathematical thinking of schoolchildren, by conducting a paired experimental study (pre-test and post-test control group design) of the data we obtained through a sample taken from students of sixth-grade primary school students in Syria the Lady Mary School in Syria, in order to evaluate the extent of the impact of popular mathematical puzzles on students' ability to solve problems and mathematical skills, and then the skills were measured and the results were analyzed using a t-test as a tool for statistical analysis.</description>

      <title>Markovian Search with Ex-Ante Constraints: Theory and Applications to Socially Aware Algorithmic Hiring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13346v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop an algorithmic framework to incorporate "ex-ante" constraints on outcomes (that hold only on average) into stateful sequential search with costly inspection. Our framework encompasses the classical Weitzman's Pandora's box [Weitzman, 1979] as well as its extensions to joint Markovian scheduling [Dumitriu et al., 2003; Gittins, 1979], modeling richer processes such as multistage search with multiple layers of inspection. Ex-ante constraints in search are particularly motivated by social considerations in algorithmic hiring, where they adjust outcome distributions to promote equity and access. Building on the optimality of index-based policies in the unconstrained problems, we show that optimal policies under a single ex-ante constraint (e.g., demographic parity) retain an index-based structure but require (i) dual-based adjustments of the indices and (ii) randomization between two such adjustments via a "tie-breaking rule," both easy to compute and economically interpretable. We then extend our results to handle multiple affine constraints by reduction to a variant of the exact Carath\'eodory problem and providing a polynomial-time algorithm to construct an optimal randomized dual-adjusted index-based policy that satisfies all constraints simultaneously. For general affine and convex constraints, we develop a primal-dual algorithm that randomizes over a polynomial number of dual-based adjustments, yielding a near-feasible, near-optimal policy. All these results rely on the key observation that a suitable relaxation of the Lagrange dual function for these constrained problems admits index-based policies akin to those in the unconstrained setting. Finally, through a numerical study, we investigate the implications of various socially aware ex-ante constraints on the utilitarian loss (price of fairness), and examine whether they achieve their intended socially desirable outcomes.</description>
