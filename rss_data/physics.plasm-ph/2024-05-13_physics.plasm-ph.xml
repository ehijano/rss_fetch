      <title>Autoresonant laser acceleration of electrons in a strongly magnetized plasma solenoid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direct laser acceleration of electrons is considered in a strongly magnetized plasmoid with the magnetic field strength allowing for reaching the auto-resonance. The plasmoid may be optically created by irradiation of specially designed targets with an auxiliary intense laser beam at the previous stage of interaction in a possible all-optical setup. Specifics of the strongly magnetized plasma solenoid may be critically important for the resonant processes where a small deviation of the parameters destroys the matching conditions. The process of the autoresonant electron acceleration is analyzed for different configurations inherent in the possible realizations of the setup, estimates for the efficiency of acceleration and resonance magnetic fields are proposed. Despite the modifications of the autoresonance conditions and the presence of collective effects, generation of energetic electron bunches in a realistic setup may be possible and effective.</description>

      <title>Generation of Ultra-Collimated Polarized Attosecond $\gamma-$Rays via Beam Instabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polarized attosecond $\gamma-$rays may offer excitation and hyperfine tracking of reactions relevant to nuclear physics, astrophysics, high-energy physics, etc. However, unfortunately, generation of a feasible and easy-to-deploy source is still a great challenge. Here, we put forward a novel method for producing ultra-collimated high-brilliance polarized attosecond $\gamma-$rays via the interaction of an unpolarized electron beam with a solid-density plasma. As a relativistic electron beam enters a solid-density plasma, it can be modulated into high-density clusters via the self-modulation instability of itself and further into attosecond slices due to its own hosing instability. This is accompanied by the generation of similar pulse-width $\gamma-$slices via nonlinear Compton scattering. The severe hosing instability breaks the symmetry of the excited electromagnetic fields, resulting in net linear polarization of $\gamma-$slices, which challenges the conventional perception that the interaction of an axially symmetric unpolarized electron beam with a uniform plasma cannot generate polarized radiation. In addition, we also obtain high-quality electron microbunches which may serve as an alternative source for prebunched free-electron lasers.</description>

      <title>Microphysical Regulation of Non-Ideal MHD in Weakly-Ionized Systems: Does the Hall Effect Matter?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) equations plus 'non-ideal' (Ohmic, Hall, ambipolar) resistivities are widely used to model weakly-ionized astrophysical systems. We show that if gradients in the magnetic field become too steep, the implied charge drift speeds become much faster than microphysical signal speeds, invalidating the assumptions used to derive both the resistivities and MHD equations themselves. Generically this situation will excite microscale instabilities that suppress the drift and current. We show this could be relevant at low ionization fractions especially if Hall terms appear significant, external forces induce supersonic motions, or dust grains become a dominant charge carrier. Considering well-established treatments of super-thermal drifts in laboratory, terrestrial, and Solar plasmas as well as conduction and viscosity models, we generalize a simple prescription to rectify these issues, where the resistivities are multiplied by a correction factor that depends only on already-known macroscopic quantities. This is generalized for multi-species and weakly-ionized systems, and leaves the equations unchanged in the drift limits for which they are derived, but restores physical behavior (driving the system back towards slow drift by diffusing away small-scale gradients in the magnetic field) if the limits are violated. This has important consequences: restoring intuitive behaviors such as the system becoming hydrodynamic in the limit of zero ionization; suppressing magnetic structure on scales below a critical length which can comparable to circumstellar disk sizes; limiting the maximum magnetic amplification; and suppressing the effects of the Hall term in particular. This likely implies that the Hall term does not become dynamically important under most conditions of interest in these systems.</description>

      <title>Collisionless conduction in a high-beta plasma: a collision operator for whistler turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06481v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The regulation of electron heat transport in high-beta, weakly collisional, magnetized plasma is investigated. A temperature gradient oriented along a mean magnetic field can induce a kinetic heat-flux-driven whistler instability (HWI), which back-reacts on the transport by scattering electrons and impeding their flow. Previous analytical and numerical studies have shown that the heat flux for the saturated HWI scales as the inverse of electron beta. These numerical studies, however, had limited scale separation and consequently large fluctuation amplitudes, which calls into question their relevance at astrophysical scales. To this end, we perform a series of particle-in-cell simulations of the HWI across a range of electron beta and temperature-gradient length scales under two different physical setups. The saturated heat flux in all of our simulations follows the expected inverse-electron-beta scaling, supporting the robustness of the result. We also use our simulation results to develop and implement several methods to construct an effective collision operator for whistler turbulence. The results point to an issue with the standard quasi-linear explanation of HWI saturation, which is analogous to the well-known 90-degree scattering problem in the cosmic ray community. Despite this limitation, the methods developed here can serve as a blueprint for future work seeking to characterize the effective collisionality caused by kinetic instabilities.</description>
