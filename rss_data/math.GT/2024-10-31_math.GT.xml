      <title>Quasisections of circle bundles and Euler class</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $ E \xrightarrow[\text{}]{\pi} B$ be an oriented circle bundle over an oriented closed surface $B$. A \textit{quasisection} is a closed smooth manifold ${Q}$ mapped by a generic smooth mapping $q$ to $E$ such that $\pi\circ q({Q})=B$. In the paper we show that Euler number (Euler class) of the bundle equals the sum of weights of (some of) singularities of a quasisection.
  We also prove the uniqueness of such a formula.
  The formula is a close relative of M. Kazarian's formula which relates the Euler number and Morse bifurcations of a generic function defined on the total space $E$.</description>

      <title>Path-connectivity of Thick Laminations, and Markov Processes with Thick Limit Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A lamination $\lambda$ is $\epsilon$-thick (with respect to a basepoint $X$), if the Teichm\"uller ray from $X$ in the direction of $\lambda$ stays in the $\epsilon$-thick part. We show that, for surfaces of high enough genus, any two $\epsilon$-thick laminations can be joined by a path of $\delta$-thick laminations. As a consequence, we show that the Morse boundary of the mapping class group is path-connected. Furthermore, we construct a subshift of finite type on the mapping class group, whose limit set consists only of thick laminations and is path-connected.</description>

      <title>Bridge Positions and Plat Presentations of Links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the relationship between links in bridge position and plat presentations. We will show that the Hilden double coset classes of plat presentations of a link are equivalent to bridge positions of the link up to bridge isotopy. This correspondence allows us to reframe algebraic questions about plat presentations in terms of bridge positions. We demonstrate some results about both plat presentations and links in bridge position using this correspondence. For instance, we reprove that there is only one Hilden double coset class of the n-bridge unknot in $\mathbb{S}^3.$ We also show that there is only a single double coset class for torus knots in plat position. Finally, we discuss how this correspondence may be used to investigate plat closures of knots, which is the subject of ongoing research.</description>

      <title>Non-singular extensions of horizontal stable fold maps from surfaces into the plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the non-singular extension problem of horizontal stable fold maps from closed oriented surfaces into $\mathbb{R}^{2}$. The problem asks, given a horizontal stable fold map $f\colon M\to\mathbb{R}^{2}$ on a closed oriented surface $M$, under what conditions there exist a compact oriented 3-dimensional manifold $N$ with $\partial N = M$ and a submersion $F\colon N \to\mathbb{R}^{2}$ such that $F|_{\partial N}=f$. As a main theorem, we provide a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a non-singular extension of a horizontal stable fold map with certain properties, assuming a submersion on a collar neighborhood is given.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we study the effects of topological and smooth obstructions on the existence of rational homology complex projective planes that admit quotient singularities of small indices. In particular, we provide a classification of the types of quotient singularities that can be realized on rational homology complex projective planes with indices up to three, whose smooth loci have trivial first integral homology group.</description>

      <title>On lens spaces bounding smooth 4-manifolds with $\boldsymbol{b_2=1}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study which lens spaces can bound smooth 4-manifolds with second Betti number one under various topological conditions. Specifically, we show that there are infinite families of lens spaces that bound compact, simply-connected, smooth 4-manifolds with second Betti number one, yet cannot bound a 4-manifold consisting of a single 0-handle and 2-handle. Additionally, we establish the existence of infinite families of lens spaces that bound compact, smooth 4-manifolds with first Betti number zero and second Betti number one, but cannot bound simply-connected 4-manifolds with second Betti number one. The construction of such 4-manifolds with lens space boundaries is motivated by the study of rational homology projective planes with cyclic quotient singularities.</description>

      <title>The Gilmer-Masbaum map is not injective on the Kauffman bracket skein module</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gilmer and Masbaum use Witten-Reshetikhin-Turaev (WRT) invariants to define a map from the Kauffman bracket skein module to a set of complex-valued functions defined on roots of unity in order to provide a lower bound for its dimension. We compute the image of the evaluation map for a family of mapping tori of the 2-torus and find that the restriction of the map to certain homology classes is not injective. This provides an answer to a question posed by Gilmer and Masbaum in the latter paper. Moreover, we give a basis for the Kauffman bracket skein module in the case of the mapping torus of a power of the Dehn twist along the meridian of the 2-torus.</description>

      <title>Bridge indices of spatial graphs and diagram colorings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the Wirtinger number of links, an invariant originally defined by Blair et al. in terms of extending initial colorings of some strands of a diagram to the entire diagram, to spatial graphs. We prove that the Wirtinger number equals the bridge index of spatial graphs, and we implement an algorithm in Python which gives a more efficient way to estimate upper bounds of bridge indices. Combined with lower bounds from diagram colorings by elements from certain algebraic structures, we obtain exact bridge indices for a large family of spatial graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.06807v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An upper bound for the $L^2$- norm of the Euler class $e(\cal F)$ of an arbitrary transversally orientable foliation $\cal F$ of codimension one, defined on a three-dimensional closed irreducible orientable Riemannian 3-manifold $M^3$ is given in terms of constants bounding the volume, the radius of injectivity, the sectional curvature of $M^3$ and the modulus of mean curvature of the leaves. As a consequence we get that only finitely many cohomolo\-gical classes of the group $H^2(M^3)$ that can be realized by the Euler class $e(\cal F)$ of a two-dimensional transversely oriented foliation $\cal F $ whose leaves have the modulus of mean curvature which is bounded above by the fixed constant $H_0$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12264v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $K_n$ be a complete graph with $n$ vertices. An embedding of $K_n$ in $S^3$ is called a spatial $K_n$-graph. Knots in a spatial $K_n$-graph corresponding to simple cycles of $K_n$ are said to be constituent knots. We consider the case $n=4$. The boundary of an oriented band surface with zero Seifert form, constructed for a spatial $K_4$, is a four-component associated link. There are obtained relations between normalized Yamada and Jaeger polynomials of spatial graphs and Jones polynomials of constituent knots and the associated link.</description>

      <title>On Legendrian representatives of non-fibered knots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16549v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that in $(S^3,\xi_{std})$ if $K$ is a non-trivial knot that realizes the three-dimensional Thurston-Bennequin bound (i.e. $K$ has a Legendrian representative $\Lambda$ with $tb(\Lambda)-rot(\Lambda)=2g(K)-1$), then $K$ has a Legendrian representative $L$ with $tb=0$. Moreover, this result can be easily generalized to contact manifolds that uniquely represent the associated contact invariants. This is the first result on Legendrian representatives of non-fibered knots in $3-$manifolds other than $S^3$. We also show that if $K$ is a nearly fibered knot in $S^3$ then $\tau(K)=g(K)$ implies that $K$ realizes the three-dimensional Thurston-Bennequin bound.</description>

      <title>A survey on the Le-Murakami-Ohtsuki invariant for closed 3-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06857v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We review the original approach to the Le-Murakami-Ohtsuki (LMO) invariant of closed 3-manifolds (as opposed to the later approach based on the Aarhus integral). Following the ideas of surgery presentation, we introduce a class of combinatorial structures, called Kirby structures, which we prove to yield multiplicative 3-manifold invariants. We illustrate this with the Reshetikhin-Turaev invariants. We then introduce a class of combinatorial structures, called pre-LMO structures, and prove that they give rise to Kirby structures. We show how the Kontsevich integral can be used to construct a pre-LMO structure. This yields two families of multiplicative 3-manifolds invariants $\{\Omega_n^{\mathfrak{c}}\}_{n\geq 1}$ and $\{\Omega_n^{\mathfrak{d}}\}_{n\geq 1}$. We review the elimination of redundant information in the latter family, leading to the construction of the LMO invariant. We also provide uniqueness results of some aspects of the LMO construction. The family of invariants $\{\Omega_n^{\mathfrak{c}}\}_{n\geq 1}$ is not discussed explicitly in the literature; whereas $\Omega_n^{\mathfrak{c}}$ enables one to recover $\Omega_n^{\mathfrak{d}}$ for any $n \geq 1$, we show that these invariants coincide for $n = 1$.</description>

Abstract: We show that for a large class of Artin groups with Dynkin diagrams being a tree, the $K(\pi,1)$-conjecture holds. We also establish the $K(\pi,1)$-conjecture for another class of Artin groups whose Dynkin diagrams contain a cycle, which applies to some hyperbolic type Artin groups. This is based on a new approach to the $K(\pi,1)$-conjecture for Artin groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12334v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a finitely presented group $G$ and a surjective homomorphism $G\to \mathbb{Z}^n$ with finitely presented kernel $K$, we give an upper bound on the Dehn function of $K$ in terms of an area-radius pair for $G$. As a consequence we obtain that finitely presented coabelian subgroups of hyperbolic groups have polynomially bounded Dehn function. This generalises results of Gersten and Short and our proof can be viewed as a quantified version of results from Renz' thesis on the second BNSR invariant.</description>
