      <title>Efficient weighted-ensemble network simulations of the SIS model of epidemics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The presence of erratic or unstable paths in standard kinetic Monte Carlo simulations significantly undermines the accurate simulation and sampling of transition pathways. While typically reliable methods, such as the Gillespie algorithm, are employed to simulate such paths, they encounter challenges in efficiently identifying rare events due to their sequential nature and reliance on exact Monte Carlo sampling. In contrast, the weighted ensemble method effectively samples rare events and accelerates the exploration of complex reaction pathways by distributing computational resources among multiple replicas, where each replica is assigned a weight reflecting its importance, and evolves independently from the others. Here, we implement the highly efficient and robust weighted ensemble method to model susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) dynamics on large heterogeneous population networks. In particular, we explore the interplay between stochasticity and contact heterogeneity which gives rise to large fluctuations, leading to extinction (spontaneous clearance of infection). By studying a wide variety of networks characterized by fat-tailed degree distributions, we are able to compute the mean time to extinction as function of the various network and epidemic parameters. Importantly, this method allows exploring previously-inaccessible parameter regimes.</description>

      <title>An SEIR network epidemic model with manual and digital contact tracing allowing delays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13392v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider an SEIR epidemic model on a network also allowing random contacts, where recovered individuals could either recover naturally or be diagnosed. Upon diagnosis, manual contact tracing is triggered such that each infected network contact is reported, tested and isolated with some probability and after a random delay. Additionally, digital tracing (based on a tracing app) is triggered if the diagnosed individual is an app-user, and then all of its app-using infectees are immediately notified and isolated. The early phase of the epidemic with manual and/or digital tracing is approximated by different multi-type branching processes, and three respective reproduction numbers are derived. The effectiveness of both contact tracing mechanisms is numerically quantified through the reduction of the reproduction number. This shows that app-using fraction plays an essential role in the overall effectiveness of contact tracing. The relative effectiveness of manual tracing compared to digital tracing increases if: more of the transmission occurs on the network, when the tracing delay is shortened, and when the network degree distribution is heavy-tailed. For realistic values, the combined tracing case can reduce $R_0$ by $20-30\%$, so other preventive measures are needed to reduce the reproduction number down to $1.2-1.4$ for contact tracing to make it successful in avoiding big outbreaks.</description>

      <title>Computational Approaches for Integrating out Subjectivity in Cognate Synonym Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19328v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Working with cognate data involves handling synonyms, that is, multiple words that describe the same concept in a language. In the early days of language phylogenetics it was recommended to select one synonym only. However, as we show here, binary character matrices, which are used as input for computational methods, do allow for representing the entire dataset including all synonyms. Here we address the question how one can and if one should include all synonyms or whether it is preferable to select synonyms a priori. To this end, we perform maximum likelihood tree inferences with the widely used RAxML-NG tool and show that it yields plausible trees when all synonyms are used as input. Furthermore, we show that a priori synonym selection can yield topologically substantially different trees and we therefore advise against doing so. To represent cognate data including all synonyms, we introduce two types of character matrices beyond the standard binary ones: probabilistic binary and probabilistic multi-valued character matrices. We further show that it is dataset-dependent for which character matrix type the inferred RAxML-NG tree is topologically closest to the gold standard. We also make available a Python interface for generating all of the above character matrix types for cognate data provided in CLDF format.</description>
