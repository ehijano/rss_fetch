      <title>Fluid Limits for Time-Varying Many-Server Queues with Finite Capacity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops fluid limits for nonstationary many-server loss systems with general service-time distributions. For the zero-buffer $M_t/G/n/n$ queuing model, we prove a functional strong law of large numbers for the fraction of busy servers and characterize the limit by a nonlinear Volterra integral equation with discontinuous coefficients induced by instantaneous blocking. Well-posedness is established through an appropriate solution concept, yielding the time-varying acceptance probability without heuristic approximations. We then treat the finite-buffer $M_t/G/n/(n+b_n)$ regime, proving a functional strong law of large numbers for the triplet of fractions of busy servers, occupied buffers, and cumulative departures, whose limit satisfies a coupled system of three discontinuous Volterra equations capturing the interaction of service completions, buffer occupancy, and admission control at the capacity boundary. We establish well-posedness and convergence of the time-varying acceptance probability. Our theoretical results are supported by numerical simulations for both zero and finite-buffer regimes, illustrating the convergence of transient acceptance probabilities guaranteed by our theory. Finally, we use the fluid limits to derive optimal staffing and buffer-capacity for both time-varying loss systems.</description>

      <title>Real Roots of Random Weyl Polynomials with General Coefficients: Expectation and Variance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the number of real zeros of random Weyl polynomials of degree \(n \to \infty\) with general coefficient distributions. Motivated by the results of arXiv:1409.4128 and arXiv:1402.4628 as well as arXiv:1711.03316 and arXiv:1912.11901, we determine how the expected number of real zeros and their variance, over various natural intervals, depend on the moments of the common coefficient distribution. Our main finding is that while the first-order asymptotic of the expectation is universal, the next-order correction depends on the third and fourth moments of the distribution, and may grow linearly with \(\log n\), depending on the interval under consideration. In contrast, for the variance we show that the leading-order term is universal, which differs from the behavior observed for random trigonometric polynomials in arXiv:1711.03316 and arXiv:1912.11901. Our approach relies on an Edgeworth expansion for random walks arising from Weyl polynomials, a result of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Mixing rates for linear operators under infinitely divisible measures on Banach spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive rates of convergence for the mixing of operators under infinitely divisible measures in the framework of linear dynamics on Banach spaces. Our approach is based on the characterization of mixing in terms of codifference functionals and control measures, and extends previous results obtained in the Gaussian setting via the use of covariance operators. Explicit mixing rates are obtained for weighted shifts under compound Poisson, {\alpha}-stable, and tempered {\alpha}-stable measures.</description>

      <title>A control variate method based on polynomial approximation of Brownian path</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel control variate technique for enhancing the efficiency of Monte Carlo (MC) estimation of expectations involving solutions to stochastic differential equations (SDEs). Our method integrates a primary fine-time-step discretization of the SDE with a control variate derived from a secondary coarse-time-step discretization driven by a piecewise parabolic approximation of Brownian motion. This approximation is conditioned on the same fine-scale Brownian increments, enabling strong coupling between the estimators. The expectation of the control variate is computed via an independent MC simulation using the coarse approximation. We characterize the minimized quadratic error decay as a function of the computational budget and the weak and strong orders of the primary and secondary discretization schemes. We demonstrate the method's effectiveness through numerical experiments on representative SDEs.</description>

      <title>On the Kantorovich contraction of Markov semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a novel operator theoretic framework to study the contraction properties of Markov semigroups with respect to a general class of Kantorovich semi-distances, which notably includes Wasserstein distances. The rather simple contraction cost framework developed in this article, which combines standard Lyapunov techniques with local contraction conditions, helps to unifying and simplifying many arguments in the stability of Markov semigroups, as well as to improve upon some existing results. Our results can be applied to both discrete time and continuous time Markov semigroups, and we illustrate their wide applicability in the context of (i) Markov transitions on models with boundary states, including bounded domains with entrance boundaries, (ii) operator products of a Markov kernel and its adjoint, including two-block-type Gibbs samplers, (iii) iterated random functions and (iv) diffusion models, including overdampted Langevin diffusion with convex at infinity potentials.</description>

      <title>A diffusion model of surface soil pollution based on planar finite-velocity stochastic motion with random lifetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a diffusion model of surface soil pollution from a stationary source based on the symmetric stochastic motion at finite speed in the plane $\Bbb R^2$, also called the planar Markov random flight, whose lifetime is a random variable with given distribution. We consider a heavy-particle model, in which the lifetime is supposed to be an exponentially-distributed random variable, and obtain an explicit formula for the stationary probability density of the pollution process expressed in terms of McDonald functions with variable indices. We also study a light-particle model, in which the lifetime is a gamma-distributed random variable. In this case, the stationary probability density of the pollution process is given in the form of a definite integral calculated numerically, as well as in the form of a functional series composed of the hypergeometric functions with variable coefficients. These stationary densities are plotted in a figure and numerically calculated tables that demonstrate the behaviour of the pollution process on long time intervals. Some remarks on the pollution model based on asymmetric finite-velocity planar stochastic motion are also given.</description>

      <title>From disordered systems to the Critical 2D Stochastic Heat Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review our joint work on the scaling limits of disordered systems, linking the notion of disorder relevance/irrelevance to that of sub/super-criticality of singular SPDEs. This line of research culminated in the construction of the Critical 2D Stochastic Heat Flow (SHF), a universal process which provides a non-trivial solution to the Stochastic Heat Equation in dimension 2, a critical singular SPDE that lies beyond the reach of existing solution theories. The SHF also offers a rare example of a non-Gaussian scaling limit for a disordered system at its phase transition point in the critical dimension.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.08524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give an explicit construction of the Brownian sphere biased by the distance between two distinguished points, which is based on the Miermont bijection for quadrangulations. We then describe various conditionings of this object, which are related to Vorono\"i cells in the Brownian sphere. In particular, we give a new construction of the Brownian sphere with two distinguished points at a fixed distance. We also use this construction to derive a new representation of the bigeodesic Brownian plane.</description>

      <title>Optimal Cash Transfers and Microinsurance to Reduce Social Protection Costs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07431v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Design and implementation of appropriate social protection strategies is one of the main targets of the United Nation's Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 1: No Poverty. Cash transfer (CT) programmes are considered one of the main social protection strategies and an instrument for achieving SDG 1. Targeting consists of establishing eligibility criteria for beneficiaries of CT programmes. In low-income countries, where resources are limited, proper targeting of CTs is essential for an efficient use of resources. Given the growing importance of microinsurance as a complementary tool to social protection strategies, this study examines its role as a supplement to CT programmes. In this article, we adopt the piecewise-deterministic Markov process introduced in Kovacevic and Pflug (2011) to model the capital of a household, which when exposed to large proportional capital losses (in contrast to the classical Cram\'er-Lundberg model) can push them into the poverty area. Striving for cost-effective CT programmes, we optimise the expected discounted cost of keeping the household's capital above the poverty line by means of injection of capital (as a direct capital transfer). Using dynamic programming techniques, we derive the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation associated with the optimal control problem of determining the amount of capital to inject over time. We show that this equation admits a viscosity solution that can be approximated numerically. Moreover, in certain special cases, we obtain closed-form expressions for the solution. Numerical examples show that there is an optimal level of injection above the poverty threshold, suggesting that efficient use of resources is achieved when CTs are preventive rather than reactive, since injecting capital into households when their capital levels are above the poverty line is less costly than to do so only when it falls below the threshold.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.07601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well-known that any finite triangulation possesses a unique maximal Schnyder wood. We introduce Schnyder woods of infinite triangulations, and prove there exists a unique maximal Schnyder wood of any infinite triangulation with finite boundary, and of the uniform infinite half-planar triangulation. Furthermore, the maximal Schnyder wood of the uniform infinite planar triangulation is the limit of maximal Schnyder woods of large finite random triangulations. Several structural properties of infinite Schnyder woods are also described.</description>

      <title>Parallel Sampling via Autospeculation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present parallel algorithms to accelerate sampling via counting in two settings: any-order autoregressive models and denoising diffusion models. An any-order autoregressive model accesses a target distribution $\mu$ on $[q]^n$ through an oracle that provides conditional marginals, while a denoising diffusion model accesses a target distribution $\mu$ on $\mathbb{R}^n$ through an oracle that provides conditional means under Gaussian noise. Standard sequential sampling algorithms require $\widetilde{O}(n)$ time to produce a sample from $\mu$ in either setting. We show that, by issuing oracle calls in parallel, the expected sampling time can be reduced to $\widetilde{O}(n^{1/2})$. This improves the previous $\widetilde{O}(n^{2/3})$ bound for any-order autoregressive models and yields the first parallel speedup for diffusion models in the high-accuracy regime, under the relatively mild assumption that the support of $\mu$ is bounded.
  We introduce a novel technique to obtain our results: speculative rejection sampling. This technique leverages an auxiliary ``speculative'' distribution~$\nu$ that approximates~$\mu$ to accelerate sampling. Our technique is inspired by the well-studied ``speculative decoding'' techniques popular in large language models, but differs in key ways. Firstly, we use ``autospeculation,'' namely we build the speculation $\nu$ out of the same oracle that defines~$\mu$. In contrast, speculative decoding typically requires a separate, faster, but potentially less accurate ``draft'' model $\nu$. Secondly, the key differentiating factor in our technique is that we make and accept speculations at a ``sequence'' level rather than at the level of single (or a few) steps. This last fact is key to unlocking our parallel runtime of $\widetilde{O}(n^{1/2})$.</description>

      <title>Model Predictive Control is almost Optimal for Heterogeneous Restless Multi-armed Bandits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a general infinite horizon Heterogeneous Restless multi-armed Bandit (RMAB). Heterogeneity is a fundamental problem for many real-world systems largely because it resists many concentration arguments. In this paper, we assume that each of the $N$ arms can have different model parameters. We show that, under a mild assumption of uniform ergodicity, a natural finite-horizon LP-update policy with randomized rounding, that was originally proposed for the homogeneous case, achieves an $O(\log N\sqrt{1/N})$ optimality gap in infinite time average reward problems for fully heterogeneous RMABs. In doing so, we show results that provide strong theoretical guarantees on a well-known algorithm that works very well in practice. The LP-update policy is a model predictive approach that computes a decision at time $t$ by planing over a time-horizon $\{t\dots t+\tau\}$. Our simulation section demonstrates that our algorithm works extremely well even when $\tau$ is very small and set to $5$, which makes it computationally efficient. Our theoretical results draw on techniques from the model predictive control literature by invoking the concept of \emph{dissipativity} and generalize quite easily to the more general weakly coupled heterogeneous Markov Decision Process setting. In addition, we draw a parallel between our own policy and the LP-index policy by showing that the LP-index policy corresponds to $\tau=1$. We describe where the latter's shortcomings arise from and how under our mild assumption we are able to address these shortcomings. The proof of our main theorem answers an open problem posed by (Brown et al 2020), paving the way for several new questions on the LP-update policies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.08288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish the large-$N$ asymptotic expansion of the (central) trace of the heat kernel on any compact classical group $G_N\subset\mathrm{GL}_N(\mathbb{C})$, which extends a previous result known only for $\mathrm{U}(N)$ \cite{LM2}. It admits two new interpretations of the trace: in terms of ramified coverings of the torus, and Gromov-Witten invariants on elliptic curves. These connections allow us to explore several aspects of the gauge/string duality in two dimensions: a Yang-Mills/Hurwitz duality, and Yang-Mills/Gromov-Witten duality.</description>

      <title>Integrable Contour Kernels in Discrete $\beta=1,4$ Ensembles, Universality and Kuznetsov Multipliers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08356v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We obtain explicit double-contour representations for the correlation kernels of the discrete orthogonal ($\beta=1$) and symplectic ($\beta=4$) random matrix ensembles with Meixner, Charlier, and Krawtchouk weights. A single Cauchy--difference--quotient composition identity expresses all $\beta=1,4$ blocks in terms of the projection kernel and bounded rational multipliers. From these formulas we give short steepest-descent proofs of bulk and edge universality (sine/Airy/Bessel) with uniform error control, an explicit Meixner$\to$Laguerre hard-edge crossover, and a first $A^{-1}$ correction that follows directly from the integrable structure. Finally, we show that Archimedean Kuznetsov tests splice into the Pfaffian kernels by a bounded holomorphic symbol acting in the contour variable; the symbol enters only through the same Cauchy difference--quotient, so the leading sine/Airy/Bessel limits persist and the $A^{-1}$ term again comes from linearizing at the saddle(s).</description>

      <title>Service Rate Control in Queues with Abandonments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a Markovian single server queue with impatient customers. There is a customer abandonment cost and a holding cost for customers in the system. We consider two versions of the problem. In the first version, customers pay a reward at the time of arrival whereas in the second version, reward is received at the time of service completion. Service rate attains values in a compact set and there is a cost associated with each service rate. Under these assumptions, our objective is to characterize the service rate policy that maximizes the infinite-horizon discounted reward and the long-run average reward. We show that for systems with an infinite buffer, the optimal service rate policy is monotone. However, the optimal policy is not necessarily monotone when capacity is finite. Furthermore, we prove that the set of possible optimal actions can be reduced to the lower boundary of the convex hull of the action space and develop an efficient policy iteration algorithm. Finally, we show that the optimal service rate converges as the state goes to infinity which allows us to truncate the state space to numerically compute the optimal service rate when system has infinite buffer space.</description>

      <title>Branched It\^o formula and natural It\^o-Stratonovich isomorphism</title>

Abstract: Branched rough paths, defined as paths with values in the character group of the Connes-Kreimer Hopf algebra $\mathcal{H}_\mathrm{CK}$, constitute integration theories that may fail to satisfy the usual integration by parts identity. Using known results on the primitive elements of $\mathcal{H}_\mathrm{CK}$ we can view it as a commutative cofree Hopf algebra (i.e. a commutative $\mathbf{B}_\infty$-algebra) and thus write an explicit change-of-variable formula for solutions to rough differential equations. This formula restricts to the well-known It\^o formula in the very special case of semimartingales. In addition, we establish an isomorphism between $\mathcal{H}_\mathrm{CK}$ and the shuffle algebra over its primitives, which extends Hoffman's exponential for the quasi-shuffle algebra, and can therefore be viewed as a far-reaching generalisation of the usual It\^o-Stratonovich correction formula for semimartingales. Indeed, this can be stated as a characterisation of the algebra structure of any commutative $\mathbf{B}_\infty$-algebra. Compared to previous approaches, this transformation has the key property of being natural in the decorating vector space. We study the one-dimensional case more closely, by introducing the branched analogue of the Kailath-Segall polynomials and Dol\'eans-Dade exponential, and conclude with some examples of branched rough path lifts of a stochastic process which are not quasi-geometric.</description>

      <title>Long-time behavior for discretization schemes of Fokker-Planck equations via couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10111v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Continuous-time Markov chains associated to finite-volume discretization schemes of Fokker-Planck equations are constructed. Sufficient conditions under which quantitative exponential decay in the $\phi$-entropy and Wasserstein distance are established, implying modified logarithmic Sobolev, Poincar\'e, and discrete Beckner inequalities. The results are not restricted to additive potentials and do not make use of discrete Bochner-type identities. The proof for the $\phi$-decay relies on a coupling technique due to Conforti, while the proof for the Wasserstein distance uses the path coupling method. Furthermore, exponential equilibration for discrete-time Markov chains is proved, based on an abstract discrete Bakry-Emery method and a path coupling.</description>

      <title>Large deviations of the giant in supercritical kernel-based spatial random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02984v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study cluster sizes in supercritical $d$-dimensional inhomogeneous percolation models with long-range edges -- such as long-range percolation -- and/or heavy-tailed degree distributions -- such as geometric inhomogeneous random graphs and the age-dependent random connection model. Our focus is on large deviations of the size of the largest cluster in the graph restricted to a finite box as its volume tends to infinity. Compared to nearest-neighbor Bernoulli bond percolation on $\mathbb{Z}^d$, we show that long edges can increase the exponent of the polynomial speed of the lower tail from $(d-1)/d$ to any $\zeta_\star\in\big((d-1)/d,1\big)$. We prove that this exponent $\zeta_\star$ also governs the size of the second-largest cluster, and the distribution of the size of the cluster containing the origin $\mathcal{C}(0)$.
  For the upper tail of large deviations, we prove that its speed is logarithmic for models with power-law degree distributions. We express the rate function via the generating function of $|\mathcal{C}(0)|$. The upper tail in degree-homogeneous models decays much faster: the speed in long-range percolation is linear.</description>

      <title>Gaussian fluctuations of generalized $U$-statistics and subgraph counting in the binomial random-connection model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12338v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive normal approximation bounds for generalized $U$-statistics of the form \begin{equation*}
  S_{n,k}(f):=\sum_{
  1 \leq \beta (1),\dots,\beta (k) \leq n \atop
  \beta (i)\ne\beta (j), \ 1\leq i\ne j \leq k}
  f\big(X_{\beta (1)},\dots,X_{\beta (k)},Y_{\beta (1),\beta (2)},\dots,Y_{\beta (k-1),\beta (k)}\big),
  \end{equation*}
  where $\{X_i\}_{i=1}^n$ and $\{Y_{i,j}\}_{1\le i&lt;j\le n}$ are independent sequences of i.i.d. random variables. Our approach relies on moment identities and cumulant bounds that are derived using partition diagram arguments. Normal approximation bounds in the Kolmogorov distance and moderate deviation results are then obtained by the cumulant method. Those results are applied to subgraph counting in the binomial random-connection model, which is a generalization of the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi model.</description>

      <title>Large-scale distributed synchronization systems, using a cancel-on-completion redundancy mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11779v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a class of multi-agent distributed synchronization systems, which are modeled as $n$ particles moving on the real line. This class generalizes the model of a multi-server queueing system, considered in [15], employing so-called cancel-on-completion (c.o.c.) redundancy mechanism, but is motivated by other applications as well. The model in [15] is a particle system, regulated at the left boundary point. The more general model of this paper is such that we allow regulation boundaries on either side, or both sides, or no regulation at all. We consider the mean-field asymptotic regime, when the number of particles $n$ and the job arrival rates go to infinity, while the job arrival rates per particle remain constant. The system state for a given $n$ is the empirical distribution of the particles' locations. The results include: the existence/uniqueness of fixed points of mean-field limits (ML), which describe the limiting dynamics of the system; conditions for the steady-state asymptotic independence (concentration of the stationary distribution on a single ML fixed point); the limits of the average velocity at which unregulated (free) particle system advances. In particular, our results for the left-regulated system unify and generalize the corresponding results in [15]. Our technical approach is such that the systems with different types of regulation are analyzed within a unified framework.</description>

      <title>Edge Universality for Inhomogeneous Random Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17838v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider symmetric and Hermitian random matrices whose entries are independent and symmetric random variables with an arbitrary variance pattern. Under a novel Short-to-Long Mixing condition, which is sharp in the sense that it precludes a corrected shift at the spectral edge, we establish GOE/GUE edge universality for such inhomogeneous random matrices. This condition effectively reduces the universality problem to verifying the mixing properties of a random walk governed by the variance profile matrix.
  Our universality results are applicable to a remarkably broad class of random matrix ensembles that may be highly inhomogeneous, sparse, or far beyond the mean-field setting of classical random matrix theory. Notable examples include:
  1. Inhomogeneous Wishart-type random matrices;
  2. Random band matrices whose entries are independent random variables with general variance profile, particularly with an optimal bandwidth in dimensions $d \le 2$;
  3. Sparse random matrices with structured variance profiles;
  4. Generalized Wigner matrices under significantly weaker sparsity constraints and heavy-tailed entry distributions;
  5. Wegner orbital models under sharp mixing assumptions;
  6. Random 2-lifts of random $d$-regular graphs where $d\geq N^{2/3+\epsilon}$ for any $\epsilon&gt;0$.</description>

      <title>A Parametric Methodology for $G$-Expectations and Stochastic Systems under Model Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13675v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a parametric representation framework for \(G\)-expectations, which offers a systematic methodology for stochastic analysis under model uncertainty. We establish that complex nonlinear problems in the \(G\)-expectation framework can be decomposed into two distinct phases: a linear execution phase within classical probability spaces, followed by a uniform estimation phase across the parameter space.
  Our central contribution is the construction of a homomorphism between \(G\)-expectation spaces and parameterized families of classical random variables. We demonstrate that this mapping preserves essential algebraic and analytic structures, thereby enabling researchers to leverage the full power of classical stochastic analysis tools while maintaining the robustness properties of \(G\)-expectation theory.
  We illustrate the applicability of our framework through its use in the analysis of \(G\)-stochastic differential equations and \(G\)-backward stochastic differential equations. This approach can yield more precise estimates by performing uniform norm estimation at the final stage, in contrast to relying on piecewise sublinear combinations.
  This work provides a methodological alternative that complements existing techniques, offering potential benefits in analytical efficiency and conceptual clarity for tackling problems under volatility uncertainty. The framework establishes a principled approach for conducting research in nonlinear expectation environments, aiming to bridge the gap between mathematical rigor and practical applicability.</description>

      <title>Last Hitting Time Distributions for Solvable Diffusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03037v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By considering any one-dimensional time-homogeneous solvable diffusion process,this paper develops a complete analytical framework for computing the distribution of the last hitting time, to any level, and its joint distribution with the process value on any finite time horizon. Our formalism allows for regular diffusions with any type of endpoint boundaries. We exploit the inherent link between last and first hitting times. The simpler known formula for the marginal distribution of the last hitting time on an infinite time horizon is easily recovered as a special limit. Furthermore, we derive general formulae for each component of the joint distribution, i.e., the jointly continuous, the partly continuous (defective) and the jointly defective portions. By employing spectral expansions of the transition densities and the first hitting time distributions, our derivations culminate in novel general spectral expansions for both marginal and joint distributions of the last hitting time and the process value on any finite time horizon.
  An additional main contribution of this paper lies in the application of our general formulae, giving rise to newly closed-form analytical formulae for several solvable diffusions. In particular, we systematically derive analytical expressions for each portion of the marginal and joint distributions of the last hitting time and the process value on any finite time horizon, without and with imposed killing at one or two interior points, for Brownian motion, Brownian motion with drift (geometric Brownian motion), the squared Bessel , squared radial Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (CIR) and Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes. Most of our formulae are given in terms of spectral series that are rapidly convergent and efficiently implemented. We demonstrate this by presenting some numerical calculations of marginal and joint distributions using accurately truncated series.</description>

      <title>Large deviations for interacting particle dynamics for finding mixed equilibria in zero-sum games</title>

      <description>arXiv:2206.15177v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Finding equilibrium points in continuous minmax games has become a key problem within machine learning, in part due to its connection to the training of generative adversarial networks and reinforcement learning. Because of existence and robustness issues, recent developments have shifted from pure equilibria to focusing on mixed equilibrium points. In this work we consider a method for finding mixed equilibria in two-layer zero-sum games based on entropic regularisation, where the two competing strategies are represented by two sets of interacting particles. We show that the sequence of empirical measures of the particle system satisfies a large deviation principle as the number of particles grows to infinity, and how this implies convergence of the empirical measure and the associated Nikaid\^o-Isoda error, complementing existing law of large numbers results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11825v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a class of chance-constrained programs in which profit needs to be maximized while enforcing that a given adverse event remains rare. Using techniques from large deviations and extreme value theory, we show how the optimal value scales as the prescribed bound on the violation probability becomes small and how convex programs emerge in the limit. We use our results to analyze the performance of existing popular approaches in the rare-event regime. We show that the popular CVaR and sample approximations have optimality properties under light-tailed assumptions on the randomness, while they behave sub-optimal in a heavy-tailed setting. Our results are derived using large deviations theory, extreme value theory, process techniques, and random set theory.</description>

      <title>Generalized Eigenspaces and Pseudospectra of Nonnormal and Defective Matrix-Valued Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06472v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider nonnormal matrix-valued dynamical systems with discrete time. For an eigenvalue of matrix, the number of times it appears as a root of the characteristic polynomial is called the algebraic multiplicity. On the other hand, the geometric multiplicity is the dimension of the linear space of eigenvectors associated with that eigenvalue. If the former exceeds the latter, then the eigenvalue is said to be defective and the matrix becomes nondiagonalizable by any similarity transformation. The discrete-time of our dynamics is identified with the geometric multiplicity of the zero eigenvalue $\lambda_0=0$. Its algebraic multiplicity takes about half of the matrix size at $t=1$ and increases stepwise in time, which keeps excess to the geometric multiplicity until their coincidence at the final time. Our model exhibits relaxation processes from far-from-normal to near-normal matrices, in which the defectivity of $\lambda_0$ is recovering in time. We show that such processes are realized as size reductions of pseudospectrum including $\lambda_0$. Here the pseudospectra are the domains on the complex plane which are not necessarily exact spectra but in which the resolvent of matrix takes extremely large values. The defective eigenvalue $\lambda_0$ is sensitive to perturbation and the eigenvalues of the perturbed systems are distributed densely in the pseudospectrum including $\lambda_0$. By constructing generalized eigenspace for $\lambda_0$, we give the Jordan block decomposition for the resolvent of matrix and characterize the pseudospectrum dynamics. Numerical study of the systems perturbed by Gaussian random matrices supports the validity of the present analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06514v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the problem of estimating the drift parameter in a system of $N$ interacting particles driven by additive fractional Brownian motion of Hurst index \( H \geq 1/2 \). Considering continuous observation of the interacting particles over a fixed interval \([0, T]\), we examine the asymptotic regime as \( N \to \infty \). Our main tool is a random variable reminiscent of the least squares estimator but unobservable due to its reliance on the Skorohod integral. We demonstrate that this object is consistent and asymptotically normal by establishing a quantitative propagation of chaos for Malliavin derivatives, which holds for any \( H \in (0,1) \). Leveraging a connection between the divergence integral and the Young integral, we construct computable estimators of the drift parameter. These estimators are shown to be consistent and asymptotically Gaussian. Finally, a numerical study highlights the strong performance of the proposed estimators.</description>

      <title>A control variate method for threshold crossing probabilities of plastic deformation driven by transient coloured noise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14565v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a hybrid method combining partial differential equation (PDE) and Monte Carlo (MC) techniques to obtain efficient estimates of statistics for plastic deformation related to kinematic hardening models driven by transient coloured noise. Our approach employs a control variate strategy inspired by [CPAM, 75 (3), 455-492, 2022] and relies on a class of PDEs with non-standard boundary conditions, which we derive here. The solutions of those PDEs represent the statistics of models driven by transient white noise and are significantly easier to solve than the coloured noise version. Our approach uses a coupling between the white-noise-driven process and the coloured-noise-driven process, yielding a variance-reduced estimator through control variate techniques. We apply our method to threshold-crossing probabilities, which are used as failure criteria known as ultimate and serviceability limit states under non-stationary excitation. Our contribution provides solid grounds for such calculations and is significantly more computationally efficient in terms of variance reduction compared to standard MC simulations.</description>

      <title>A Malliavin calculus approach to score functions in diffusion generative models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05550v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Score-based diffusion generative models have recently emerged as a powerful tool for modelling complex data distributions. These models aim at learning the score function, which defines a map from a known probability distribution to the target data distribution via deterministic or stochastic differential equations (SDEs). The score function is typically estimated from data using a variety of approximation techniques, such as denoising or sliced score matching, Hyv\"arien's method, or Schr\"odinger bridges. In this paper, we derive an exact, closed-form, expression for the score function for a broad class of nonlinear diffusion generative models. Our approach combines modern stochastic analysis tools such as Malliavin derivatives and their adjoint operators (Skorokhod integrals or Malliavin Divergence) with a new Bismut-type formula. The resulting expression for the score function can be written entirely in terms of the first and second variation processes, with all Malliavin derivatives systematically eliminated, thereby enhancing its practical applicability. The theoretical framework presented in this work offers a principled foundation for advancing score estimation methods in generative modelling, enabling the design of new sampling algorithms for complex probability distributions. Our results can be extended to broader classes of stochastic differential equations, opening new directions for the development of score-based diffusion generative models.</description>
