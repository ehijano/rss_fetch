      <title>Probabilistic Forecasting of Radiation Exposure for Spaceflight</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extended human presence beyond low-Earth orbit (BLEO) during missions to the Moon and Mars will pose significant challenges in the near future. A primary health risk associated with these missions is radiation exposure, primarily from galatic cosmic rays (GCRs) and solar proton events (SPEs). While GCRs present a more consistent, albeit modulated threat, SPEs are harder to predict and can deliver acute doses over short periods. Currently NASA utilizes analytical tools for monitoring the space radiation environment in order to make decisions of immediate action to shelter astronauts. However this reactive approach could be significantly enhanced by predictive models that can forecast radiation exposure in advance, ideally hours ahead of major events, while providing estimates of prediction uncertainty to improve decision-making. In this work we present a machine learning approach for forecasting radiation exposure in BLEO using multimodal time-series data including direct solar imagery from Solar Dynamics Observatory, X-ray flux measurements from GOES missions, and radiation dose measurements from the BioSentinel satellite that was launched as part of Artemis~1 mission. To our knowledge, this is the first time full-disk solar imagery has been used to forecast radiation exposure. We demonstrate that our model can predict the onset of increased radiation due to an SPE event, as well as the radiation decay profile after an event has occurred.</description>

      <title>Effectiveness of Multi-Layered Radiation Shields Constructed from Polyethylene and Metal Hydrides Using HZETRN and OLTARIS for space applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A major challenge for extended human spaceflights in deep space is the dangerous exposure to space radiation. In previous studies aluminium has been used as a multilayer shielding material in GCR space radiation environment with high dose equivalent. To further reduce the dose equivalent, shielding effectiveness of various metal hydrides in GCR free space environment is investigated using HZETRN2015 (High charge (Z) &amp; Energy TRaNsport) and OLTARIS (On-Line Tool for the Assessment of Radiation In Space) in this work. Metal hydride materials are chosen because of their capacity to store hydrogen. Among these materials, lithium hydride has demonstrated superior effectiveness as a radiation shield. Given this, the potential of a multilayer shield composed of polyethylene and lithium hydride is also being explored considering the tensile strength certain varieties of polyethylene like UHMWPE (Ultra High Molecular Weight Poly-Ethylene) can provide. The results from HZETRN2015 and OLTARIS transport codes are compared and found in agreement.</description>

      <title>In-situ observations of resident space objects with the CHEOPS space telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The CHaracterising ExOPlanet Satellite (CHEOPS) is a partnership between the European Space Agency and Switzerland with important contributions by 10 additional ESA member States. It is the first S-class mission in the ESA Science Programme. CHEOPS has been flying on a Sun-synchronous low Earth orbit since December 2019, collecting millions of short-exposure images in the visible domain to study exoplanet properties. A small yet increasing fraction of CHEOPS images show linear trails caused by resident space objects crossing the instrument field of view. To characterize the population of satellites and orbital debris observed by CHEOPS, all and every science images acquired over the past 3 years have been scanned with a Hough transform algorithm to identify the characteristic linear features that these objects cause on the images. Thousands of trails have been detected. This statistically significant sample shows interesting trends and features such as an increased occurrence rate over the past years as well as the fingerprint of the Starlink constellation. The cross-matching of individual trails with catalogued objects is underway as we aim to measure their distance at the time of observation and deduce the apparent magnitude of the detected objects. As space agencies and private companies are developing new space-based surveillance and tracking activities to catalogue and characterize the distribution of small debris, the CHEOPS experience is timely and relevant. With the first CHEOPS mission extension currently running until the end of 2026, and a possible second extension until the end of 2029, the longer time coverage will make our dataset even more valuable to the community, especially for characterizing objects with recurrent crossings.</description>

      <title>Intergalactic medium rotation measure of primordial magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16230v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Faraday rotation effect, quantified by the Rotation Measure (RM), is a powerful probe of the large-scale magnetization of the Universe - tracing magnetic fields not only on galaxy and galaxy cluster scales but also in the intergalactic Medium (IGM; referred to as $\mathrm{RM}_{\text{IGM}}$). The redshift dependence of the latter has extensively been explored with observations. It has also been shown that this relation can help to distinguish between different large-scale magnetization scenarios. We study the evolution of this $\mathrm{RM}_{\text{IGM}}$ for different primordial magnetogenesis scenarios to search for the imprints of primordial magnetic fields (PMFs; magnetic fields originating in the early Universe) on the redshift-dependence of $\mathrm{RM}_{\text{IGM}}$. We use cosmological magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations for evolving PMFs during large-scale structure formation, coupled to the light cone analysis to produce a realistic statistical sample of mock $\mathrm{RM}_{\text{IGM}}$ images. We study the predicted behavior for the cosmic evolution of $\mathrm{RM}_{\text{IGM}}$ for different correlation lengths of PMFs, and provide fitting functions for their dependence on redshifts. We compare these mock RM trends with the recent analysis of the the LOw-Frequency ARray (LOFAR) RM Grid and find that large-scale-correlated PMFs should have (comoving) strengths $\lesssim 0.75$ nanoGauss, if originated during inflation with the scale invariant spectrum and (comoving) correlation length $\sim 19$ cMpc/h or $ \lesssim 30$ nanoGauss if they originated during phase-transition epochs with the comoving correlation length $\sim 1$ cMpc/h. Our findings agree with previous observations and confirm the results of semi-analytical studies, showing that upper limits on the PMF strength decrease as their coherence scales increase.</description>

      <title>Multi-spacecraft observations of the decay phase of solar energetic particle events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07903v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Context: Parameters of solar energetic particle (SEP) event profiles such as the onset time and peak time have been researched extensively to obtain information on acceleration and transport of SEPs. Corotation of particle-filled magnetic flux tubes with the Sun is generally thought to play a minor role in determining intensity profiles. However recent simulations have suggested that corotation has an effect on SEP decay phases, depending on the location of the observer with respect to the active region (AR) associated with the event. Aims: We aim to determine whether signatures of corotation are present in observations of decay phases of SEP events and study how the parameters of the decay phase depend on the properties of the flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) associated with the events. Methods: We analyse multi-spacecraft observations of SEP intensity profiles from 11 events between 2020 and 2022, using data from SOLO, PSP, STEREO-A, and SOHO. We determine the decay time constant, \tau in 3 energy channels; electrons ~ 1 MeV, protons ~ 25 MeV, and protons ~ 60 MeV. We study the dependence of \tau on the longitudinal separation, \Delta \phi, between source active region (AR) and the spacecraft magnetic footpoint on the Sun.
  Results: Within individual events there is a tendency for the decay time constant to decrease with increasing $\Delta \phi$, in agreement with test particle simulations. The intensity of the associated flare and speed of the associated CMEs have a strong effect on the measured $\tau$ values and are likely the cause of the observed large inter-event variability.
  Conclusions: We conclude that corotation has a significant effect on the decay phase of a solar energetic particle event and should be included in future simulations and interpretations of these events.</description>

      <title>Detection asymmetry in solar energetic particle events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08211v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Context. Solar energetic particles (SEPs) are detected in interplanetary space in association with flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) at the Sun. The magnetic connection between the observing spacecraft and the solar active region (AR) source of the event is a key parameter in determining whether SEPs are observed and the properties of the particle event. Aims. We investigate whether an east-west asymmetry in the detection of SEP events is present in observations and discuss its possible link to corotation of magnetic flux tubes with the Sun. Methods. We used a published dataset of 239 CMEs recorded between 2006 and 2017 and having source regions both on the front side and far side of the Sun as seen from Earth. We produced distributions of occurrence of in-situ SEP intensity enhancements associated with the CME events, versus \Delta \phi, the separation in longitude between the source active region and the magnetic footpoint of the observing spacecraft based on the nominal Parker spiral. We focused on protons of energy &gt;10 MeV measured by the STEREO A, STEREO B and GOES spacecraft at 1 au. We also considered the occurrence of 71-112 keV electron events detected by MESSENGER between 0.31 and 0.47 au. Results. We find an east-west asymmetry in the detection of &gt;10 MeV proton events and of 71-112 keV electron events. For protons, observers for which the source AR is on the east side of the spacecraft footpoint and not well connected (-180 &lt; \Delta \phi &lt; -40) are 93% more likely to detect an SEP event compared to observers with +40 &lt; \Delta \phi &lt; +180. The asymmetry may be a signature of corotation of magnetic flux tubes with the Sun, given that for events with \Delta \phi &lt; 0 corotation sweeps the particle-filled flux tubes towards the observing spacecraft, while for \Delta \phi &gt; 0 it takes them away from it.</description>
