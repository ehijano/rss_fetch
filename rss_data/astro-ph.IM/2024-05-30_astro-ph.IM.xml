      <title>Design, Implementation, and Performance of the Primary Reflector for SALTUS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Single Aperture Large Telescope for Universe Studies (SALTUS) is a mission concept for a far-infrared observatory developed under the recent Astrophysics Probe Explorer opportunity from NASA. The enabling element of the program is a 14 m diameter inflatable primary mirror, M1. Due to its importance to SALTUS and potentially other space observatories, this paper focuses entirely on M1. We present a historical overview of inflatable systems, illustrating that M1 is the logical next step in the evolution of such systems. The process of design and manufacture is addressed. We examine how M1 performs in its environment in terms of operating temperature, interaction with the solar wind, and shape change due to non-penetrating particles. We investigate the longevity of the inflatant in detail and show it meets mission lifetime requirements with ample margin and discuss the development and testing to realize the flight M1.</description>

      <title>Identification of multi-component LOFAR sources with multi-modal deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern high-sensitivity radio telescopes are discovering an increased number of resolved sources with intricate radio structures and fainter radio emissions. These sources often present a challenge because source detectors might identify them as separate radio sources rather than components belonging to the same physically connected radio source. Currently, there are no reliable automatic methods to determine which radio components are single radio sources or part of multi-component sources. We propose a deep learning classifier to identify those sources that are part of a multi-component system and require component association on data from the LOFAR Two-Metre Sky Survey (LoTSS). We combine different types of input data using multi-modal deep learning to extract spatial and local information about the radio source components: a convolutional neural network component that processes radio images is combined with a neural network component that uses parameters measured from the radio sources and their nearest neighbours. Our model retrieves 94 per cent of the sources with multiple components on a balanced test set with 2,683 sources and achieves almost 97 per cent accuracy in the real imbalanced data (323,103 sources). The approach holds potential for integration into pipelines for automatic radio component association and cross-identification. Our work demonstrates how deep learning can be used to integrate different types of data and create an effective solution for managing modern radio surveys.</description>

      <title>The Near-Infrared Gatherer of Helium Transits (NIGHT)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the subsystems of the NIGHT instrument. NIGHT (the Near Infrared Gatherer of Helium Transits) is a narrowband, high-resolution spectrograph, marking the first dedicated survey instrument for exoplanetary atmosphere observations. Developed through a collaboration between the Observatory of Geneva and the Universite de Montreal, NIGHT aims to conduct an extensive statistical survey of helium atmospheres around 100+ exoplanets over several years. The instrument will report new detections of helium in exoplanet atmospheres and perform temporal monitoring of a subset of these.
  NIGHT measures absorption from the metastable helium state during exoplanet transits, observable in a triplet of lines around 1083nm. The instrument comprises a vacuum enclosure housing the spectrograph, a front end unit for fiber injection at the telescope's focal plane, and a calibration and control rack containing calibration light sources and control hardware.
  The spectrograph is optimized for efficiency, achieving a uniform throughput of approximately 71%. The primary disperser employs a VPH grating in a unique double-pass configuration, enabling a spectral resolution of 75,000 while maintaining high throughput. The detector is a HAWAII-1 infrared array, cooled to 85K, with the spectrograph operating at room temperature. Thanks to its relatively high throughput, NIGHT on a 2m class telescope is predicted to be as sensitive as existing instruments on 4m class telescopes.
  The front end unit injects starlight and sky background into two separate fibers leading to the spectrograph. It also performs near-infrared guiding and includes a mechanism for injecting calibration light.
  The assembly and optical alignment of NIGHT's spectrograph and front end unit are scheduled for July to September 2024, with the first light anticipated before early 2025.</description>

      <title>Development of the X-ray polarimeter using CMOS imager: polarization sensitivity of a $1.5~{\rm \mu m}$ pixel CMOS sensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We are developing an imaging polarimeter by combining a fine-pixel CMOS image sensor with a coded aperture mask as part of the cipher project, aiming to achieve X-ray polarimetry in the energy range of $10$$\unicode{x2013}$$30~\mathrm{keV}$. A successful proof-of-concept experiment was conducted using a fine-pixel CMOS sensor with a $2.5~\mathrm{\mu m}$ pixel size. In this study, we conducted beam experiments to assess the modulation factor (MF) of the CMOS sensor with a $1.5~\mathrm{\mu m}$ pixel size manufactured by Canon and to determine if there was any improvement in the MF. The measured MF was $8.32\% \pm 0.34\%$ at $10~\mathrm{keV}$ and $16.10\% \pm 0.68\%$ at $22~\mathrm{keV}$, exceeding those of the $2.5~\mathrm{\mu m}$ sensor in the $6$$\unicode{x2013}$$22~\mathrm{keV}$ range. We also evaluated the quantum efficiency of the sensor, inferring a detection layer thickness of $2.67 \pm 0.48~{\rm \mu m}$. To develop a more sensitive polarimeter, a sensor with a thicker detection layer, smaller pixel size, and reduced thermal diffusion effect is desirable.</description>

      <title>The BlackGEM telescope array I: Overview</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main science aim of the BlackGEM array is to detect optical counterparts to gravitational wave mergers. Additionally, the array will perform a set of synoptic surveys to detect Local Universe transients and short time-scale variability in stars and binaries, as well as a six-filter all-sky survey down to ~22nd mag. The BlackGEM Phase-I array consists of three optical wide-field unit telescopes. Each unit uses an f/5.5 modified Dall-Kirkham (Harmer-Wynne) design with a triplet corrector lens, and a 65cm primary mirror, coupled with a 110Mpix CCD detector, that provides an instantaneous field-of-view of 2.7~square degrees, sampled at 0.564\arcsec/pixel. The total field-of-view for the array is 8.2 square degrees. Each telescope is equipped with a six-slot filter wheel containing an optimised Sloan set (BG-u, BG-g, BG-r, BG-i, BG-z) and a wider-band 440-720 nm (BG-q) filter. Each unit telescope is independent from the others. Cloud-based data processing is done in real time, and includes a transient-detection routine as well as a full-source optimal-photometry module. BlackGEM has been installed at the ESO La Silla observatory as of October 2019. After a prolonged COVID-19 hiatus, science operations started on April 1, 2023 and will run for five years. Aside from its core scientific program, BlackGEM will give rise to a multitude of additional science cases in multi-colour time-domain astronomy, to the benefit of a variety of topics in astrophysics, such as infant supernovae, luminous red novae, asteroseismology of post-main-sequence objects, (ultracompact) binary stars, and the relation between gravitational wave counterparts and other classes of transients</description>

      <title>Reliability of in-band and broadband spectral index measurement: systematic study of the effect of signal to noise for uGMRT data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low radio frequency spectral index measurements are a powerful tool to distinguish between different emission mechanisms and, in turn, to understand the nature of the sources. Besides the standard method of estimating the ``broadband" spectral index of sources from observations in two different frequency ``bands", if the observations were made with large instantaneous bandwidth, the ``in-band" spectral index can be determined, either using images of emission at multiple frequency ranges within a band or using the novel Multi Term-Multi Frequency Synthesis (MT-MFS) imaging algorithm. Here, using simulated upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) data, we have systematically studied the reliability of various methods of spectral index estimation for sources with a wide range of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). It is found that, for synthetic uGMRT point source data, the MT-MFS imaging algorithm produces in-band spectral indices for SNR~$\lesssim100$ that have errors $\gtrsim 0.2$, making them unreliable. However, at a similar SNR, the sub-band splitting method produces errors $\lesssim 0.2$, which are more accurate and unbiased in-band spectral indices. The broadband spectral indices produce errors $\lesssim 0.2$ even for SNR $\gtrsim 15$, and hence, they are most reliable if there are no higher-order variations in the spectral index. These results may be used to improve the uGMRT observation and data analysis strategies depending on the brightness of the target source.</description>

      <title>Calibration of MAJIS (Moons And Jupiter Imaging Spectrometer): III. Spectral Calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Moons And Jupiter Imaging Spectrometer (MAJIS) is the visible and near-infrared imaging spectrometer onboard ESA s Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (JUICE) mission. Before its integration into the spacecraft, the instrument undergoes an extensive ground calibration to establish its baseline performances. This process prepares the imaging spectrometer for flight operations by characterizing the behavior of the instrument under various operative conditions and uncovering instrumental distortions that may depend on instrumental commands. Two steps of the on-ground calibration campaigns were held at the instrument level to produce the data. Additional in-flight measurements have recently been obtained after launch during the Near-Earth Commissioning Phase. In this article, we present the analyses of these datasets, focusing on the characterization of the spectral performances. First, we describe and analyze the spectral calibration datasets obtained using both monochromatic sources and polychromatic sources coupled with solid and gas samples. Then, we derive the spectral sampling and the spectral response function over the entire field of view. These spectral characteristics are quantified for various operational parameters of MAJIS, such as temperature and spectral binning. The derived on-ground performances are then compared with in-flight measurements obtained after launch and presented in the framework of the MAJIS performance requirements.</description>

      <title>Photometric Completeness Modelled With Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In almost any study involving optical/NIR photometry, understanding the completeness of detection and recovery is an essential part of the work. The recovery fraction is, in general, a function of several variables including magnitude, color, background sky noise, and crowding. We explore how completeness can be modelled, {with the use of artificial-star tests,} in a way that includes all of these parameters \emph{simultaneously} within a neural network (NN) framework. The method is able to manage common issues including asymmetric completeness functions and the bilinear dependence of the detection limit on color index. We test the method with two sample HST (Hubble Space Telescope) datasets: the first involves photometry of the star cluster population around the giant Perseus galaxy NGC 1275, and the second involves the halo-star population in the nearby elliptical galaxy NGC 3377. The NN-based method achieves a classification accuracy of $&gt;$\,94\%, and produces results entirely consistent with more traditional techniques for determining completeness. Additional advantages of the method are that none of the issues arising from binning of the data are present, and that a recovery probability can be assigned to every individual star in the real photometry. Our data, models, and code (called COINTOSS) can be found online on Zenodo at the following link: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8306488.</description>

      <title>WST -- Widefield Spectroscopic Telescope: addressing the instrumentation challenges of a new 12m class telescope dedicated to widefield Multi-object and Integral Field Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: WST - Widefield Spectroscopic Telescope: We summarise the design challenges of instrumentation for a proposed 12m class Telescope that aims to provide a large (&gt;2.5 square degree) field of view and enable simultaneous Multi-object (&gt; 20,000 objects) and Integral Field spectroscopy (inner 3x3 arcminutes field of view), initially at visible wavelengths. For the MOS mode, instrumentation includes the fiber positioning units, fiber runs and the high (R~40,000) and low (R~3,000 - 4,000) resolution spectrographs. For the MUSE like Integral Field Spectrograph, this includes the relay from the Telescope Focal Plane, the multi-stage splitting and slicing and almost 150 identical spectrographs. We highlight the challenge of mass production at a credible cost and the issues of maintenance and sustainable operation.</description>

      <title>Improving Harmonic Analysis using Multitapering: Precise frequency estimation of stellar oscillations using the harmonic F-test</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In Patil et. al 2024a, we developed a multitaper power spectrum estimation method, mtNUFFT, for analyzing time-series with quasi-regular spacing, and showed that it not only improves upon the statistical issues of the Lomb-Scargle periodogram, but also provides a factor of three speed up in some applications. In this paper, we combine mtNUFFT with the harmonic F-test to test the hypothesis that a strictly periodic signal or its harmonic (as opposed to e.g. a quasi-periodic signal) is present at a given frequency. This mtNUFFT/F-test combination shows that multitapering allows detection of periodic signals and precise estimation of their frequencies, thereby improving both power spectrum estimation and harmonic analysis. Using asteroseismic time-series data for the Kepler-91 red giant, we show that the F-test automatically picks up the harmonics of its transiting exoplanet as well as certain dipole ($l=1$) mixed modes. We use this example to highlight that we can distinguish between different types of stellar oscillations, e.g., transient (damped, stochastically-excited) and strictly periodic (undamped, heat-driven). We also illustrate the technique of dividing a time-series into chunks to further examine the transient versus periodic nature of stellar oscillations. The harmonic F-test combined with mtNUFFT is implemented in the public Python package tapify (https://github.com/aaryapatil/tapify), which opens opportunities to perform detailed investigations of periodic signals in time-domain astronomy.</description>

      <title>Design and Implementation of a New Apparatus for Astrochemistry: Kinetic Measurements of the CH + OCS Reaction and Frequency Comb Spectroscopy in a Cold Uniform Supersonic Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the development of a new astrochemical research tool HILTRAC, the Highly Instrumented Low Temperature ReAction Chamber. The instrument is based on a pulsed form of the CRESU (Cin\'etique de R\'eaction en \'Ecoulement Supersonique Uniforme, meaning reaction kinetics in a uniform supersonic flow) apparatus, with the aim of collecting kinetics and spectroscopic information on gas phase chemical reactions important in interstellar space or planetary atmospheres. We discuss the apparatus design and its flexibility, the implementation of pulsed laser photolysis followed by laser induced fluorescence (PLP-LIF), and the first implementation of direct infrared frequency comb spectroscopy (DFCS) coupled to the uniform supersonic flow. Achievable flow temperatures range from 32(3) - 111(9) K, characterising a total of five Laval nozzles for use with N2 and Ar buffer gases by pressure impact measurements. These results were further validated using LIF and DFCS measurements of the CH radical and OCS, respectively. Spectroscopic constants and linelists for OCS are reported for the 1001 band near $2890 - 2940 cm^{-1}$ for both $OC^{32}S$ and $OC^{34}S$, measured using DFCS. Additional peaks in the spectrum are tentatively assigned to the OCS-Ar complex. The first reaction rate coefficients for the CH + OCS reaction measured between 32(3) K and 58(5) K are reported. The reaction rate coefficient at 32(3) K was measured to be $3.9(4) \times 10^{10} cm^3 molecule^{-1} s^{-1}$ and the reaction was found to exhibit no observable temperature dependence over this low temperature range.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the efectiveness of sonifcation in science education using Edukoi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics classes are mainly taught using visual supports. However, the advancement of technology and the increasing eforts to equip schools with digital instrumentation have opened up the possibility of exploring new teaching avenues, such as sonifcation. We explored the efcacy of sonifcation in education using a novel interactive tool, Edukoi, in the context of astronomy, which is predominantly disseminated through spectacular images, animations, and visuals. Edukoi is a motion-sensing sonifcation tool that converts images to sound in real-time for educational applications. Our study, conducted with nearly 150 middle-school students, included a preliminary questionnaire investigating the perception, engagement, and motivation of students towards science; two sessions dedicated to testing Edukoi and assessing the potentiality of the software for the recognition of the colour and the shape of real and sketchy images; and a fnal second administration of the questionnaire to capture a possible benefcial efect of the use of the tool in the engagement towards science. Results showed the efectiveness of Edukoi in colour recognition and reasonable efcacy in shape identifcation. Although the questionnaire did not reveal an increment in science engagement over the time of the study, oral feedback from the students was positive. Edukoi presents a possible alternative teaching aid, potentially benefting diverse learners, including the visually impaired. Further developments of the software are needed to enhance its efectiveness in conveying more complex features such as composite colours or shapes.</description>

      <title>Computing low-thrust transfers in the asteroid belt, a comparison between astrodynamical manipulations and a machine learning approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18918</link>

Abstract: Low-thrust trajectories play a crucial role in optimizing scientific output and cost efficiency in asteroid belt missions. Unlike high-thrust transfers, low-thrust trajectories require solving complex optimal control problems. This complexity grows exponentially with the number of asteroids visited due to orbital mechanics intricacies. In the literature, methods for approximating low-thrust transfers without full optimization have been proposed, including analytical and machine learning techniques. In this work, we propose new analytical approximations and compare their accuracy and performance to machine learning methods. While analytical approximations leverage orbit theory to estimate trajectory costs, machine learning employs a more black-box approach, utilizing neural networks to predict optimal transfers based on various attributes. We build a dataset of about 3 million transfers, found by solving the time and fuel optimal control problems, for different time of flights, which we also release open-source. Comparison between the two methods on this database reveals the superiority of machine learning, especially for longer transfers. Despite challenges such as multi revolution transfers, both approaches maintain accuracy within a few percent in the final mass errors, on a database of trajectories involving numerous asteroids. This work contributes to the efficient exploration of mission opportunities in the asteroid belt, providing insights into the strengths and limitations of different approximation strategies.</description>

      <title>A short review on joint weak and strong cluster lens-mass reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The divide between weak and strong lensing is of course artificial, in that both regimes are manifestations of the same physical phenomenon: gravity bending the path of light. Nevertheless, these two regimes have to a large extent been treated separately, with different methods. This review traces the development of methods combining weak-lensing and strong-lensing data for joint lens-mass reconstruction, with a particular emphasis on cluster lenses, where both effects occur. We conclude that so-called inverse methods have been successful in merging the two regimes insofar data analysis is concerned. However, a number of improvements seem to be needed. First, not many studies include weak lensing data beyond shear. In light of the unprecedented quality of the data of JWST and future surveys, this is a clear point of improvement. Especially so, since flexion terms have proven useful in determining sub-structures. Second, considering the amount of data available, and the complexity of non-parametric lenses, automating the processes of lens-mass reconstruction would be beneficial. Towards this end, invoking machine learning seems like a promising way forward. The silence of the literature on this latter point is in fact somewhat surprising.</description>

      <title>Towards a computationally-efficient follow-up pipeline for blind continuous gravitational-wave searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The sensitivity of continuous gravitational-wave (CW) searches for unknown neutron stars (NSs) is limited by their parameter space breadth. To fit within reasonable computing budgets, hierarchical schemes are used to identify interesting candidates using affordable methods. The resulting sensitivity critically depends on the number of candidates selected to follow-up. In this work, we present a novel framework to evaluate the effectiveness of stochastic CW follow-ups. Our results in realistic datasets allow for a ten-fold reduction of the computing cost of pyfstat, a well-established follow-up method. We also simplify the setup of multi-stage follow-ups by removing the need for parameter-space metrics. The study was conducted on Gaussian and real O3 Advanced LIGO data using realistic durations, and covered both isolated and binary sources. These results will have a positive impact on the sensitivity of all-sky searches in the forthcoming observing runs of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration.</description>

      <title>Archetype-Based Redshift Estimation for the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a computationally efficient galaxy archetype-based redshift estimation and spectral classification method for the Dark Energy Survey Instrument (DESI) survey. The DESI survey currently relies on a redshift fitter and spectral classifier using a linear combination of PCA-derived templates, which is very efficient in processing large volumes of DESI spectra within a short time frame. However, this method occasionally yields unphysical model fits for galaxies and fails to adequately absorb calibration errors that may still be occasionally visible in the reduced spectra. Our proposed approach improves upon this existing method by refitting the spectra with carefully generated physical galaxy archetypes combined with additional terms designed to absorb data reduction defects and provide more physical models to the DESI spectra. We test our method on an extensive dataset derived from the survey validation (SV) and Year 1 (Y1) data of DESI. Our findings indicate that the new method delivers marginally better redshift success for SV tiles while reducing catastrophic redshift failure by $10-30\%$. At the same time, results from millions of targets from the main survey show that our model has relatively higher redshift success and purity rates ($0.5-0.8\%$ higher) for galaxy targets while having similar success for QSOs. These improvements also demonstrate that the main DESI redshift pipeline is generally robust. Additionally, it reduces the false positive redshift estimation by $5-40\%$ for sky fibers. We also discuss the generic nature of our method and how it can be extended to other large spectroscopic surveys, along with possible future improvements.</description>

      <title>Improving Power Spectrum Estimation using Multitapering: Efficient asteroseismic analyses for understanding stars, the Milky Way, and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.15027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.15027v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Asteroseismic time-series data have imprints of stellar oscillation modes, whose detection and characterization through time-series analysis allows us to probe stellar interior physics. Such analyses usually occur in the Fourier domain by computing the Lomb-Scargle (LS) periodogram, an estimator of the power spectrum underlying unevenly-sampled time-series data. However, the LS periodogram suffers from the statistical problems of (1) inconsistency (or noise) and (2) bias due to high spectral leakage. Here, we develop a multitaper power spectrum estimator using the Non-Uniform Fast Fourier Transform (mtNUFFT) to tackle the inconsistency and bias problems of the LS periodogram. Using a simulated light curve, we show that the mtNUFFT power spectrum estimate of solar-like oscillations has lower variance and bias than the LS estimate. We also apply our method to the Kepler-91 red giant, and combine it with PBjam peakbagging to obtain mode parameters and a derived age estimate of $3.97 \pm 0.52$ Gyr. PBjam allows the improvement of age precision relative to the $4.27 \pm 0.75$ Gyr APOKASC-2 (uncorrected) estimate, whereas partnering mtNUFFT with PBjam speeds up peakbagging thrice as much as LS. This increase in efficiency has promising implications for Galactic archaeology, in addition to stellar structure and evolution studies. Our new method generally applies to time-domain astronomy and is implemented in the public Python package tapify, available at https://github.com/aaryapatil/tapify.</description>

      <title>CHIME/FRB Outriggers: KKO Station System and Commissioning Results</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07898v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Localizing fast radio bursts (FRBs) to their host galaxies is an essential step to better understanding their origins and using them as cosmic probes. The CHIME/FRB Outrigger program aims to add VLBI-localization capabilities to CHIME, such that FRBs may be localized to tens of milliarcsecond precision at the time of their discovery, more than sufficient for host galaxy identification. The first-built outrigger telescope is KKO, located 66 kilometers west of CHIME. Cross-correlating KKO with CHIME can achieve arcsecond-scale localization in right ascension while avoiding the worst effects of the ionosphere. This paper presents measurements of KKO's performance throughout its commissioning phase, as well as a summary of its design and function. We demonstrate KKO's capabilities as a standalone instrument by producing full-sky images, mapping the angular and frequency structure of the primary beam, and measuring feed positions. To demonstrate the localization capabilities of the CHIME -- KKO baseline, we collected five separate observations each for a set of twenty bright pulsars, and aimed to measure their positions to within 5~arcseconds. All of these pulses were successfully localized to within this specification. The next two outriggers are expected to be commissioned in 2024, and will enable subarcsecond localizations for approximately hundreds of FRBs each year.</description>

      <title>Deeper, Sharper, Faster: Application of Efficient Transformer to Galaxy Image Restoration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00102v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Transformer architecture has revolutionized the field of deep learning over the past several years in diverse areas, including natural language processing, code generation, image recognition, time series forecasting, etc. We propose to apply Zamir et al.'s efficient transformer to perform deconvolution and denoising to enhance astronomical images. We conducted experiments using pairs of high-quality images and their degraded versions, and our deep learning model demonstrates exceptional restoration of photometric, structural, and morphological information. When compared with the ground-truth JWST images, the enhanced versions of our HST-quality images reduce the scatter of isophotal photometry, Sersic index, and half-light radius by factors of 4.4, 3.6, and 4.7, respectively, with Pearson correlation coefficients approaching unity. The performance is observed to degrade when input images exhibit correlated noise, point-like sources, and artifacts. We anticipate that this deep learning model will prove valuable for a number of scientific applications, including precision photometry, morphological analysis, and shear calibration.</description>

Abstract: The ComPair gamma-ray telescope is a technology demonstrator for a future gamma-ray telescope called the All-sky Medium Energy Gamma-ray Observatory (AMEGO). The instrument is composed of four subsystems, a double-sided silicon strip detector, a virtual Frisch grid CdZnTe calorimeter, a CsI:Tl based calorimeter, and an anti-coincidence detector (ACD). The CsI calorimeter's goal is to measure the position and energy deposited from high-energy events. To demonstrate the technological readiness, the calorimeter has flown onboard a NASA scientific balloon as part of the GRAPE-ComPair mission and accumulated around 3 hours of float time at an altitude of 40 km. During the flight, the CsI calorimeter observed background radiation, Regener-Pfotzer Maximum, and several gamma-ray activation lines originating from aluminum.</description>

      <title>HST/JWST Long-Term Monitoring Working Group Final Report</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12297v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Astro2020 Decadal Survey recognizes time-domain astronomy as a key science area over the next decade and beyond. With over 30 years of HST data and the potential for 20 years of JWST operations, these flagship observatories offer an unparalleled prospect for a half-century of space-based observations in the time domain. To take best advantage of this opportunity, STScI charged a working group to solicit community input and formulate strategies to maximize the science return in time-domain astronomy from these two platforms. Here, the HST/JWST Long-Term Monitoring Working Group reports on the input we received and presents our recommendations to enhance the scientific return for time-domain astronomy from HST and JWST. We suggest changes in policies to enable and prioritize long-term science programs of high scientific value. As charged, we also develop recommendations based on community input for a JWST Director's Discretionary Time program to observe high-redshift transients.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Signal Extraction Against Non-Stationary Instrumental Noises with Deep Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13091v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sapce-borne gravitational wave antennas, such as LISA and LISA-like mission (Taiji and Tianqin), will offer novel perspectives for exploring our Universe while introduce new challenges, especially in data analysis. Aside from the known challenges like high parameter space dimension, superposition of large number of signals and etc., gravitational wave detections in space would be more seriously affected by anomalies or non-stationarities in the science measurements. Considering the three types of foreseeable non-stationarities including data gaps, transients (glitches), and time-varying noise auto-correlations, which may come from routine maintenance or unexpected disturbances during science operations, we developed a deep learning model for accurate signal extractions confronted with such anomalous scenarios. Our model exhibits the same performance as the current state-of-the-art models do for the ideal and anomaly free scenario, while shows remarkable adaptability in extractions of coalescing massive black hole binary signal against all three types of non-stationarities and even their mixtures. This also provide new explorations into the robustness studies of deep learning models for data processing in space-borne gravitational wave missions.</description>
