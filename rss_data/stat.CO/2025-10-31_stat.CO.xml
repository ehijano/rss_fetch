      <title>Phantom types for robust hierarchical models with typegeist</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Bayesian hierarchical models, group-level parameter arrays must be mapped to the observation axis, often using explicit indexing. In complex models with numerous incompatible data and parameter sets, this introduces the potential for bugs, as indexing with the incorrect indices typically fails silently. Here we present typegeist, a type system for Python that uses static type analysis to enable specification and enforcement of data-parameter-index correspondences. We show how this can be used with common probabilistic programming frameworks to help guarantee model correctness with minimal run-time overhead.</description>

      <title>Life-cycle Modeling and the Walking Behavior of the Pedestrian-Group as an Emergent Agent: With Empirical Data on the Cohesion of the Group Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article investigates the pedestrian group as an emergent agent. The article explores empirical data to derive emergent agency and formation state spaces and outline recurring patterns of walking behavior. In this analysis, pedestrian trajectories extracted from surveillance videos are used along with manually annotated pedestrian group memberships. We conducted manual expert evaluation of observed groups, produced new manual annotations for relevant events pertaining to group behavior and extracted metrics relevant group formation. This information along with quantitative analysis was used to model the life-cycle and formation of the group agent. Those models give structure to expectations around walking behavior of groups; from pedestrian walking independently to the emergence of a collective intention where group members tended to maintain bounded distance between each other. Disturbances to this bounded distance often happened in association with changes in either their agency or their formation states. We summarized the patterns of behavior along with the sequences of state transitions into abstract patterns, which can aid in the development of more detailed group agents in simulation and in the design of engineering systems to interact with such groups.</description>

      <title>Monte-Carlo/Moments micro-macro Parareal method for unimodal and bimodal scalar McKean-Vlasov SDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.11365v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a micro-macro parallel-in-time Parareal method for scalar McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equations (SDEs). In the algorithm, the fine Parareal propagator is a Monte Carlo simulation of an ensemble of particles, while an approximate ordinary differential equation (ODE) description of the mean and the variance of the particle distribution is used as a coarse Parareal propagator to achieve speedup. We analyse the convergence behaviour of our method for a linear problem and provide numerical experiments indicating the parallel weak scaling of the algorithm on a set of examples. We show, with numerical experiments, that convergence typically takes place in a low number of iterations, depending on the quality of the ODE predictor. For bimodal SDEs, we avoid quality deterioration of the coarse predictor (compared to unimodal SDEs) through the usage of multiple ODEs, each describing the mean and variance of the particle distribution in locally unimodal regions of the phase space. The benefit of the proposed algorithm can be viewed through two lenses: (i) through the parallel-in-time lens, speedup is obtained through the use of a very cheap coarse integrator (an ODE moment model), and (ii) through the moment models lens, accuracy is iteratively gained through the use of parallel machinery as a corrector. In contrast to the isolated use of a moment model, the proposed method (iteratively) converges to the true distribution generated by the SDE.</description>

      <title>Cybersecurity threat detection based on a UEBA framework using Deep Autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11542v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: User and Entity Behaviour Analytics (UEBA) is a broad branch of data analytics that attempts to build a normal behavioural profile in order to detect anomalous events. Among the techniques used to detect anomalies, Deep Autoencoders constitute one of the most promising deep learning models on UEBA tasks, allowing explainable detection of security incidents that could lead to the leak of personal data, hijacking of systems, or access to sensitive business information. In this study, we introduce the first implementation of an explainable UEBA-based anomaly detection framework that leverages Deep Autoencoders in combination with Doc2Vec to process both numerical and textual features. Additionally, based on the theoretical foundations of neural networks, we offer a novel proof demonstrating the equivalence of two widely used definitions for fully-connected neural networks. The experimental results demonstrate the proposed framework capability to detect real and synthetic anomalies effectively generated from real attack data, showing that the models provide not only correct identification of anomalies but also explainable results that enable the reconstruction of the possible origin of the anomaly. Our findings suggest that the proposed UEBA framework can be seamlessly integrated into enterprise environments, complementing existing security systems for explainable threat detection.</description>
