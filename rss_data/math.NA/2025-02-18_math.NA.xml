      <title>Function recovery and optimal sampling in the presence of nonuniform evaluation costs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider recovering a function $f : D \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ in a $n$-dimensional linear subspace $\mathcal{P}$ from i.i.d. pointwise samples via (weighted) least-squares estimators. Different from most works, we assume the cost of evaluating $f$ is potentially nonuniform, and governed by a cost function $c : D \rightarrow (0,\infty)$ which may blow up at certain points. We therefore strive to choose the sampling measure in a way that minimizes the expected total cost. We provide a recovery guarantee which asserts accurate and stable recovery with an expected cost depending on the Christoffel function and Remez-type constant of the space $\mathcal{P}$. This leads to a general recipe for optimizing the sampling measure for general $c$. As an example, we consider one-dimensional polynomial spaces. Here, we provide two strategies for choosing the sampling measure, which we prove are optimal (up to constants and log factors) in the case of algebraically-growing cost functions.</description>

      <title>b-d-Lawson: a method for the interpolation constrained rational minimax approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel dual-based Lawson's method, termed b-d-Lawson, designed for addressing the rational minimax approximation under specific interpolation conditions. The b-d-Lawson approach incorporates two pivotal components that have been recently gained prominence in the realm of the rational approximations: the barycentric representation of the rational function and the dual framework for tackling minimax approximation challenges. The employment of barycentric formulae enables a streamlined parameterization of the rational function, ensuring natural satisfaction of interpolation conditions while mitigating numerical instability typically associated with Vandermonde basis matrices when monomial bases are utilized. This enhances both the accuracy and computational stability of the method. To address the bi-level min-max structure, the dual framework effectively transforms the challenge into a max-min dual problem, thereby facilitating the efficient application of Lawson's iteration. The integration of this dual perspective is crucial for optimizing the approximation process. We will discuss several applications of interpolation-constrained rational minimax approximation and illustrate numerical results to evaluate the performance of the b-d-Lawson method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and analyze a coupled hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin/discontinuous Galerkin (HDG/DG) method for porous media in which we allow fully and partly immersed faults, and faults that separate the domain into two disjoint subdomains. We prove well-posedness and present an a priori error analysis of the discretization. Numerical examples verify our analysis.</description>

      <title>Accelerating convergence of a natural convection solver by continuous data assimilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Picard iteration for the Boussinesq model of natural convection can be an attractive solver because it stably decouples the fluid equations from the temperature equation (for contrast, the Newton iteration does not stably decouple). However, the convergence of Picard for this system is only linear and slows as the Rayleigh number increases, eventually failing for even moderately sized Rayleigh numbers. We consider this solver in the setting where sparse solution data is available, e.g. from data measurements or solution observables, and enhance Picard by incorporating the data into the iteration using a continuous data assimilation (CDA) approach. We prove that our approach scales the linear convergence rate by $H^{1/2}$, where $H$ is the characteristic spacing of the measurement locations. This implies that when Picard is converging, CDA will accelerate convergence, and when Picard is not converging, CDA (with enough data) will enable convergence. In the case of noisy data, we prove that the linear convergence rate of the nonlinear residual is similarly scaled by $H^{1/2}$ but the accuracy is limited by the accuracy of the data. Several numerical tests illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, including when the data is noisy. These tests show that CDA style nudging adapted to an iteration (instead of a time stepping scheme) enables convergence at much higher $Ra$.</description>

      <title>Hybrid high-order methods for elasto-acoustic wave propagation in the time domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We devise a Hybrid High-Order (HHO) method for the coupling between the acoustic and elastic wave equations in the time domain. A first-order formulation in time is considered. The HHO method can use equal-order and mixed-order settings, as well as O(1)- and O(1/h)-stabilizations. An energy-error estimate is established in the time-continuous case. A numerical spectral analysis is performed, showing that O(1)-stabilization is required to avoid excessive CFL limitations for explicit time discretizations. Moreover, the spectral radius of the stiffness matrix is fairly independent of the geometry of the mesh cells. For analytical solutions on general meshes, optimal convergence rates of order (k+1) are shown in both equal- and mixed-order settings using O(1)-stabilization, whereas order (k+2) is achieved in the mixed-order setting using O(1/h)-stabilization. Test cases with a Ricker wavelet as an initial condition showcase the relevance of the proposed method for the simulation of elasto-acoustic wave propagation across media with contrasted material properties.</description>

      <title>Tensor parametric Hamiltonian operator inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a tensor-based approach to constructing data-driven reduced-order models corresponding to semi-discrete partial differential equations with canonical Hamiltonian structure. By expressing parameter-varying operators with affine dependence as contractions of a generalized parameter vector against a constant tensor, this method leverages the operator inference framework to capture parametric dependence in the learned reduced-order model via the solution to a convex, least-squares optimization problem. This leads to a concise and straightforward implementation which compactifies previous parametric operator inference approaches and directly extends to learning parametric operators with symmetry constraints, a key feature required for constructing structure-preserving surrogates of Hamiltonian systems. The proposed approach is demonstrated on both a (non-Hamiltonian) heat equation with variable diffusion coefficient as well as a Hamiltonian wave equation with variable wave speed.</description>

      <title>Learning the Exact Time Integration Algorithm for Initial Value Problems by Randomized Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a method leveraging extreme learning machine (ELM) type randomized neural networks (NNs) for learning the exact time integration algorithm for initial value problems (IVPs). The exact time integration algorithm for non-autonomous systems can be represented by an algorithmic function in higher dimensions, which satisfies an associated system of partial differential equations with corresponding boundary conditions. Our method learns the algorithmic function by solving this associated system using ELM with a physics informed approach. The trained ELM network serves as the learned algorithm and can be used to solve the IVP with arbitrary initial data or step sizes from some domain. When the right hand side of the non-autonomous system exhibits a periodicity with respect to any of its arguments, while the solution itself to the problem is not periodic, we show that the algorithmic function is either periodic, or when it is not, satisfies a well-defined relation for different periods. This property can greatly simplify the algorithm learning in many problems. We consider explicit and implicit NN formulations, leading to explicit or implicit time integration algorithms, and discuss how to train the ELM network by the nonlinear least squares method. Extensive numerical experiments with benchmark problems, including non-stiff, stiff and chaotic systems, show that the learned NN algorithm produces highly accurate solutions in long-time simulations, with its time-marching errors decreasing nearly exponentially with increasing degrees of freedom in the neural network. We compare extensively the computational performance (accuracy vs.~cost) between the current NN algorithm and the leading traditional time integration algorithms. The learned NN algorithm is computationally competitive, markedly outperforming the traditional algorithms in many problems.</description>

      <title>Scalable Binary CUR Low-Rank Approximation Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a scalable binary CUR low-rank approximation algorithm that leverages parallel selection of representative rows and columns within a deterministic framework. By employing a blockwise adaptive cross approximation strategy, the algorithm efficiently identifies dominant components in large-scale matrices, thereby reducing computational costs. Numerical experiments on $16,384 \times 16,384$ matrices demonstrate remarkable scalability, with execution time decreasing from $12.37$ seconds using $2$ processes to $1.02$ seconds using $64$ processes. The tests on Hilbert matrices and synthetic low-rank matrices across various sizes demonstrate a near-optimal reconstruction accuracy. These results suggest a potential for practical application in large-scale matrix low-rank approximation.</description>

      <title>Trace Ratio vs Ratio Trace methods for multi dimensionality reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a higher order approach for dimension reduction based on the Trace Ratio problem. We show the existence and uniqueness of the solution, and we provide a relationship between the Trace Ratio problem and the Ratio Trace problem. We also propose a new algorithm to solve the Trace Ratio problem. We apply the approach to generalize the Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) to higher order tensors. We provide some numerical experiments to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed method. The method is based on the Einstein product, and it is a generalization of the state-of-the-art trace based DR methods to higher order tensors. The superiority of the Tensor-based methods have been shown experimentally, which motivates us to extend the state-of-the-art Ratio Trace based DR methods to higher order tensors via the Einstein product.</description>

      <title>A Second-order method on graded meshes for fractional Laplacian via Riesz fractional derivative with a singular source term</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The high-order numerical analysis for fractional Laplacian via the Riesz fractional derivative, under the low regularity solution, has presented significant challenges in the past decades. To fill in this gap, we design a grid mapping function on graded meshes to analyse the local truncation errors, which are far less than second-order convergence at the boundary layer. To restore the second-order global errors, we construct an appropriate right-preconditioner for the resulting matrix algebraic equation. We prove that the proposed scheme achieves second-order convergence on graded meshes even if the source term is singular or hypersingular. Numerical experiments illustrate the theoretical results. The proposed approach is applicable for multidimensional fractional diffusion equations, gradient flows and nonlinear equations.</description>

      <title>Sparse Identification for bifurcating phenomena in Computational Fluid Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates model reduction techniques for nonlinear parameterized and time-dependent PDEs, specifically focusing on bifurcating phenomena in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). We develop interpretable and non-intrusive Reduced Order Models (ROMs) capable of capturing dynamics associated with bifurcations by identifying a minimal set of coordinates. Our methodology combines the Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) method with a deep learning framework based on Autoencoder (AE) architectures. To enhance dimensionality reduction, we integrate a nested Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) with the SINDy-AE architecture. This novel combination enables a sparse discovery of system dynamics while maintaining efficiency of the reduced model. We demonstrate our approach via two challenging test cases defined on sudden-expansion channel geometries: a symmetry-breaking bifurcation and a Hopf bifurcation. Starting from a comprehensive analysis of their high-fidelity behavior, i.e. symmetry-breaking phenomena and the rise of unsteady periodic solutions, we validate the accuracy and computational efficiency of our ROMs. The results show successful reconstruction of the bifurcations, accurate prediction of system evolution for unseen parameter values, and significant speed-up compared to full-order methods.</description>

      <title>Experimental study on square RC short columns strengthened with corrugated steel jacket under axial compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the long-term service of life, structural columns may experience mechanical performance degradation due to environmental erosion, various hazards, and functional modifications. This study proposes a novel concrete column reinforcement method utilizing square corrugated steel jackets as external confinement components, which significantly enhances both bearing capacity and ductility of original members. To investigate the mechanical performance improvement mechanisms and load-carry mode, 10 axially compressed short column specimens were designed. Detailed analyses were conducted surrounding the effects of connection methods for corrugated sheets, corrugated steel thickness, and damage levels on load-displacement curves, as well as stress and strain development patterns. A computational model for ultimate bearing capacity of reinforced sections was established. Key findings include: (1) The use of corrugated steel sleeves can enhance the ultimate bearing capacity of the original short columns by 34.6% to 67.3%. (2) Considering that the confinement effect of square sleeves is not optimal, it is more material-efficient to use thinner corrugated steel plates to achieve similar results. (3) There is no significant difference in the effects of connection types on mechanical performance. (4) The cracking and softening of damaged concrete can enhance the confinement effect in corrugated steel-strengthened reinforced concrete columns. (5) The confined concrete strength model can be used to accurately predict the ultimate bearing capacity.</description>

      <title>O-MMGP: Optimal Mesh Morphing Gaussian Process Regression for Solving PDEs with non-Parametric Geometric Variations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the computational challenges of solving parametric PDEs with non parametrized geometric variations and non-reducible problems, such as those involving shocks and discontinuities of variable positions. Traditional dimensionality reduction methods like POD struggle with these scenarios due to slowly decaying Kolmogorov widths. To overcome this, we propose a novel non-linear dimensionality reduction technique to reduce the required modes for representation. The non-linear reduction is obtained through a POD after applying a transformation on the fields, which we call optimal mappings, and is a solution to an optimization problem in infinite dimension. The proposed learning framework combines morphing techniques, non-linear dimensionality reduction, and Gaussian Process Regression (GPR). The problem is reformulated on a reference geometry before applying the dimensionality reduction. Our method learns both the optimal mapping, and the solution fields, using a series of GPR models, enabling efficient and accurate modeling of complex parametric PDEs with geometrical variability. The results obtained concur with current state-of-the-art models. We mainly compare our method with the winning solution of the ML4CFD NeurIPS 2024 competition.</description>

      <title>A new banded Petrov--Galerkin spectral method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a Petrov--Galerkin spectral method for ODEs with variable coefficients. When the variable coefficients are smooth, the new method yields a strictly banded linear system, which can be efficiently constructed and solved in linear complexity. The performance advantage of our method is demonstrated through benchmarking against Mortensen's Galerkin method and the ultraspherical spectral method. Furthermore, we introduce a systematic approach for designing the recombined basis and establish that our new method serves as a unifying framework that encompasses all existing banded Galerkin spectral methods. This significantly addresses the ongoing challenge of developing recombined bases and sparse Galerkin spectral method. Additionally, the accelerating techniques presented in this paper can also enhance the performance of the ultraspherical spectral method.</description>

      <title>Iterative Procedure for Non-Linear Fractional Integro-Differential Equations via Daftardar--Jafari Polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel approach called the Iterative Aboodh Transform Method (IATM) which utilizes Daftardar--Jafari polynomials for solving non-linear problems. Such method is employed to derive solutions for non-linear fractional partial integro-differential equations (FPIDEs). The key novelty of the suggested method is that it can be used for handling solutions of non-linear FPIDEs in a very simple and effective way. {More precisely, we show that Daftardar--Jafari polynomials have simple calculations as compared to Adomian polynomials with higher accuracy}. The results obtained within the Daftardar--Jafari polynomials are demonstrated with graphs and tables, and the IATM's absolute error confirms the higher accuracy of the suggested method.</description>

      <title>Evaluating singular and near-singular integrals on $C^2$ smooth surfaces with a novel geometric method and closed form expressions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most Fredholm integral equations involve integrals with weakly singular kernels. Once the domain of integration is discretized into elements, these weakly singular kernels become strongly singular or ``near-singular". Common methods to compute these integrals when the kernel is a Green's function include the Duffy transform, polar coordinates with closed analytic formulas, and singularity extraction. However, these methods do not generalize well to the normal derivatives of Green's functions. We provide methods to integrate both the Green's function and its normal derivative on smooth surfaces discretized by triangular elements in three dimensions. For strongly singular integrals involving normal derivatives of Green's functions, we provide two methods that can accurately approximate the true integrals on the true domain. The Geometric method uses geometric information of the true surface of integration to approximate the original integral on the true domain using push-forward maps. The Interpolation-Duffy method heuristically cancels out the singularity and then evaluates the integral using a quadrature scheme. Both methods are better than simply setting the singular integrals to zero, while being faster than adaptive refinement methods. The explicit analytic formulas for integrating polynomials $p$ of degree less than three are provided.</description>

      <title>Approximating a spatially-heterogeneously mass-emitting object by multiple point sources in a diffusion model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Various biological cells secrete diffusing chemical compounds into their environment for communication purposes. Secretion usually takes place over the cell membrane in a spatially heterogeneous manner. Mathematical models of these processes will be part of more elaborate models, e.g. of the movement of immune cells that react to cytokines in their environment. Here, we compare two approaches to modelling of the secretion-diffusion process of signalling compounds. The first is the so-called spatial exclusion model, in which the intracellular space is excluded from consideration and the computational space is the extracellular environment. The second consists of point source models, where the secreting cell is replaced by one or more non-spatial point sources or sinks, using -- mathematically -- Dirac delta distributions. We propose a multi-Dirac approach and provide explicit expressions for the intensities of the Dirac distributions. We show that two to three well-positioned Dirac points suffice to approximate well a temporally constant but spatially heterogeneous flux distribution of compound over the cell membrane, for a wide range of variation in flux density and diffusivity. The multi-Dirac approach is compared to a single-Dirac approach that was studied in previous work. Moreover, an explicit Green's function approach is introduced that has significant benefits in circumventing numerical instability that may occur when the Dirac sources have high intensities.</description>

      <title>Data assimilation performed with robust shape registration and graph neural networks: application to aortic coarctation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image-based, patient-specific modelling of hemodynamics can improve diagnostic capabilities and provide complementary insights to better understand the hemodynamic treatment outcomes. However, computational fluid dynamics simulations remain relatively costly in a clinical context. Moreover, projection-based reduced-order models and purely data-driven surrogate models struggle due to the high variability of anatomical shapes in a population. A possible solution is shape registration: a reference template geometry is designed from a cohort of available geometries, which can then be diffeomorphically mapped onto it. This provides a natural encoding that can be exploited by machine learning architectures and, at the same time, a reference computational domain in which efficient dimension-reduction strategies can be performed. We compare state-of-the-art graph neural network models with recent data assimilation strategies for the prediction of physical quantities and clinically relevant biomarkers in the context of aortic coarctation.</description>

      <title>pylevin: efficient numerical integration of integrals containing up to three Bessel functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrals involving highly oscillatory Bessel functions are notoriously challenging to compute using conventional integration techniques. While several methods are available, they predominantly cater to integrals with at most a single Bessel function, resulting in specialised yet highly optimised solutions. Here we present pylevin, a Python package to efficiently compute integrals containing up to three Bessel functions of arbitrary order and arguments. The implementation makes use of Levin's method and allows for accurate and fast integration of these highly oscillatory integrals. In benchmarking pylevin against existing software for single Bessel function integrals, we find its speed comparable, usually within a factor of two, to specialised packages such as FFTLog. Furthermore, when dealing with integrals containing two or three Bessel functions, pylevin delivers performance up to four orders of magnitude faster than standard adaptive quadrature methods, while also exhibiting better stability for large Bessel function arguments. pylevin is available from source via github or directly from PyPi.</description>

      <title>Weighted quantization using MMD: From mean field to mean shift via gradient flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Approximating a probability distribution using a set of particles is a fundamental problem in machine learning and statistics, with applications including clustering and quantization. Formally, we seek a finite weighted mixture of Dirac measures that best approximates the target distribution. While much existing work relies on the Wasserstein distance to quantify approximation errors, maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) has received comparatively less attention, especially when allowing for variable particle weights. We study the quantization problem from the perspective of minimizing MMD via gradient flow in the Wasserstein-Fisher-Rao (WFR) geometry. This gradient flow yields an ODE system from which we further derive a fixed-point algorithm called mean shift interacting particles (MSIP). We show that MSIP extends the (non-interacting) mean shift algorithm, widely used for identifying modes in kernel density estimates. Moreover, we show that MSIP can be interpreted as preconditioned gradient descent, and that it acts as a relaxation of Lloyd's algorithm for clustering. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that MSIP and the WFR ODEs outperform other algorithms for quantization of multi-modal and high-dimensional targets.</description>

      <title>An Interior-Point Algorithm for Continuous Nonlinearly Constrained Optimization with Noisy Function and Derivative Evaluations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An algorithm based on the interior-point methodology for solving continuous nonlinearly constrained optimization problems is proposed, analyzed, and tested. The distinguishing feature of the algorithm is that it presumes that only noisy values of the objective and constraint functions and their first-order derivatives are available. The algorithm is based on a combination of a previously proposed interior-point algorithm that allows inexact subproblem solutions and recently proposed algorithms for solving bound- and equality-constrained optimization problems with only noisy function and derivative values. It is shown that the new interior-point algorithm drives a stationarity measure below a threshold that depends on bounds on the noise in the function and derivative values. The results of numerical experiments show that the algorithm is effective across a wide range of problems.</description>

      <title>Accelerated Gradient-based Design Optimization Via Differentiable Physics-Informed Neural Operator: A Composites Autoclave Processing Case Study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulation and optimization are crucial for advancing the engineering design of complex systems and processes. Traditional optimization methods require substantial computational time and effort due to their reliance on resource-intensive simulations, such as finite element analysis, and the complexity of rigorous optimization algorithms. Data-agnostic AI-based surrogate models, such as Physics-Informed Neural Operators (PINOs), offer a promising alternative to these conventional simulations, providing drastically reduced inference time, unparalleled data efficiency, and zero-shot super-resolution capability. However, the predictive accuracy of these models is often constrained to small, low-dimensional design spaces or systems with relatively simple dynamics. To address this, we introduce a novel Physics-Informed DeepONet (PIDON) architecture, which extends the capabilities of conventional neural operators to effectively model the nonlinear behavior of complex engineering systems across high-dimensional design spaces and a wide range of dynamic design configurations. This new architecture outperforms existing SOTA models, enabling better predictions across broader design spaces. Leveraging PIDON's differentiability, we integrate a gradient-based optimization approach using the Adam optimizer to efficiently determine optimal design variables. This forms an end-to-end gradient-based optimization framework that accelerates the design process while enhancing scalability and efficiency. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework in the optimization of aerospace-grade composites curing processes achieving a 3x speedup in obtaining optimal design variables compared to gradient-free methods. Beyond composites processing, the proposed model has the potential to be used as a scalable and efficient optimization tool for broader applications in advanced engineering and digital twin systems.</description>

      <title>Transfer function interpolation remainder formula of rational Krylov subspace methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2102.11915v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rational Krylov subspace projection methods have proven to be a highly successful approach in the field of model order reduction (MOR), primarily due to the fact that some derivatives of the approximate and original transfer functions are identical.This is the well-known theory of moments matching. Nevertheless, the properties of points situated at considerable distances from the interplation nodes remain underexplored. In this paper, we present the explicit expression of the MOR error, which involves both the shifts and the Ritz values.The superiority of our discoveries over the known moments matching theory can be likened to the disparity between the Lagrange and Peano type remainder formulas in Taylor's theorem. Furthermore, two explanations are provided for the error formula with respect to the two parameters in the resolvent function. One explanation reveals that the MOR error is an interplation remainder, while the other explanation implies that the error is also a Gauss-Christoffel quadrature remainder.By applying the error formula, we suggest a greedy algorithm for the interpolatory $H_{\infty}$ norm MOR.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic modified Crouzeix-Raviart finite element method for the stationary Navier-Stokes equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.10214v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We studied an anisotropic modified Crouzeix--Raviart finite element method for the rotational form of a stationary incompressible Navier--Stokes equation with large irrotational body forces. We present an anisotropic $H^1$ error estimate for the velocity of the modified Crouzeix--Raviart finite element method for the Navier--Stokes equation. The modified Crouzeix--Raviart finite element scheme was obtained using a lifting operator that mapped the velocity test functions to $H(\div;\Omega)$-conforming finite element spaces. Because no shape-regularity mesh conditions are imposed, anisotropic meshes can be used for the analysis. The core idea of the proof involves using the relation between the Raviart--Thomas and Crouzeix--Raviart finite element spaces. Furthermore, we present a discrete Sobolev inequality under semi-regular mesh conditions to estimate the stability of the proposed method, and confirm the results obtained through numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Scaling-robust built-in a posteriori error estimation for discontinuous least-squares finite element methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.19930v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A convincing feature of least-squares finite element methods is the built-in a posteriori error estimator for any conforming discretization. In order to generalize this property to discontinuous finite element ansatz functions, this paper introduces a least-squares principle on piecewise Sobolev functions by the example of the Poisson model problem with mixed boundary conditions. It allows for fairly general discretizations including standard piecewise polynomial ansatz spaces on triangular and polygonal meshes. The presented scheme enforces the interelement continuity of the piecewise polynomials by additional least-squares residuals. A side condition on the normal jumps of the flux variable requires a vanishing integral mean and enables the penalization of the jump with the natural power of the mesh size in the least-squares functional. This avoids over-penalization with additional regularity assumptions on the exact solution as usually present in the literature on discontinuous LSFEM. The proof of the built-in a posteriori error estimation for the over-penalized scheme is presented as well. All results in this paper are robust with respect to the size of the domain guaranteed by a suitable weighting of the residuals in the least-squares functional. Numerical experiments illustrate the importance of the proposed weighting and exhibit optimal convergence rates of the adaptive mesh-refining algorithm for various polynomial degrees.</description>

      <title>Analysis and improvement of a semi-Lagrangian exponential scheme for the shallow-water equations on the rotating sphere</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02237v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we study and extend a class of semi-Lagrangian exponential methods, which combine exponential time integration techniques, suitable for integrating stiff linear terms, with a semi-Lagrangian treatment of nonlinear advection terms. Partial differential equations involving both processes arise for instance in atmospheric circulation models. Through a truncation error analysis, we show that previously formulated semi-Lagrangian exponential schemes are limited to first-order accuracy due to the approximation of the integration factor acting on the discretization of the linear term; we then formulate a new discretization leading to second-order accuracy. Also, a detailed stability study is conducted to compare several Eulerian and semi-Lagrangian exponential schemes, as well as a well-established semi-Lagrangian semi-implicit method, which is used in operational atmospheric models. Numerical simulations of the shallow-water equations on the rotating sphere are performed to assess the orders of convergence, stability properties, and computational cost of each method. The proposed second-order semi-Lagrangian exponential method was shown to be more stable and accurate than the previously formulated schemes of the same class at the expense of larger wall-clock times; however, the method is more stable and has a similar cost compared to the well-established semi-Lagrangian semi-implicit method; therefore, it is a competitive candidate for potential operational applications in atmospheric circulation modeling.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we analyze the convergence rate of randomized quasi-Monte Carlo (RQMC) methods under Owen's boundary growth condition [Owen, 2006] via spectral analysis. Specifically, we examine the RQMC estimator variance for the two commonly studied sequences: the lattice rule and the Sobol' sequence, applying the Fourier transform and Walsh--Fourier transform, respectively, for this analysis. Assuming certain regularity conditions, our findings reveal that the asymptotic convergence rate of the RQMC estimator's variance closely aligns with the exponent specified in Owen's boundary growth condition for both sequence types. We also provide analysis for certain discontinuous integrands.</description>

Abstract: Ensemble Kalman methods solve problems in domains such as filtering and inverse problems with interacting particles that evolve over time. For computationally expensive problems, the cost of attaining a high accuracy quickly becomes prohibitive. We exploit a hierarchy of approximations to the underlying forward model and apply multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) techniques, improving the asymptotic cost-to-error relation. More specifically, we use MLMC at each time step to estimate the interaction term in a single, globally-coupled ensemble. This technique was proposed by Hoel et al. for the ensemble Kalman filter; our goal is to study its applicability to a broader family of ensemble Kalman methods.</description>

Abstract: An underdetermined generalized absolute value equation (GAVE) may have no solution, one solution, finitely many or infinitely many solutions. This paper is concerned with sufficient conditions that guarantee the existence of solutions to an underdetermined GAVE. Particularly, sufficient conditions are established for an underdetermined GAVE to have infinitely many solutions with no zero entry that possess a particular or any given sign pattern. Iterative methods are proposed for the case when the underdetermined GAVE does have a solution. Some existing results for square GAVE are also extended.</description>

      <title>Generalized upwind summation-by-parts operators and their application to nodal discontinuous Galerkin methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14557v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-order numerical methods for conservation laws are highly sought after due to their potential efficiency. However, it is challenging to ensure their robustness, particularly for under-resolved flows. Baseline high-order methods often incorporate stabilization techniques that must be applied judiciously -- sufficient to ensure simulation stability but restrained enough to prevent excessive dissipation and loss of resolution. Recent studies have demonstrated that combining upwind summation-by-parts (USBP) operators with flux vector splitting can increase the robustness of finite difference (FD) schemes without introducing excessive artificial dissipation. This work investigates whether the same approach can be applied to nodal discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods. To this end, we demonstrate the existence of USBP operators on arbitrary grid points and provide a straightforward procedure for their construction. Our discussion encompasses a broad class of USBP operators, not limited to equidistant grid points, and enables the development of novel USBP operators on Legendre--Gauss--Lobatto (LGL) points that are well-suited for nodal DG methods. We then examine the robustness properties of the resulting DG-USBP methods for challenging examples of the compressible Euler equations, such as the Kelvin--Helmholtz instability. Similar to high-order FD-USBP schemes, we find that combining flux vector splitting techniques with DG-USBP operators does not lead to excessive artificial dissipation. Furthermore, we find that combining lower-order DG-USBP operators on three LGL points with flux vector splitting indeed increases the robustness of nodal DG methods. However, we also observe that higher-order USBP operators offer less improvement in robustness for DG methods compared to FD schemes. We provide evidence that this can be attributed to USBP methods adding dissipation only to unresolved modes...</description>

      <title>Using Linearized Optimal Transport to Predict the Evolution of Stochastic Particle Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01857v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop an Euler-type method to predict the evolution of a time-dependent probability measure without explicitly learning an operator that governs its evolution. We use linearized optimal transport theory to prove that the measure-valued analog of Euler's method is first-order accurate when the measure evolves ``smoothly.'' In applications of interest, however, the measure is an empirical distribution of a system of stochastic particles whose behavior is only accessible through an agent-based micro-scale simulation. In such cases, this empirical measure does not evolve smoothly because the individual particles move chaotically on short time scales. However, we can still perform our Euler-type method, and when the particles' collective distribution approximates a measure that \emph{does} evolve smoothly, we observe that the algorithm still accurately predicts this collective behavior over relatively large Euler steps. We specifically demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by showing that our algorithm vastly reduces the number of micro-scale steps needed to correctly approximate long-term behavior in two illustrative examples, reflected Brownian motion and a model of bacterial chemotaxis.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the dependence of physical observable of open quantum systems with Bosonic bath on the bath correlation function. We provide an error estimate of the difference of physical observable induced by the variation of bath correlation function, based on diagrammatic and combinatorial arguments.

      <description>arXiv:2410.04034v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the sparse phase retrieval problem, which aims to recover a sparse signal from a system of quadratic measurements. In this work, we propose a novel non-convex algorithm, termed Gradient Hard Thresholding Pursuit (GraHTP), for sparse phase retrieval with complex sensing vectors. GraHTP is theoretically provable and exhibits high efficiency, achieving a quadratic convergence rate after a finite number of iterations, while maintaining low computational complexity per iteration. Numerical experiments further demonstrate GraHTP's superior performance compared to state-of-the-art algorithms.</description>

      <title>Long-time Integration of Nonlinear Wave Equations with Neural Operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15617v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural operators have shown promise in solving many types of Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). They are significantly faster compared to traditional numerical solvers once they have been trained with a certain amount of observed data. However, their numerical performance in solving time-dependent PDEs, particularly in long-time prediction of dynamic systems, still needs improvement. In this paper, we focus on solving the long-time integration of nonlinear wave equations via neural operators by replacing the initial condition with the prediction in a recurrent manner. Given limited observed temporal trajectory data, we utilize some intrinsic features of these nonlinear wave equations, such as conservation laws and well-posedness, to improve the algorithm design and reduce accumulated error. Our numerical experiments examine these improvements in the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation, the sine-Gordon equation, and the Klein-Gordon wave equation on the irregular domain.</description>

      <title>Convergence proofs and strong error bounds for forward-backward stochastic differential equations using neural network simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01306v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce forward-backward stochastic differential equations, highlighting the connection between solutions of these and solutions of partial differential equations, related by the Feynman-Kac theorem. We review the technique of approximating solutions to high dimensional partial differential equations using neural networks, and similarly approximating solutions of stochastic differential equations using multilevel Monte Carlo. Connecting the multilevel Monte Carlo method with the neural network framework using the setup established by E et al. and Raissi, we provide novel numerical analyses to produce strong error bounds for the specific framework of Raissi. Our results bound the overall strong error in terms of the maximum of the discretisation error and the neural network's approximation error. Our analyses are necessary for applications of multilevel Monte Carlo, for which we propose suitable frameworks to exploit the variance structures of the multilevel estimators we elucidate. Also, focusing on the loss function advocated by Raissi, we expose the limitations of this, highlighting and quantifying its bias and variance. Lastly, we propose various avenues of further research which we anticipate should offer significant insight and speed improvements.</description>

      <title>A numerical method for solving the generalized tangent vector of hyperbolic systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04251v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work is concerned with the computation of the first-order variation for one-dimensional hyperbolic partial differential equations. In the case of shock waves the main challenge is addressed by developing a numerical method to compute the evolution of the generalized tangent vector introduced by Bressan and Marson (1995). Our basic strategy is to combine the conservative numerical schemes and a novel expression of the interface conditions for the tangent vectors along the discontinuity. Based on this, we propose a simple numerical method to compute the tangent vectors for general hyperbolic systems. Numerical results are presented for Burgers' equation and a 2 x 2 hyperbolic system with two genuinely nonlinear fields.</description>

      <title>A finite element scheme for an optimal control problem on steady Navier-Stokes-Brinkman equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09336v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a rigorous finite element framework for solving an optimal control problem governed by the steady Navier-Stokes-Brinkman equations, focusing on identifying a scalar permeability parameter $\gamma$ from local velocity observations. Three different finite element discretization schemes are proposed, and a priori error estimates are proven under appropriate regularity assumptions for each one. A key contribution of this paper is the development of residual-based a posteriori error estimators for both fully discrete and semi-discrete schemes, guiding adaptive mesh refinement to achieve comparable accuracy with fewer degrees of freedom. The method of manufactured solutions is used for numerical experiments to validate the theoretical findings, to demonstrate optimal convergence rates and the effectivity index is evaluated to measure their reliability. The framework offers insights into flow control mechanisms and paving the way for extensions to time-dependent, stochastic, or multiphysics problems.</description>

      <title>The greedy side of the LASSO: New algorithms for weighted sparse recovery via loss function-based orthogonal matching pursuit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.00844v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a class of greedy algorithms for weighted sparse recovery by considering new loss function-based generalizations of Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP). Given a (regularized) loss function, the proposed algorithms alternate the iterative construction of the signal support via greedy index selection and a signal update based on solving a local data-fitting problem restricted to the current support. We show that greedy selection rules associated with popular weighted sparsity-promoting loss functions admit explicitly computable and simple formulas. Specifically, we consider $ \ell^0 $- and $ \ell^1 $-based versions of the weighted LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator), the Square-Root LASSO (SR-LASSO) and the Least Absolute Deviations LASSO (LAD-LASSO). Through numerical experiments on Gaussian compressive sensing and high-dimensional function approximation, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms and empirically show that they inherit desirable characteristics from the corresponding loss functions, such as SR-LASSO's noise-blind optimal parameter tuning and LAD-LASSO's fault tolerance. In doing so, our study sheds new light on the connection between greedy sparse recovery and convex relaxation.</description>

      <title>Optimal Low-Depth Quantum Signal-Processing Phase Estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01583v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum effects like entanglement and coherent amplification can be used to drastically enhance the accuracy of quantum parameter estimation beyond classical limits. However, challenges such as decoherence and time-dependent errors hinder Heisenberg-limited amplification. We introduce Quantum Signal-Processing Phase Estimation algorithms that are robust against these challenges and achieve optimal performance as dictated by the Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound. These algorithms use quantum signal transformation to decouple interdependent phase parameters into largely orthogonal ones, ensuring that time-dependent errors in one do not compromise the accuracy of learning the other. Combining provably optimal classical estimation with near-optimal quantum circuit design, our approach achieves a standard deviation accuracy of $10^{-4}$ radians for estimating unwanted swap angles in superconducting two-qubit experiments, using low-depth ($&lt;10$) circuits. This represents up to two orders of magnitude improvement over existing methods. Theoretically and numerically, we demonstrate the optimality of our algorithm against time-dependent phase errors, observing that the variance of the time-sensitive parameter $\varphi$ scales faster than the asymptotic Heisenberg scaling in the small-depth regime. Our results are rigorously validated against the quantum Fisher information, confirming our protocol's ability to achieve unmatched precision for two-qubit gate learning.</description>

      <title>Pseudospectral method for solving PDEs using Matrix Product States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02916v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This research focuses on solving time-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs), in particular the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation, using matrix product states (MPS). We propose an extension of Hermite Distributed Approximating Functionals (HDAF) to MPS, a highly accurate pseudospectral method for approximating functions of derivatives. Integrating HDAF into an MPS finite precision algebra, we test four types of quantum-inspired algorithms for time evolution: explicit Runge-Kutta methods, Crank-Nicolson method, explicitly restarted Arnoli iteration and split-step. The benchmark problem is the expansion of a particle in a quantum quench, characterized by a rapid increase in space requirements, where HDAF surpasses traditional finite difference methods in accuracy with a comparable cost. Moreover, the efficient HDAF approximation to the free propagator avoids the need for Fourier transforms in split-step methods, significantly enhancing their performance with an improved balance in cost and accuracy. Both approaches exhibit similar error scaling and run times compared to FFT vector methods; however, MPS offer an exponential advantage in memory, overcoming vector limitations to enable larger discretizations and expansions. Finally, the MPS HDAF split-step method successfully reproduces the physical behavior of a particle expansion in a double-well potential, demonstrating viability for actual research scenarios.</description>

      <title>Non-convergence to global minimizers in data driven supervised deep learning: Adam and stochastic gradient descent optimization provably fail to converge to global minimizers in the training of deep neural networks with ReLU activation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10533v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep learning methods - consisting of a class of deep neural networks (DNNs) trained by a stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimization method - are nowadays key tools to solve data driven supervised learning problems. Despite the great success of SGD methods in the training of DNNs, it remains a fundamental open problem of research to explain the success and the limitations of such methods in rigorous theoretical terms. In particular, even in the standard setup of data driven supervised learning problems, it remained an open research problem to prove (or disprove) that SGD methods converge in the training of DNNs with the popular rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation function with high probability to global minimizers in the optimization landscape. In this work we answer this question negatively. Specifically, in this work we prove for a large class of SGD methods that the considered optimizer does with high probability not converge to global minimizers of the optimization problem. It turns out that the probability to not converge to a global minimizer converges at least exponentially quickly to one as the width of the first hidden layer of the ANN and the depth of the ANN, respectively, increase. The general non-convergence results of this work do not only apply to the plain vanilla standard SGD method but also to a large class of accelerated and adaptive SGD methods such as the momentum SGD, the Nesterov accelerated SGD, the Adagrad, the RMSProp, the Adam, the Adamax, the AMSGrad, and the Nadam optimizers.</description>

      <title>Spectra and pseudospectra in the evaluation of material stability in phase field schemes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20570v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the dynamics of bodies with "active" microstructure described by vector-valued phase fields. For waves with time-varying amplitude, the associated evolution equation involves a matrix that can be non-normal, depending on the constitutive choices adopted for the microstructural actions associated with the considered phase field. The occurrence of non-normality requires to look at the pseudospectrum of the considered matrix, namely the set of all possible eigenvalues of matrices in a $\varepsilon$-neighborhood of the matrix itself, because the eigenvalues of non-normal matrices can be very sensitive to small perturbations and therefore the spectral analysis alone would not be sufficient to distinguish with certainty between table and unstable behavior. We develop the relevant analyses in the case of quasicrystals for which the values of some constitutive parameters are not known or are uncertain from an experimental point of view, a circumstance suggesting parametric analyses. We find circumstances in which the pseudospectra obtained by means of the so-called structured perturbations predict instability when, instead, the spectral analysis indicates stability.</description>
