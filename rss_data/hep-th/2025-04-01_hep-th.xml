      <title>Solving 1D crossing and QFT$_2$/CFT$_1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide an effective solution of the 1D crossing equation. We begin by arguing that crossing constraints can be recast in terms of bases of sum rules associated to special sets of CFT data -- extremal solutions -- which solve these constraints in a minimal way and naturally saturate positivity bounds on the space of CFTs. We conjecture, argue and check extensively that any extremal solution behaves as a generalized free field in the UV. This allows us to reconstruct the entirety of their CFT data using a rapidly convergent ``hybrid bootstrap'' method, which combines numerics and analytics. Strikingly, as we approach special corners in the space of extremal solutions we find that their CFT data can present non-trivial structure up to arbitrarily large energies. We interpret these corners as flat space limits of QFTs in AdS$_2$, which extremal solutions naturally describe. This picture allows us to bootstrap their CFT data in these limits in terms of 2d S-matrices, and conversely provide a microscopic CFT construction of the latter. Further evidence for this QFT in AdS description of extremal solutions comes from an explicit construction of bulk QFT operators solving an AdS locality problem. Concretly we show that it is possible to canonically associate one or more such operators to any extremal solution by explicitly solving for their BOE data. In the special case where this operator is the bulk stress-tensor we combine crossing and bulk locality constraints to derive stronger bounds on the OPE and BOE data, including an exact bootstrap lower bound on the central charge $C_T\geq 1/2$.</description>

      <title>Greybody Factor in AdS Black Brane Spectroscopy: A Study with Scalar and Electromagnetic Perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the greybody factor for scalar and photon radiations in AdS Schwarzschild black brane. We consider the linearized field equations satisfied by the minimally coupled massive scalar field and the transverse components of the Maxwell fields on the black brane background and recast them to the Heun's equations by appropriate change of variables and field redefinitions. At the asymptotic region, we consider appropriate linear combinations of the normalizable and non-normalizable solutions of the field equations to construct in/outgoing modes. We consider the ingoing solutions near horizon to construct the IN state and compute the coefficients of the in- and outgoing modes of the asymptotic solutions in terms of the connection coefficients of the Heun functions. Finally by calculating ratio of the coefficient of outgoing modes to the ingoing modes we find an exact expression for the greybody factor. We find that the greybody factor for the transverse Maxwell fields and that for the scalars dual to the conformal scalar primaries with odd integer scaling dimensions vanish off.</description>

      <title>Torsion in M2-brane theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We determine the role of torsion in the local and global geometrical description of M2-branes with fluxes and parabolic monodromies. The monodromy corresponds to a representation of the fundamental group of the base manifold into the parabolic subgroup of $\mbox{SL}(2,\mathbb{Z})$, the group of isotopy classes of area-preserving diffeomorphisms. These are supersymmetric M2-branes with a quantum discrete spectrum with finite multiplicity. The global description of these QM2-branes is given by twisted torus bundles with monodromy. They are classified by $\mbox{H}^2(\Sigma,\mathbb{Z}_\rho)=\mathbb{Z}\oplus \mathbb{Z}_k$, or equivalently, by the coinvariants associated with the parabolic monodromy subgroup. We generalize previous constructions in two different ways. The first one considers parabolic monodromies with $k&gt;1$. This will allow us to identify torsion cycles of order greater than one. We find that there are well-defined nilmanifolds in three, four, and five dimensions contained in the global description of these M2-branes. These nilmanifolds are in correspondence with the nilpotent Lie algebras $g_{3,1}$, $g_{3,1}\oplus g_1$, and $g_{3,1}\oplus g_2$. All these nilmanifolds have torsion cycles of order $k$ contained in the compact sector of the target space of the M2-brane. The torsion is also manifest in the equivalence classes of M2-brane twisted torus bundles, namely coinvariants. The second one is that we analyze how the torsion acts on the coinvariants of the base manifold. Together with the flux condition, the torsion defines explicitly the number of coinvariants for a given flux and monodromy $k$.</description>

      <title>Effective Description of Ajar Systems with a $U(1)$ Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of "ajar systems" as an intermediate case between closed and open systems, where the time scale for charge exchange with the environment is parametrically larger than all other characteristic time scales. The Schwinger-Keldysh effective action for such finite-temperature systems exhibits a symmetry group $G_1 \times G_2$ weakly broken to its diagonal subgroup $G_{\text{diag}}$, which we systematically describe using spurion techniques. For $G = U(1)$, we calculate leading-order corrections to correlation functions in both diffusive and spontaneously broken phases. Unlike systems with approximate symmetries where both real and imaginary parts of dispersion relations receive corrections, ajar systems modify only the imaginary part -- preserving gapless modes while adding finite damping.</description>

      <title>Motions of Test Particles in Gravitational Field, Perturbations and Greybody Factor of Bardeen-like AdS Black Hole with Phantom Global Monopoles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of test particles, perturbations, and greybody factors within the framework of a Bardeen-like AdS black hole (BH) with a phantom global monopole. This study explores the interactions between nonlinear electrodynamics, the energy scale of symmetry breaking, and space-time topology. We analyze the geodesic motion of null and time-like particles, deriving effective potentials that describe their trajectories. Utilizing the Regge-Wheeler potential, we calculate the quasinormal modes (QNMs) for scalar, vector, and tensor perturbations, applying the sixth-order WKB approximation. Our findings highlight how the Bardeen-like parameter ($\mathrm{b}$) and the energy scale of symmetry breaking, characterized by the parameter ($\eta$), influence the QNM spectra, with potential implications for gravitational wave observations. We also examine greybody factors, focusing on the transmission and reflection coefficients for scalar and axial fields, and employ semi-analytic techniques to derive precise bounds. Furthermore, we assess the thermodynamic stability of the BH, emphasizing the role of these parameters in phase transitions and stability criteria.</description>

      <title>Effective electromagnetic Lagrangians in the derivative expansion method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the effective electromagnetic Lagrangian up to the lowest-order corrections in the derivatives for two fermionic systems of interest in condensed matter physics in the linearized approximation of the tight-binding Hamiltonian near the Fermi level in the Brillouin zone: (i) the $(3+1)$ description of the simplest Weyl semimetal and (ii) the massive $(2+1)$ electrodynamics, which can serve as a model for the interface between two $(3+1)$ topological insulators. We employ the derivative expansion method which directly provides local effective Lagrangians and allows selecting from the outset both the powers of the electromagnetic potential to be considered together with the number of relevant derivatives. We find new higher-order derivative corrections to Carroll-Field-Jackiw electrodynamics. In general, the new terms we find either have a similar structure or constitute a relativistic generalization of some recent phenomenological proposals found in the literature. In this way, they should be incorporated into these proposals for assessing the relative significance of all the terms included up to a given order.</description>

      <title>Giant Graviton Correlators as Defect Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider correlation functions of two maximal giant gravitons and two light $\frac{1}{2}$-BPS operators in 4d $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM. Viewed as two-point correlators in the presence of a zero dimensional defect, they can be completely fixed at strong coupling using analytic bootstrap techniques. We determine all infinitely such correlators for arbitrary light $\frac{1}{2}$-BPS operators and find that the result can be repackaged into a simple generating function thanks to a hidden higher dimensional symmetry. We also find evidence that the same symmetry holds at weak coupling for loop correction integrands.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a holographic tensor network for the double-scaled SYK model (DSSYK). The moment of the transfer matrix of DSSYK can be mapped to the matrix product state (MPS) of a spin chain. By adding the height direction as a holographic direction, we recast the MPS for DSSYK into the holographic tensor network whose building block is a 4-index tensor with the bond dimension three.</description>

      <title>Reduced Yang model and noncommutative geometry of curved spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Yang model describes a noncommutative geometry in a curved spacetime by means of an orthogonal algebra $o(1,5)$, whose 15 generators are identified with phase space variables and Lorentz generators together with an additional scalar generator. In this paper we show that it is possible to define a nonlinear algebra with the same structure, but with only 14 generators, that better fits in phase space. The fifteenth generator of the Yang algebra can then be written as a function of the squares of the others.
  As a simple application, we also consider the problem of the quantum harmonic oscillator in this theory, calculating the energy spectrum in the one- and three-dimensional nonrelativistic versions of the model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A long time ago C.N. Yang proposed a generalization of the Snyder model to the case of a curved background spacetime, based on an algebra isomorphic to $so(1,5)$, which includes as subalgebras both the Snyder and the de Sitter algebras. His proposal can therefore be interpreted as a model of noncommutative curved spacetime, and could be useful for relating physics at very small and very large scales. We review this model and some recent progress concerning its generalizations and its interpretation in the framework of Hopf algebras. We also report some possibilities to relate it to more phenomenological aspects.</description>

      <title>On $\text{AdS}_2\times \text{S}^7$, its $\mathbb{Z}_k$ orbifold and their dual quantum mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a previously constructed class of massive Type IIA AdS$_2\times$S$^7\times I$ solutions with OSp$(8|2)$ symmetry, as well as OSp$(6|2)$-symmetric ones, by replacing the S$^7$ with the orbifold S$^7/\mathbb{Z}_k$. In both cases we construct global solutions for which the interval $I$ is bounded between physical singularities, by allowing D8-branes transverse to $I$. We also generate a new class of Type IIB AdS$_2\times \mathbb{CP}^3\times\text{S}^1\times I$ solutions by T-duality and establish a chain of dualities that maps the massless limit of these classes to AdS$_4/\mathbb{Z}_{k'}\times\text{S}^7/\mathbb{Z}_k$, thus identifying the brane configurations yielding these solutions. We propose that the ${\cal N}=8$ solutions are dual to a theory living on a D0-F1-D8 brane intersection which has a description in terms of disconnected quivers and similarly for the ${\cal N}=6$ solutions.</description>

      <title>An Attempt for a Double Copy Formulation of Heterotic DFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been shown that double field theory (DFT) action can be constructed in a perturbative manner up to cubic order by using double copy of Yang-Mills. This construction can also be extended by starting with higher-derivative Yang-Mills theory to obtain higher-derivative DFT action. In this work, I try to use this classical double copy formulation for Abelian subsector of heterotic DFT, starting with a Yang-Mills theory including a charged scalar field, namely (Y M + \phi^3) theory. Although the methods I used cannot give an exact match, they give some promising results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There are two approaches towards supersymmetry: The ``conventional approach'', in which the fields appear in the classical action and the ``stochastic approach'', in which they emerge upon introducing in the action the contribution of a certain determinant. The second approach relies, in particular, on the so-called Nicolai map. The relation between the two approaches hasn't been clarified and the subject of this contribution is to spell it out. In particular the interpretation proposed by Parisi and Sourlas has remained quite incomplete. The subject of this contribution is to spell out in what way the two approaches complement each other and how the second can provide insights for the first.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent discovery of hidden zeros in particle and string amplitudes, we characterize zeros of individual graph contributions to the cosmological wavefunction of a scalar field theory. We demonstrate that these contributions split near these zeros for all tree graphs and provide evidence that this extends to loop graphs as well. We explicitly construct polytopal realizations of the relevant graph associahedra and show that the cosmological zeros have natural geometric and physical interpretations. As a byproduct, we establish an equivalence between the wavefunction coefficients of chain graphs and flat-space Tr$(\phi^3)$ amplitudes, enabling us to leverage the cosmological zeros to uncover the recently discovered hidden zeros of colored amplitudes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a complete classification of AdS$_2$ solutions of Type II supergravity realising $\mathcal{N}=6$ supersymmetry and OSp$(6|2)$ superconformal symmetry on backgrounds that are foliations of AdS$_2 \times \mathbb{CP}^3$ over a Riemann surface $\Sigma_2$. Such solutions only exist in type IIB supergravity and are in 1 to 1 correspondence with a fourth order PDE that can be locally solved in terms of two holomorphic functions. Particular solutions in the class are the T-duals of the $\text{AdS}_3\times \mathbb{CP}^3$ and $\text{AdS}_2\times \text{S}^7$ solutions to massive Type IIA supergravity found in the literature. We discuss the field theory interpretation of the two sub-classes of solutions related to $\text{AdS}_3\times \mathbb{CP}^3$ by Abelian and non-Abelian T-duality, which provide explicit examples for the Riemann surface an annulus or a strip. In the second case we interpret the solutions as holographic duals to baryon vertex configurations realised in D2-brane box models.</description>

      <title>Derivative expansion in a two-scalar field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The derivative expansion of the effective action is considered in the model with two interacting real scalar fields in curved spacetime. Using the functional approach and local momentum representation, the coefficient of the derivative term is calculated up to the first order in curvature in the one-scalar theory. The two-scalar problem is solved by extracting normal modes and consequent reduction to the single-scalar case. The method can be applied to a larger number of scalars. In the theory with strong hierarchy of masses, the renormalized effective potential and the coefficients of the second-order derivative terms demonstrate the quantum decoupling in the low-energy limit.</description>

      <title>On an approach to canonicalizing elliptic Feynman integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic method for the construction of canonical bases for univariate elliptic Feynman integrals with multiple kinematic scales, which frequently arise in phenomenologically relevant scattering processes. The construction is performed in the Legendre normal form of elliptic curves, where the geometric propoerties of the curves are simple and explicit and further kinemtic singularities are present as marked points. The canonical bases are constructed using Abelian differentials of three kinds with a universal linear transformation. The bases constructed in the normal form can be mapped to generic integral families via an appropriate M\"obius transformation. As a demonstration, we discuss the application of our method to several concrete examples, where we show that the $\varepsilon$-factorization of sub-sector dependence can also be simply done. Our method can be readily applied to more complicated integral families straightforwardly.</description>

      <title>Classification of Modular Symmetries in Non-Supersymmetric Heterotic String theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study modular symmetries in non-supersymmetric heterotic string theories on toroidal backgrounds with Wilson line modulus, constructed by stringy Scherk-Schwartz compactification. In particular, we focus on a subgroup of the T-duality group $O(D+16,D,\mathbb{Z})$ with $D=2$ given by an outer automorphism of the Narain lattice, which can be mapped to the Siegel modular group $\mathrm{Sp}(4,\mathbb{Z})$. We classify the modular symmetries and a $CP$-like symmetry on $T^2$ and its orbifolds with symmetric and asymmetric orbifold twists. It turns out that the non-supersymmetric heterotic string theories only enjoy a part of modular symmetries in contrast to supersymmetric ones. Furthermore, the gauge symmetry is maximally enhanced at fixed points of modular symmetries on $T^2$ on which we analyze the vacuum structure of eight-dimensional tachyon-free vacua.</description>

      <title>Two approaches to the holomorphic modular bootstrap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The holomorphic bootstrap attempts to classify rational conformal field theories. The straight ahead approach is hard to implement when the number of characters become large. We combine all characters of an RCFT to form a vector valued modular form with multiplier. Using known results from the theory of vector valued modular forms, given a known RCFT, we obtain new vector valued modular forms that share the same multiplier as the original RCFT. By taking particular linear combinations of the new solutions, we look for and find new admissible solutions. In the well-studied two character case, we reproduce all known admissible solutions with Wronskian indices $6$ and $8$. The method is illustrated with examples with up to six characters. The method using vector valued modular forms thus provides a new approach to the holomorphic modular bootstrap.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the Wilson Dirac operator in lattice gauge theory can be identified as a mathematical object in $K$-theory and that its associated spectral flow is equal to the index. In comparison to the standard lattice Dirac operator index, our formulation does not require the Ginsparg-Wilson relation and has broader applicability to systems with boundaries and to the mod-two version of the indices in general dimensions. We numerically verify that the $K$ and $KO$ group formulas reproduce the known index theorems in continuum theory. We examine the Atiyah-Singer index on a flat two-dimensional torus and, for the first time, demonstrate that the Atiyah-Patodi-Singer index with nontrivial curved boundaries, as well as the mod-two versions, can be computed on a lattice.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic multipole expansions and the logarithmic soft photon theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the general structure of the electromagnetic field in the vicinity of spatial infinity. Starting from the general solution of the sourced Maxwell equations written in terms of multipole moments as obtained by Iyer and Damour, we derive the expansion of the electromagnetic field perturbatively in the electromagnetic coupling. At leading order, where the effect of long-range Coulombic interactions between charged particles is neglected, we discover infinite sets of antipodal matching relations satisfied by the electromagnetic field, which extend and sometimes correct previously known relations. At next-to-leading order, electromagnetic tails resulting from these Coulombic interactions appear, which affect the antipodal matching relations beyond those equivalent to the leading soft photon theorem. Moreover, new antipodal matching relations arise, which we use to re-derive the classical logarithmic soft photon theorem of Sahoo and Sen. Our analysis largely builds upon that of Campiglia and Laddha, although it invalidates the antipodal matching relation which they originally used in their derivation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the $q=2$ SYK model with paraparticles (PSYK$_2$), analyzing its thermodynamics and spectral form factor (SFF) using random matrix theory. The Hamiltonian is quadratic, with coupling coefficients randomly drawn from the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble (GUE). The model exhibits self-averaging behavior and shows a striking transition in SFF dynamics: while the fermionic SYK$_2$ displays a ramp behavior $\mathcal{K}(t) \sim e^{C_0 t}$ with $C_0 \sim \ln N$, the paraparticle cases exhibit $C_0 \sim \mathcal{O}(1)$. These findings offer new insights into quantum systems with exotic statistics.</description>

      <title>Quantization of Lie-Poisson algebra and Lie algebra solutions of mass-deformed type IIB matrix model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A quantization of Lie-Poisson algebras is studied. The mass-deformed IIB matrix model admits classical solutions constructed from the basis of any semisimple Lie algebra. We consider the geometry described by the classical solutions of the Lie algebras in the limit where the mass vanishes and the matrix size is infinite. Lie-Poisson varieties are regarded as such geometric objects. We provide a quantization called ``weak matrix regularization''of any Lie-Poisson algebra (linear Poisson algebra) on the algebraic variety defined by its Casimir polynomials. The Lie algebra that gives weak matrix regularization is not necessarily semisimple. Casimir polynomials correspond with Casimir operators of the Lie algebra by the quantization. This quantization is a generalization of the fuzzy sphere. In order to define the weak matrix regularization of the quotient space by the ideal generated by the Casimir polynomials, we take a construction method that fixes a reduced Gr\"obner basis of the ideal. The Gr\"obner basis determines remainders of polynomials. The operation of replacing this remainders with representation matrices of a Lie algebra roughly corresponds to a weak matrix regularization. As concrete examples, we construct weak matrix regularization for $su(2)$ and $su(3)$. In the case of $su(3)$, we not only construct weak matrix regularization for the quadratic Casimir polynomial, but also construct weak matrix regularization for the cubic Casimir polynomial.</description>

      <title>Worldvolume fermion as baryon with homogeneous instantons in holographic $\mathrm{QCD}_{3}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate holographically the effective theory of the worldvolume fermion on the flavor branes in the D3/D7 model with homogeneously smeared D(-1)-branes. As a top-down approach in gauge-gravity duality, the D(-1)-branes are instantons and violate the CP symmetry in the dual theory. The background geometry of this model contains black brane (deconfined geometry) and bubble D3-brane solutions (confined geometry), all with a non-zero Romand-Romand zero form as axion. The dual theories to the backgrounds are respectively the Super Yang-Mills theory at finite temperature and three-dimensional confining Yang-Mills theory, all with a Chern-Simons term induced by instantons. In the confined geometry, we introduce a baryon vertex as a D5-brane wrapped on $S^{5}$, then identify the fermionic flux on the D7-brane as a baryonic operator. Afterwards, we study the spectrum and the holographic correlation function of the flavored fermion on the D7-branes. Remarkably, the fermionic spectrum is in agreement with the dispersion curves obtained from the confined correlation function, and the mass ratio of the lowest baryon and meson in our model is close to the associated experimental data. Moreover, the effective interaction terms of the holographic baryon and meson are derived and all the coupling constants take order of $N_{c}^{1/2}$ agreeing with the evaluation from the large N field theory. In the deconfined geometry, the holographic correlation function is also evaluated numerically while the fermion on D7-brane is identified to plasmino instead of baryon. The dispersion curves from the deconfined correlation function basically covers the results from the hard thermal loop approximation and may imply the instanton-induced interaction with spin. Overall, this work constructs a holographic theory about baryonic fermion and mesonic boson with instantons or CP violation.</description>

      <title>Berry Phase in Non-Perturbative QED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study QED$_4$ in the adiabatic approximation, incorporating global topological effects associated with the $U(1)$ Berry connection. The Berry phase accumulated by the fermionic vacuum is given by $\Delta \alpha = \oint_{\mathcal{C}} \gamma_5\, \mathcal{A}^{(n)}$, where $\mathcal{A}^{(n)}$ is a closed but non-exact one-form defined over the space of gauge configurations. This chiral holonomy induces an emergent vacuum angle that contributes non-perturbatively to the effective action. The partition function decomposes into topological sectors weighted by this geometric phase, analogous to quantum systems on multiply connected spaces. Our results reveal that even in Abelian gauge theory, the infrared regime can exhibit global effects beyond the reach of local or perturbative descriptions.</description>

      <title>Jordanian deformation of the non-compact and $\mathfrak{sl}_2 $-invariant $XXX_{-1/2}$ spin-chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using a Drinfeld twist of Jordanian type, we construct a deformation of the non-compact and $\mathfrak{sl}_2$-invariant $XXX_{-1/2}$ spin-chain. Before the deformation, the seed model can be understood as a sector of the $\mathfrak{psu}(2,2|4)$-invariant spin-chain encoding the spectral problem of $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills at one loop in the planar limit. The deformation gives rise to interesting features because, while being integrable, the Hamiltonian is non-hermitian and non-diagonalisable, so that it only admits a Jordan decomposition. Moreover, the eigenvalues of the deformed Hamiltonian coincide with those of the original undeformed spin-chain. We use explicit examples as well as the techniques of the coordinate and of the algebraic Bethe ansatz to discuss the construction of the (generalised) eigenvectors of the deformed model. We also show that the deformed spin-chain is equivalent to an undeformed one with twisted boundary conditions, and that it may be derived from a scaling limit of the non-compact $U_q(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$-invariant $XXZ_{-1/2} $ spin-chain.</description>

      <title>Cylindrical boundary induced current in the cosmic string spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the vacuum current associated with a charged bosonic field operator, induced by a cylindrical boundary in the idealized cosmic string spacetime. In this setup we assume that the cylindrical boundary is coaxial with the string, that by its turn carry a magnetic flux along its core. In order to develop this analysis, we calculate the positive frequency Wightman functions for both regions, inside and outside the boundary. Moreover, we assume that the bosonic field obeys the Robin boundary condition on the cylindrical shell. Using this approach, the analytical expressions for the vacuum bosonic currents are presented in the form of the sum of boundary-free and boundary-induced parts. Because the boundary-free contribution is very well established in literature, our focus here is in the boundary-dependent part. As we will see, our general results are presented in a cylindrically symmetric static structure. Some asymptotic behaviors for the boundary-induced vacuum currents are investigated in various limiting cases. In order to provide a better understanding of these currents, we provide some graphs exhibiting their behavior as function of the distance to the string's core, and on the intensity of the magnetic flux running along it. These plots also present how the parameter associated with the planar angle deficit interfere in the intensity of the corresponding current.</description>

      <title>Universality of R\'enyi Entropy in Conformal Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the thermal effective theory to prove that, for the vacuum state in any conformal field theory in $d$ dimensions, the $n$-th R\'enyi entropy $S_A^{(n)}$ behaves as $S_A^{(n)} = \frac{f}{(2\pi n)^{d-1}} \frac{ {\rm Area}(\partial A)}{(d-2)\epsilon^{d-2}}\left(1+O(n)\right)$ in the $n \rightarrow 0$ limit when the boundary of the entanglement domain $A$ is spherical with the UV cutoff $\epsilon$.The theory dependence is encapsulated in the cosmological constant $f$ in the thermal effective action. Using this result, we estimate the density of states for large eigenvalues of the modular Hamiltonian for the domain $A$. In two dimensions, we can use the hot spot idea to derive more powerful formulas valid for arbitrary positive $n$. We discuss the difference between two and higher dimensions and clarify the applicability of the hot spot idea. We also use the thermal effective theory to derive an analog of the Cardy formula for boundary operators in higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Effects of superradiance on relativistic Foldy-Wouthuysen densities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent interest in the studies of structured states obtained in relativistic electron beams has highlighted the use of two alternative descriptions, each based on a different wavefunction and the related space-time density. Although both wavefunctions obey the Dirac equation (one directly and the other through a Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation) they lead to different dynamics and properties, such as the presence or absence of spin-orbit interactions. In this work we investigate wavepacket dynamics for the Klein-Gordon equation, which displays the same ambiguity regarding the choice of different densities, in a setting involving Klein tunneling across a series of supercritical potential barriers. Relying on the superradiant character of this setting, we obtain solutions to the wavepacket dynamics indicating that the density based on a Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation of the wavefunction can be locally amplified outside the light-cone. In principle, the exponential increase of the charge due to the field inhomogeneities can lead to an arbitrarily large amplification over macroscopic distances. These results might lead to question the descriptions based on Foldy-Wouthuysen densities.</description>

Abstract: We explore 1+1 dimensional (1+1D) gapped phases in systems with non-invertible symmetries, focusing on symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases (defined as gapped phases with non-degenerate ground states), as well as SPT orders (defined as the differences between gapped/gapless phases with identical bulk excitations spectrum). For group-like symmetries, distinct SPT phases share identical bulk excitations and always differ by SPT orders. However, for certain non-invertible symmetries, we discover novel SPT phases that have different bulk excitations and thus do not differ by SPT orders. Additionally, we also study the spontaneous symmetry-breaking (SSB) phases of non-invertible symmetries. Unlike group-like symmetries, non-invertible symmetries lack the concept of subgroups, which complicates the definition of SSB phases as well as their identification. This challenge can be addressed by employing the symmetry-topological-order (symTO) framework for the symmetry. The Lagrangian condensable algebras and automorphisms of the symTO facilitate the classification of gapped phases in systems with such symmetries, enabling the analysis of both SPT and SSB phases (including those that differ by SPT orders). Finally, we apply this methodology to investigate gapless phases in symmetric systems and to study gapless phases differing by SPT orders.</description>

      <title>Effects of perturbation for transition operator of double-${\beta}$ decay on nuclear matrix element, effective axial-vector current coupling, and half-life</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We calculate the nuclear matrix element (NME), effective axial-vector current coupling $g_A^\mathrm{eff}$, and half-life of the double-$\beta$ ($\beta\beta$) decay using the transition operator perturbed by the nuclear interaction. The correction terms for the NME are obtained by extending the hadron sector to a higher order in terms of the Rayleigh-Schr\"{o}dinger perturbation theory. The NME calculations are performed for the neutrinoless $\beta\beta$ ($0\nu\beta\beta$) and the two-neutrino $\beta\beta$ ($2\nu\beta\beta$) decays of $^{136}$Xe. The nuclear wave functions are calculated by the quasiparticle random-phase approximation (QRPA) with the Skyrme, the Coulomb, and the contact pairing interactions. Sufficiently large single-particle valence spaces are used. The correction terms for the NME are comparable with the leading term in absolute value, and the sum of the corrections has the opposite sign to that of the leading term. The $g_A^\mathrm{eff}$'s for the $\beta\beta$ NME are calculated by a few methods depending on the truncation of the NME and the half-life referred to. Similarities are found between some of these $g_A^\mathrm{eff}$'s including those of the $0\nu\beta\beta$ NME. This leads to the conclusion that the value of $g_A^\mathrm{eff}$ can indeed be determined by the perturbed transition operator. It is in a comparable range of the $g_A$ for the $2\nu\beta\beta$ NME. The perturbation effect on the $2\nu\beta\beta$ half-life is discussed by comparing the calculated half-lives with the different $g_A$'s and the NME components.</description>

      <title>Higgs Criticality and the Metastability Bound: a target for future colliders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: New physics at the TeV scale or lower may destabilise the electroweak vacuum. How low could the vacuum instability scale be? This fundamental question may be tied to a deeper understanding of the Higgs potential and its associated hierarchy problem. The scale of vacuum instability can be viewed as an upper bound on the Higgs mass-the so-called vacuum metastability bound-and criticality of the Higgs potential through some underlying mechanism then places our universe at this metastable point. In this report, we summarise recent work developing this eminently testable hypothesis. If the vacuum metastability bound plays a role in determining the properties of the Higgs boson, the new physics responsible will likely be discovered or excluded in the entire natural region of parameter space at future facilities. This makes it a tantalising and attractive target for future colliders.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ordered phases of matter, such as solids, ferromagnets, superfluids, or quantum topological order, typically only exist at low temperatures. Despite this conventional wisdom, we present explicit local models in which all such phases persist to arbitrarily high temperature. This is possible since order in one degree of freedom can enable other degrees of freedom to strongly fluctuate, leading to "entropic order", whereby typical high energy states are ordered. Our construction, which utilizes interacting bosons, avoids existing no-go theorems on long-range order or entanglement at high temperature. We propose a simple model for high-temperature superconductivity using these general principles.</description>

      <title>A chaotic lattice field theory in two dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe spatiotemporally chaotic (or turbulent) field theories discretized over d-dimensional lattices in terms of sums over their multi-periodic orbits. `Chaos theory' is here recast in the language of statistical mechanics, field theory, and solid state physics, with the traditional periodic orbits theory of low-dimensional, temporally chaotic dynamics a special, one-dimensional case.
  In the field-theoretical formulation, there is no time evolution. Instead, treating the temporal and spatial directions on equal footing, one determines the spatiotemporally periodic orbits that contribute to the partition sum of the theory, each a solution of the system's defining deterministic equations, with sums over time-periodic orbits of dynamical systems theory replaced here by sums of d-periodic orbits over d-dimensional spacetime geometries, the weight of each orbit given by the Jacobian of its spatiotemporal orbit Jacobian operator. The weights, evaluated by application of the Bloch theorem to the spectrum of periodic orbit's Jacobian operator, are multiplicative for spacetime orbit repeats, leading to a spatiotemporal zeta function formulation of the theory in terms of prime orbits.</description>

      <title>Quantum signatures and decoherence during inflation from deep subhorizon perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In order to shed light on the quantum-to-classical transition of the primordial perturbations in single field inflation, we investigate the decoherence and associated quantum corrections to the correlation functions of superhorizon scalar curvature perturbations. The latter are considered as an open quantum system which undergoes quantum decoherence induced by a time-dependent environment of deep subhorizon tensorial modes through the trilinear interactions predicted by General Relativity. We first prove that, in full generality, a time dependent subhorizon environment can be relevant for decoherence during inflation, by considering derivativeless interactions, which, in our case, give the most important results. For the first time, the time dependence of the environment is properly taken into account by modifying the quantum master equation. Important non-Markovian effects pop up, instead, when dealing with derivative interactions. We adopt a possible way to treat them which has been recently proposed and seems well suited for our case. Our results show that when considering the interplay between derivativeless and derivative interactions, decoherence is slowed down. This underlines the importance of accounting for all the interactions in open quantum-system calculations in an inflationary setting. We finally compute the quantum corrections to cosmological correlation functions, by solving the transport equations induced by the quantum master equation. We also compare the results to the solutions obtained by an alternative method previously used in the literature. We observe a resummation of the quantum corrections to the power-spectrum, which is a general property of quantum master equations. We extend these results to the bispectrum, showing a decay of this correlation function in time which is analogous to the one found, previously, for the power-spectrum.</description>

      <title>Slow-roll Natural &amp; Hilltop Inflation in Rastall Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study provides a concise analysis of inflation under Rastall gravity by examining three types of potential such as the power law, natural, and hilltop potentials. Choosing a minimal interaction between matter and gravity, we derived the modified slow-roll parameters, the scalar spectral index $(n_s)$, the tensor spectral index $(n_T)$, and the tensor-to-scalar ratio $(r)$. For a general power-law potential as well as for Natural &amp; Hilltop inflation, we calculated these quantities and subsequently plotted their trajectories in the $(n_s, r)$ plane. For the power-law potential, only the cases $n = 2/3$ and $n = 1$ satisfy the observational constraint of the Planck 2018 data. The natural potential analysis shows that the mass scale is crucial, with better compatibility achieved at $f = 5M_{p}$ compared to $f = 10M_{p}$. Lastly, the Hilltop potential results indicate that among the cases studied $m = 3/2, 2, 3$, and $4$, only $m = 3/2$ exhibits marginal consistency with observational bounds, while the other cases fail to produce acceptable $(n_s - r)$ trajectories.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Landscapes: black holes with linear equations of state in asymptotically safe gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study black holes with linear equation of state within the framework of asymptotically safe gravity. This study extends previous work on gravitational collapse in asymptotically safe gravity (that has been done for a dust fluid) by considering into account the pressure of stellar matter. We derive modified field equations containing the running gravitational coupling and the cosmological constant as functions of energy density. The interior space-time of collapsing star is modeled by the Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker metric, while the exterior is described by a static spherically symmetric space-time. Different equations of state from ordinary matter to exotic phantom energy are considered to investigate their impact on black hole structure and horizon formation. Our results illustrate that asymptotically safe gravity can introduce non-singular black hole solutions under specific conditions. These results provide new insights into black hole physics and the avoidance of singularities within the asymptotically safe gravity framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a systematic method for analytically computing time-dependent observables for a relativistic probe particle in Coulomb and Schwarzschild backgrounds. The method generates expressions valid both in the bound and unbound regimes, namely bound-unbound universal expressions. To demonstrate our method we compute the time-dependent radius and azimuthal angle for relativistic motion in a Coulomb background (relativistic Keplerian motion), as well as the electromagnetic field radiated by a relativistic Keplerian source. All of our calculations exhibit bound-unbound universality. Finally, we present an exact expression for the semi-classical wave function in Schwarzschild. The latter is crucial in applying our method to any time-dependent observable for probe-limit motion in Schwarzschild, to any desired order in velocity and the gravitational constant $G$.</description>

      <title>Many body quantum chaos and time reversal symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate universal signatures of quantum chaos in the presence of time reversal symmetry (TRS) in generic many body quantum chaotic systems (gMBQCs). We study three classes of minimal models of gMBQCs with TRS, realized through random quantum circuits with (i) local TRS, (ii) global TRS, and (iii) TRS combined with discrete time-translation symmetry. In large local Hilbert space dimension $q$, we derive the emergence of random matrix theory (RMT) universality in the spectral form factor (SFF) at times larger than the Thouless time $t_{\mathrm{Th}}$, which diverges with system sizes in gMBQCs. At times before $t_{\mathrm{Th}}$, we identify universal behaviour beyond RMT by deriving explicit scaling functions of SFF in the thermodynamic limit. In the simplest non-trivial setting - preserving global TRS while breaking time translation symmetry and local TRS - we show that the SFF is mapped to the partition function of an emergent classical ferromagnetic Ising model, where the Ising spins correspond to the time-parallel and time-reversed pairings of Feynman paths, and external magnetic fields are induced by TRS-breaking mechanisms. Without relying on the large-$q$ limit, we develop a second independent derivation of the Ising scaling behaviour of SFF using space-time duality and parity symmetric non-Hermitian Ginibre ensembles. Moreover, we show that many body effects originating from time-reversed pairings of Feynman paths manifest in the two-point autocorrelation function (2PAF), the out-of-time-order correlator (OTOC), and the partial spectral form factor - quantities sensitive to both eigenvalue and eigenstate correlations. We establish that the fluctuations of 2PAF are governed by an emergent three-state Potts model, leading to an exponential scaling with the operator support size, at a rate set by the three-state Potts model.

Abstract: In this work, we explore the intriguing phenomenon of acceleration radiation exhibited by an atom falling into a black hole. Our investigation focuses on examining the impact of Lorentz violation within the framework of the bumblebee gravity model on this phenomenon. We observe that the excitation probability although acquires Planck-like factor the exponential part of it acquires the Lorentz violation factor that shows a clear indication of violation of equivalence principle and it is rooted to Lorentz violation conformal symmetry has nothing to do with it. Then we calculate the horizon brightened acceleration radiation (HBAR) entropy for this black hole geometry. We observed that the HBAR entropy has the form similar to that of Bekenstein-Hawking black hole entropy however it has been observed that it is also influenced by Lorentz violation aspect of Bumblebee theory. We also study the prospect of equivalence principle in this Lorentz violation background. by investigating the transition probabilities of a two-level atomic detector. Transition probabilities depend both on conformal symmetry and Lorentz violation effect.</description>

Abstract: In this document drafted by the Neutrino Scattering Theory Experiment Collaboration (NuSTEC), we provide input on the synergies between theoretical and experimental efforts that can provide critical input to the prediction accuracy needed for the forthcoming high-precision neutrino measurements. These efforts involve a wide range of energies and interaction processes, as well as target nuclei and interaction probes. The challenges discussed will be overcome only through the active support of integrated collaboration across strong and electroweak physics from both the nuclear and high energy physics communities.</description>

Abstract: The European Strategy for Particle Physics (ESPP) - 2026 update is taking place in a turbulent international climate. Many of the norms that have governed relations between states for decades are being broken or challenged. The future progress of science in general, and particle physics in particular, will depend on our ability to maintain peaceful international scientific collaboration in the face of political pressures. We plead that the ESPP 2026 update acknowledge explicitly the importance of peaceful international scientific collaboration, not only for the progress of science, but also as a precious bridge between geopolitical blocs.

      <title>Physics case for low-$\sqrt{s}$ QCD studies at FCC-ee</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Measurements of hadronic final states in $e^{+}e^{-}$ collisions at centre-of-mass (CM) energies below the Z peak can notably extend the FCC-ee physics reach in terms of precision quantum chromodynamics (QCD) studies. Hadronic final states can be studied over a range of hadronic energies $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{had}} \approx 20\mbox{--}80\,\mathrm{GeV}$ by exploiting events with hard initial- and final-state QED radiation (ISR/FSR) during the high-luminosity Z-pole run, as well as in dedicated short (about one month long) $e^{+}e^{-}$ runs at CM energies $\sqrt{s} \approx 40\,\mathrm{GeV}$ and $60\,\mathrm{GeV}$. Using realistic estimates and fast detector simulations, we show that data samples of about $10^{9}$ hadronic events can be collected at the FCC-ee at each of the low-CM-energy points. Such datasets can be exploited in a variety of precision QCD measurements, including studies of light-, heavy-quark and gluon jet properties, hadronic event shapes, fragmentation functions, and nonperturbative dynamics. This will offer valuable insights into strong interaction physics, complementing data from nominal FCC-ee runs at higher center-of-mass energies, $\sqrt{s} \approx 91, 160, 240,$ and $365\,\mathrm{GeV}$.</description>

      <title>Hint of $r\simeq 0.01$ after DESI DR2 ?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23918v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the report by BICEP and Keck collaborations, the tensor-to-scalar ratio is $r_{0.05}&lt;0.036$ (95\% C.L.) and $ &lt;1.3\sigma$ non-zero (with pre-DESI BAO data). However, recent datasets have significantly shifted the bestfit values of relevant $\Lambda$CDM cosmological parameters, and thus possibly alter the amplitude of lensing B-mode spectrum, which would affect the search for $r$. Here, the joint analysis of Planck and BICEP/Keck data with DESI DR2 reveals that the lower bound of $r_{0.05}$ is $2.0\sigma$ and $2.1\sigma$ non-zero for PantheonPlus and DES-Y5, respectively, and the bestfit $r$ is $r_{0.05}\simeq 0.01$. The results are consistent with those with DESI DR1, but slightly strengthened. There might be still systematic uncertainties in B-mode measurements due to the foreground contamination, however, our work is to not say what about the value of $r$, but emphasize that the detection for $r$ is model-dependent and depends potentially on our insight into the dark universe, highlighting the important role of cosmological surveys in comprehending our very early universe.</description>

      <title>Production of $K^+K^-$ Pairs Through Decay of $\phi$ Meson</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a theoretical framework for the production of $K^+K^-$ pairs through the decay of $\phi$ mesons produced from a thermal background, based on the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model. The differential production rate of $K^+K^-$ is related to the self-energy of the $\phi$ meson, incorporating the contributions of the quark loop at leading order and the kaon loop at next-to-leading order in the $1/N_c$ expansion. We numerically evaluate the invariant mass spectrum of the $K^+K^-$ pair both in vacuum and at finite temperature. The inclusion of the kaon loop results in a finite width of the spectrum, improving agreement with experimental data. We also investigate the spin alignment of the $\phi$ meson induced by its motion relative to the thermal background. In the NJL model with only chiral condensates, we find that deviations from the unpolarized limit of 1/3 are negligible.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Spinning Test Body in quadratic Einstein-Cartan Theory and its Free-fall Test</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of the non-relativistic spinning test body (STB) in the framework of Einstein-Cartan theory(ECT), in which the weak equivalence principle is violated by the spin-gravitational interaction. We derive the general equation of geodesic in terms of comoving tetrads. More concretely, we consider the case of the quadratic form of the lagrangian, within the environment of weak and static spherically symmetric space-time. We find that the trajectories of STB deviate from the traditional Mathisson\textendash Papapetrou equation, which is due to the coupling of the spin of the test particle to the torsion field of the environment. This allows us to test the theory with free-fall experiment in the laboratory, such as atom interferometer. By using the previous data, we find the upper bound of the possible torsion field on Earth is given by up to $2.0\times 10^{1} \mathrm{~m^{-1}}$ and torsion gradient up to $3.1 \times 10^{-6}\mathrm{~m^{-2}}$. This result may enable us to provide a theoretical foundation for future precision measurements of the existence of the fifth force.</description>

      <title>Characteristic initial value problems for the Einstein-Maxwell-scalar field equations in spherical symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The characteristic initial boundary problem is discussed in spherical symmetry for the Einstein-Maxwell-scalar field equations. It is formulated for an affine-null metric and the resulting field equations are cast into a hierarchical system of partial differential equations. The initial boundary value problem for a family of null hypersurfaces is specified for a timelike-null foliation at the central geodesic of spherical symmetry as well as for a double-null foliation where the corresponding boundary is a null hypersurface. For the latter, two distinct boundary value formulations arise -- one where the null boundary has zero Misner-Sharp mass and another one where the corresponding Misner-Sharp mass is nonzero. As an application, the nonextremal and the extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om solution in null coordinates for a charged black hole and the Fisher-Janis-Newman-Winicour solution are derived.</description>

      <title>A possibility for grand unification and non-Higgs mass generation in a Nambu-Jona-Lasinio-like theory of fermions interacting with current metric field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Grand unification possibilities in Nambu-Jona-Lasinio-like models are studied. To address the problem of vector boson masses and nonrenormalizability of the theory, algebraic formalism encompassing the effective action, Schwinger-Keldysh path integral, and Bogoliubov-Parasiuk-Hepp-Zimmerman renormalization is constructed. A new NJL-like model: the theory of current metric field interacting with fermions is proposed. Bosonization in this model can produce massless vector bosons under certain conditions which makes it a candidate grand unified theory. Both Higgs and non-Higgs effects can contribute to particle masses.</description>

      <title>Modified cosmology though spacetime thermodynamics and generalized mass-to-horizon entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we apply the gravity-thermodynamics approach for the case of generalized mass-to-horizon entropy, which is a two-parameter extension of Bekenstein-Hawking entropy that arises from the extended mass-to-horizon relation, that is in turn required in order to have consistency with the Clausius relation. We extract the modified Friedmann equations and we obtain an effective dark energy sector arising from the novel terms. We derive analytical solutions for the dark energy density parameter, the dark energy equation-of-state parameter, and the deceleration parameter, and we show that the Universe exhibits the usual thermal history with the succession of matter and dark energy epochs. Additionally, depending on the value of the entropy parameters, the dark energy equation-of-state parameter can either lie in the phantom regime at high redshifts entering into the quintessence regime at small redshifts, or it can lie in the quintessence regime at high redshifts and experience the phantom-divide crossing at small redshifts, while in the far future in all cases it asymptotically obtains the cosmological constant value $-1$. Finally, we perform observational confrontation with Supernova Type Ia (SNIa), Cosmic Chronometers (CC) and Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) datasets, showing that the scenario is in agreement with observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2110.04990v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the mass shell condition of the bosonic higher spin gauge models which are BRST deformations of the Fronsdal action in the BRST-antifield formalism. Assuming convergence of the infinite series of the deformation parameter, we will find that these models are free on-shell. We further investigate whether this nature persists for models with fermions and models on AdS spaces. We find that these models also turn out to be free on-shell after all. Furthermore, we point out that the cubic vertices of these models are BRST-exact.</description>

      <title>Reduced Half-sided Translations and Islands</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.11085v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An AdS$_2$ black hole in equilibrium with a finite temperature non-gravitating bath comes with a Hawking-like information paradox. The resolution of this paradox requires introducing an island for the bath after the Page time. Since the island region contains the black hole interior, the consistency of the island paradigm demands the failure of any interior reconstruction proposal that uses only the operators in the AdS$_2$ region outside the black hole horizon after the Page time. In this paper, we investigate the consistency of the island paradigm using the black hole interior reconstruction proposal due to Leutheusser and Liu. They argued that the operators in the interior of a black hole can be reconstructed by the half-sided translations of the operators outside the black hole horizon. However, in order to illustrate the island paradigm we need to modify the Leutheusser-Liu proposal by introducing the notion of the reduced half-sided translations. The reduced half-sided translations, unlike the half-sided translations, have non-trivial action only on the operators in the AdS$_2$ black hole region. As a result, the reconstructed interior operators are expressed only using the operators in the AdS$_2$ region outside the black hole horizon. We demonstrate the consistency of the island paradigm by showing that the reduced half-sided translation, which successfully reconstruct the operators in the black hole interior before the Page time, fails to reconstruct the interior operators after the Page time.</description>

      <title>Reduced Half-sided Translations and Information Recovery from Radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00773v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The island paradigm asserts that after the Page time the operators in the interior of an AdS$_2$ eternal black hole in equilibrium with a finite temperature non-gravitating bath can not be reconstructed using the operators in the black hole region outside the horizon. In \cite{Jalan:2023dmq}, the authors demonstrated this assertion by slightly modifying the black hole interior reconstruction method due to Leutheusser and Liu \cite{Leutheusser:2021qhd, Leutheusser:2021frk}, based on the half-sided translations. This was done by introducing the notion of the reduced half-sided translations associated with the algebra of operators restricted to the black hole region outside the horizon, and by showing that albeit the reduced half-sided translations translate operators in the black hole region outside the horizon to the black hole interior before the Page time, it fails to do so after the Page time. In this paper, we demonstrate the second assertion of the island paradigm using this modified interior reconstruction method, which states that after the Page time the operators in the black hole interior can be reconstructed using the operators in the bath. We show that even though before the Page time the reduced half-sided translations associated with the algebra of operators restricted to the bath do not translate the operators in the bath to the black hole interior, after the Page time they take them to the black hole interior.</description>

      <title>Matter from multiply enhanced singularities in F-theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14731v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the geometrical structure of multiply enhanced codimension-two singularities in the $SU(5)$ model of six-dimensional F-theory, where the rank of the singularity increases by two or more. We perform blow-up processes for the enhancement $SU(5)\rightarrow G'$, where $G'=E_6$, $E_7$ or $E_8$, to examine whether a sufficient set of exceptional curves emerge that can explain the charged matter generation predicted from anomaly cancelation. We first apply one of the six Esole-Yau small resolutions to the multiply enhanced singularities, but it turns out that the proper transform of the threefold equation does not reflect changes in the singularity or how the generic codimension-two singularities gather there. We then use a(n) (apparently) different way of small resolutions than Esole-Yau to find that, except for the cases of $G'= E_6$ and special cases of $E_7$, either (1) the resolution only yields exceptional curves that are insufficient to cancel the anomaly, or (2) there arises a type of singularity that is neither a conifold nor a generalized conifold singularity. Finally, we revisit the Esole-Yau small resolution and show that the change of the way of small resolutions amounts to simply exchanging the proper transform and the constraint condition, and under this exchange the two ways of small resolutions are completely equivalent.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16457v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study scalar-tensor gravitational theories using on-shell amplitude methods. We focus on theories with gravity coupled to a massless scalar via the Gauss-Bonnet and Chern-Simons terms. In this framework, we calculate the waveforms for classical scalar radiation emitted in scattering of macroscopic objects, including spin effects. To this end, we use the Kosower-Maybee-O'Connell formalism, with the 5-particle amplitude for scalar emission in matter scattering calculated at tree level using the unitarity-factorization bootstrap techniques. We also discuss in detail the dependence of that amplitude on the contact terms of the intermediate 4-particle scalar-graviton-matter amplitude. Finally, we discuss the conditions for resolvability of classical scalar radiation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12330v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop the pole-skipping structure in de Sitter (dS) spacetime and find that their leading frequencies satisfy the relation $\omega_{dS}=i2\pi T_{dS}(1-s)$, where $T_{dS}=1/2\pi L$ and $s$ denotes spin. In the two-dimensional dS spacetime, the pole-skipping points near the cosmic horizon $r=L$ for the scalar field of spin-0 and the fermionic field of spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ correspond one-to-one with those in the classical limit as $\lambda\rightarrow 0$ in double-scaled Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model when the temperature is infinite (DSSYK$_\infty$). This provides a numerical correspondence between the static patch of two-dimensional dS spacetime and the DSSYK$_\infty$ model. We present that the dimensionless parameter $\beta\mathcal{J}$\textendash encoding the interplay between temperature and interaction energy\textendash serves as a universal scaling factor governing the pole-skipping structure in the SYK model. The pole-skipping points undergo a transition from correspondence with dS spacetime at $\beta\mathcal{J}\rightarrow 0$ to Anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime at $\beta\mathcal{J}\rightarrow \infty$.</description>

Abstract: Zero-point fluctuations in the background of a cosmic string provide an opportunity to study the effects of topology in quantum field theory. We use a scattering theory approach to compute quantum corrections to the energy density of a cosmic string, using the "ballpoint pen" and "flowerpot" models to allow for a nonzero string radius. For computational efficiency, we consider a massless field in $2+1$ dimensions. We show how to implement precise and unambiguous renormalization conditions in the presence of a deficit angle, and make use of Kontorovich-Lebedev techniques to rewrite the sum over angular momentum channels as an integral on the imaginary axis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19342v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the path integral formulation of the superstring, the chiral measure acquires a phase under the modular transformation of a Riemann surface. This motivated the use of anomaly inflow to define the superstring chiral measure by a path integral formalism of a modular invariant $3$-dimensional theory. A Gelca-Hamilton topological field theory (TQFT) is one of the Atiyah's TQFT on a $3$-dimensional extended manifold with the boundary Jacobi variety of a Riemann surface, whose Hilbert space is spanned by the theta series. We show that genus $g\leq 2$ superstring chiral measure in the path integral can be obtained by the path integral of the Gelca-Hamilton TQFT on some $3$-dimensional bulk extended manifolds. The modular transformation of the superstring chiral measure can be understood as the action of the extended mapping class group on the bulk $3$-dimensional extended manifolds.</description>

The model is known to contain electric field solutions sourced by the scalar field that are distinct from embedded Maxwell electric fields. We examine the perturbative stability of the solution and identify a region of parameter space where the solution is stable. In the regime where the scalar field has a negative mass squared, the solution has two branches and we identify an instability in one of the branches.</description>

Abstract: It is well-established that compactifying type I string theory on a circle \( S^{(1)} \) transforms the theory under T-duality into type I' theory, the compactification of type IIA string theory on the orbifold \( \tilde{S}^{(1)}/\mathbb{Z}_2 \), where the \( \mathbb{Z}_2 \) action combines worldsheet parity with spacetime reflection along the dual circle \( \tilde{S}^{(1)} \). We propose that, upon compactification, the untwisted (twisted) sector of the type I effective action should map under the Buscher rules to the untwisted (twisted) sector of the type I' effective action. This T-duality constraint offers significant insight into the determination of bosonic couplings in the effective action of type IIA theories, specifically those that remain after orbifold reduction, as well as in the untwisted sector of the type I effective action. However, its scope is limited and insufficient to fully determine the couplings within the twisted sectors of type I and type I' theories. Within this framework, we demonstrate that the leading 2-derivative couplings in untwisted sector of type I and the 2-derivative couplings in type IIA theory are uniquely determined, except for the Chern-Simons term in type IIA, which is absent in the orbifold reduction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09796v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We numerically investigate the Araki-Uhlmann relative entropy in Quantum Field Theory, focusing on a free massive scalar field in 1+1-dimensional Minkowski spacetime. Using Tomita-Takesaki modular theory, we analyze the relative entropy between a coherent state and the vacuum state, with several types of test functions localized in the right Rindler wedge. Our results confirm that relative entropy decreases with increasing mass and grows with the size of the spacetime region, aligning with theoretical expectations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10169v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper focuses on a conformal block with rank $\frac{3}{2}$ irregular singularity which corresponds to the prepotential of the ${\cal H}_1$ Argyres-Douglas theory in $\Omega$ background. We derive this irregular conformal block using generalized holomorphic anomaly recursion relation. This results is an expression which is a power series in $\Omega$-background parameters $\epsilon_{1,2}$ and exact in coupling. We have verified that in small coupling regime our result is consistent with previously known expressions.
  Furthermore we derive the Deformed Seiberg-Witten curve which provides an alternative tool to explore above mentioned theory in Nekrasov-Shatashvili limit of $\Omega$-background. We checked that the results are in complete agreement with the holomorphic anomaly approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05948v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A class of higher-spin gauge theories on $AdS_4$ associated with various Coxeter groups $\mathcal{C}$ is analyzed at the linear order. For a general $\mathcal{C}$, a solution corresponding to the $AdS_4$ space and the form of the free unfolded equations are established. A disentanglement criterion has been formulated for Coxeter HS modules. The shifted homotopy technique is uplifted to the general Coxeter HS models. In case of the Coxeter group $B_2$ classification of unitary HS modules and a consistent truncation to them are determined, the dynamical content is discussed briefly.</description>

Abstract: We derive a manifestly superconformally covariant unfolded formulation of the free (2,0) tensor multiplet in six spacetime dimensions. The unfolded system consists of an abelian two-form and an infinite-dimensional chiral zero-form containing the system's curvature, matter fields, and their derivatives on-shell, realized using superoscillators. The construction of the cocycle gluing these forms on a general superconformal background goes one step beyond previous results in super-Poincar\'e backgrounds.</description>

Abstract: We consider N=1 supersymmetric systems in d=4, 6 and 10 dimensions which consist of reducible bosonic and fermionic massless representations of the Poincare group. We show in detail how to decompose the corresponding Lagrangians into a sum of Lagrangians for irreducible representations of the Poincare group. We also outline a modification of this procedure in the case of an anti-de Sitter background.</description>

Abstract: It has been shown that if one solves self-consistently the semiclassical Einstein equations in the presence of a quantum scalar field, with a cutoff on the number of modes, spacetime become flatter when the cutoff increases. Here we extend the result to include the effect of fields with spin 0, 1/2, 1 and 2. With minor adjustments, the main result persists. Remarkably, one can have positive curvature even if the cosmological constant in the bare action is negative.</description>

      <title>Restoration of residual gauge symmetries due to topological defects and color confinement in the Lorenz gauge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18252v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The residual gauge symmetry (RGS) is the local gauge symmetry remaining even after imposing the gauge fixing condition. Although this symmetry is ``spontaneously broken'' in the perturbative vacuum, it can be restored in the true confining vacuum of QCD. Therefore, a color confinement criterion is obtained as the condition of restoration of the RGS, namely, disappearance of the massless Nambu-Goldstone pole associated with this spontaneous breaking, provided that the color confinement phase is a disordered phase where all internal symmetries remain unbroken. In the Lorenz gauge, indeed, it was shown by Hata that the restoration condition is identical to the Kugo-Ojima color confinement criterion, if the gauge transformation function $\omega (x)$ for the residual gauge symmetry is taken to be linear in $x$. However, this result was obtained without regard to topological configurations. In this talk, we reconsider this issue by taking into account topological defects that are expected to play the dominant role for realizing confinement in the non-perturbative way.</description>

      <title>The structure of divergences in the higher-derivative supersymmetric $6D$ gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18532v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the harmonic superspace approach, we perform a comprehensive study of the structure of divergences in the higher-derivative $6D$, ${\cal N}=(1,0)$ supersymmetric Yang--Mills theory coupled to the hypermultiplet in the adjoint representation. The effective action is constructed in the framework of the superfield background field method with the help of ${\cal N}=(1,0)$ supersymmetric higher-derivative regularization scheme which preserves all symmetries of the theory. The one-loop divergences are calculated in a manifestly gauge invariant and $6D$, ${\cal N}=(1,0)$ supersymmetric form hopefully admitting a generalization to higher loops. The $\beta$-function in the one-loop approximation is found and analyzed. In particular, it is shown that the one-loop $\beta$-function for an arbitrary regulator function is specified by integrals of double total derivatives in momentum space, like it happens in $4D,\, {\cal N}=1$ superfield gauge theories. This points to the potential possibility to derive the all-loop NSVZ-like exact $\beta$-function in the considered theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21644v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Symmetric orbifold CFTs contain twist operators that can join and split copies of the CFT. In this paper, we study the effects of four twist-2 operators on two copies of a single free boson. A recent study analyzed their effects on the vacuum, finding a nontrivial left-right mixing that arises from the fact that the covering surface is a torus, while the effects of one or two twist-2 operators do not produce such mixing. Here, we extend this analysis to excited states and find a similar left-right mixing. Furthermore, we explore the continuum, or high-energy, limit and show that the left-right mixing becomes negligible in this limit.</description>

      <title>Non-singular "Gauss'' black hole from non-locality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2104.00555v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cutting out an infinite tube around $r=0$ formally removes the Schwarzschild singularity, but without a physical mechanism this procedure seems ad hoc and artificial. In this paper we provide justification for such a mechanism by means of non-locality. Motivated by the Gauss law we define a suitable radius variable as the inverse of a regular non-local potential, and use this variable to model a non-singular black hole. The resulting geometry has a de\,Sitter core, and for generic values of the regulator there is \emph{no inner horizon}, saving this model from potential issues via mass inflation. An \emph{outer} horizon only exists for masses above a critical threshold, thereby reproducing the conjectured ``mass gap'' for black holes in non-local theories. The geometry's density and pressure terms decrease exponentially, thereby rendering it an almost-exact vacuum solution of the Einstein equations outside of astrophysical black holes. Its thermodynamic properties resemble that of the Hayward black hole, with the notable exception that for critical mass the horizon radius is zero.</description>

Abstract: We define 2-categories of microlocal perverse (resp. coherent) sheaves of categories on the skeleton of a hypertoric variety and show that the generators of these 2-categories lift the projectives (resp. simples) in hypertoric category $\mathcal{O}$. We then establish equivalences of 2-categories categorifying the Koszul duality between Gale dual hypertoric categories $\mathcal{O}$. These constructions give a prototype for understanding symplectic duality via the fully extended 3d mirror symmetry conjecture.</description>

      <title>Radiative corrections to the $R$ and $R^2$ invariants from torsion fluctuations on maximally symmetric spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16681v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive the runnings of the $R$ and $R^2$ operators that stem from integrating out quantum torsion fluctuations on a maximally symmetric Euclidean background, while treating the metric as a classical field. Our analysis is performed in a manifestly covariant way, exploiting both the recently-introduced spin-parity decomposition of torsion perturbations and the heat kernel technique. The Lagrangian we start with is the most general one for 1-loop computations on maximally symmetric backgrounds involving kinetic terms and couplings to the scalar curvature that is compatible with a gauge-like symmetry for the torsion. The latter removes the twice-longitudinal vector mode from the spectrum, and it yields operators of maximum rank four. We also examine the conditions required to avoid ghost instabilities and ensure the validity of our assumption to neglect metric quantum fluctuations, demonstrating the compatibility between these two assumptions. Then, we use our findings in the context of Starobinsky's inflation to calculate the contributions from the torsion tensor to the $\beta$-function of the $R^2$ term. While this result is quantitatively reliable only at the $0$-th order in the slow-roll parameters or during the very early stages of inflation -- due to the background choice -- it qualitatively illustrates how to incorporate quantum effects of torsion in the path integral formalism.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13665v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We uncover the solution space of a five dimensional geometry which we deem it as the direct counterpart of the Bianchi Type V cosmological model. We kinematically reduce the scale factor matrix and then, with an appropriate scaling and choice of time, we cast the spatial equations into a simple "Kasner" like form; thus revealing linear integrals of motion. Their number is enough so that, along with the quadratic constraint, it suffices to scan the entire space of solutions. The latter is revealed to be quite rich, containing cosmological solutions, some of which admit dimensional reduction asymptotically to four dimensions, Kundt spacetimes with vanishing type I (polynomial) curvature scalars and solutions describing periodic universes which behave like cosmological time crystals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02027v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neutrino propagation in the Galactic and extragalactic magnetic fields is considered. We extend an approach developed in \cite{Popov:2019nkr} to describe neutrino flavour and spin oscillations using wave packets. The evolution equations for the neutrino wave packets in a uniform and non-uniform magnetic fields are derived. The analytical expressions for neutrino flavour and spin oscillations probabilities accounting for damping due to the wave packet separation are obtained for the case of a uniform magnetic field. It is shown that terms in the flavour oscillations probabilities that depend on the magnetic field strength are characterized by two coherence lengths. One of the coherence lengths coincides with the coherence length for neutrino oscillations in vacuum, while the second one is proportional to the cube of the average neutrino momentum $p_0^3$. The probabilities of flavour and spin oscillations are calculated numerically for neutrino interacting with the non-uniform Galactic magnetic field. It is shown that oscillations on certain frequencies are suppressed on the Galactic scale due to the neutrino wave packets separation. The flavour compositions of high-energy neutrino flux coming from the Galactic centre and ultra-high energy neutrinos from an extragalactic sourse are calculated accounting for neutrino interaction with the magnetic field and decoherence due to the wave packet separation. It is shown that for neutrino magnetic moments $\sim 10^{-13} \mu_B$ and larger these flavour compositions significantly differ from ones predicted by the vacuum neutrino oscillations scenario.</description>

Abstract: Condensed matter systems can host emergent `vacua' with particles, fields and dimension different from that of the universe we inhabit. Motivated by the appearance of emergent gauge fields with both electric and magnetic charges, we consider the fate of electromagnetism in two dimensions in the presence of magnetic monopoles. We find that generically electromagnetic fields are damped due to resistive effects. However, we can still identify a magnetohydrodynamic regime. It exhibits magnetosonic waves which, unlike in $d=3$, are isotropic, to which there is a contribution from the odd viscosity coefficient present in the system. Further, we find a dynamo action, which unlike in $d=3$ requires compressibility of the flow.</description>

      <title>Waveform models for the gravitational-wave memory effect: Extreme mass-ratio limit and final memory offset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19017v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The gravitational-wave (GW) memory effect is a strong-field relativistic phenomenon that is associated with a persistent change in the GW strain after the passage of a GW. The nonlinear effect arises from interactions of GWs themselves in the wave zone and is an observable effect connected to the infrared properties of general relativity. The detection of the GW memory effect is possible with LIGO and Virgo in a population of binary-black-hole (BBH) mergers or from individual events with next-generation ground- and space-based GW detectors or pulsar timing arrays. Matched-filtering-based searches for the GW memory require accurate, and preferably rapid-to-evaluate waveform models of the memory effect's GW signal. One important element of such a waveform model is a model for the final memory offset -- namely, the net change in strain between early and late times. In this paper, we construct a model for the final memory offset from the merger of nonspinning BBH systems in quasicircular orbits. A novel ingredient of this model is that we first compute the memory signal for extreme mass-ratio inspirals using a high post-Newtonian-order analytic calculation, and we use this analytical result to fix the coefficient in the fit which is linear in the mass-ratio. The resulting memory-offset fit could be used for detecting the GW memory for binaries that merge on a timescale that is short relative to the inverse of the low-frequency cutoff of a GW detector. Additionally, this fit will be useful for analytic waveform models of the GW memory signals in the time and frequency domains.</description>

      <title>Thermal and nonthermal dark matters with gravitational neutrino reheating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12450v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have discussed in detail how neutrinos produced from inflaton solely through gravitational interaction can successfully reheat the universe. For this, we have introduced the well-known Type-I seesaw neutrino model. Depending on seesaw model parameters, two distinct reheating histories have been realized and dubbed as i) Neutrino dominating: Following the inflaton domination, the universe becomes neutrino dominated, and their subsequent decay concludes the reheating process, and ii) Neutrino heating: Despite being sub-dominant compared to inflaton energy, neutrinos efficiently heat the thermal bath and produce the radiation dominated universe. Imposing baryon asymmetric yield, the $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ constraint at Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) considering primordial gravitational waves (PGW), we have arrived at the following constraints on reheating equation of state to lie within $0.5\lesssim w_\phi\lesssim1.0$. In these neutrino-driven reheating backgrounds, we further performed a detailed analysis of both thermal and non-thermal production of dark matter (DM), invoking two minimal models, namely the Higgs portal DM and classical QCD pseudo scalar axion. An interesting correlation between seemingly uncorrelated DM and Type-I seesaw parameters has emerged when confronting various direct and indirect observations. When DMs are set to freeze-in, freeze-out, or oscillate during reheating, new parameter spaces open, which could be potentially detectable in future experiments, paving an indirect way to look into the early universe in the laboratory.</description>

      <title>Particle creation and evaporation in Kalb-Ramond gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06841v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we examine particle creation and the evaporation process in the context of Kalb-Ramond gravity. Specifically, we build upon two existing solutions from the literature [1] (Model I) and [2] (Model II), both addressing a static, spherically symmetric configuration. For this study, we focus on the scenario in which the cosmological constant vanishes. The analysis begins by examining bosonic particles to investigate Hawking radiation. Using the Klein-Gordon equation, the Bogoliubov coefficients are derived, highlighting the role of the parameter $\ell$, which governs Lorentz symmetry breaking, in introducing corrections to the amplitude of particle production. This forms the basis for calculating the Hawking temperature. The study further explores Hawking radiation through the tunneling mechanism, where divergent integrals are solved using the residue method. The particle creation density is also computed for fermionic particle modes. Additionally, greybody bounds are evaluated for bosons and fermions as well. Finally, we analyze the deviation of our results from those predicted by general relativity. In a general panorama, Model I exhibits the highest particle creation densities and the fastest evaporation process, whereas Model II shows the largest greybody factor intensities.</description>

      <title>Gravitational memory and Ward identities in the local detector frame</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12273v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational memory, which describes the permanent shift in the strain after the passage of gravitational waves, is directly related to Weinberg's soft graviton theorems and the Bondi-Metzner-Sachs (BMS) symmetry group of asymptotically flat space-times. In this work, we provide an equivalent description of the phenomenon in local coordinates around gravitational wave detectors, such as transverse-traceless (TT) gauge. We show that gravitational memory is encoded in large residual diffeomorphisms in this gauge, which include time-dependent anisotropic spatial rescalings, and prove their equivalence to BMS transformations when translated to TT gauge. We then derive the associated Ward identities and associated soft theorems, for both scattering amplitudes and equal-time (in-in) correlation functions, and explicitly check their validity for planar gravitational waves. The in-in identities are recognized as the flat-space analog of the well-known inflationary consistency relations.</description>

      <title>Black hole spectroscopy and nonlinear echoes in Einstein-Maxwell-scalar theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14259v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the context of Einstein-Maxwell-scalar theory with a nonminimal coupling between the electromagnetic and scalar field, we study linear (non)radial perturbations and nonlinear radial dynamics of spherically symmetric black holes. In a certain region of the parameter space, this theory admits hairy black holes with a stable photon sphere. This has a counterpart in the effective potential of linear perturbations, featuring multiple maxima and minima. The corresponding quasinormal mode spectrum contains long-lived modes trapped in the potential cavity and the time-domain linear response displays echoes, as previously observed for horizonless compact objects. Interestingly, the black-hole dynamics in this theory can be studied at the nonlinear level. By performing fully-fledged 1+1 simulations, we show that echoes are present even when the nonlinearities are significant. To our knowledge, this is the first example of echoes appearing in a consistent theory beyond a linearized analysis. In a follow-up work we will study whether this feature is also present in the post-merger signal from black hole collisions in this theory.</description>

      <title>On the geometry of Lagrangian one-forms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14700v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lagrangian multiform theory is a variational framework for integrable systems. In this article we introduce a new formulation which is based on symplectic geometry and which treats position, momentum and time coordinates of a finite-dimensional integrable hierarchy on an equal footing. This formulation allows a streamlined one-step derivation of both the multi-time Euler-Lagrange equations and the closure relation (encoding integrability). We argue that any Lagrangian one-form for a finite-dimensional system can be recast in our new framework. This framework easily extends to non-commuting flows and we show that the equations characterising (infinitesimal) Hamiltonian Lie group actions are variational in character. We reinterpret these equations as a system of compatible non autonomous Hamiltonian equations.</description>

      <title>Non-invertible SPTs: an on-site realization of (1+1)d anomaly-free fusion category symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20546v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate (1+1)d symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases with fusion category symmetries. We emphasize that the UV description of an anomaly-free fusion category symmetry must include the fiber functor, giving rise to a local symmetry action, a charge category and a trivial phase. We construct an ``onsite'' matrix-product-operator (MPO) version of the Hopf algebra symmetry operators in a lattice model with tensor-product Hilbert space. In particular, we propose a systematic framework for classifying and constructing SPTs with non-invertible symmetries. An SPT phase corresponds to a Q-system in the charge category, such that the Q-system becomes a matrix algebra when the symmetry is forgotten. As an example, we provide an explicit microscopic realization of all three $\mathsf{Rep}^\dagger(D_8)$ SPT phases, including a trivial phase, and further demonstrate the $S_3$-duality among these three SPT phases.</description>

      <title>Can tensor-scalar induced GWs dominate PTA observations ?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00228v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Observational constraints on small-scale primordial gravitational waves are considerably weaker than those on large scales. We focus on scenarios with significant primordial gravitational waves and curvature perturbations on small scales, studying the energy density spectrum of the second-order TSIGW. By leveraging current data from CMB, BAO, and PTA, combined with the SNR analysis of LISA, we can investigate how tensor-scalar induced gravitational waves affect observations on various scales, thus constraining the parameter space for primordial gravitational waves and curvature perturbations. The Bayes factor analysis suggests that TSIGW+PGW might be more likely to dominate current PTA observations compared to SMBHB.</description>

      <title>Thermal RG Flow of AS Quantum Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02878v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform the thermal Renormalization Group (RG) study of the Asymptotically Safe (AS) quantum gravity in the Einstein-Hilbert truncation by relating the temperature parameter to the running RG scale as $T \equiv k_T = \tau k$ (in natural units) in order to determine its thermal evolution in terms of the dimensionless temperature $\tau$ which is associated with the temperature of the expanding Universe. Thus, $k_T$ and $k$ are understood as running cutoffs for thermal and quantum fluctuations, respectively. Quantum effects are taken into account by moving along the thermal RG trajectory with fixed value of $\tau$ producing the quantum effective action at a given dimensionless temperature. The $\tau$-evolution of the dimensionless Newton coupling $g(\tau)$ and the dimensionless cosmological constant $\lambda(\tau)$ results in a vanishing $g$-coordinate of the Reuter (i.e., non-Gaussian UV) fixed point in the high temperature limit ($\tau \to \infty$) which means that only the symmetric phase of AS gravity survives at $\tau = \infty$. Thus, in case of large temperatures the cosmological constant takes on a negative value in the limit $k\to 0$ which was also initially predicted by certain string theories, however, in our approach this is not in disagreement with observations, since during the thermal evolution of the Universe a phase transition occurs and the cosmological constant runs to the expected positive value at low temperatures.</description>

      <title>Perspectives on Quantum Friction, Self-Propulsion, and Self-Torque</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17793v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper provides an overview of the nonequilibrium fluctuational forces and torques acting on a body either in motion or at rest relative to another body or to the thermal vacuum blackbody radiation. We consider forces and torques beyond the usual static Casimir-Polder and Casimir forces and torques. For a moving body, a retarding force emerges, called quantum or Casimir friction, which in vacuum was first predicted by Einstein and Hopf in 1910. Nonreciprocity may allow a stationary body, out of thermal equilibrium with its environment, to experience a torque. Moreover, if a stationary reciprocal body is not in thermal equilibrium with the blackbody vacuum, a self-propulsive force or torque can appear, resulting in a potentially observable linear or angular terminal velocity, even after thermalization.</description>

      <title>Status of early dark energy after DESI: the role of $\Omega_m$ and $r_s H_0$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15541v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The EDE model is one of the promising solutions to the long-standing Hubble tension. This paper investigates the status of several EDE models in light of recent BAO observations from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) and their implications for resolving the Hubble tension. The DESI Y1 BAO results deviate from the CMB and Type Ia supernova (SNeIa) observations in their constraints on the matter density $\Omega_m$ and the product of the sound horizon and the Hubble constant $r_s H_0$. Meanwhile, these EDE models happen to tend towards this deviation. Therefore, in this work, it is found that DESI Y1 BAO results strengthen the preference for EDE models and help to obtain a higher $H_0$. Even considering the Pantheon+ observations for SNeIa, which have an opposite tendency, DESI still dominates the preference for EDE. This was unforeseen in past SDSS BAO measurements and therefore emphasizes the role of BAO and SNeIa measurements in Hubble tension.</description>

Abstract: We discuss the Dirac oscillator in $(1+1)$ and $(2+1)$ dimensions and generalize it in the spirit of the isotonic oscillator using supersymmetric quantum mechanics. In $(1+1)$ dimensions, the Dirac oscillator returns to the quantum harmonic oscillator in the non-relativistic limit, while its generalization maps to the isotonic oscillator. We describe exact solutions of these generalized systems and also present their non-relativistic limits. Finally, based on supersymmetric quantum mechanics, we show that a generalized Dirac oscillator in $(2+1)$ dimensions can be mapped to an anti-Jaynes-Cummings-like Hamiltonian in which the spin operators couple with the supercharges.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17240v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The calculation of gray-body factors is essential for understanding Hawking radiation and black hole thermodynamics. While the formalism developed by Chandrasekhar is effective for static black holes, it faces significant challenges in Kerr spacetimes, particularly in the superradiant regime, where a specific choice of coordinates introduces numerical inaccuracies. To address these limitations, an alternative method based on re-scaling radial coordinates and employing Frobenius-like expansions has been investigated. We compare the gray-body factors obtained for a near-maximally rotating black hole using both methods and find that the Chandrasekhar formalism systematically overestimates the values in the superradiant regime compared to well-established analytical results. Specifically, for a spin parameter of $a_* = 0.999$, the Chandrasekhar method yields values approximately twice as large as the correct result. Since this approach has been implemented in \texttt{BlackHawk}, we assess the impact of these discrepancies on constraints derived from gamma-ray observations of highly spinning primordial black holes.</description>

      <title>The Role of the Schwinger Effect in Superradiant Axion Lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01039v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Superradiance can cause the axion cloud around a rotating black hole to reach extremely high densities, and the decay of these axions can produce a powerful laser. The electric field of these lasers is strong enough that the Schwinger effect may become significant, resulting in the production of an electron-positron plasma. We explore the dynamics between axion lasers and this electron-positron plasma. While there are several mechanisms by which the inclusion of a plasma can impact the laser's behavior, the most significant of these mechanisms is that the electron-positron plasma imparts an effective mass on the photon. As the plasma frequency increases, axion decay becomes energetically unfavorable, up to the point where the axion no longer decays into photons, shutting off the laser. We find that the impact of the electron-positron plasma on the dynamics of the system depend heavily on the parameters, specifically the axion mass $m_\phi$ and the superradiant coupling $\alpha$, and that we may divide parameter space into three regimes: the unenhanced, enhanced, and unstable regimes. In the unenhanced and enhanced regime, the system will eventually settle into an equilibrium state, emitting a laser of constant luminosity while the number of axions remains constant. In the unenhanced regime, this equilibrium state can be calculated while neglecting the effects of Schwinger production; in the enhanced regime, the equilibrium luminosity is slightly larger than what it would be without Schwinger production. In the unstable regime, the electron-positron plasma suppresses axion decay to the point where the system is never able to reach equilibrium; instead, the axions continue to grow superradiantly. In all three cases, the production of superradiant axions will eventually cause the black hole to spin down to the point where superradiance ceases.</description>

      <title>Running vacuum and H^4-inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01041v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent studies of QFT in cosmological spacetime indicate that the speeding up of the present universe may not just be associated with a rigid cosmological term but with a running one that evolves with the expansion rate: $\Lambda=\Lambda(H)$. This running is inherited from the cosmic evolution of the vacuum energy density (VED), $\rho_{\rm vac}$, which is sensitive to quantum effects in curved spacetime that ultimately trigger that running. The VED is a function of the Hubble rate and its time derivatives: $\rho_{\rm vac}=\rho_{\rm vac}(H, \dot{H},\ddot{H},...)$. Two nearby points of the cosmic evolution during the FLRW epoch are smoothly related as $\delta\rho_{\rm vac}\sim {\cal O}(H^2)$. In the very early universe, in contrast, the higher powers of the Hubble rate take over and bring about a period of fast inflation. They originate from quantum effects on the effective action of vacuum, which we compute. Herein we focus on the lowest possible power for inflation to occur: $H^4$. During the inflationary phase, $H$ remains approximately constant and very large. Subsequently, the universe enters the usual FLRW radiation epoch. This new mechanism (`RVM-inflation') is not based on any supplementary `inflaton' field, it is fueled by pure QFT effects on the dynamical background and is different from Starobinsky's inflation, in which $H$ is never constant.</description>

      <title>Deflection angle in the strong deflection limit: a perspective from local geometrical invariants and matter distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02320v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In static, spherically symmetric spacetimes, the deflection angle of photons in the strong deflection limit exhibits a logarithmic divergence. We introduce an analytical framework that clarifies the physical origin of this divergence by employing local, coordinate-invariant geometric quantities alongside the properties of the matter distribution. In contrast to conventional formulations -- where the divergence rate $\bar{a}$ is expressed via coordinate-dependent metric functions -- our approach relates $\bar{a}$ to the components of the Einstein tensor in an orthonormal basis adapted to the spacetime symmetry. By applying the Einstein equations, we derive the expression \begin{align*} \bar{a}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-8\pi R_{\mathrm{m}}^2\left(\rho_{\mathrm{m}}+\Pi_{\mathrm{m}}\right)}}, \end{align*} where $\rho_{\mathrm{m}}$ and $\Pi_{\mathrm{m}}$ denote the local energy density and tangential pressure evaluated at the photon sphere of areal radius $R_{\mathrm{m}}$. This result reveals that $\bar{a}$ is intrinsically governed by the local matter distribution, with the universal value $\bar{a}=1$ emerging when $\rho_{\mathrm{m}}+\Pi_{\mathrm{m}}=0$. Notably, this finding resolves the long-standing puzzle of obtaining $\bar{a}=1$ in a class of spacetimes supported by a massless scalar field. Furthermore, these local properties are reflected in the frequencies of quasinormal modes, suggesting a profound connection between strong gravitational lensing and the dynamical response of gravitational wave signals. Our framework, independent of any specific gravitational theory, offers a universal tool for testing gravitational theories and interpreting astrophysical observations.</description>

      <title>DESI results: Hint towards coupled dark matter and dark energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10806v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a scenario where a dark energy quintessence field $\phi$ with positive kinetic energy is coupled with dark matter. With two different self-interaction potentials for the field and a particular choice of the coupling function, we show explicitly how the observable effective equation of state parameter $w_{\rm eff}$ for the dark energy field crosses the phantom barrier ($w_{\rm eff} = -1$) while keeping the equation of state of the quintessence field $w_\phi &gt; -1$. With appropriate choices of parameters, $w_{\rm eff}$ crosses the phantom divide around redshift $z\sim 0.5$, transitioning from $w_{\rm eff} &lt;-1$ in the past to $w_{\rm eff}&gt;-1$ today. This explains DESI observations well. Our analysis reveals that the model remains consistent within the $2\sigma$ confidence intervals provided by DESI for several combinations of the scalar field parameters, highlighting its potential in explaining the dynamics of dark energy arising from a simple Yukawa-type long-range interaction in the dark sector. While the current findings offer a promising framework for interpreting DESI observations, future work, including a comprehensive Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis, is necessary to constrain the parameter space further and strengthen the statistical significance of the results.</description>

      <title>The $\pi\pi$ scattering amplitude at large $N_\text{c}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13978v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the scaling of meson-meson scattering amplitudes with the number of colors, $N_\text{c}$. We use lattice calculations in a theory with $N_\text{f}=4$ degenerate flavors, with $N_\text{c}=3-6$ and pion mass $M_\pi\approx 560$ MeV. We focus on three different scattering channels, two of which have the same quantum numbers as some tetraquark candidates recently found at LHCb: the $T_{cs0}^0(2900)$, $T_{c\bar{s}0}^{++}(2900)$, $T_{c\bar{s}0}^0(2900)$ and $T_{c\bar{s}1}^0(2900)$ states. Finite-volume energies are extracted using a large set of operators, containing two-particle operators with the form of two pions or two vector mesons, and local tetraquark operators. The resulting energy spectra is used to constrain the infinite-volume scattering amplitude by means of L\"uscher's quantization condition. We consider polynomial parametrizations of the phase shift, as well as one-loop chiral perturbation theory (ChPT) predictions. We find that our lattice results follow the expected $N_\text{c}$ scaling and are sensitive to subleading $N_\text{c}$ corrections. In addition, we constrain the scaling of different combinations of low-energy constants from matching to large $N_\text{c}$ ChPT. The results for the channel corresponding to a $(\pi^+ D^+_s - K^+ D^+)$ state show evidence of a virtual bound state with energy $E_\text{virtual}=1.63(10)M_\pi$ for $N_\text{c}=3$, while this pole disappears at $N_\text{c}&gt;3$. This may be connected to the exotic states found in experiment.</description>

      <title>Dark Energy within the Generalized Uncertainty Principle in Light of DESI DR2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20896v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we modify the $\Lambda$CDM model by introducing a deformed algebra within the framework of the Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP). We formulate the modified Raychaudhuri equation, where new terms are introduced which describe dynamical pressure components. For the quadratic GUP model, we derive the Hubble function, which leads to a time-dependent dark energy model. The free parameters are determined using late-time observational data, the Pantheon+ SNIa sample, the cosmic chronometers, and the DESI 2025 BAO data. We find that the modified model introduce only one new additional degree of freedom compared to the $\Lambda$CDM model. The GUP-Modified $\Lambda$CDM model provides a better fit to the data than the undeformed theory. Furthermore, we compare the same model with the DESI 2024 BAO data and find that the Bayesian evidence becomes stronger with the inclusion of the DESI 2025 release.</description>
