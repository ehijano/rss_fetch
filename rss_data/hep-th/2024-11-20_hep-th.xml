      <title>Gravity and Unification: Insights from SL(2N,C) Gauge Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The perspective that gravity governs the unification of all known elementary forces necessitates the extension of the gauge gravity symmetry group $SL(2,C)$ to the broader local symmetry $% SL(2N,C)$, where $N$ defines the degree of the internal $SU(N)$ symmetry as a subgroup. This extension is argued to lead to a consistent hyperunification scheme provided that the tetrad fields of $SL(2,C)$ gravity retain their form in the extended theory, thereby preserving the invertibility conditions, which would otherwise be lost. Consequently, while the entire gauge multiplet of $SL(2N,C)$ normally includes vector, axial-vector and tensor field submultiplets of the internal $SU(N)$ symmetry, only the submultiplet of vector fields and the singlet tensor field emerge in the observed particle spectrum. The submultiplet of axial-vector fields appear sterile to ordinary matter, while the submultiplet of tensor fields acquires the Planck scale order masses. As a consequence, the entire theory only exhibits the effective $SL(2,C)\times SU(N)$ symmetry, comprising $SL(2,C)$ gauge gravity on one hand and $SU(N)$ grand unified theory on the other. Given that all states involved in the $% SL(2N,C)$ theories are additionally classified according to their spin values, many potential $SU(N)$ GUTs, including the conventional $SU(5)$ theory, appear to be irrelevant for standard spin $1/2$ quarks and leptons. Meanwhile, applying the $SL(2N,C)$ symmetry to the model of composite quarks and leptons with constituent chiral preons in its fundamental representations identifies $SL(16,C)$ with the effective $SL(2,C)\times SU(8)$ symmetry, accommodating all three quark-lepton families, as the most likely candidate for hyperunification of the existing elementary forces.</description>

      <title>End-of-the-World Branes and Inflationary Predictions for Rocky and Swampy Landscapes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Making cosmological predictions in a multiverse is a fundamental theoretical challenge. Assuming that (quasi-)de Sitter vacua are quantum mechanically described by a finite-dimensional Hilbert space, we develop a detailed framework for making explicit anthropic predictions. A key challenge which we attempt to overcome arises because, almost unavoidably, cosmologies that asymptote to Minkowski space exist. We then apply our framework to predicting the scale of inflation. We find that, even if eternal inflation is allowed, our predictions depend on creation rates of universes from nothing. These, in turn, are highly sensitive to the existence of end-of-the-world branes. The rates for the creation of universes from nothing are the dominant ingredient for `Swampy Landscapes', which may have no metastable de Sitter vacua but only slow-roll solutions. In `Rocky Landscapes', where long-lived de Sitter vacua are abundant, tunneling rates between such vacua represent a further key factor for deriving predictions.</description>

      <title>The Structure of Quantum Singularities on a Cauchy Horizon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spacetime singularities pose a long-standing puzzle in quantum gravity. Unlike Schwarzschild, a generic family of black holes gives rise to a Cauchy horizon on which, even in the Hartle-Hawking state, quantum observables such as $\langle T_{\mu\nu} \rangle$ -- the expectation value of the stress-energy tensor -- can diverge, causing a breakdown of semiclassical gravity. Because they are diagnosed within quantum field theory (QFT) on a smooth background, these singularities may provide a better-controlled version of the spacetime singularity problem, and merit further study.
  Here, I highlight a mildness puzzle of Cauchy horizon singularities: the $\langle T_{\mu\nu} \rangle$ singularity is significantly milder than expected from symmetry and dimensional analysis. I address the puzzle in a simple spacetime $W_P$, which arises universally near all black hole Cauchy horizons: the past of a codimension-two spacelike plane in flat spacetime. Specifically, I propose an extremely broad QFT construction in which, roughly speaking, Cauchy horizon singularities originate from operator insertions in the causal complement of the spacetime. The construction reproduces well-known outer horizon singularities (e.g., in the Boulware state), and remarkably, when applied to $W_P$, gives rise to a universal mild singularity structure for robust singularities, ones whose leading singular behavior is state-independent. I make non-trivial predictions for all black hole Cauchy horizon singularities using this, and discuss extending the results beyond robust singularities and the strict near Cauchy horizon limit.</description>

      <title>Conformal Mapping of Non-Lorentzian Geometries in SU(1,2) Conformal Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We realize an explicit conformal mapping between the state and operator pictures in a class of (2+1)-dimensional non-Lorentzian field theories with SU(1,2)$\times$U(1) conformal symmetry. The state picture arises from null reducing four-dimensional relativistic conformal field theories on a three-sphere, yielding a non-Lorentzian geometry with the conformal Killing symmetry group SU(1,2). This is complementary to the operator picture recently studied by Lambert et al., where the geometry acquires an $\Omega$-deformation. We then use the geometric mapping between the two pictures to derive a correspondence between the generators. This provides a concrete realization of the state-operator correspondence in non-Lorentzian conformal field theories.</description>

      <title>A New Genuine Multipartite Entanglement Measure: from Qubits to Multiboundary Wormholes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the Latent Entropy (L-entropy) as a novel measure to characterize the genuine multipartite entanglement in quantum systems. Our measure leverages the upper bound of reflected entropy, achieving maximal values for $n$-party 2-uniform states ($n\geq 4$) and GHZ state for 3-party quantum systems. We demonstrate that the measure functions as a multipartite pure state entanglement monotone and briefly address its extension to mixed multipartite states. We then analyze its interesting characteristics in spin chain models and the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model. Subsequently, we explore its implications to holography by deriving a Page-like curve for the L-entropy in the CFT dual to a multi-boundary wormhole model. Furthermore, we examine the behavior of L-entropy in Haar random states, deriving analytical expressions and validating them against numerical results. In particular, we show that for $n \geq 5$, random states approximate 2-uniform states with maximal multipartite entanglement. Furthermore, we propose a potential connection between random states and multi-boundary wormhole geometries. Extending to finite-temperature systems, we introduce the Multipartite Thermal Pure Quantum (MTPQ) state, a multipartite generalization of the thermal pure quantum state, and explore its entanglement properties. By incorporating state dependent construction of MTPQ state, we resolve the factorization issue in the random average of the MTPQ state, ensuring consistency with the correlation functions in the holographic dual multiboundary wormhole. Finally, we apply this construction to the multi-copy SYK model and examine its multipartite entanglement structure.</description>

      <title>The Nahm transform of multi-fractional instantons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We embed the multi-fractional instantons of $SU(N)$ gauge theories on $\mathbb T^4$ with 't Hooft twisted boundary conditions into $U(N)$ bundles and use the Nahm transform to study the corresponding configurations on the dual $\widehat{\mathbb T}^4$. We first show that $SU(N)$ fractional instantons of topological charge $Q={r \over N}$, $r \in \{1, 2,...,N-1\}$, are mapped to fractional instantons of $SU(\widehat N)$ of charge $\widehat Q = {r \over \widehat N}$, where $\widehat N = N q_1 q_3 - r q_3 + q_1$ and $q_{1,3}$ are integer-quantized $U(1)$ fluxes. We then explicitly construct the Nahm transform of constant field strength fractional instantons of $SU(N)$ and find the $SU(\widehat N)$ configurations they map to. Both the $\mathbb T^4$ instantons and their $\widehat {\mathbb T}^4$ images are self-dual for appropriately tuned torus periods. The Nahm duality can be extended to tori with detuned periods, with detuning parameter $\Delta$, mapping solutions with $\Delta &gt;0$ on $\mathbb T^4$ to ones with $\widehat\Delta &lt;0$ on $\widehat{\mathbb T}^4$. We also recall that fractional instantons appear in string theory precisely via the $U(N)$ embedding, suggesting that studying the end point of tachyon condensation for $\Delta \ne 0$ is needed -- and is perhaps feasible in a small-$\Delta$ expansion, as in field theory studies -- in order to understand the appearance and role of fractional instantons in $D$-brane constructions.</description>

      <title>The Hidden M-Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Following arguments that the (hidden) M-algebra serves as the maximal super-exceptional tangent space for 11D supergravity, we make explicit here its integration to a (super-Lie) group. This is equipped with a left-invariant extension of the ''decomposed'' M-theory 3-form, such that it constitutes the Kleinian space on which super-exceptional spacetimes are to be locally modeled as Cartan geometries.
  As a simple but consequential application, we highlight how to describe lattice subgroups $\mathbb{Z}^{k \leq 528}$ of the hidden M-group that allow to toroidially compactify also the ''hidden'' dimensions of a super-exceptional spacetime, akin to the familiar situation in topological T-duality.
  In order to deal with subtleties in these constructions, we (i) provide a computer-checked re-derivation of the ''decompose'' M-theory 3-form, and (ii) present a streamlined conception of super-Lie groups, that is both rigorous while still close to physics intuition and practice.
  Thereby this article highlights modernized super-Lie theory along the example of the hidden M-algebra, with an eye towards laying foundations for super-exceptional geometry. Among new observations is the dimensional reduction of the hidden M-algebra to a ''hidden IIA-algebra'' which in a companion article we explain as the exceptional extension of the T-duality doubled super-spacetime.</description>

      <title>Matrix moment approach to positivity bounds and UV reconstruction from IR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Positivity bounds in effective field theories (EFTs) can be extracted through the moment problem approach, utilizing well-established results from the mathematical literature. We generalize this formalism using the matrix moment approach to derive positivity bounds for theories with multiple field components. The sufficient conditions for obtaining optimal bounds are identified and applied to several example field theories, yielding results that match precisely the numerical bounds computed using other methods. The upper unitarity bounds can also be easily harnessed in the matrix case. Furthermore, the moment problem formulation also provides a means to reverse engineer the UV spectrum from the EFT coefficients, often uniquely, as explicitly demonstrated in examples such as string amplitudes and the $stu$ kink theory.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show the existence of infinitely many Bethe expansions for general four dimensional superconformal theories. We then propose an analytic method to systematically obtain all the Bethe solutions, both isolated and continuous, for general superconformal theories. In particular, we show that the contribution from the continuous manifold of solutions to the index comes from isolated points on this manifold. We check our proposals on $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM. For $U(3)$ or $SU(3)$, which are the first examples with continuous solutions, we demonstrate the non-trivial cancellation between the tachyon contributions from the previously known isolated solutions and those from the continuous solutions.</description>

      <title>Nonassociative gauge gravity theories with R-flux star products and Batalin-Vilkovisky quantization in algebraic quantum field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonassociative modifications of general relativity, GR, and quantum gravity, QG, models naturally arise as star product and R-flux deformations considered in string/ M-theory. Such nonassociative and noncommutative geometric and quantum information theories were formulated on phase spaces defined as cotangent Lorentz bundles enabled with nonassociative symmetric and nonsymmetric metrics and nonlinear and linear connection structures. We outline the analytic methods and proofs that corresponding geometric flow evolution and dynamical field equations can be decoupled and integrated in certain general off-diagonal forms. New classes of solutions describing nonassociative black holes, wormholes, and locally anisotropic cosmological configurations are constructed using such methods. We develop the Batalin-Vilkovisky, BV, formalism for quantizing modified gravity theories, MGTs, involving twisted star products and semi-classical models of nonassociative gauge gravity with de Sitter/affine/ Poincar\'{e} double structure groups. Such theories can be projected on Lorentz spacetime manifolds in certain forms equivalent to GR or MGTs with torsion generalizations etc. We study the properties of the classical and quantum BV operators for nonassociative phase spaces and nonassociative gauge gravity. Recent results and methods from algebraic QFT are generalized to involve nonassociative star product deformations of the anomalous master Ward identity. Such constructions are elaborated in a nonassociative BV perspective and for developing non-perturbative methods in QG.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recent paper, Anupam, Chowdhury, and Sen [arXiv:2308.00038] constructed the non-extremal saddle that reproduces the supersymmetric index of the BMPV black hole with three independent charges in the classical limit. This saddle solution is a finite temperature complex solution saturating the BPS bound. In this paper, we write this solution in a canonical form in terms of harmonic functions on three-dimensional flat base space, thereby showing that it is supersymmetric. We also show that it exhibits the new form of attraction.</description>

      <title>Holographic correlation functions from wedge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel holographic method for computing correlation functions of operators in conformal field theories. This method refines previous approaches and is specifically aimed at being applied to heavy operators. For operators that correspond to particles in the bulk, we show that the correlation functions can be derived from the on-shell actions of excised geometries for heavy operators, using numerical and perturbative calculations. These excised geometries are constructed from various background solutions such as \Poincare AdS$_3$, global AdS$_3$, and BTZ by cutting out a wedge bounded by two intersecting End-of-the-world branes and the AdS boundary. The wedge itself can be interpreted as a dual to a BCFT with cusps in the AdS/BCFT framework. Additionally, we calculate the correlation functions for heavy operators directly by constructing backreacted bulk geometries for particle excitations through coordinate transformations from a conical solution. We find that the on-shell actions of these backreacted solutions accurately reproduce correlation functions, although they differ from those computed in Fefferman-Graham(FG) gauge. This discrepancy, previously noted and explained in our earlier work, is reinforced by additional examples presented here.</description>

      <title>Generalized Fefferman-Graham gauge and boundary Weyl structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the framework of AdS/CFT correspondence, the Fefferman--Graham (FG) gauge offers a useful way to express asymptotically anti-de Sitter spaces, allowing a clear identification of their boundary structure. A known feature of this approach is that choosing a particular conformal representative for the boundary metric breaks explicitly the boundary scaling symmetry. Recent developments have shown that it is possible to generalize the FG gauge to restore boundary Weyl invariance by adopting the Weyl--Fefferman--Graham gauge. In this paper, we focus on three-dimensional gravity and study the emergence of a boundary Weyl structure when considering the most general AdS boundary conditions introduced by Grumiller and Riegler. We extend the holographic renormalization scheme to incorporate Weyl covariant quantities, identifying new subleading divergences appearing at the boundary. To address these, we introduce a new codimension-two counterterm, or corner term, that ensures the finiteness of the gravitational action. From here, we construct the quantum-generating functional, the holographic stress tensor, and compute the corresponding Weyl anomaly, showing that the latter is now expressed in a full Weyl covariant way. Finally, we discuss explicit applications to holographic integrable models and accelerating black holes. For the latter, we show that the new corner term plays a crucial role in the computation of the Euclidean on-shell action.</description>

      <title>Classical and quantum chaos of closed strings on a charged confining holographic background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the classical and quantum chaos of closed strings on a recently constructed charged confining holographic background. The confining background corresponds to the charged soliton, which is a solution of minimal $d=5$ gauged supergravity. The solution has a compact spacelike direction with a Wilson line on a circle and asymptotes to $AdS_5$ with a planar boundary. For the classical case, we analyze the chaos using the power spectrum, Poincar\'{e} sections, and Lyapunov exponents, finding that both energy and charge play constructive effects on enhancing the chaotic nature of the system. We similarly analyze quantum chaos using the distribution of the spectrum's level-spacing and out-of-time-ordered correlators and thoroughly investigate the effects of charge and energy. A gradual transition from a chaotic to an integrable regime is obtained as the energy and charge increase from lower to higher values, with charge playing a subdominant role.</description>

      <title>Collective coordinates method for long-range kink collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explored a class of potentials with three minima that support kink solutions exhibiting one long-range tail. We analyzed antikink-kink interactions using an effective Lagrangian based on collective coordinates and compared the results to those obtained from full dynamical simulations. To this end, we constructed the collective coordinates with the antikink-kink configuration, and also a generalized Derrick mode, choosing the kink position and the Derrick mode amplitude as the moduli. For the antikink-kink configuration, we utilized the impurity ansatz proposed in \cite{campos2024collision}. We also studied the interaction of wobbling kinks where the lowest delocalized mode is excited.</description>

      <title>The H_0 Tension and Late Time Phenomena in f(T,\mathcal{T}) Gravity Framework: Role of H_0 Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we have investigated the role of $H_0$ priors in describing $H_0$ tension and late-time cosmic behavior of the Universe in the framework of $f(T, \mathcal{T})$ gravity. The specific functional form of $f(T, \mathcal{T})$, where $T$ and $\mathcal{T}$ respectively denote the torsion scalar and trace of the energy-momentum tensor, has the potential to show the $H_0$ tension and late-time accelerating behavior. The model parameter space has been obtained using multiple cosmological data sets such as cosmic chronometers (CC), Supernovae Type Ia $PAN^+\&amp;SH0ES$, and baryon acoustic oscillations (BAOs). Also, we have incorporated the $H_0$ priors from the Tip of the Red Giant Branch (TRGB) and HW. The analysis shows the ability of the model to replicate comparative performance with the standard $\Lambda$CDM model through AIC and BIC. From the results obtained, it has been observed that the inclusion of the BAO data set shifts the $H_0$ values lower as compared to that of the $CC+PAN^+\&amp;SH0ES$ data set, whereas the combination of HW prior favors higher $H_0$ values. This demonstrates the sensitivity of the model to different $H_0$ priors. The findings indicate that the $f(T, \mathcal{T})$ gravity model can provide an alternative approach to show cosmological tension and late-time cosmic phenomena.</description>

      <title>Casimir effect in magnetic dual chiral density waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the Casimir effect originating from Dirac fields in finite-density matter under a magnetic field. In particular, we focus on quark fields in the magnetic dual chiral density wave (MDCDW) phase as a possible inhomogeneous ground state of interacting Dirac-fermion systems. In this system, the distance dependence of Casimir energy shows a complex oscillatory behavior by the interplay between the chemical potential, magnetic field, and inhomogeneous ground state. By decomposing the total Casimir energy into contributions of each Landau level, we elucidate what types of Casimir effects are realized from each Landau level: the lowest or some types of higher Landau levels lead to different behaviors of Casimir energies. Furthermore, we point out characteristic behaviors due to level splitting between different fermion flavors, i.e., up/down quarks. These findings provide new insights into Dirac-fermion (or quark) matter with a finite thickness.</description>

      <title>High-energy interactions of charged black holes in full general relativity I: Zoom-whirl orbits and universality with the irreducible mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We simulate high-energy scattering of equal-mass, nonspinning black holes endowed with like charges in full general relativity while varying the impact parameter $b$. We show that electrodynamics does not suppress zoom-whirl orbits for at least charge-to-mass ratios $\lambda = 0.1, 0.4, 0.6$. However, we find that as $\lambda$ increases, the immediate merger and scattering thresholds defining the zoom-whirl regime move to smaller impact parameter $b/M_{\rm ADM}$, with $M_{\rm ADM}$ designating the binary black hole gravitational mass. This demonstrates that charge leaves observable imprints in key properties at energy scales where charge has negligible influence in head-on collisions. Additionally, we find that these threshold impact parameters become universal, i.e., charge-independent, when we normalize $b$ by the sum of the initial BH irreducible masses in the binary ($b/M_{\rm irr}$). This is the first explicit demonstration that the irreducible mass, which is proportional to the black hole areal radius, defines a fundamental gauge-invariant length scale governing horizon scale scattering events in the strong-field, dynamical spacetime regime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum geometric tensor (QGT) characterizes the Hilbert space geometry of the eigenstates of a parameter-dependent Hamiltonian. In recent years, the QGT and related quantities have found extensive theoretical and experimental utility, in particular for quantifying quantum phase transitions both at and out of equilibrium. Here we consider the symmetric part (quantum Riemannian metric) of the QGT for various multi-parametric random matrix Hamiltonians and discuss the possible indication of ergodic or integrable behaviour. We found for a two-dimensional parameter space that, while the ergodic phase corresponds to the smooth manifold, the integrable limit marks itself as a singular geometry with a conical defect. Our study thus provides more support for the idea that the landscape of the parameter space yields information on the ergodic-nonergodic transition in complex quantum systems, including the intermediate phase.</description>

      <title>Constraint on the equation of state of strange quark star: Perturbative QCD along with a density-dependent bag constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the structural properties of strange quark stars (SQS) using a Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) perturbative model combined with the latest Particle Data Group dataset. Given the energy scale present in compact stars, QCD perturbation theory alone may not fully explain their structure. To account for non-perturbative contributions, we incorporate a density-dependent effective bag parameter, $B$, and derive the equation of state (EOS) for strange quark matter (SQM). We start by demonstrating the limitations of EOSs with a constant $B$ in describing massive objects with $ M_{TOV}&gt; 2M_{\odot} $. Subsequently, we show that considering $B$ as a density-dependent function significantly changes the results. Our definition of $B$ includes two parameters determined by both theoretical and observational constraints. We demonstrate that incorporating a density-dependent $B$ into the perturbative EOS can yield SQSs with masses exceeding $2M_{\odot}$, while complying with gravitational wave constraints such as tidal deformability, and thermodynamic considerations, including stability conditions and speed of sound behavior. Specifically, we show that massive compact objects like PSR J0952-0607, PSR J2215+5135, PSR J0740+6620, and the secondary mass of GW190814 can be SQSs. Additionally, we compare our EOS with the EOS of the authors who use a generalized polytropic form with adjustable parameters and obtain an interesting result.</description>

      <title>Long-time Freeness in the Kicked Top</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent work highlighted the importance of higher-order correlations in quantum dynamics for a deeper understanding of quantum chaos and thermalization. The full Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis, the framework encompassing correlations, can be formalized using the language of Free Probability theory. In this context, chaotic dynamics at long times are proposed to lead to free independence or "freeness" of observables. In this work, we investigate these issues in a paradigmatic semiclassical model - the kicked top - which exhibits a transition from integrability to chaos. Despite its simplicity, we identify several non-trivial features. By numerically studying 2n-point out-of-time-order correlators, we show that in the fully chaotic regime, long-time freeness is reached exponentially fast. These considerations lead us to introduce a large deviation theory for freeness that enables us to define and analyze the associated time scale. The numerical results confirm the existence of a hierarchy of different time scales, indicating a multifractal approach to freeness in this model. Our findings provide novel insights into the long-time behavior of chaotic dynamics and may have broader implications for the study of many-body quantum dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a generalization of the theory of magnetic Skyrmions in chiral magnets in two dimensions to a higher-dimensional theory with magnetic Skyrmions in three dimensions and an $S^3$ target space, requiring a 4-dimensional magnetization vector. A physical realization of our theory necessitates the use of a synthetic dimension, recently promoted and realized in condensed matter physics. In the simplest incarnation of the theory, we find a Skyrmion and a sphaleron - the latter being an unstable soliton. Including also the Skyrme term in theory enriches the spectrum to a small metastable Skyrmion, an unstable sphaleron and a large stable Skyrmion.</description>

Abstract: We study the entanglement entropy in quasiparticle states where certain unit patterns are excited repeatedly and sequentially in momentum space. We find that in the scaling limit, each unit pattern contributes independently and universally to the entanglement, leading to a volume-law scaling of the entanglement entropy. This characteristic of volume-law entanglement fragmentation is numerically confirmed in both fermionic and bosonic chains. We derive an analytical formula for fermions, which can also be applied to the spin-1/2 XXZ chain with appropriate identifications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quasinormal mode spectrum of gravitational waves emitted during the black hole ringdown relaxation phase, following the merger of a black hole binary, is a crucial target of gravitational wave astronomy. By considering causality constraints on the on-shell graviton three-point couplings within a weakly coupled gravity theory, we present arguments indicating that the contributions to the physics of linear and quadratic quasinormal modes from higher derivative gravity theories are either negligible or vastly suppressed for Schwarzschild and Kerr black holes. Their spectrum and interactions are dictated solely by Einstein's gravity.</description>

      <title>It\^{o}, Stratonovich, and zoom-in schemes in stochastic inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The It\^{o} and Stratonovich approaches are two ways to integrate stochastic differential equations. Detailed knowledge of the origin of the stochastic noise is needed to determine which approach suits a particular problem. I discuss this topic pedagogically in stochastic inflation, where the noise arises from a changing comoving coarse-graining scale or, equivalently, from `zooming in' into inflating space. I introduce a zoom-in scheme where deterministic evolution alternates with instantaneous zoom-in steps. I show that this alternating zoom-in scheme is equivalent to the It\^{o} approach in the Markovian limit, while the Stratonovich approach doesn't have a similar interpretation. In the full non-Markovian setup, the difference vanishes. The framework of zoom-in schemes clarifies the relationship between computations in stochastic inflation, linear perturbation theory, and the classical $\Delta N$ formalism. It informs the numerical implementation of stochastic inflation and is a building block for a first-principles derivation of the stochastic equations.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Ordering Ambiguities in Weak Chern-Simons 4D Gravity and Metastability of the Condensate-Induced Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we elaborate further on a 4D cosmological Running-Vacuum-type Model (RVM) of inflation that characterises string-inspired Chern-Simons (CS) gravity. It has been shown that inflation in such models is caused by a condensation of the gravitational CS (gCS) terms induced by primordial gravitational waves (GW), which leads to a linear-axion potential, thus breaking the shift symmetry, and lifting its periodicity (monodromy). We demonstrate here that this inflationary phase may be metastable, due to the existence of non-trivial imaginary parts of the gCS condensate. These imaginary parts are quantum effects, proportional to appropriate commutators of GW perturbations. As we stress, their existence is quantum-ordering-scheme dependent. We argue here in favor of a physical importance of such imaginary parts, which we compute to second order in the GW (tensor) perturbations in the framework of a specific gauge-fixed effective Lagrangian, within a (mean field) weak-quantum-gravity path integral approach. We pay specific attention to the various space-time boundary terms. We thus provide an estimate of the life time of inflation. On matching our results with the relevant inflationary phenomenology, we fix the quantum-ordering ambiguities, and obtain an order-of-magnitude constraint on the ratio of the string energy scale $M_s$ in this model to the (four-spacetime-dimensional) reduced Planck mass $M_{\rm Pl}$, specifically, $M_s/M_{\rm Pl} = \mathcal{O}(10^{-1})$. This is consistent with the corresponding estimate obtained in previous analyses by the authors in this framework, based on a dynamical-system approach to linear-axion RVM inflation. Finally, we examine the role of periodic modulations in the axion potential induced by non-perturbative stringy effects on the slow-roll inflationary parameters, and find compatibility with the cosmological data.</description>

      <title>Bose-Einstein condensation in a rigidly rotating relativistic boson gas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) of a free Bose gas under rigid rotation. The aim is to explore the impact of rotation on the thermodynamic quantities associated with BEC, including the Bose-Einstein (BE) transition temperature and condensate fraction. We begin by introducing the rotation in the Lagrangian density of free charged Klein-Gordon fields and determine the corresponding grand canonical partition function at finite temperature, chemical potential, and finite angular velocity. Assuming slow rotation, we derive analytical expressions for the pressure, energy, number, and angular momentum densities of a free Bose gas in nonrelativistic and ultrarelativistic limits in terms of the corresponding fugacities. We then focus on the phenomenon of BEC. We calculate the critical temperature of BEC transition and the condensate fraction in a slowly rotating Bose gas including only particles. Our findings indicate that the critical exponent associated with the BE transition in a rotating gas is lower compared to that in a nonrotating Bose gas. We also determine the fugacity in a rotating Bose gas in the aforementioned limits and examine how rotation affects its temperature dependence, both below and above the critical temperature. By analyzing the behavior of heat capacity at these temperatures, we demonstrate that in a nonrelativistic Bose gas, the rotation transforms the nature of the BE phase transition from a continuous to a discontinuous transition. In general, we find that a nonrelativistic Bose gas under rotation behaves similarly to a nonrotating Bose gas in ultrarelativistic limit.</description>

Abstract: We examine the vacuum state and its corresponding renormalized stress-energy tensor (RSET) in static horizonless regular spacetime in both two- and four-dimensions. Using the local field formulation of the anomaly-induced effective action, we show that the regularities of the spacetime and the RSET dictate the appropriate vacuum state. Furthermore, through a case study under the horizonless Bardeen-type spacetime, we demonstrate that the preferred vacuum state is not the Boulware vacuum, but a non-trivial one with a different RSET profile.</description>

Abstract: This collection of perspective pieces captures recent advancements and reflections from a dynamic research community dedicated to bridging quantum gravity, hydrodynamics, and emergent cosmology. It explores four key research areas: (a) the interplay between hydrodynamics and cosmology, including analog gravity systems; (b) phase transitions, continuum limits and emergent geometry in quantum gravity; (c) relational perspectives in gravity and quantum gravity; and (d) the emergence of cosmological models rooted in quantum gravity frameworks. Each contribution presents the distinct perspectives of its respective authors. Additionally, the introduction by the editors proposes an integrative view, suggesting how these thematic units could serve as foundational pillars for a novel theoretical cosmology framework termed "hydrodynamics on superspace".</description>

      <title>Yang--Mills topology on four-dimensional triangulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider 4D $SU(N)$ gauge theories coupled to gravity in the Causal Dynamical Triangulations (CDT) approach, focusing on the topological classification of the gauge path-integral over fixed triangulations. We discretize the topological charge and, after checking the emergence of topology and the continuum scaling on flat triangulations, we show that topology emerges on thermalized triangulations only in the so-called $C$-phase of CDT, thus enforcing the link between such phase and semi-classical space-time. We also provide a tool to visualize the topological structures.</description>

      <title>Disentangling critical quantum spin chains with Clifford circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12683v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Clifford circuits can be utilized to disentangle quantum state with polynomial cost, thanks to the Gottesman-Knill theorem. Based on this idea, Clifford Circuits Augmented Matrix Product States (CAMPS) method, which is a seamless integration of Clifford circuits within the DMRG algorithm, was proposed recently and was shown to be able to reduce entanglement in various quantum systems. In this work, we further explore the power of CAMPS method in critical spin chains described by conformal field theories (CFTs) in the scaling limit. We find that the variationally optimized disentangler corresponds to {\it duality} transformations, which significantly reduce the entanglement entropy in the ground state. For critical quantum Ising spin chain governed by the Ising CFT with self-duality, the Clifford circuits found by CAMPS coincide with the duality transformation, e.g., the Kramer-Wannier self-duality in the critical Ising chain. It reduces the entanglement entropy by mapping the free conformal boundary condition to the fixed one. In the more general case of XXZ chain, the CAMPS gives rise to a duality transformation mapping the model to the quantum Ashkin-Teller spin chain. Our results highlight the potential of CAMPS as a versatile tool for uncovering hidden dualities and simplifying the entanglement structure of critical quantum systems.</description>

Abstract: We give Swampland constraints on the three dimensional Landscape of Anti-de Sitter higher spin gravity in the Chern-Simons formulation with connection valued in various split real forms of Lie algebras. We derive the finiteness conjecture by computing the upper bound on the rank of possible gauge groups then we refine it using the AdS distance conjecture. We discuss the implications of this Swampland constraint on the spectrum of higher spin gravity theories and we compare it with the gravitational exclusion principle required from BTZ black hole consideration to excerpt a constraint on the Chern-Simons level k.</description>

      <title>Numerical results on Quantum Energy Inequalities in Integrable Models at the Two-Particle level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14960v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we study the impact of self-interaction and multiparticle states on sustaining negative energies in relativistic quantum systems. For physically reasonable models, one usually requires bounds on both magnitude and duration of the accumulation of negative energy, typically given in form of a quantum energy inequality (QEI). Such bounds have applications in semiclassical gravity where they exclude exotic spacetime geometries and imply the formation of singularities. The essence of this article is a novel numerical method for determining optimal QEI bounds at the one- or two-particle level, extending previous work focused on the one-particle case and overcoming a new type of technical challenge associated with the two-particle scenario. Our method is tailored for integrable models in quantum field theory constructed via the S-matrix boostrap. Applying the method to a representative model, the sinh-Gordon model, we confirm self-interaction as the source of negative energy, with stronger interactions leading to more pronounced negativities. Moreover, we establish the validity of QEIs and the averaged weak energy condition (AWEC) at the one- and two-particle level. Lastly, we identify a constrained one-parameter class of nonminimal stress tensor expressions satisfying QEIs at both levels, with more stringent constraints emerging from the QEI bounds at the two-particle level.</description>

      <title>Learning the Simplicity of Scattering Amplitudes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04720v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The simplification and reorganization of complex expressions lies at the core of scientific progress, particularly in theoretical high-energy physics. This work explores the application of machine learning to a particular facet of this challenge: the task of simplifying scattering amplitudes expressed in terms of spinor-helicity variables. We demonstrate that an encoder-decoder transformer architecture achieves impressive simplification capabilities for expressions composed of handfuls of terms. Lengthier expressions are implemented in an additional embedding network, trained using contrastive learning, which isolates subexpressions that are more likely to simplify. The resulting framework is capable of reducing expressions with hundreds of terms - a regular occurrence in quantum field theory calculations - to vastly simpler equivalent expressions. Starting from lengthy input expressions, our networks can generate the Parke-Taylor formula for five-point gluon scattering, as well as new compact expressions for five-point amplitudes involving scalars and gravitons. An interactive demonstration can be found at https://spinorhelicity.streamlit.app .</description>

      <title>Triple Product Amplitude from Chiral String</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11732v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we proposed a worldsheet construction of a subset of triple product amplitudes proposed by Huang and Remmen (2022). We start with closed bosonic strings but left and right-moving momenta are not necessarily equal. Instead, they satisfy certain conditions. We called them section conditions. These conditions are generalizations of the section condition in double field theory. The vertex operators of chiral strings have nontrivial monodromy, so we interpret them as attached to the end of defects. In the calculation of the amplitude, we not only have to integrate over the moduli space, we also have to sum over different defect configurations. Unitarity and other consistency conditions for chiral string amplitudes are checked. We found the graviton amplitude, the Virasoro amplitude, and also a special kind of amplitude that has one infinite spin tower. Similar kinds of amplitude have appeared in bootstrap literature. The more general $N$-point amplitude could be obtained from a modified KLT relation. The five-point chiral string amplitude is also explicitly calculated.</description>

      <title>From Operator Product Expansion to Anomalous Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03283v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new method for computing renormalization functions, which is based on the ideas of operator product expansion and large momentum expansion. In this method, the renormalization $Z$-factors are determined by the ultraviolet finiteness of Wilson coefficients in the dimensional regularization scheme. The ultraviolet divergence is extracted solely from two-point functions at the large momentum limit. We develop this method in scalar field theories and provide a general framework for computing anomalous dimensions of field, mass, couplings and composite operators. In particular, it is applied to 6-dimensional cubic scalar theory and 4-dimensional quartic scalar theory. We demonstrate this method by computing the anomalous dimension of the $\phi^Q$ operator in cubic theory up to four loops for arbitrary $Q$, which is in agreement with the known result in the large $N$ limit. The idea of computing anomalous dimensions from operator production expansion is general and can be extended beyond scalar theories.</description>

      <title>Ginzburg-Landau description of a class of non-unitary minimal models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11714v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has been proposed that the Ginzburg-Landau description of the non-unitary conformal minimal model $M(3,8)$ is provided by the Euclidean theory of two real scalar fields with third-order interactions that have imaginary coefficients. The same lagrangian describes the non-unitary model $M(3,10)$, which is a product of two Yang-Lee theories $M(2,5)$, and the Renormalization Group flow from it to $M(3,8)$. This proposal has recently passed an important consistency check, due to T. Tanaka and Y. Nakayama, based on the anomaly matching for non-invertible topological lines. In this paper, we elaborate the earlier proposal and argue that the two-field theory describes the $D$ series modular invariants of both $M(3,8)$ and $M(3,10)$. We further propose the Ginzburg-Landau descriptions of the entire class of $D$ series minimal models $M(q, 3q-1)$ and $M(q, 3q+1)$, with odd integer $q$. They involve $PT$ symmetric theories of two scalar fields with interactions of order $q$ multiplied by imaginary coupling constants.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18812v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tensor networks provide a powerful tool for studying many-body quantum systems, particularly making quantum simulations more efficient. In this article, we construct a tensor network representation of the spin network states, which correspond to $SU(2)$ gauge-invariant discrete field theories. Importantly, the spin network states play a central role in the Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG) approach to the Planck scale physics. Our focus is on the Ising-type spin networks, which provide a basic model of quantum space in LQG. It is shown that the tensor network approach improves the previously introduced methods of constructing quantum circuits for the Ising spin networks by reducing the number of qubits involved. It is also shown that the tensor network approach is convenient for implementing holographic states involving the bulk-boundary conjecture, which contributes to establishing a link between LQG and holographic duality.</description>

      <title>Double Copy in AdS3 from Minitwistor Space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23342v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The double copy relates gravitational theories to the square of gauge theories. While it is well understood in flat backgrounds, its precise realisation around curved spacetimes remains an open question. In this paper, we construct a classical double copy for cohomology class representatives in the minitwistor space of hyperbolic spacetimes. We find that the realisation of a physical double copy requires that the masses of the different spinning fields are not equal, contrary to the flat space prescription. This leads to a position-space double copy for bulk-to-boundary propagators. We also show that in coordinate space, this implies the Cotton double copy for waves and warped black holes of Topologically Massive Gravity. We show that these are exact double copy relations by constructing their Kerr-Schild metrics and also analysing the Kerr-Schild double copy. Furthermore, we find that near the boundary the double copy relates the dual CFT currents.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00220v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Continuous symmetries of spacetime such as spatial homogeneity and isotropy are rigorously defined using the concept of isometries and Killing vectors. In supergravity, the metric, or rather the tetrad, is not a standalone entity, but is part of a multiplet containing also the Rarita-Schwinger spinor-vector. Thus, we pursue a generalization of the Killing equations that is in harmony with the tenets of supergravity. Using a superfield approach, we derive one such generalization of the Killing equations encompassing the whole supergravity multiplet. A relaxation of the spinor-vector equations is required to allow for a non-vanishing isotropic Rarita-Schwinger field.</description>

Abstract: In this letter, we consider effective field theories for light fields transforming under the fundamental or adjoint representation of a continuous group. We demonstrate that in the presence of gravity, crossing symmetry combined with two subtraction sum rules, leads to stringent constraints on the spectrum of its ultraviolet (UV) completion. Such constraints come in the form of necessary conditions on the symmetry group irreps of the UV states. This is in sharp contrast with non-gravitational theories where anything goes. Beautifully, the graviton pole is the anchor of our argument, not an obstruction. Using numerical methods, we also demonstrate that the massless spin-2 must be a singlet under said symmetry group.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05242v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a revision of the discrete symmetries (C, P, T, CP, and CPT), within an approach that treats 2-component Weyl spinors as the fundamental building blocks. Then, we discuss some salient aspects of the discrete symmetries within quantum field theory (QFT). Besides the generic discussion, we also consider aspects arising within specific renormalizable theories (such as QED and YM). As a new application of the chiral formulation, we discuss the discrete symmetries for the Rarita-Schwinger (RS) spin-$\frac{3}{2}$ field. For the sake of completeness, the elements of linearized gravity (LG) and RS theories are discussed, as they are fundamental to Supergravity (SUGRA). We also discuss the advantages of using the 2-component spinors as the basic building blocks for the formulation of CPT-violating QFTs. Following this formalism, we establish an extension of the general RS theory with terms that violate the Lorentz symmetry and/or CPT symmetry, as well as the one already established in LG.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05550v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We generalize the concept of holography for the color superconductivity (CSC) phase by considering $d$-dimensional Anti de Sitter (AdS) space instead of the traditional 6 dimensions. The corresponding dual field theory is a gauge theory with $SU(N_c)$ symmetry defined in $(d-1)$-dimensions that, despite lacking a confinement phase, retains characteristics consistent with quantum chromodynamics (QCD) CSC. We then use a holographic model based on Einstein-Maxwell gravity and the standard Maxwell interaction in $d$-dimensional AdS space to investigate this phenomenon for the number of colors $N_c\geq 2$ without confinement phase, identifying the dimensions where the model remains valid for $N_c = 2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08948v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we develop a generalisation of the thermal entropy to complex inverse temperatures, which we call the thermal pseudo-entropy. We show that this quantity represents the pseudo-entropy of the transition matrix between Thermofield Double states at different times. We have studied its properties in various quantum mechanical setups, Schwarzian theory, Random Matrix Theories, and 2D CFTs, including symmetric orbifolds. Our findings indicate a close relationship between the averaged thermal pseudo-entropy and the spectral form factor, which is instrumental in distinguishing chaotic and integrable models. Moreover, we have observed a logarithmic scaling of this quantity in models with a continuous spectrum, with a universal coefficient that is sensitive to the scaling of the density of states near the edge of the spectrum. Lastly, we found the connection between the real and imaginary parts of the thermal pseudo-entropy through the Kramers-Kronig relations.</description>

Abstract: We formulate fermionic versions, for any number of spatial dimensions, of the van der Waals and Casimir-Polder interactions, and study their properties. In both cases, the systems we introduce contain localized `atoms': two-level systems, coupled to a vacuum Dirac field. This Dirac field plays here a role akin to the electromagnetic field in the van der Waals case. In this context, bag-model conditions for the Dirac field serve as the analog of the 'mirror' in the Casimir-Polder effect.

      <title>Were you born in an aborted primordial black hole?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.09408v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a mechanism of electroweak baryogenesis based on the Standard Model and explaining the coincidence between the baryon and Dark Matter (DM) densities. Large curvature fluctuations slightly below the threshold for Primordial Black Hole (PBH) formation locally reheat the plasma above the sphaleron barrier when they collapse gravitationally, leading to regions with a maximal baryogenesis at the Quantum Chromodynamics epoch. Using numerical relativity simulations, we calculate the overdensity threshold for baryogenesis. If PBH significantly contribute to the DM, aborted PBHs can generate a baryon density and an averaged baryon-to-photon ratio consistent with observations.</description>

      <title>Field equations and Noether potentials for higher-order theories of gravity with Lagrangians involving $\Box^i R$, $\Box^i R_{\mu\nu}$ and $\Box^i R_{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17429v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we aim to perform a systematical investigation on the field equations and Noether potentials for the higher-order gravity theories endowed with Lagrangians depending on the metric and the Riemann curvature tensor, together with $i$th ($i=1,2,\cdot\cdot\cdot$) powers of the Beltrami-d'Alembertian operator $\Box$ acting on the latter. We start with a detailed derivation of the field equations and the Noether potential corresponding to the Lagrangian $\sqrt{-g}L_R(R,\Box R,\cdot\cdot\cdot,\Box^m R)$ through the direct variation of the Lagrangian and a method based upon the conserved current. Next the parallel analysis is extended to a more generic Lagrangian $\sqrt{-g}L_{\text{Ric}}(g^{\mu\nu}, R_{\mu\nu},\Box R_{\mu\nu}, \cdot\cdot\cdot,\Box^m R_{\mu\nu})$, as well as to the generalization of the Lagrangian $\sqrt{-g}L_{\text{Ric}}$, which depends on the metric $g^{\mu\nu}$, the Riemann tensor $R_{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}$ and $\Box^i R_{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}$s. Finally, all the results associated to the three types of Lagrangians are extended to the Lagrangian relying on an arbitrary tensor and the variables via $\Box^i$ acting on such a tensor. In particular, we take into consideration of equations of motion and Noether potentials for nonlocal gravity models. For Lagrangians involving the variables $\Box^i R$, $\Box^i R_{\mu\nu}$ and $\Box^i R_{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}$, our investigation provides their concrete Noether potentials and the field equations without the derivative of the Lagrangian density with respect to the metric. Besides, the Iyer-Wald potentials associated to these Lagrangians are also presented.</description>

      <title>Entanglement in flavored scalar scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13743v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate quantum entanglement in high-energy $2\to 2$ scalar scattering, where the scalars are characterized by an internal flavor quantum number acting like a qubit. Working at the 1-loop order in perturbation theory, we build the final-state density matrix as a function of the scattering amplitudes connecting the initial to the outgoing state. In this construction, the unitarity of the $S$-matrix is guaranteed at the required order by the optical theorem. We consider the post-scattering entanglement between the momentum and flavor degrees of freedom of the final-state particles, as well as the entanglement of the two-qubit flavor subsystem. In each case we identify the couplings of the scalar potential that can generate, destroy, or transfer entanglement between different bipartite subspaces of the Hilbert space.</description>

      <title>New insights into axion freeze-in</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01678v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Freeze-in via the axion-photon coupling, $g_{\phi\gamma}$, can produce axions in the early Universe. At low reheating temperatures close to the minimum allowed value $T_{\rm reh}\approx T_{\rm BBN}\approx 10\,{\rm MeV}$, the abundance peaks for axion masses $m_\phi\approx T_{\rm reh}$. Such heavy axions are unstable and subsequently decay, leading to strong constraints on $g_{\phi\gamma}$ from astrophysics and cosmology. In this work, we revisit the computation of the freeze-in abundance and clarify important issues. We begin with a complete computation of the collision terms for the Primakoff process, electron-positron annihilation, and photon-to-axion (inverse-)decay, while approximately taking into account plasma screening and threshold effects. We then solve the Boltzmann equation for the full axion distribution function. We confirm previous results about the importance of both processes to the effective "relic abundance" (defined as density prior to decay), and provide useful fitting formulae to estimate the freeze-in abundance from the equilibrium interaction rate. For the distribution function, we find an out-of-equilibrium population of axions and introduce an effective temperature for them. We follow the evolution right up until decay, and find that the average axion kinetic energy is larger than a thermal relic by between 20\% and 80\%, which may have implications for limits on decaying axions from X-ray spectra. We extend our study to a two-axion system with quartic cross-coupling, and find that for typical/expected couplings, freeze-in of a second axion flavour by annihilations leads to a negligibly small contribution to the relic density.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Skyrmions: from lumps to supercompactons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03941v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The magnetic Skyrmion is described by one control parameter and one length scale. We study the two extreme limits of the control parameter - infinitely large and vanishing - and find that the magnetic Skyrmion becomes a "restricted" magnetic Skyrmion and an O(3) sigma model lump, respectively. Depending on the potential under consideration, the restricted limit manifests differently. In the case of the Zeeman term, the restricted magnetic Skyrmion becomes a "supercompacton" that develops a discontinuity, whereas for the Zeeman term to the power 3/2 it becomes a normal compacton. In both the lump and the restricted limit the solution is given in exact explicit form. We observe that the case of the Zeeman term squared, which can also be understood as a special combination of the Zeeman term and the easy-plane potential - realizable in the laboratory, the analytically exact solution for all values of the coupling - including the Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) case - is also of the lump type. Finally, we notice that certain materials (e.g. Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_x$Si or Mn$_{1-x}$Fe$_x$Ge) have a rather large control parameter $\epsilon$ of order 100, making the restricted limit a suitable rough approximation.</description>

      <title>Scheme-independent determination of the QCD running coupling at all scales from jet observables using the Principle of Maximum Conformality/Infinity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08570v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new approach to determining the strong coupling $\alpha_s(Q)$, over the entire range of validity of perturbative QCD, for scales above $\Lambda_{\mathrm{QCD}}$ and up to the Planck scale $\sim1.22\cdot10^{19}$\,GeV, with the highest precision and using the data of a single experiment. In particular, we use the results obtained for the thrust ($T$) and $C$-parameter ($C$) distributions in $e^+e^-$ annihilation at a single annihilation energy $\sqrt{s}=M_Z$ (i.e.\ at the $Z^0$ peak). This new method is based on the \emph{intrinsic conformality} (iCF) and on the Infinite-Order Scale Setting, using the Principle of Maximum Conformality (i.e.\ the PMC$_\infty$), which allows a rigorous determination of the renormalization scales for the event-shape variable distributions satisfying all of the requirements of Renormalization Group Invariance, including renormalization-scheme independence and consistency with Abelian theory in the $N_C \to 0$ limit. This new method is based on the scale-invariance of the iCF, which allows determination of $\alpha_s(\mu_0)$ at any scale $\mu_0$, and on the Maximum Likelihood statistical approach. We introduce a novel approach to determining the best-fitting range based on the most-likely-lowest $\chi^2$ calculated considering all possible intervals among the entire range of bins available in the perturbative region. This new method improves the precision and leads to results that are statistically more reliable. In particular, we obtain the following results for the running coupling: $\alpha_s(M_Z)=0.1170^{+0.0012}_{-0.0010}$ from thrust and $\alpha_s(M_Z)=0.1181^{+0.0013}_{-0.0009}$ for $C$-parameter in the $\overline{\mathrm{MS}}$ scheme at NNLO...</description>

      <title>Entanglement of Disjoint Intervals in Dual-Unitary Circuits: Exact Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16750v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The growth of the entanglement between a disjoint subsystem and its complement after a quantum quench is regarded as a dynamical chaos indicator. Namely, it is expected to show qualitatively different behaviours depending on whether the underlying microscopic dynamics is chaotic or integrable. So far, however, this could only be verified in the context of conformal field theories. Here we present an exact confirmation of this expectation in a class of interacting microscopic Floquet systems on the lattice, i.e., dual-unitary circuits. These systems can either have zero or a super extensive number of conserved charges: the latter case is achieved via fine-tuning. We show that, for almost all dual unitary circuits the asymptotic entanglement dynamics agrees with what is expected for chaotic systems. On the other hand, if we require the systems to have conserved charges, we find that the entanglement displays the qualitatively different behaviour expected for integrable systems. Interestingly, despite having many conserved charges, charge-conserving dual-unitary circuits are in general not Yang-Baxter integrable.</description>

      <title>Quantum Noise Analysis of Gravitational Waves via Numerical Iterations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04562v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Detections of gravitational waves since GW150914 has gained renewed interest in a quantum-classical correspondence between GWs and the hypothetical graviton. While a complete quantum theory of gravity remains elusive, massless gravitons in a 3+1 spacetime are often modeled as the quantum noise underlying GWs and between two gravitational masses. This study treats a coalescing binary heuristically as a rotating and contracting Gaussian volume, modeling the gravitons composing the gravitational bulk as an effectively thermal gas. Applying the Einstein-Langevin equation to the coalescing binary system, a relation is established where quanta dissipation scales directly with the third power of osculating eccentricity and inversely with the contracting volume. Numerical analysis employs an Euler iteration scheme to simulate gravitonic Brownian motion throughout binary coalescence. The resulting noise signals exhibit characteristics resembling macroscopic gravitational waveforms. Reproducible coding implementations in Wolfram Mathematica are provided, with equivalent Python commands included in the appendix.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of the scalar field potential in non-metricity gravity through Gaussian processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00051v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The accelerated expansion of the universe has been widely confirmed, posing challenges to the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, particularly the cosmological coincidence problem. This has motivated the exploration of modified gravity theories, including non-metricity gravity, which explains cosmic acceleration without dark energy. In this work, we incorporate a quintessence scalar field into the non-metricity framework to model both inflation and late-time acceleration. Employing the Gaussian process method with a square exponential kernel, we reconstruct the scalar field potential, $V(\phi)$, from observational Hubble data sets coming from cosmic chronometers (CC) as well as from the method of radial baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) in a model-independent approach. This approach allows us to obtain a suitable quintessence scalar field model that aligns with the observational Hubble data under the framework of power-law non-metricity gravity. Additionally, we compare our reconstructed potential with power-law scalar field potentials, revealing that these models show better agreement with the observational data, providing new insights into the dynamics of the universe. In contrast, we find that the early dark energy has minimal effect on the present-time accelerated expansion of the universe.</description>

      <title>Helicity amplitudes in massless QED to higher orders in the dimensional regulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07063v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analytically calculate one- and two-loop helicity amplitudes in massless QED, by adopting a four-dimensional tensor decomposition. We draw our attention to four-fermion and Compton scattering processes to higher orders in the dimensional regulator, as required for theoretical predictions at N$^3$LO. We organise loop amplitudes by proposing an efficient algorithm at integrand level to group Feynman graphs into integral families. We study the singular structure of these amplitudes and discuss the correspondence between QED and QCD processes. We present our results in terms of generalised polylogarithms up to transcendental weight six.</description>
