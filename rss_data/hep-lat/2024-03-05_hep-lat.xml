      <title>Nonperturbative Collins-Soper Kernel from Chiral Quarks with Physical Masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a lattice QCD calculation of the rapidity anomalous dimension of quark transverse-momentum-dependent distributions, i.e., the Collins-Soper (CS) kernel, up to transverse separations of about 1 fm. This unitary lattice calculation is conducted, for the first time, employing the chiral-symmetry-preserving domain wall fermion discretization and physical values of light and strange quark masses. The CS kernel is extracted from the ratios of pion quasi-transverse-momentum-dependent wave functions (quasi-TMDWFs) at next-to-leading logarithmic perturbative accuracy. Also for the first time, we utilize the recently proposed Coulomb-gauge-fixed quasi-TMDWF correlator without a Wilson line. We observe significantly slower signal decay with increasing quark separations compared to the established gauge-invariant method with a staple-shaped Wilson line. This enables us to determine the CS kernel at large nonperturbative transverse separations and find its near-linear dependence on the latter. Our result is consistent with the recent lattice calculation using gauge-invariant quasi-TMDWFs, and agrees with various recent phenomenological parametrizations of experimental data.</description>

      <title>Multi-particle interpolating operators in quantum field theories with cubic symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerical studies of lattice quantum field theories are conducted in finite spatial volumes, typically with cubic symmetry in the spatial coordinates. Motivated by these studies, this work presents a general algorithm to construct multi-particle interpolating operators for quantum field theories with cubic symmetry. The algorithm automates the block diagonalization required to combine multiple operators of definite linear momentum into irreducible representations of the appropriate little group. Examples are given for distinguishable and indistinguishable particles including cases with both zero and non-zero spin. An implementation of the algorithm is publicly available at https://github.com/latticeqcdtools/mhi.</description>

      <title>The quark-mass dependence of the potential energy between static colour sources in the QCD vacuum with light and strange quarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The low-lying energy spectrum of the static-colour-source-anti-source system in a vacuum containing light and strange quarks is computed using lattice QCD for a range of different light quark masses. The resulting levels are described using a simple model Hamiltonian and the parameters in this model are extrapolated to the physical light-quark masses. In this framework, the QCD string tension is found to be $\sqrt{\sigma}=445(3)_{\rm stat}(6)_{\rm sys}$ MeV.</description>

      <title>Pseudoscalar Mesons and Emergent Mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite its role in the continuing evolution of the Universe, only a small fraction of the mass of visible material can be attributed to the Higgs boson alone. The overwhelmingly dominant share may/should arise from the strong interactions that act in the heart of nuclear matter; namely, those described by quantum chromodynamics. This contribution describes how studying and explaining the attributes of pseudoscalar mesons can open an insightful window onto understanding the origin of mass in the Standard Model and how these insights inform our knowledge of hadron structure. The survey ranges over distribution amplitudes and functions, electromagnetic and gravitational form factors, light-front wave functions, and generalized parton distributions. Advances made using continuum Schwinger function methods and their relevance for experimental efforts are highlighted.</description>

      <title>The QCD theta-parameter in canonical quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The role of the QCD theta-parameter is investigated in pure Yang-Mills theory in the spacetime given by the four-dimensional Euclidean torus. While in this setting the introduction of possibly unphysical boundary conditions is avoided, it must be specified how the sum over the topological sectors is to be carried out. To connect with observables in real time, we perceive the partition function as the trace over the canonical density matrix. The system then corresponds to one of a finite temperature on a spatial three-torus. Carrying out the trace operation requires canonical quantization and gauge fixing. Fixing the gauge and demanding that the Hermiticity of the Hamiltonian is maintained leads to a restriction of the Hilbert space of physical wave functionals that generalizes the constraints derived from imposing Gauss' law. Consequently, we find that the states in the Hilbert space are properly normalizable under an inner product that integrates over each physical configuration represented by the gauge potential one time and one time only. The observables derived from the constrained Hilbert space do not violate charge-parity symmetry. We note that an exact hidden symmetry of the theory that is present for arbitrary values of theta in the Hamiltonian is effectively promoted to parity conservation in this constrained space. These results, derived on a torus in order to avoid the introduction of boundary conditions, also carry over to Minkowski spacetime when taking account of all possible gauge transformations.</description>

      <title>Scalar field Restricted Boltzmann Machine as an ultraviolet regulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.15002v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) are well-known tools used in Machine Learning to learn probability distribution functions from data. We analyse RBMs with scalar fields on the nodes from the perspective of lattice field theory. Starting with the simplest case of Gaussian fields, we show that the RBM acts as an ultraviolet regulator, with the cutoff determined by either the number of hidden nodes or a model mass parameter. We verify these ideas in the scalar field case, where the target distribution is known, and explore implications for cases where it is not known using the MNIST data set. We also demonstrate that infrared modes are learnt quickest.</description>

      <title>Efficient vacuum state preparation for quantum simulation of strongly interacting local quantum field theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19229v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an efficient approach for preparing ground states in the context of strongly interacting local quantum field theories on quantum computers. The approach produces the vacuum state in a time proportional to the square-root of the volume, which is a square-root improvement in speed compared to traditional approaches. The approach exploits a novel method for traversing the path in parameter space in which the resources scale linearly with a path length suitably defined in parameter space. Errors due to practical limitations are controlled and do not exhibit secular growth along the path. The final accuracy can be arbitrarily improved with an additive cost, which is independent of the volume and grows slower than logarithmically with the overlap between the state produced and the exact ground state. We expect that the method could potentially hold practical value not only within the realm of quantum field theories but also in addressing other challenges involving long path lengths.</description>

      <title>Exploring Composite Dark Matter with an SU(4) gauge theory with 1 fermion flavor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07362v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Several SU(N) gauge theories have been explored as candidates for producing stable dark matter particles that can explain their relative abundance, while also evading current constraints from direct, indirect and collider searches. In this talk, I will present the confinement and spectral properties of a new model we name "Hyper Stealth Dark Matter", which involves an SU(4) gauge theory with 1 quark flavor. The lightest baryon in this theory can be a potential dark matter candidate as it is protected from decay and hence can evade detection with a mass of just a few GeV. Existence of a first order confinement transition would open the possibility of potential detection of gravitational waves from such a transition at future observatories.</description>

      <title>The five-point bootstrap</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.08914v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study five-point correlation functions of scalar operators in d-dimensional conformal field theories. We develop a new approach to computing the five-point conformal blocks for exchanged primary operators of arbitrary spin by introducing a generalization of radial coordinates, using an appropriate ansatz, and perturbatively solving two quadratic Casimir differential equations. We then study five-point correlators $\langle \sigma \sigma \epsilon \sigma \sigma \rangle$ in the critical 3d Ising model. We truncate the operator product expansions (OPEs) in the correlator by including a finite number of primary operators with conformal dimension below a cutoff $\Delta \leqslant \Delta_{\rm cutoff}$. We then compute several OPE coefficients involving $\epsilon$ and two spinning operators by demanding that the truncated correlator approximately satisfies the crossing relation.</description>

      <title>A unified description of DGLAP, CSS, and BFKL: TMD factorization bridging large and small x</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16402v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a transverse-momentum dependent (TMD) factorization scheme designed to unify both large and small Bjorken-x regimes. We compute the next-to-leading order (NLO) quantum chromodynamics (QCD) corrections to the gluon TMD operator for an unpolarized hadron within this proposed scheme. This leads to the emergence of a new TMD evolution, incorporating those in transverse momentum, rapidity, and Bjorken-x. When matched to the collinear factorization scheme, our factorization scheme faithfully reproduces the well-established Dokshitzer-Gribov-Lipatov-Altarelli-Parisi (DGLAP) and Collins-Soper-Sterman (CSS) evolutions. Conversely, matching with high-energy factorization not only yields the Balitsky-Fadin-Kuraev-Lipatov (BFKL) evolution but also reveals distinctive signatures of CSS logarithms. The development of this novel TMD factorization scheme, capable of seamlessly reconciling disparate Bjorken-x regimes and faithfully reproducing established QCD evolution equations, has the potential to significantly advance our comprehension of high-energy processes and three-dimensional parton structures of hadrons.</description>

      <title>Improving the five-point bootstrap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13344v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new algorithm for the numerical evaluation of five-point conformal blocks in $d$-dimensions, greatly improving the efficiency of their computation. To do this we use an appropriate ansatz for the blocks as a series expansion in radial coordinates, derive a set of recursion relations for the unknown coefficients in the ansatz, and evaluate the series using a Pad\'e approximant to accelerate its convergence. We then study the $\langle\sigma\sigma\epsilon\sigma\sigma\rangle$ correlator in the 3d critical Ising model by truncating the operator product expansion (OPE) and only including operators with conformal dimension below a cutoff $\Delta\leqslant \Delta_{\rm cutoff}$. We approximate the contributions of the operators above the cutoff by the corresponding contributions in a suitable disconnected five-point correlator. Using this approach, we compute a number of OPE coefficients with greater accuracy than previous methods.</description>
