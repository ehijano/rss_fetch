      <title>Extending Robinson Spaces: Complexity and Algorithmic Solutions for Non-Symmetric Dissimilarity Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we extend the concept of Robinson spaces to asymmetric dissimilarities, enhancing their applicability in representing and analyzing complex data. Within this generalized framework, we introduce two different problems that extend the classical seriation problem: an optimization problem and a decision problem. We establish that these problems are NP-hard and NP-complete, respectively. Despite this complexity results, we identify several non-trivial instances where these problems can be solved in polynomial time, providing valuable insights into their tractability.</description>

      <title>Dudeney's Dissection is Optimal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 1907, Henry Ernest Dudeney posed a puzzle: ``cut any equilateral triangle \dots\ into as few pieces as possible that will fit together and form a perfect square'' (without overlap, via translation and rotation). Four weeks later, Dudeney demonstrated a beautiful four-piece solution, which today remains perhaps the most famous example of a dissection. In this paper (over a century later), we finally solve Dudeney's puzzle, by proving that the equilateral triangle and square have no common dissection with three or fewer polygonal pieces. We reduce the problem to the analysis of a discrete graph structure representing the correspondence between the edges and vertices of the pieces forming each polygon, using ideas from common unfolding.</description>

      <title>Robust Contraction Decomposition for Minor-Free Graphs and its Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a robust contraction decomposition theorem for $H$-minor-free graphs, which states that given an $H$-minor-free graph $G$ and an integer $p$, one can partition in polynomial time the vertices of $G$ into $p$ sets $Z_1,\dots,Z_p$ such that $\operatorname{tw}(G/(Z_i \setminus Z')) = O(p + |Z'|)$ for all $i \in [p]$ and $Z' \subseteq Z_i$. Here, $\operatorname{tw}(\cdot)$ denotes the treewidth of a graph and $G/(Z_i \setminus Z')$ denotes the graph obtained from $G$ by contracting all edges with both endpoints in $Z_i \setminus Z'$.
  Our result generalizes earlier results by Klein [SICOMP 2008] and Demaine et al. [STOC 2011] based on partitioning $E(G)$, and some recent theorems for planar graphs by Marx et al. [SODA 2022], for bounded-genus graphs (more generally, almost-embeddable graphs) by Bandyapadhyay et al. [SODA 2022], and for unit-disk graphs by Bandyapadhyay et al. [SoCG 2022].
  The robust contraction decomposition theorem directly results in parameterized algorithms with running time $2^{\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{k})} \cdot n^{O(1)}$ or $n^{O(\sqrt{k})}$ for every vertex/edge deletion problems on $H$-minor-free graphs that can be formulated as Permutation CSP Deletion or 2-Conn Permutation CSP Deletion. Consequently, we obtain the first subexponential-time parameterized algorithms for Subset Feedback Vertex Set, Subset Odd Cycle Transversal, Subset Group Feedback Vertex Set, 2-Conn Component Order Connectivity on $H$-minor-free graphs. For other problems which already have subexponential-time parameterized algorithms on $H$-minor-free graphs (e.g., Odd Cycle Transversal, Vertex Multiway Cut, Vertex Multicut, etc.), our theorem gives much simpler algorithms of the same running time.</description>

      <title>WalkSAT is linear on random 2-SAT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In an influential article Papadimitriou [FOCS 1991] proved that a local search algorithm called WalkSAT finds a satisfying assignment of a satisfiable 2-CNF with $n$ variables in $O(n^2)$ expected time. Variants of the WalkSAT algorithm have become a mainstay of practical SAT solving (e.g., [Hoos and St\"utzle 2000]). In the present article we analyse the expected running time of WalkSAT on random 2-SAT instances. Answering a question raised by Alekhnovich and Ben-Sasson [SICOMP 2007], we show that WalkSAT runs in linear expected time for all clause/variable densities up to the random 2-SAT satisfiability threshold.</description>

      <title>On de Bruijn Rings and Families of Almost Perfect Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03309v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: De Bruijn tori, or perfect maps, are two-dimensional periodic arrays of letters from a finite alphabet, where each possible pattern of shape (m,n) appears exactly once in a single period. While the existence of certain de Bruijn tori, such as square tori with odd m=n element {3,5,7} and even alphabet sizes, remains unresolved, sub-perfect maps are often sufficient in applications like positional coding. These maps capture a large number of patterns, with each appearing at most once. While previous methods for generating such sub-perfect maps cover only a fraction of the possible patterns, we present a construction method for generating almost perfect maps for arbitrary pattern shapes and arbitrary non-prime alphabet sizes, including the above mentioned square tori with odd m=n element {3,5,7} as long that the alphabet size is non-prime. This is achieved through the introduction of de Bruijn rings, a minimal-height sub-perfect map and a formalization of the concept of families of almost perfect maps. The generated sub-perfect maps are easily decodable which makes them perfectly suitable for positional coding applications.</description>

      <title>Near optimal bounds for weak and strong spatial mixing for the anti-ferromagnetic Potts model on trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.04338v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the anti-ferromagnetic Potts model on trees exhibits strong spatial mixing for a near-optimal range of parameters. Our work complements recent results of Chen, Liu, Mani, and Moitra [arXiv.2304.01954] who showed this to be true in the infinite temperature setting, corresponding to uniform proper colorings. We furthermore prove weak spatial mixing results complementing results in [arXiv.2304.01954].</description>

      <title>On the Formation of Steady Coalitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05087v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the formation of the grand coalition of a cooperative game by investigating its possible internal dynamics. Each coalition is capable of forcing all players to reconsider the current state of the game when it does not provide sufficient payoff. Different coalitions may ask for contradictory evolutions, leading to the impossibility of the grand coalition forming. In this paper, we give a characterization of the impossibility, for a given state, of finding a new state dominating the previous one such that each aggrieved coalition has a satisfactory payoff. To do so, we develop new polyhedral tools related to a new family of polyhedra, appearing in numerous situations in cooperative game theory.</description>

      <title>Guaranteed Bounds on Posterior Distributions of Discrete Probabilistic Programs with Loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10393v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of bounding the posterior distribution of discrete probabilistic programs with unbounded support, loops, and conditioning. Loops pose the main difficulty in this setting: even if exact Bayesian inference is possible, the state of the art requires user-provided loop invariant templates. By contrast, we aim to find guaranteed bounds, which sandwich the true distribution. They are fully automated, applicable to more programs and provide more provable guarantees than approximate sampling-based inference. Since lower bounds can be obtained by unrolling loops, the main challenge is upper bounds, and we attack it in two ways. The first is called residual mass semantics, which is a flat bound based on the residual probability mass of a loop. The approach is simple, efficient, and has provable guarantees.
  The main novelty of our work is the second approach, called geometric bound semantics. It operates on a novel family of distributions, called eventually geometric distributions (EGDs), and can bound the distribution of loops with a new form of loop invariants called contraction invariants. The invariant synthesis problem reduces to a system of polynomial inequality constraints, which is a decidable problem with automated solvers. If a solution exists, it yields an exponentially decreasing bound on the whole distribution, and can therefore bound moments and tail asymptotics as well, not just probabilities as in the first approach.
  Both semantics enjoy desirable theoretical properties. In particular, we prove soundness and convergence, i.e. the bounds converge to the exact posterior as loops are unrolled further. On the practical side, we describe Diabolo, a fully-automated implementation of both semantics, and evaluate them on a variety of benchmarks from the literature, demonstrating their general applicability and the utility of the resulting bounds.</description>
