      <title>Optimal Bundling and Dominance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The optimal bundling problem is the design of bundles (and prices) that maximize the expected virtual surplus, constrained by individual rationality and incentive compatibility. I focus on a relaxed, constraint-free problem that maximizes the expected virtual surplus with deterministic allocations. I show that when the difference of two virtual value functions for any pair of stochastic bundles is single-crossing, the minimal optimal menu for the relaxed problem is the set of all undominated bundles, where dominance refers to the natural comparison of virtual values across the type space. Under single-crossing differences, this comparison simplifies to comparisons on boundary types, enabling an algorithm to generate the minimal optimal menu. I further show that when the difference of two virtual value functions for any pair of stochastic bundles is monotonic, there exists an endogenous order among deterministic bundles. This order justifies that the minimal optimal menu for the relaxed problem is also optimal for the nonrelaxed problem. I also characterize the conditions under which consumers' valuation functions and distributions allow the virtual value functions to exhibit monotonic differences. This characterization, combined with the dominance notion, solves related bundling problems such as distributional robustness, bundling with additive values, and the optimality of pure, nested, and relatively novel, singleton-bundle menus. As a side result, I discover new properties of single crossing and monotonic differences in convex environments.</description>

      <title>NDAI Agreements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a fundamental challenge in the economics of innovation: an inventor must reveal details of a new idea to secure compensation or funding, yet such disclosure risks expropriation. We present a model in which a seller (inventor) and buyer (investor) bargain over an information good under the threat of hold-up. In the classical setting, the seller withholds disclosure to avoid misappropriation, leading to inefficiency. We show that trusted execution environments (TEEs) combined with AI agents can mitigate and even fully eliminate this hold-up problem. By delegating the disclosure and payment decisions to tamper-proof programs, the seller can safely reveal the invention without risking expropriation, achieving full disclosure and an efficient ex post transfer. Moreover, even if the invention's value exceeds a threshold that TEEs can fully secure, partial disclosure still improves outcomes compared to no disclosure. Recognizing that real AI agents are imperfect, we model "agent errors" in payments or disclosures and demonstrate that budget caps and acceptance thresholds suffice to preserve most of the efficiency gains.
  Our results imply that cryptographic or hardware-based solutions can function as an "ironclad NDA," substantially mitigating the fundamental disclosure-appropriation paradox first identified by Arrow (1962) and Nelson (1959). This has far-reaching policy implications for fostering R&amp;D, technology transfer, and collaboration.</description>

      <title>A shared-revenue Bertrand game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and analyze a variation of the Bertrand game in which the revenue is shared between two players. This game models situations in which one economic agent can provide goods/services to consumers either directly or through an independent seller/contractor in return for a share of the revenue. We analyze the equilibria of this game, and show how they can predict different business outcomes as a function of the players' costs and the transferred revenue shares. Importantly, we identify game parameters for which independent sellers can simultaneously increase the original player's payoff while increasing consumer surplus. We then extend the shared-revenue Bertrand game by considering the shared revenue proportion as an action and giving the independent seller an outside option to sell elsewhere. This work constitutes a first step towards a general theory for how partnership and sharing of resources between economic agents can lead to more efficient markets and improve the outcomes of both agents as well as consumers.</description>

      <title>Optimal Pricing of Cloud Services: Committed Spend under Demand Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a seller who offers services to a buyer with multi-unit demand. Prior to the realization of demand, the buyer receives a noisy signal of their future demand, and the seller can design contracts based on the reported value of this signal. Thus, the buyer can contract with the service provider for an unknown level of future consumption, such as in the market for cloud computing resources or software services. We characterize the optimal dynamic contract, extending the classic sequential screening framework to a nonlinear and multi-unit setting. The optimal mechanism gives discounts to buyers who report higher signals, but in exchange they must provide larger fixed payments. We then describe how the optimal mechanism can be implemented by two common forms of contracts observed in practice, the two-part tariff and the committed spend contract. Finally, we use extensions of our base model to shed light on policy-focused questions, such as analyzing how the optimal contract changes when the buyer faces commitment costs, or when there are liquid spot markets.</description>

      <title>Sabotage and Free Riding in Contests with a Group-Specific Public-Good/Bad Prize</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study contests in which two groups compete to win (or not to win) a group-specific public-good/bad prize. Each player in the groups can exert two types of effort: one to help her own group win the prize, and one to sabotage her own group's chances of winning it. The players in the groups choose their effort levels simultaneously and independently. We introduce a specific form of contest success function that determines each group's probability of winning the prize, taking into account players' sabotage activities. We show that two types of purestrategy Nash equilibrium occur, depending on parameter values: one without sabotage activities and one with sabotage activities. In the first type, only the highest-valuation player in each group expends positive effort, whereas, in the second type, only the lowest-valuation player in each group expends positive effort.</description>

      <title>Renegotiation-Proof Cheap Talk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An informed Advisor and an uninformed Decision-Maker engage in repeated cheap talk communication in always new (stochastically independent) decision problems. They have a conflict of interest over which action should be implemented at least in some cases. Our main result is that, while the Decision-Maker's optimal payoff is attainable in some subgame perfect equilibrium (by force of the usual folk theorem), no payoff profile close to the Decision-Maker's optimal one is immune to renegotiation. Pareto efficient renegotiation-proof equilibria are typically attainable, and they entail a compromise between the Advisor and the Decision-Maker. This could take the form of the Advisor being truthful and the Decision-Maker not utilizing this information to their own full advantage, or the Advisor being somewhat liberal with the truth and the Decision-Maker, while fully aware of this, pretending to believe the Advisor.</description>

      <title>Equitable Auction Design: With and Without Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a mechanism design problem where a seller aims to allocate a good to multiple bidders, each with a private value. The seller supports or favors a specific group, referred to as the minority group. Specifically, the seller requires that allocations to the minority group are at least a predetermined fraction (equity level) of those made to the rest of the bidders. Such constraints arise in various settings, including government procurement and corporate supply chain policies that prioritize small businesses, environmentally responsible suppliers, or enterprises owned by historically disadvantaged individuals. We analyze two variants of this problem: stochastic mechanism design, which assumes bidders' values follow a known distribution and seeks to maximize expected revenue, and regret-based mechanism design, which makes no distributional assumptions and aims to minimize the worst-case regret. We characterize a closed-form optimal stochastic mechanism and propose a closed-form regret-based mechanism, and establish that the ex-post regret under the latter is at most a constant multiple (dependent on the equity level) of the optimal worst-case regret. We further quantify that this approximation constant is at most 1.31 across different equity levels. Both mechanisms can be interpreted as set-asides, a common policy tool that reserves a fraction of goods for minority groups. Furthermore, numerical results demonstrate that the stochastic mechanism performs well when the bidders' value distribution is accurately estimated, while the regret-based mechanism exhibits greater robustness under estimation errors.</description>

      <title>Mechanism Design in Max-Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies allocation mechanisms in max-flow games with players' capacities as private information. We first show that no core-selection mechanism is truthful: there may exist a player whose payoff increases if she under-reports her capacity when a core-section mechanism is adopted. We then introduce five desirable properties for mechanisms in max-flow games: DSIC (truthful reporting is a dominant strategy), SIR (individual rationality and positive payoff for each player contributing positively to at least one coalition), SP (no edge has an incentive to split into parallel edges), MP (no parallel edges have incentives to merge), and CM (a player's payoff does not decrease as another player's capacity and max-flow increase). While the Shapley value mechanism satisfies DSIC and SIR, it fails to meet SP, MP and CM. We propose a new mechanism based on minimal cuts that satisfies all five properties.</description>

      <title>Non-Monetary Mechanism Design without Distributional Information: Using Scarce Audits Wisely</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a repeated resource allocation problem with strategic agents where monetary transfers are disallowed and the central planner has no prior information on agents' utility distributions. In light of Arrow's impossibility theorem, acquiring information about agent preferences through some form of feedback is necessary. We assume that the central planner can request powerful but expensive audits on the winner in any round, revealing the true utility of the winner in that round. We design a mechanism achieving $T$-independent $O(K^2)$ regret in social welfare while requesting $O(K^3 \log T)$ audits in expectation, where $K$ is the number of agents and $T$ is the number of rounds. We also show an $\Omega(K)$ lower bound on the regret and an $\Omega(1)$ lower bound on the number of audits when having low regret. Algorithmically, we show that incentive-compatibility can be mostly enforced with an accurate estimation of the winning probability of each agent under truthful reporting. To do so, we impose future punishments and introduce a *flagging* component, allowing agents to flag any biased estimate (we show that doing so aligns with individual incentives). On the technical side, without monetary transfers and distributional information, the central planner cannot ensure that truthful reporting is exactly an equilibrium. Instead, we characterize the equilibrium via a reduction to a simpler *auxiliary game*, in which agents cannot strategize until late in the $T$ rounds of the allocation problem. The tools developed therein may be of independent interest for other mechanism design problems in which the revelation principle cannot be readily applied.</description>

      <title>Learning in Markets with Heterogeneous Agents: Dynamics and Survival of Bayesian vs. No-Regret Learners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the performance of heterogeneous learning agents in asset markets with stochastic payoffs. Our agents aim to maximize the expected growth rate of their wealth but have different theories on how to learn this best. We focus on comparing Bayesian and no-regret learners in market dynamics. Bayesian learners with a prior over a finite set of models that assign positive prior probability to the correct model have posterior probabilities that converge exponentially to the correct model. Consequently, they survive even in the presence of agents who invest according to the correct model of the stochastic process. Bayesians with a continuum prior converge to the correct model at a rate of $O((\log T)/T)$. Online learning theory provides no-regret algorithms for maximizing the log of wealth in this setting, achieving a worst-case regret bound of $O(\log T)$ without assuming a steady underlying stochastic process but comparing to the best fixed investment rule. This regret, as we observe, is of the same order of magnitude as that of a Bayesian learner with a continuum prior. However, we show that even such low regret may not be sufficient for survival in asset markets: an agent can have regret as low as $O(\log T)$, but still vanish in market dynamics when competing against agents who invest according to the correct model or even against a perfect Bayesian with a finite prior. On the other hand, we show that Bayesian learning is fragile, while no-regret learning requires less knowledge of the environment and is therefore more robust. Any no-regret learner will drive out of the market an imperfect Bayesian whose finite prior or update rule has even small errors. We formally establish the relationship between notions of survival, vanishing, and market domination studied in economics and the framework of regret minimization, thus bridging these theories.</description>

      <title>The effect of competition in contests: A unifying approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04970v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study how increasing competition, by making prizes more unequal, affects effort in contests. In a finite type-space environment, we characterize the equilibrium, analyze the effect of competition under linear costs, and identify conditions under which these effects persist under general costs. Our findings reveal that competition may encourage or deter effort, depending on the relative likelihood of efficient versus inefficient types. We derive implications for the classical budget allocation problem and establish that the most competitive winner-takes-all contest is robustly optimal under linear and concave costs, thereby resolving an open question. Methodologically, our analysis of the finite type-space domain -- which includes complete information as a special case and can approximate any continuum type-space -- provides a unifying approach that sheds light on the contrasting results in these extensively studied environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02686v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider a university administrator who must assign students to both courses and dorms, and runs (random) serial dictatorship independently in each market. While serial dictatorship is efficient for each individual matching problem holding the other fixed, Pareto improvements can be found via students jointly trading their allocated course and dorm. To resolve this problem, we introduce paired serial dictatorship where students report relative preferences between courses and dorms that then influence their priority in either market. By aligning allocation priorities with students' relative preferences, paired serial dictatorship improves welfare compared to independently running serial dictatorship in each market. Any deterministic allocation that arises in equilibrium is furthermore Pareto efficient, pointing towards randomization as the key barrier to optimality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.18138v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a Bayesian persuasion game where a sender wants to persuade a receiver to take a binary action, such as purchasing a product. The sender is informed about the (real-valued) state of the world, such as the quality of the product, but only has limited information about the receiver's beliefs and utilities. Motivated by customer surveys, user studies, and recent advances in AI, we allow the sender to learn more about the receiver by querying an oracle that simulates the receiver's behavior. After a fixed number of queries, the sender commits to a messaging policy and the receiver takes the action that maximizes her expected utility given the message she receives. We characterize the sender's optimal messaging policy given any distribution over receiver types. We then design a polynomial-time querying algorithm that optimizes the sender's expected utility in this game. We also consider approximate oracles, more general query structures, and costly queries.</description>

      <title>Single-token vs Two-token Blockchain Tokenomics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15429v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study long-term equilibria that arise in the token monetary policy, or tokenomics, design of proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain systems that engage utility maximizing users and validators. Validators are system maintainers who get rewarded with tokens for performing the work necessary for the system to function properly, while users compete and pay with such tokens for getting a desired portion of the system service.
  We study how the system service provision and suitable rewards schemes together can lead to equilibria with the following desirable characteristics (1) viability: the system keeps parties engaged,
  (2) decentralization and skin-in-the-game: multiple sufficiently invested validators are participating,
  (3) stability: the price path of the underlying token used to transact with the system does not change widely over time, and
  (4) feasibility: the mechanism is easy to implement as a smart contract, e.g., it does not require a fiat reserve on-chain to perform token {\em buybacks} or to perform bookkeeping of exponentially growing token holdings.
  Our analysis enables us to put forward a novel generic mechanism for blockchain monetary policy that we call quantitative rewarding (QR). We investigate how to implement QR in single-token and two-token proof of stake (PoS) blockchain systems. The latter are systems that utilize one token for the users to pay the transaction fees and a different token for the validators to participate in the PoS protocol and get rewarded. Our approach demonstrates a concrete advantage of the two-token setting in terms of the ability of the QR mechanism to be realized effectively and provide good equilibria. Our analysis also reveals an inherent limitation of the single token setting in terms of implementing an effective blockchain monetary policy - a distinction that is, to the best of our knowledge, highlighted for the first time.</description>

      <title>Quantum Advantage in Trading: A Game-Theoretic Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17189v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum games, like quantum algorithms, exploit quantum entanglement to establish strong correlations between strategic player actions. This paper introduces quantum game-theoretic models applied to trading and demonstrates their implementation on an ion-trap quantum computer. The results showcase a quantum advantage, previously known only theoretically, realized as higher-paying market Nash equilibria. This advantage could help uncover alpha in trading strategies, defined as excess returns compared to established benchmarks.
