      <title>Construct accurate multi-continuum micromorphic homogenisations in multi-D space-time with computer algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Homogenisation empowers the efficient macroscale system level prediction of physical problems with intricate microscale structures. Here we develop an innovative powerful, rigorous and flexible framework for asymptotic homogenisation of dynamics at the finite scale separation of real physics, with proven results underpinned by modern dynamical systems theory. The novel systematic approach removes most of the usual assumptions, whether implicit or explicit, of other methodologies. By no longer assuming averages the methodology constructs so-called multi-continuum or micromorphic homogenisations systematically based upon the microscale physics. The developed framework and approach enables a user to straightforwardly choose and create such homogenisations with clear physical and theoretical support, and of highly controllable accuracy and fidelity.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Model Reduction to Random Spectral Submanifolds in Random Vibrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamical systems in engineering and physics are often subject to irregular excitations that are best modeled as random. Monte Carlo simulations are routinely performed on such random models to obtain statistics on their long-term response. Such simulations, however, are prohibitively expensive and time consuming for high-dimensional nonlinear systems. Here we propose to decrease this numerical burden significantly by reducing the full system to very low-dimensional, attracting, random invariant manifolds in its phase space and performing the Monte Carlo simulations on that reduced dynamical system. The random spectral submanifolds (SSMs) we construct for this purpose generalize the concept of SSMs from deterministic systems under uniformly bounded random forcing. We illustrate the accuracy and speed of random SSM reduction by computing the SSM-reduced power spectral density of the randomly forced mechanical systems that range from simple oscillator chains to finite-element models of beams and plates.</description>

      <title>U-Gibbs measure rigidity for partially hyperbolic endomorphisms on surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that, for a $C^2$ partially hyperbolic endomorphism of the 2-torus which is strongly transitive, given an ergodic $u$-Gibbs measure that has positive center Lyapunov exponent and has full support, then either the map is special (has only one unstable direction per point), or the measure is the unique absolutely continuous invariant measure. We can apply this result in many settings, in particular obtaining uniqueness of $u$-Gibbs measures for every non-special perturbation of irreducible linear expanding maps of the torus with simple spectrum. This gives new open sets of partially hyperbolic systems displaying a unique $u$-Gibbs measure.</description>

      <title>A network aggregation model for the dynamics and treatment of neurodegenerative diseases at the brain scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neurodegenerative diseases are associated with the assembly of specific proteins into oligomers and fibrillar aggregates. At the brain scale, these protein assemblies can diffuse through the brain and seed other regions, creating an autocatalytic protein progression. The growth and transport of these assemblies depend on various mechanisms that can be targeted therapeutically. Here, we use spatially-extended nucleation-aggregation-fragmentation models for the dynamics of prion-like neurodegenerative protein-spreading in the brain to study the effect of different drugs on whole-brain Alzheimer's disease progression.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Parameter Singular Perturbation Analysis of the Robertson Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Robertson model describing a chemical reaction involving three reactants is one of the classical examples of stiffness in ODEs. The stiffness is caused by the occurrence of three reaction rates $k_1,\,k_2$, and $k_3$, with largely differing orders of magnitude, acting as parameters. The model has been widely used as a numerical test problem. Surprisingly, no asymptotic analysis of this multiscale problem seems to exist. In this paper we provide a full asymptotic analysis of the Robertson model under the assumption $k_1, k_3 \ll k_2$. We rewrite the equations as a two-parameter singular perturbation problem in the rescaled small parameters $(\varepsilon_1,\varepsilon_2):=(k_1/k_2,k_3/k_2)$, which we then analyze using geometric singular perturbation theory (GSPT). To deal with the multi-parameter singular structure, we perform blow-ups in parameter- and variable space. We identify four distinct regimes in a neighbourhood of the singular limit \mbox{$(\varepsilon_1,\varepsilon_2)= (0,0)$}. Within these four regimes we use GSPT and additional blow-ups to analyze the dynamics and the structure of solutions. Our asymptotic results are in excellent qualitative and quantitative agreement with the numerics.</description>

      <title>Poisson stability of solutions for stochastic evolution equations driven by fractional Brownian motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of Poisson stability of solutions for stochastic semi-linear evolution equation driven by fractional Brownian motion $$\mathrm{d} X(t)= \left( AX(t) + f(t,X(t)) \right) \mathrm{d}t + g\left(t,X(t)\right)\mathrm{d}B^H_{Q}(t),$$ where $A$ is an exponentially stable linear operator acting on a separable Hilbert space $\mathbb{H}$, coefficients $f$ and $g$ are Poisson stable in time, and $B^H_Q (t)$ is a $Q$-cylindrical fBm with Hurst index $H$. First, we establish the existence and uniqueness of the solution for this equation. Then, we prove that under the condition where the functions $f$ and $g$ are sufficiently "small", the equation admits a solution that exhibits the same character of recurrence as $f$ and $g$. The discussion is further extended to the asymptotic stability of these Poisson stable solutions. Finally, we include an example to validate our results.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Formalism for a family of cellular automata and duality with the shift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We will consider a family of cellular automata $\Phi: \{1,2,...,r\}^\mathbb{N}\circlearrowright$ that are not of algebraic type. Our first goal is to determine conditions that result in the identification of probabilities that are at the same time $\sigma$-invariant and $\Phi$-invariant, where $\sigma$ is the full shift. Via the use of versions of the Ruelle operator $\mathcal{L}_{A,\sigma}$ and $\mathcal{L}_{B,\Phi}$ we will show that there is an abundant set of measures with this property; they will be equilibrium probabilities for different Lispchitz potentials $A,B$ and for the corresponding dynamics $\sigma$ and $\Phi$. Via the use of a version of the involution kernel $W$ for a $(\sigma,\Phi)$-mixed skew product $\hat{\Phi}: \{1,2,...,r\}^\mathbb{Z}\circlearrowright$, given $A$ one can determine $B$, in such way that the integral kernel $e^W$ produce a duality between eigenprobabilities $\rho_A$ for $(\mathcal{L}_{A,\sigma})^*$ and eigenfunctions $\psi_B$ for $\mathcal{L}_{B,\Phi}$. In another direction, considering the non-mixed extension $\hat{\Phi}_n : \{1,2,...,r\}^\mathbb{Z}\circlearrowright$ of $\Phi$, given a Lispchitz potential $\hat{A} : \{1,2,...,r\}^\mathbb{Z}\to \mathbb{R}$, we can identify a Lipschitz potential $A:\{1,2,...,r\}^\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R} $, in such away that relates the variational problem of $\hat{\Phi}_n$-Topological Pressure for $\hat{A}$ with the $\Phi$-Topological Pressure for $A$. We also present a version of Livsic's Theorem. Whether or not $\Phi$ (or $\hat{\Phi})$ can eventually be conjugated with another shift of finite type is irrelevant in our context.</description>

      <title>Flutter instability in solids and structures, with a view on biomechanics and metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The phenomenon of oscillatory instability called \lq flutter' was observed in aeroelasticity and rotor dynamics about a century ago. Driven by a series of applications involving nonconservative elasticity theory at different physical scales, ranging from nanomechanics to the mechanics of large space structures and including biomechanical problems of motility and growth, research on flutter is experiencing a new renaissance. A review is presented of the most notable applications and recent advances in fundamentals, both theoretical and experimental aspects, of flutter instability and Hopf bifurcation. Open problems, research gaps, and new perspectives for investigations are indicated.</description>

      <title>A connection between Lipschitz and Kazhdan constants for groups of homeomorphisms of the real line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We exhibit an obstruction for groups with Property (T) to act on the real line by bi-Lipschitz homeomorphisms. This condition is expressed in terms of the Lipschitz constants and the Kazhdan constants associated to finite, generating subsets. As a corollary, we obtain an upper bound for the Kazhdan constants of orderable groups. Our main tool is the Koopman representation associated to the action $\operatorname{BiLip}_+(\mathbb{R})\curvearrowright\mathbb{R}$.</description>

      <title>TwinLab: a framework for data-efficient training of non-intrusive reduced-order models for digital twins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Purpose: Simulation-based digital twins represent an effort to provide high-accuracy real-time insights into operational physical processes. However, the computation time of many multi-physical simulation models is far from real-time. It might even exceed sensible time frames to produce sufficient data for training data-driven reduced-order models. This study presents TwinLab, a framework for data-efficient, yet accurate training of neural-ODE type reduced-order models with only two data sets. Design/methodology/approach: Correlations between test errors of reduced-order models and distinct features of corresponding training data are investigated. Having found the single best data sets for training, a second data set is sought with the help of similarity and error measures to enrich the training process effectively. Findings: Adding a suitable second training data set in the training process reduces the test error by up to 49% compared to the best base reduced-order model trained only with one data set. Such a second training data set should at least yield a good reduced-order model on its own and exhibit higher levels of dissimilarity to the base training data set regarding the respective excitation signal. Moreover, the base reduced-order model should have elevated test errors on the second data set. The relative error of the time series ranges from 0.18% to 0.49%. Prediction speed-ups of up to a factor of 36,000 are observed. Originality: The proposed computational framework facilitates the automated, data-efficient extraction of non-intrusive reduced-order models for digital twins from existing simulation models, independent of the simulation software.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Analysis of a bi-monomeric nonlinear Becker-D{\"o}ring system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To provide a mechanistic explanation of sustained {then} damped oscillations observed in a depolymerisation experiment,  a bi-monomeric variant of the seminal Becker-D\"oring system has been proposed in \cite{DFMR}. When all reaction rates are constant, the equations are the following: \begin{align*}\frac{dv}{dt} &amp; =-vw+v\sum_{j=2}^{\infty}c_{j}, \qquad \frac{dw}{dt} =vw-w\sum_{j=1}^{\infty}c_{j},  \\ \frac{dc_{j}}{dt} &amp; =J_{j-1}-J_{j}\ \ ,\ \ j\geq1\ \ ,\ \ \ J_{j}=wc_{j}-vc_{j+1}\ \ ,\ \ j\geq1\ \ ,\ J_{0}=0,
\end{align*} where $v$ and $w$ are two distinct unit species, and $c_i$ represents the concentration of clusters containing $i$ units.
  We study in detail the mechanisms leading to such oscillations and characterise the different phases of the dynamics, from the initial high-amplitude oscillations to the progressive damping leading to the convergence towards the unique positive stationary solution. We give quantitative approximations for the main quantities of interest: period of the oscillations, size of the damping (corresponding to a loss of energy), number of oscillations characterising each phase. We illustrate these results by numerical simulation, in line with the theoretical results,  and provide numerical methods to solve the system.</description>

      <title>Gaps in the complex Farey sequence of an imaginary quadratic number field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given an imaginary quadratic number field $K$ with ring of integers $\mathcal{O}_K$, we are interested in the asymptotic \emph{distance to nearest neighbour} (or \emph{gap}) statistic of complex Farey fractions $\frac{p}{q}$, with $p,q \in \mathcal{O}_K$ and $0&lt;|q|\leq T$, as $T \to \infty$. Reformulating this problem in a homogeneous dynamical setting, we follow the approach of J. Marklof for real Farey fractions with several variables (2013) and adapt a joint equidistribution result in the real $3$-dimensional hyperbolic space of J. Parkkonen and F. Paulin (2023) to derive the existence of a probability measure describing this asymptotic gap statistic. We obtain an integral formula for the associated cumulative distribution function, and use geometric arguments to find an explicit estimate for its tail distribution in the cases of Gaussian and Eisenstein fractions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we study nonlinear Vlasov equations with a smooth interaction kernel on a compact manifold without boundary where the geodesic flow exhibits strong chaotic behavior, known as the Anosov property. We show that, for small initial data with finite regularity and supported away from the null section, there exist global solutions to the nonlinear Vlasov equations which weakly converge to an equilibrium of the free transport equation, and whose potential strongly converges to zero, both with exponential speed. Central to our approach are microlocal anisotropic Sobolev spaces, originally developed for studying Pollicott-Ruelle resonances, that we further refine to deal with the geometry of the full cotangent bundle, which paves the way to the analysis of nonlinear Vlasov equations.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a class of non-invertible piecewise isometries on the upper half-plane known as Translated Cone Exchanges. These maps include a simple interval exchange on a boundary we call the baseline. We provide a geometric construction for the first return map to a neighbourhood of the vertex of the middle cone for a large class of parameters, then we show a recurrence in the first return map tied to Diophantine properties of the parameters, and subsequently prove the infinite renormalizability of the first return map for these parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05638v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the class of interval maps with dense set of periodic points CP and its closure Cl(CP) equipped with the metric of uniform convergence. Besides studying basic topological properties and density results in the spaces CP and Cl(CP) we prove that Cl(CP) is dynamically characterized as the set of interval maps for which every point is chain-recurrent. Furthermore, we prove that a strong topological expansion property called topological exactness (or leo property) is attained on the open dense set of maps in CP and on a residual set in Cl(CP). Moreover, we show that every second category set in CP and Cl(CP) is rich in a sense that it contains uncountably many conjugacy classes. An analogous conclusion also holds in the setting of interval maps preserving any fixed non-atomic probability measure with full support. Finally, we give a detailed description of the structure of periodic points of generic maps in CP and Cl(CP) and show that generic maps in CP and Cl(CP) satisfy the shadowing property.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18809v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extended dynamic mode decomposition (EDMD) is a well-established method to generate a data-driven approximation of the Koopman operator for analysis and prediction of nonlinear dynamical systems. Recently, kernel EDMD (kEDMD) has gained popularity due to its ability to resolve the challenging task of choosing a suitable dictionary by using the kernel's canonical features and, thus, data-informed observables. In this paper, we provide the first pointwise bounds on the approximation error of kEDMD. The main idea consists of two steps. First, we show that the reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces of Wendland functions are invariant under the Koopman operator. Second, exploiting that the learning problem given by regression in the native norm can be recast as an interpolation problem, we prove our novel error bounds by using interpolation estimates. Finally, we validate our findings with numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Horocycle flows on abelian covers of surfaces of negative curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08592v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the unit speed parametrization of the horocycle flow on infinite Abelian covers of compact surfaces of negative curvature. We prove an asymptotic result for the ergodic integrals of sufficiently regular functions. In the case of constant curvature, where the unit speed and the uniformly contracting parametrizations of horocycles coincide, we recover a result by Ledrappier and Sarig. Our method, which does not use symbolic dynamics, is based on a general Fourier decomposition for Abelian covers and on the study of spectral theory of weighted (and twisted) transfer operators for the geodesic flow acting on appropriate anisotropic Banach spaces. Finally, as a byproduct result, we obtain a power deviation estimate for the horocycle ergodic averages on compact surfaces, without requiring any pinching condition as in previous results.</description>

      <title>Group measure space construction, ergodicity and $W^\ast$-rigidity for stable random fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.14821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2007.14821v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work discovers a novel link between probability theory (of stable random fields) and von Neumann algebras. It is established that the group measure space construction corresponding to a minimal representation is an invariant of a stationary symmetric $\alpha$-stable (S$\alpha$S) random field indexed by any countable group $G$. When $G=\mathbb{Z}^d$, we characterize ergodicity (and also absolute non-ergodicity) of stationary S$\alpha$S fields in terms of the central decomposition of this crossed product von Neumann algebra coming from any (not necessarily minimal) Rosinski representation. This shows that ergodicity (or the complete absence of it) is a $W^\ast$-rigid property (in a suitable sense) for this class of fields. All our results have analogues for stationary max-stable random fields as well.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Boundary Integral Networks (PIBI-Nets): A Data-Driven Approach for Solving Partial Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.09571v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Partial differential equations (PDEs) are widely used to describe relevant phenomena in dynamical systems. In real-world applications, we commonly need to combine formal PDE models with (potentially noisy) observations. This is especially relevant in settings where we lack information about boundary or initial conditions, or where we need to identify unknown model parameters. In recent years, Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have become a popular tool for this kind of problems. In high-dimensional settings, however, PINNs often suffer from computational problems because they usually require dense collocation points over the entire computational domain. To address this problem, we present Physics-Informed Boundary Integral Networks (PIBI-Nets) as a data-driven approach for solving PDEs in one dimension less than the original problem space. PIBI-Nets only require points at the computational domain boundary, while still achieving highly accurate results. Moreover, PIBI-Nets clearly outperform PINNs in several practical settings. Exploiting elementary properties of fundamental solutions of linear differential operators, we present a principled and simple way to handle point sources in inverse problems. We demonstrate the excellent performance of PIBI- Nets for the Laplace and Poisson equations, both on artificial datasets and within a real-world application concerning the reconstruction of groundwater flows.</description>

      <title>Extending echo state property for quantum reservoir computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02686v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The echo state property (ESP) represents a fundamental concept in the reservoir computing (RC) framework that ensures output-only training of reservoir networks by being agnostic to the initial states and far past inputs. However, the traditional definition of ESP does not describe possible non-stationary systems in which statistical properties evolve. To address this issue, we introduce two new categories of ESP: $\textit{non-stationary ESP}$, designed for potentially non-stationary systems, and $\textit{subspace/subset ESP}$, designed for systems whose subsystems have ESP. Following the definitions, we numerically demonstrate the correspondence between non-stationary ESP in the quantum reservoir computer (QRC) framework with typical Hamiltonian dynamics and input encoding methods using non-linear autoregressive moving-average (NARMA) tasks. We also confirm the correspondence by computing linear/non-linear memory capacities that quantify input-dependent components within reservoir states. Our study presents a new understanding of the practical design of QRC and other possibly non-stationary RC systems in which non-stationary systems and subsystems are exploited.</description>

      <title>Pole Placement and Feedback Stabilization for Discrete Linear Ensemble Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19017v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider discrete ensembles of linear, scalar control systems with single-inputs. Assuming that all the individual systems are unstable, we investigate whether there exist linear feedback control laws that can asymptotically stabilize the ensemble system. We provide necessary/sufficient conditions for feasibility of pole placement in the left half plane and for feedback stabilizability of the ensemble systems.</description>

      <title>Robustly non-convex hypersurfaces in contact manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05979v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct the first examples of hypersurfaces in any contact manifold of dimension 5 and larger that cannot be $C^2$-approximated by convex hypersurfaces. This contrasts sharply with the foundational result of Giroux in dimension $3$ and the work of Honda-Huang in the $C^0$ case. The main technical step is the construction of a Bonatti-Diaz type blender in the contact setting.</description>

      <title>Approximate Controllability of Linear Fractional Impulsive Evolution Equations in Hilbert Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15114v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the approximate controllability of linear fractional impulsive evolution equations in Hilbert spaces. We provide a representation of solutions utilizing impulsive operators. Necessary and sufficient conditions for the approximate controllability of linear fractional impulsive evolution equations are established in terms of the impulsive resolvent operator. An example is presented to demonstrate the application of the obtained theoretical results.</description>
