      <title>Identifying bound states in the continuum by their boundary sensitivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a method for effectively identifying bound states in the continuum (BICs) - notably without computing the imaginary part of the eigenvalues - thereby simplifying the modeling and potentially reducing computation time. In real, open, physical systems, wave decay must be taken into account. This phenomenon is captured by complex-valued solutions of the harmonic wave equation, the so-called quasi-normal modes (QNMs). BICs, however, constitute a limiting class of solutions that do not radiate energy to infinity and are therefore, by their very nature, insensitive to the region surrounding the physical structure. Building on this observation, we identify BICs by varying the external boundary conditions that close the computational domain; the resulting behavior is displayed in the form of spectral histograms. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this procedure by comparing it with conventional QNM analysis employing perfectly matched layers. Two representative examples are considered: a periodic system of permeable inclusions supporting guided Rayleigh-Bloch waves, and a whispering-gallery resonator constructed from this configuration. Finally, we provide a mathematical explanation for the method's validity by deriving integral reciprocity statements.</description>

      <title>Homogenization of architected materials incorporating shearable beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional architected materials are often realized as periodic grids of elastic beams. Conventional homogenization methods represent these structures as equivalent elastic solids but neglect shear deformation in the constituent beams. This article addresses this limitation by incorporating shear deformability through Timoshenko beam theory, enabling accurate modeling of stubby beams. Moreover, shearable beams with extreme mechanical characteristics can be obtained through the design of appropriate microstructures. Introducing shearable beams into the grid expands the design space, allowing, for instance, the control of the effective Poisson's ratio beyond the limits achievable with slender beams.</description>

      <title>Thermal performance and environmental impact of a wood frame wall enhanced with clay-based plaster: an experimental and simulation analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study evaluates the thermal performance and environmental impact of wooden frame walls with clay-based plaster by using the complementary properties of both materials. Clay's moderate density and high thermal capacity enhance the thermal behaviour of wood structures, making it a valuable addition to lightweight constructions. At the material scale, the thermal properties of clay-based plaster were experimentally characterized and integrated into thermal dynamic simulations to assess the influence of internal and external wall configurations on the indoor temperature in the framework of overheating in summer. A life cycle assessment was conducted to compare the environmental impact of three walls: one made of concrete, a wooden frame wall, and another using wood frame wall with clay-based plaster.</description>
