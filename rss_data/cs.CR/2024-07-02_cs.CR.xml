      <title>Provably Secure Non-interactive Key Exchange Protocol for Group-Oriented Applications in Scenarios with Low-Quality Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-interactive key exchange (NIKE) enables two or multiple parties (just knowing the public system parameters and each other's public key) to derive a (group) session key without the need for interaction. Recently, NIKE in multi-party settings has been attached importance. However, we note that most existing multi-party NIKE protocols, underlying costly cryptographic techniques (i.e., multilinear maps and indistinguishability obfuscation), lead to high computational costs once employed in practice. Therefore, it is a challenging task to achieve multi-party NIKE protocols by using more practical cryptographic primitives. In this paper, we propose a secure and efficient NIKE protocol for secure communications in dynamic groups, whose construction only bases on bilinear maps. This protocol allows multiple parties to negotiate asymmetric group keys (a public group encryption key and each party's decryption key) without any interaction among one another. Additionally, the protocol supports updating of group keys in an efficient and non-interactive way once any party outside a group or any group member joins or leaves the group. Further, any party called a sender (even outside a group) intending to connect with some or all of group members called receivers in a group, just needs to generate a ciphertext with constant size under the public group encryption key, and only the group member who is the real receiver can decrypt the ciphertext to obtain the session key. We prove our protocol captures the correctness and indistinguishability of session key under k-Bilinear Diffie-Hellman exponent (k-BDHE) assumption. Efficiency evaluation shows the efficiency of our protocol.</description>

      <title>SBOM.EXE: Countering Dynamic Code Injection based on Software Bill of Materials in Java</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Software supply chain attacks have become a significant threat as software development increasingly relies on contributions from multiple, often unverified sources. The code from unverified sources does not pose a threat until it is executed. Log4Shell is a recent example of a supply chain attack that processed a malicious input at runtime, leading to remote code execution. It exploited the dynamic class loading facilities of Java to compromise the runtime integrity of the application. Traditional safeguards can mitigate supply chain attacks at build time, but they have limitations in mitigating runtime threats posed by dynamically loaded malicious classes. This calls for a system that can detect these malicious classes and prevent their execution at runtime. This paper introduces SBOM.EXE, a proactive system designed to safeguard Java applications against such threats. SBOM.EXE constructs a comprehensive allowlist of permissible classes based on the complete software supply chain of the application. This allowlist is enforced at runtime, blocking any unrecognized or tampered classes from executing. We assess SBOM.EXE's effectiveness by mitigating 3 critical CVEs based on the above threat. We run our tool with 3 open-source Java applications and report that our tool is compatible with real-world applications with minimal performance overhead. Our findings demonstrate that SBOM.EXE can effectively maintain runtime integrity with minimal performance impact, offering a novel approach to fortifying Java applications against dynamic classloading attacks.</description>

      <title>Dual-view Aware Smart Contract Vulnerability Detection for Ethereum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The wide application of Ethereum technology has brought technological innovation to traditional industries. As one of Ethereum's core applications, smart contracts utilize diverse contract codes to meet various functional needs and have gained widespread use. However, the non-tamperability of smart contracts, coupled with vulnerabilities caused by natural flaws or human errors, has brought unprecedented challenges to blockchain security. Therefore, in order to ensure the healthy development of blockchain technology and the stability of the blockchain community, it is particularly important to study the vulnerability detection techniques for smart contracts. In this paper, we propose a Dual-view Aware Smart Contract Vulnerability Detection Framework named DVDet. The framework initially converts the source code and bytecode of smart contracts into weighted graphs and control flow sequences, capturing potential risk features from these two perspectives and integrating them for analysis, ultimately achieving effective contract vulnerability detection. Comprehensive experiments on the Ethereum dataset show that our method outperforms others in detecting vulnerabilities.</description>

      <title>Resource Allocation and Secure Wireless Communication in the Large Model-based Mobile Edge Computing System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large models and mobile edge computing, transfer learning, particularly through fine-tuning, has become crucial for adapting models to downstream tasks. Traditionally, this requires users to share their data with model owners for fine-tuning, which is not only costly but also raises significant privacy concerns. Furthermore, fine-tuning large-scale models is computationally intensive and often impractical for many users. To tackle these challenges, we introduce a system that combines offsite-tuning with physical-layer security, which provides local data owners with a lightweight adapter and a compressed emulator. Data owners then fine-tune the adapter locally and securely send it back to the model owners through a confidential channel for integration, ensuring privacy and resource conservation. Our paper focuses on optimizing computational resource allocation among data owners and the large model owner deployed on edge, and on the compression ratio of adapters. We incorporate a secrecy uplink channel to maximize the utility that we defined while minimizing system costs like energy consumption and delay. The optimization uses the Dinkelbach algorithm, fractional programming, successive convex approximation and alternating optimization. Experiments demonstrate our algorithm's superiority over existing methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that differential privacy type guarantees can be obtained when using a Poisson synthesis mechanism to protect counts in contingency tables. Specifically, we show how to obtain $(\epsilon, \delta)$-probabilistic differential privacy guarantees via the Poisson distribution's cumulative distribution function. We demonstrate this empirically with the synthesis of an administrative-type confidential database.</description>

      <title>Navigating the road to automotive cybersecurity compliance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The automotive industry has evolved significantly since the introduction of the Ford Model T in 1908. Today's vehicles are not merely mechanical constructs; they are integral components of a complex digital ecosystem, equipped with advanced connectivity features powered by Artificial Intelligence and cloud computing technologies. This evolution has enhanced vehicle safety, efficiency, and the overall driving experience. However, it also introduces new challenges, notably in cybersecurity.
  With the increasing integration of digital technologies, vehicles have become more susceptible to cyber-attacks, prompting significant cybersecurity concerns. These concerns include securing sensitive data, protecting vehicles from unauthorized access, and ensuring user privacy. In response, the automotive industry is compelled to adopt robust cybersecurity measures to safeguard both vehicles and data against potential threats.
  Legislative frameworks such as UNR155 and UNR156 by the United Nations, along with other international regulations, aim to establish stringent cybersecurity mandates. These regulations require compliance with comprehensive cybersecurity management systems and necessitate regular updates and testing to cope with the evolving nature of cyber threats. The introduction of such regulations highlights the growing recognition of cybersecurity as a critical component of automotive safety and functionality.
  The future of automotive cybersecurity lies in the continuous development of advanced protective measures and collaborative efforts among all stakeholders, including manufacturers, policymakers, and cybersecurity professionals. Only through such concerted efforts can the industry hope to address the dual goals of innovation in vehicle functionality and stringent security measures against the backdrop of an increasingly interconnected digital landscape.</description>

      <title>Blockchain based Decentralized Petition System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A decentralized online petition system enables individuals or groups to create, sign, and share petitions without a central authority. Using blockchain technology, these systems ensure the integrity and transparency of the petition process by recording every signature or action on the blockchain, making alterations or deletions impossible. This provides a permanent, tamper-proof record of the petition's progress. Such systems allow users to bypass traditional intermediaries like government or social media platforms, fostering more democratic and transparent decision-making.
  This paper reviews research on petition systems, highlighting the shortcomings of existing systems such as lack of accountability, vulnerability to hacking, and security issues. The proposed blockchain-based implementation aims to overcome these challenges. Decentralized voting systems have garnered interest recently due to their potential to provide secure and transparent voting platforms without intermediaries, addressing issues like voter fraud, manipulation, and trust in the electoral process.
  We propose a decentralized voting system web application using blockchain technology to ensure the integrity and security of the voting process. This system aims to provide a transparent, decentralized decision-making process that counts every vote while eliminating the need for centralized authorities. The paper presents an overview of the system architecture, design considerations, and implementation details, along with the potential benefits and limitations.
  Finally, we discuss future research directions, examining the technical aspects of the application, including underlying algorithms and protocols. Our research aims to enhance the integrity and accessibility of democratic processes, improve security, and ensure fairness, transparency, and tamper-proofness.</description>

      <title>Privacy-Preserving and Trustworthy Deep Learning for Medical Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The shift towards efficient and automated data analysis through Machine Learning (ML) has notably impacted healthcare systems, particularly Radiomics. Radiomics leverages ML to analyze medical images accurately and efficiently for precision medicine. Current methods rely on Deep Learning (DL) to improve performance and accuracy (Deep Radiomics). Given the sensitivity of medical images, ensuring privacy throughout the Deep Radiomics pipeline-from data generation and collection to model training and inference-is essential, especially when outsourced. Thus, Privacy-Enhancing Technologies (PETs) are crucial tools for Deep Radiomics. Previous studies and systematization efforts have either broadly overviewed PETs and their applications or mainly focused on subsets of PETs for ML algorithms. In Deep Radiomics, where efficiency, accuracy, and privacy are crucial, many PETs, while theoretically applicable, may not be practical without specialized optimizations or hybrid designs. Additionally, not all DL models are suitable for Radiomics. Consequently, there is a need for specialized studies that investigate and systematize the effective and practical integration of PETs into the Deep Radiomics pipeline. This work addresses this research gap by (1) classifying existing PETs, presenting practical hybrid PETS constructions, and a taxonomy illustrating their potential integration with the Deep Radiomics pipeline, with comparative analyses detailing assumptions, architectural suitability, and security, (2) Offering technical insights, describing potential challenges and means of combining PETs into the Deep Radiomics pipeline, including integration strategies, subtilities, and potential challenges, (3) Proposing potential research directions, identifying challenges, and suggesting solutions to enhance the PETs in Deep Radiomics.</description>

      <title>Your Car Tells Me Where You Drove: A Novel Path Inference Attack via CAN Bus and OBD-II Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite its well-known security issues, the Controller Area Network (CAN) is still the main technology for in-vehicle communications. Attackers posing as diagnostic services or accessing the CAN bus can threaten the drivers' location privacy to know the exact location at a certain point in time or to infer the visited areas. This represents a serious threat to users' privacy, but also an advantage for police investigations to gather location-based evidence. In this paper, we present On Path Diagnostic - Intrusion \&amp; Inference (OPD-II), a novel path inference attack leveraging a physical car model and a map matching algorithm to infer the path driven by a car based on CAN bus data. Differently from available attacks, our approach only requires the attacker to know the initial location and heading of the victim's car and is not limited by the availability of training data, road configurations, or the need to access other victim's devices (e.g., smartphones). We implement our attack on a set of four different cars and a total number of 41 tracks in different road and traffic scenarios. We achieve an average of 95% accuracy on reconstructing the coordinates of the recorded path by leveraging a dynamic map-matching algorithm that outperforms the 75% and 89% accuracy values of other proposals while removing their set of assumptions.</description>

      <title>BAZAM: A Blockchain-Assisted Zero-Trust Authentication in Multi-UAV Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are vulnerable to interception and attacks when operated remotely without a unified and efficient identity authentication. Meanwhile, the openness of wireless communication environments potentially leads to data leakage and system paralysis. However, conventional authentication schemes in the UAV network are system-centric, failing to adapt to the diversity of UAVs identities and access, resulting in changes in network environments and connection statuses. Additionally, UAVs are not subjected to periodic identity compliance checks once authenticated, leading to difficulties in controlling access anomalies. Therefore, in this work, we consider a zero-trust framework for UAV network authentication, aiming to achieve UAVs identity authentication through the principle of ``never trust and always verify''. We introduce a blockchain-assisted zero-trust authentication scheme, namely BAZAM, designed for multi-UAV wireless networks. In this scheme, UAVs follow a key generation approach using physical unclonable functions (PUFs), and cryptographic technique helps verify registration and access requests of UAVs. The blockchain is applied to store UAVs authentication information in immutable storage. Through thorough security analysis and extensive evaluation, we demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed BAZAM.</description>

      <title>UWBAD: Towards Effective and Imperceptible Jamming Attacks Against UWB Ranging Systems with COTS Chips</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: UWB ranging systems have been adopted in many critical and security sensitive applications due to its precise positioning and secure ranging capabilities. We present a practical jamming attack, namely UWBAD, against commercial UWB ranging systems, which exploits the vulnerability of the adoption of the normalized cross-correlation process in UWB ranging and can selectively and quickly block ranging sessions without prior knowledge of the configurations of the victim devices, potentially leading to severe consequences such as property loss, unauthorized access, or vehicle theft. UWBAD achieves more effective and less imperceptible jamming due to: (i) it efficiently blocks every ranging session by leveraging the field-level jamming, thereby exerting a tangible impact on commercial UWB ranging systems, and (ii) the compact, reactive, and selective system design based on COTS UWB chips, making it affordable and less imperceptible. We successfully conducted real attacks against commercial UWB ranging systems from the three largest UWB chip vendors on the market, e.g., Apple, NXP, and Qorvo. We reported our findings to Apple, related Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM), and the Automotive Security Research Group, triggering internal security incident response procedures at Volkswagen, Audi, Bosch, and NXP. As of the writing of this paper, the related OEM has acknowledged this vulnerability in their automotive systems and has offered a $5,000 reward as a bounty.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper aimed to discover the risks associated with the dark web and to detect the threats related to human trafficking using image processing with OpenCV and Python. Apart from that, a development environment was set up by installing TensorFlow, OpenCV and Python. Through exploratory data analysis (EDA), significant insights into the distribution and interactions of dataset features were obtained, which are crucial for evaluating various cyberthreats. The construction and evaluation of logistic regression and support vector machine (SVM) models revealed that the SVM model outperforms logistic regression in accuracy. The paper delves into the intricacies of data preprocessing, EDA, and model development, offering valuable insights into network protection and cyberthreat response.</description>

      <title>A Whole-Process Certifiably Robust Aggregation Method Against Backdoor Attacks in Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has garnered widespread adoption across various domains such as finance, healthcare, and cybersecurity. Nonetheless, FL remains under significant threat from backdoor attacks, wherein malicious actors insert triggers into trained models, enabling them to perform certain tasks while still meeting FL's primary objectives. In response, robust aggregation methods have been proposed, which can be divided into three types: ex-ante, ex-durante, and ex-post methods. Given the complementary nature of these methods, combining all three types is promising yet unexplored. Such a combination is non-trivial because it requires leveraging their advantages while overcoming their disadvantages. Our study proposes a novel whole-process certifiably robust aggregation (WPCRA) method for FL, which enhances robustness against backdoor attacks across three phases: ex-ante, ex-durante, and ex-post. Moreover, since the current geometric median estimation method fails to consider differences among clients, we propose a novel weighted geometric median estimation algorithm (WGME). This algorithm estimates the geometric median of model updates from clients based on each client's weight, further improving the robustness of WPCRA against backdoor attacks. We also theoretically prove that WPCRA offers improved certified robustness guarantees with a larger certified radius. We evaluate the advantages of our methods based on the task of loan status prediction. Comparison with baselines shows that our methods significantly improve FL's robustness against backdoor attacks. This study contributes to the literature with a novel WPCRA method and a novel WGME algorithm. Our code is available at https://github.com/brick-brick/WPCRAM.</description>

      <title>Physical Layer Deception with Non-Orthogonal Multiplexing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physical layer security (PLS) is a promising technology to secure wireless communications by exploiting the physical properties of the wireless channel. However, the passive nature of PLS creates a significant imbalance between the effort required by eavesdroppers and legitimate users to secure data. To address this imbalance, in this article, we propose a novel framework of physical layer deception (PLD), which combines PLS with deception technologies to actively counteract wiretapping attempts. Combining a two-stage encoder with randomized ciphering and non-orthogonal multiplexing, the PLD approach enables the wireless communication system to proactively counter eavesdroppers with deceptive messages. Relying solely on the superiority of the legitimate channel over the eavesdropping channel, the PLD framework can effectively protect the confidentiality of the transmitted messages, even against eavesdroppers who possess knowledge equivalent to that of the legitimate receiver. We prove the validity of the PLD framework with in-depth analyses and demonstrate its superiority over conventional PLS approaches with comprehensive numerical benchmarks.</description>

      <title>CSUM: A Novel Mechanism for Updating CubeSat while Preserving Authenticity and Integrity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent rise of CubeSat has revolutionized global space explorations, as it offers cost-effective solutions for low-orbit space applications (including climate monitoring, weather measurements, communications, and earth observation). A salient feature of CubeSat is that applications currently on-boarded can either be updated or entirely replaced by new applications via software updates, which allows reusing in-orbit hardware, reduces space debris, and saves cost as well as time. Securing software updates employing traditional methods (e.g., encryption) remains impractical mainly due to the low-resource capabilities of CubeSat. Therefore, the security of software updates for CubeSats remains a critical issue.
  In this paper, we propose CubeSat Update Mechanism (CSUM), a lightweight scheme to provide integrity, authentication, and data freshness guarantees for software update broadcasts to CubeSats using a hash chain. We empirically evaluate our proof of concept implementation to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of our approach. CSUM can validate 50,000 consecutive updates successfully in less than a second. We also perform a comparative analysis of different cryptographic primitives. Our empirical evaluations show that the hash-based approach is at least 61$\times$ faster than the conventional mechanisms, even in resource-constrained environments. Finally, we discuss the limitations, challenges, and potential future research directions for CubeSat software update procedures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a privacy-preserving framework for integrating consumer-grade drones into bushfire management. This system creates a marketplace where bushfire management authorities obtain essential data from drone operators. Key features include local differential privacy to protect data providers and a blockchain-based solution ensuring fair data exchanges and accountability. The framework is validated through a proof-of-concept implementation, demonstrating its scalability and potential for various large-scale data collection scenarios. This approach addresses privacy concerns and compliance with regulations like Australia's Privacy Act 1988, offering a practical solution for enhancing bushfire detection and management through crowdsourced drone services.</description>

      <title>Decentralized PKI Framework for Data Integrity in Spatial Crowdsourcing Drone Services</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the domain of spatial crowdsourcing drone services, which includes tasks like delivery, surveillance, and data collection, secure communication is paramount. The Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) ensures this by providing a system for digital certificates that authenticate the identities of entities involved, securing data and command transmissions between drones and their operators. However, the centralized trust model of traditional PKI, dependent on Certificate Authorities (CAs), presents a vulnerability due to its single point of failure, risking security breaches. To counteract this, the paper presents D2XChain, a blockchain-based PKI framework designed for the Internet of Drone Things (IoDT). By decentralizing the CA infrastructure, D2XChain eliminates this single point of failure, thereby enhancing the security and reliability of drone communications. Fully compatible with the X.509 standard, it integrates seamlessly with existing PKI systems, supporting all key operations such as certificate registration, validation, verification, and revocation in a distributed manner. This innovative approach not only strengthens the defense of drone services against various security threats but also showcases its practical application through deployment on a private Ethereum testbed, representing a significant advancement in addressing the unique security challenges of drone-based services and ensuring their trustworthy operation in critical tasks.</description>

      <title>SecureSpectra: Safeguarding Digital Identity from Deep Fake Threats via Intelligent Signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advancements in DeepFake (DF) audio models pose a significant threat to voice authentication systems, leading to unauthorized access and the spread of misinformation. We introduce a defense mechanism, SecureSpectra, addressing DF threats by embedding orthogonal, irreversible signatures within audio. SecureSpectra leverages the inability of DF models to replicate high-frequency content, which we empirically identify across diverse datasets and DF models. Integrating differential privacy into the pipeline protects signatures from reverse engineering and strikes a delicate balance between enhanced security and minimal performance compromises. Our evaluations on Mozilla Common Voice, LibriSpeech, and VoxCeleb datasets showcase SecureSpectra's superior performance, outperforming recent works by up to 71% in detection accuracy. We open-source SecureSpectra to benefit the research community.</description>

      <title>Robust and Reliable Early-Stage Website Fingerprinting Attacks via Spatial-Temporal Distribution Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Website Fingerprinting (WF) attacks identify the websites visited by users by performing traffic analysis, compromising user privacy. Particularly, DL-based WF attacks demonstrate impressive attack performance. However, the effectiveness of DL-based WF attacks relies on the collected complete and pure traffic during the page loading, which impacts the practicality of these attacks. The WF performance is rather low under dynamic network conditions and various WF defenses, particularly when the analyzed traffic is only a small part of the complete traffic. In this paper, we propose Holmes, a robust and reliable early-stage WF attack. Holmes utilizes temporal and spatial distribution analysis of website traffic to effectively identify websites in the early stages of page loading. Specifically, Holmes develops adaptive data augmentation based on the temporal distribution of website traffic and utilizes a supervised contrastive learning method to extract the correlations between the early-stage traffic and the pre-collected complete traffic. Holmes accurately identifies traffic in the early stages of page loading by computing the correlation of the traffic with the spatial distribution information, which ensures robust and reliable detection according to early-stage traffic. We extensively evaluate Holmes using six datasets. Compared to nine existing DL-based WF attacks, Holmes improves the F1-score of identifying early-stage traffic by an average of 169.18%. Furthermore, we replay the traffic of visiting real-world dark web websites. Holmes successfully identifies dark web websites when the ratio of page loading on average is only 21.71%, with an average precision improvement of 169.36% over the existing WF attacks.</description>

      <title>SCIF: A Language for Compositional Smart Contract Security</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Securing smart contracts remains a fundamental challenge. At its core, it is about building software that is secure in composition with untrusted code, a challenge that extends far beyond blockchains. We introduce SCIF, a language for building smart contracts that are compositionally secure. SCIF is based on the fundamentally compositional principle of secure information flow, but extends this core mechanism to include protection against reentrancy attacks, confused deputy attacks, and improper error handling, even in the presence of malicious contracts that do not follow SCIF's rules. SCIF supports a rich ecosystem of interacting principals with partial trust through its mechanisms for dynamic trust management. SCIF has been implemented as a compiler to Solidity. We describe the SCIF language, including its static checking rules and runtime. Finally, we implement several applications with intricate security reasoning, showing how SCIF supports building complex smart contracts securely and gives programmer accurate diagnostics about potential security bugs.</description>

      <title>A Fingerprint for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances show that scaling a pre-trained language model could achieve state-of-the-art performance on many downstream tasks, prompting large language models (LLMs) to become a hot research topic in the field of artificial intelligence. However, due to the resource-intensive nature of training LLMs from scratch, it is urgent and crucial to protect the intellectual property of LLMs against infringement. This has motivated the authors in this paper to propose a novel black-box fingerprinting technique for LLMs, which requires neither model training nor model fine-tuning. We first demonstrate that the outputs of LLMs span a unique vector space associated with each model. We model the problem of ownership authentication as the task of evaluating the similarity between the victim model's space and the output's space of the suspect model. To deal with this problem, we propose two solutions, where the first solution involves verifying whether the outputs of the suspected large model are in the same space as those of the victim model, enabling rapid identification of model infringement, and the second one reconstructs the union of the vector spaces for LLM outputs and the victim model to address situations where the victim model has undergone the Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) attacks. Experimental results indicate that the proposed technique achieves superior performance in ownership verification and robustness against PEFT attacks. This work reveals inherent characteristics of LLMs and provides a promising solution for ownership verification of LLMs in black-box scenarios, ensuring efficiency, generality and practicality.</description>

      <title>QUEEN: Query Unlearning against Model Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model extraction attacks currently pose a non-negligible threat to the security and privacy of deep learning models. By querying the model with a small dataset and usingthe query results as the ground-truth labels, an adversary can steal a piracy model with performance comparable to the original model. Two key issues that cause the threat are, on the one hand, accurate and unlimited queries can be obtained by the adversary; on the other hand, the adversary can aggregate the query results to train the model step by step. The existing defenses usually employ model watermarking or fingerprinting to protect the ownership. However, these methods cannot proactively prevent the violation from happening. To mitigate the threat, we propose QUEEN (QUEry unlEarNing) that proactively launches counterattacks on potential model extraction attacks from the very beginning. To limit the potential threat, QUEEN has sensitivity measurement and outputs perturbation that prevents the adversary from training a piracy model with high performance. In sensitivity measurement, QUEEN measures the single query sensitivity by its distance from the center of its cluster in the feature space. To reduce the learning accuracy of attacks, for the highly sensitive query batch, QUEEN applies query unlearning, which is implemented by gradient reverse to perturb the softmax output such that the piracy model will generate reverse gradients to worsen its performance unconsciously. Experiments show that QUEEN outperforms the state-of-the-art defenses against various model extraction attacks with a relatively low cost to the model accuracy. The artifact is publicly available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/queen implementation-5408/.</description>

      <title>DeepiSign-G: Generic Watermark to Stamp Hidden DNN Parameters for Self-contained Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning solutions in critical domains like autonomous vehicles, facial recognition, and sentiment analysis require caution due to the severe consequences of errors. Research shows these models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, such as data poisoning and neural trojaning, which can covertly manipulate model behavior, compromising reliability and safety. Current defense strategies like watermarking have limitations: they fail to detect all model modifications and primarily focus on attacks on CNNs in the image domain, neglecting other critical architectures like RNNs.
  To address these gaps, we introduce DeepiSign-G, a versatile watermarking approach designed for comprehensive verification of leading DNN architectures, including CNNs and RNNs. DeepiSign-G enhances model security by embedding an invisible watermark within the Walsh-Hadamard transform coefficients of the model's parameters. This watermark is highly sensitive and fragile, ensuring prompt detection of any modifications. Unlike traditional hashing techniques, DeepiSign-G allows substantial metadata incorporation directly within the model, enabling detailed, self-contained tracking and verification.
  We demonstrate DeepiSign-G's applicability across various architectures, including CNN models (VGG, ResNets, DenseNet) and RNNs (Text sentiment classifier). We experiment with four popular datasets: VGG Face, CIFAR10, GTSRB Traffic Sign, and Large Movie Review. We also evaluate DeepiSign-G under five potential attacks. Our comprehensive evaluation confirms that DeepiSign-G effectively detects these attacks without compromising CNN and RNN model performance, highlighting its efficacy as a robust security measure for deep learning applications. Detection of integrity breaches is nearly perfect, while hiding only a bit in approximately 1% of the Walsh-Hadamard coefficients.</description>

      <title>Maximizing Blockchain Performance: Mitigating Conflicting Transactions through Parallelism and Dependency Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While blockchains initially gained popularity in the realm of cryptocurrencies, their widespread adoption is expanding beyond conventional applications, driven by the imperative need for enhanced data security. Despite providing a secure network, blockchains come with certain tradeoffs, including high latency, lower throughput, and an increased number of transaction failures. A pivotal issue contributing to these challenges is the improper management of "conflicting transactions", commonly referred to as "contention". When a number of pending transactions within a blockchain collide with each other, this results in a state of contention. This situation worsens network latency, leads to the wastage of system resources, and ultimately contributes to reduced throughput and higher transaction failures. In response to this issue, in this work, we present a novel blockchain scheme that integrates transaction parallelism and an intelligent dependency manager aiming to reduce the occurrence of conflicting transactions within blockchain networks. In terms of effectiveness and efficiency, experimental results show that our scheme not only mitigates the challenges posed by conflicting transactions, but also outperforms both existing parallel and non-parallel Hyperledger Fabric blockchain networks achieving higher transaction success rate, throughput, and latency. The integration of our scheme with Hyperledger Fabric appears to be a promising solution for improving the overall performance and stability of blockchain networks in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>On the Abuse and Detection of Polyglot Files</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A polyglot is a file that is valid in two or more formats. Polyglot files pose a problem for malware detection systems that route files to format-specific detectors/signatures, as well as file upload and sanitization tools. In this work we found that existing file-format and embedded-file detection tools, even those developed specifically for polyglot files, fail to reliably detect polyglot files used in the wild, leaving organizations vulnerable to attack. To address this issue, we studied the use of polyglot files by malicious actors in the wild, finding $30$ polyglot samples and $15$ attack chains that leveraged polyglot files. In this report, we highlight two well-known APTs whose cyber attack chains relied on polyglot files to bypass detection mechanisms. Using knowledge from our survey of polyglot usage in the wild -- the first of its kind -- we created a novel data set based on adversary techniques. We then trained a machine learning detection solution, PolyConv, using this data set. PolyConv achieves a precision-recall area-under-curve score of $0.999$ with an F1 score of $99.20$% for polyglot detection and $99.47$% for file-format identification, significantly outperforming all other tools tested. We developed a content disarmament and reconstruction tool, ImSan, that successfully sanitized $100$% of the tested image-based polyglots, which were the most common type found via the survey. Our work provides concrete tools and suggestions to enable defenders to better defend themselves against polyglot files, as well as directions for future work to create more robust file specifications and methods of disarmament.</description>

      <title>Logicbreaks: A Framework for Understanding Subversion of Rule-based Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study how to subvert language models from following the rules. We model rule-following as inference in propositional Horn logic, a mathematical system in which rules have the form "if $P$ and $Q$, then $R$" for some propositions $P$, $Q$, and $R$. We prove that although transformers can faithfully abide by such rules, maliciously crafted prompts can nevertheless mislead even theoretically constructed models. Empirically, we find that attacks on our theoretical models mirror popular attacks on large language models. Our work suggests that studying smaller theoretical models can help understand the behavior of large language models in rule-based settings like logical reasoning and jailbreak attacks.</description>

      <title>Differentially Private Graph Diffusion with Applications in Personalized PageRanks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph diffusion, which iteratively propagates real-valued substances among the graph, is used in numerous graph/network-involved applications. However, releasing diffusion vectors may reveal sensitive linking information in the data such as transaction information in financial network data. However, protecting the privacy of graph data is challenging due to its interconnected nature. This work proposes a novel graph diffusion framework with edge-level different privacy guarantees by using noisy diffusion iterates. The algorithm injects Laplace noise per diffusion iteration and adopts a degree-based thresholding function to mitigate the high sensitivity induced by low-degree nodes. Our privacy loss analysis is based on Privacy Amplification by Iteration (PABI), which to our best knowledge, is the first effort that analyzes PABI with Laplace noise and provides relevant applications. We also introduce a novel Infinity-Wasserstein distance tracking method, which tightens the analysis of privacy leakage and makes PABI more applicable in practice. We evaluate this framework by applying it to Personalized Pagerank computation for ranking tasks. Experiments on real-world network data demonstrate the superiority of our method under stringent privacy conditions.</description>

Abstract: Exact unlearning was first introduced as a privacy mechanism that allowed a user to retract their data from machine learning models on request. Shortly after, inexact schemes were proposed to mitigate the impractical costs associated with exact unlearning. More recently unlearning is often discussed as an approach for removal of impermissible knowledge i.e. knowledge that the model should not possess such as unlicensed copyrighted, inaccurate, or malicious information. The promise is that if the model does not have a certain malicious capability, then it cannot be used for the associated malicious purpose. In this paper we revisit the paradigm in which unlearning is used for in Large Language Models (LLMs) and highlight an underlying inconsistency arising from in-context learning. Unlearning can be an effective control mechanism for the training phase, yet it does not prevent the model from performing an impermissible act during inference. We introduce a concept of ununlearning, where unlearned knowledge gets reintroduced in-context, effectively rendering the model capable of behaving as if it knows the forgotten knowledge. As a result, we argue that content filtering for impermissible knowledge will be required and even exact unlearning schemes are not enough for effective content regulation. We discuss feasibility of ununlearning for modern LLMs and examine broader implications.</description>

      <title>The Future of QKD Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the recent advancements in quantum technologies, the QKD market exploded. World players are scrambling to win the race towards global QKD networks, even before the rules and policies required by such large endeavors were even discussed. Several vendors are on the market, each with specific parameters and advantages (in terms of key rate, link range, KMS software, etc.), hence considerable effort is now made towards standardization. While quantum communications is expected to reach a market size of up to \$36B by 2040, the largest QKD initiative to date is EuroQCI, which, due to its sheer scale, is forcing the market to mature. Although building a QKD network is believed to be trivial today, inter-connecting federated networks on a global scale is a heavy challenge. We propose QKD virtual networks not only as a useful infrastructure abstraction for increased flexibility and granular security, but as an inevitable solution for several problems that future QKD networks will encounter on the way towards widespread adoption.</description>

      <title>Information Density Bounds for Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the implications of guaranteeing privacy by imposing a lower bound on the information density between the private and the public data. We introduce an operationally meaningful privacy measure called pointwise maximal cost (PMC) and demonstrate that imposing an upper bound on PMC is equivalent to enforcing a lower bound on the information density. PMC quantifies the information leakage about a secret to adversaries who aim to minimize non-negative cost functions after observing the outcome of a privacy mechanism. When restricted to finite alphabets, PMC can equivalently be defined as the information leakage to adversaries aiming to minimize the probability of incorrectly guessing randomized functions of the secret. We study the properties of PMC and apply it to standard privacy mechanisms to demonstrate its practical relevance. Through a detailed examination, we connect PMC with other privacy measures that impose upper or lower bounds on the information density. Our results highlight that lower bounding the information density is a more stringent requirement than upper bounding it. Overall, our work significantly bridges the gaps in understanding the relationships between various privacy frameworks and provides insights for selecting a suitable framework for a given application.</description>

      <title>Data After Death: Australian User Preferences and Future Solutions to Protect Posthumous User Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The digital footprints of today's internet-active individuals are a testament to their lives, and have the potential to become digital legacies once they pass on. Future descendants of those alive today will greatly appreciate the unprecedented insight into the lives of their long since deceased ancestors, but this can only occur if today we have a process for data preservation and handover after death. Many prominent online platforms offer nebulous or altogether absent policies regarding posthumous data handling, and despite recent advances it is currently unclear who the average Australian would like their data to be managed after their death (i.e., social media platforms, a trusted individual, or another digital executor). While at present the management of deceased accounts is largely performed by the platform (e.g., Facebook), it is conceivable that many Australians may not trust such platforms to do so with integrity. This study aims to further the academic conversation around posthumous data by delving deeper into the preferences of the Australian Public regarding the management of their data after death, ultimately to inform future development of research programs and industry solutions. A survey of 1020 Australians revealed that most desired a level of control over how their data is managed after death. Australians currently prefer to entrust the management of their data to a trusted close individual or third party software that they can administrate themselves. As expected, social media companies ranked low regarding both trust and convenience to manage data after death. Future research focus should be to conceptualise and develop a third-party solution that enables these preferences to be realised. Such a solution could interface with the major online vendors (social media, cloud hosting etc.) to action the deceased's will.</description>

      <title>Protecting Privacy in Classifiers by Token Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using language models as a remote service entails sending private information to an untrusted provider. In addition, potential eavesdroppers can intercept the messages, thereby exposing the information. In this work, we explore the prospects of avoiding such data exposure at the level of text manipulation. We focus on text classification models, examining various token mapping and contextualized manipulation functions in order to see whether classifier accuracy may be maintained while keeping the original text unrecoverable. We find that although some token mapping functions are easy and straightforward to implement, they heavily influence performance on the downstream task, and via a sophisticated attacker can be reconstructed. In comparison, the contextualized manipulation provides an improvement in performance.</description>

Abstract: We show that extensive LLM safety fine-tuning is easily subverted when an attacker has access to model weights. We evaluate three state-of-the-art fine-tuning methods-QLoRA, ReFT, and Ortho-and show how algorithmic advances enable constant jailbreaking performance with cuts in FLOPs and optimisation power. We strip safety fine-tuning from Llama 3 8B in one minute and Llama 3 70B in 30 minutes on a single GPU, and sketch ways to reduce this further.</description>

      <title>M-to-N Backdoor Paradigm: A Multi-Trigger and Multi-Target Attack to Deep Learning Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.01875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.01875v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where a backdoored model behaves normally with clean inputs but exhibits attacker-specified behaviors upon the inputs containing triggers. Most previous backdoor attacks mainly focus on either the all-to-one or all-to-all paradigm, allowing attackers to manipulate an input to attack a single target class. Besides, the two paradigms rely on a single trigger for backdoor activation, rendering attacks ineffective if the trigger is destroyed. In light of the above, we propose a new $M$-to-$N$ attack paradigm that allows an attacker to manipulate any input to attack $N$ target classes, and each backdoor of the $N$ target classes can be activated by any one of its $M$ triggers. Our attack selects $M$ clean images from each target class as triggers and leverages our proposed poisoned image generation framework to inject the triggers into clean images invisibly. By using triggers with the same distribution as clean training images, the targeted DNN models can generalize to the triggers during training, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of our attack on multiple target classes. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our new backdoor attack is highly effective in attacking multiple target classes and robust against pre-processing operations and existing defenses.</description>

      <title>Extracting Protocol Format as State Machine via Controlled Static Loop Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.13483v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reverse engineering of protocol message formats is critical for many security applications. Mainstream techniques use dynamic analysis and inherit its low-coverage problem -- the inferred message formats only reflect the features of their inputs. To achieve high coverage, we choose to use static analysis to infer message formats from the implementation of protocol parsers. In this work, we focus on a class of extremely challenging protocols whose formats are described via constraint-enhanced regular expressions and parsed using finite-state machines. Such state machines are often implemented as complicated parsing loops, which are inherently difficult to analyze via conventional static analysis. Our new technique extracts a state machine by regarding each loop iteration as a state and the dependency between loop iterations as state transitions. To achieve high, i.e., path-sensitive, precision but avoid path explosion, the analysis is controlled to merge as many paths as possible based on carefully-designed rules. The evaluation results show that we can infer a state machine and, thus, the message formats, in five minutes with over 90% precision and recall, far better than state of the art. We also applied the state machines to enhance protocol fuzzers, which are improved by 20% to 230% in terms of coverage and detect ten more zero-days compared to baselines.</description>

      <title>Comparing AI Algorithms for Optimizing Elliptic Curve Cryptography Parameters in e-Commerce Integrations: A Pre-Quantum Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.06752v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a comparative analysis between the Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), two vital artificial intelligence algorithms, focusing on optimizing Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) parameters. These encompass the elliptic curve coefficients, prime number, generator point, group order, and cofactor. The study provides insights into which of the bio-inspired algorithms yields better optimization results for ECC configurations, examining performances under the same fitness function. This function incorporates methods to ensure robust ECC parameters, including assessing for singular or anomalous curves and applying Pollard's rho attack and Hasse's theorem for optimization precision. The optimized parameters generated by GA and PSO are tested in a simulated e-commerce environment, contrasting with well-known curves like secp256k1 during the transmission of order messages using Elliptic Curve-Diffie Hellman (ECDH) and Hash-based Message Authentication Code (HMAC). Focusing on traditional computing in the pre-quantum era, this research highlights the efficacy of GA and PSO in ECC optimization, with implications for enhancing cybersecurity in third-party e-commerce integrations. We recommend the immediate consideration of these findings before quantum computing's widespread adoption.</description>

      <title>A Two-Layer Blockchain Sharding Protocol Leveraging Safety and Liveness for Enhanced Performance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.11373v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sharding is essential for improving blockchain scalability. Existing protocols overlook diverse adversarial attacks, limiting transaction throughput. This paper presents Reticulum, a groundbreaking sharding protocol addressing this issue, boosting blockchain scalability.
  Reticulum employs a two-phase approach, adapting transaction throughput based on runtime adversarial attacks. It comprises "control" and "process" shards in two layers. Process shards contain at least one trustworthy node, while control shards have a majority of trusted nodes. In the first phase, transactions are written to blocks and voted on by nodes in process shards. Unanimously accepted blocks are confirmed. In the second phase, blocks without unanimous acceptance are voted on by control shards. Blocks are accepted if the majority votes in favor, eliminating first-phase opponents and silent voters. Reticulum uses unanimous voting in the first phase, involving fewer nodes, enabling more parallel process shards. Control shards finalize decisions and resolve disputes.
  Experiments confirm Reticulum's innovative design, providing high transaction throughput and robustness against various network attacks, outperforming existing sharding protocols for blockchain networks.</description>

      <title>sec-certs: Examining the security certification practice for better vulnerability mitigation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.17603v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Products certified under security certification frameworks such as Common Criteria undergo significant scrutiny during the costly certification process. Yet, critical vulnerabilities, including private key recovery (ROCA, Minerva, TPM-Fail...), get discovered in certified products with high assurance levels. Furthermore, assessing which certified products are impacted by such vulnerabilities is complicated due to the large amount of unstructured certification-related data and unclear relationships between the certified products. To address these problems, we conducted a large-scale automated analysis of Common Criteria certificates. We trained unsupervised models to learn which vulnerabilities from NIST's National Vulnerability Database impact existing certified products and how certified products reference each other. Our tooling automates the analysis of tens of thousands of certification-related documents, extracting machine-readable features where manual analysis is unattainable. Further, we identify the security requirements that are associated with products being affected by fewer and less severe vulnerabilities. This indicates which aspects of certification correlate with higher security. We demonstrate how our tool can be used for better vulnerability mitigation on four case studies of known, high-profile vulnerabilities. All tools and continuously updated results are available at https://seccerts.org</description>

      <title>Stealing Maggie's Secrets -- On the Challenges of IP Theft Through FPGA Reverse Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06195v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Intellectual Property (IP) theft is a cause of major financial and reputational damage, reportedly in the range of hundreds of billions of dollars annually in the U.S. alone. Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) are particularly exposed to IP theft, because their configuration file contains the IP in a proprietary format that can be mapped to a gate-level netlist with moderate effort. Despite this threat, the scientific understanding of this issue lacks behind reality, thereby preventing an in-depth assessment of IP theft from FPGAs in academia. We address this discrepancy through a real-world case study on a Lattice iCE40 FPGA found inside iPhone 7. Apple refers to this FPGA as Maggie. By reverse engineering the proprietary signal-processing algorithm implemented on Maggie, we generate novel insights into the actual efforts required to commit FPGA IP theft and the challenges an attacker faces on the way. Informed by our case study, we then introduce generalized netlist reverse engineering techniques that drastically reduce the required manual effort and are applicable across a diverse spectrum of FPGA implementations and architectures. We evaluate these techniques on six benchmarks that are representative of different FPGA applications and have been synthesized for Xilinx and Lattice FPGAs, as well as in an end-to-end white-box case study. Finally, we provide a comprehensive open-source tool suite of netlist reverse engineering techniques to foster future research, enable the community to perform realistic threat assessments, and facilitate the evaluation of novel countermeasures.</description>

      <title>Cross-silo Federated Learning with Record-level Personalized Differential Privacy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.16251v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enhanced by differential privacy has emerged as a popular approach to better safeguard the privacy of client-side data by protecting clients' contributions during the training process. Existing solutions typically assume a uniform privacy budget for all records and provide one-size-fits-all solutions that may not be adequate to meet each record's privacy requirement. In this paper, we explore the uncharted territory of cross-silo FL with record-level personalized differential privacy. We devise a novel framework named \textit{rPDP-FL}, employing a two-stage hybrid sampling scheme with both uniform client-level sampling and non-uniform record-level sampling to accommodate varying privacy requirements.
  A critical and non-trivial problem is how to determine the ideal per-record sampling probability $q$ given the personalized privacy budget $\varepsilon$. We introduce a versatile solution named \textit{Simulation-CurveFitting}, allowing us to uncover a significant insight into the nonlinear correlation between $q$ and $\varepsilon$ and derive an elegant mathematical model to tackle the problem. Our evaluation demonstrates that our solution can provide significant performance gains over the baselines that do not consider personalized privacy preservation.</description>

      <title>Privacy Impact Assessments in the Wild: A Scoping Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11193v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Privacy Impact Assessments (PIAs) offer a systematic process for assessing the privacy impacts of a project or system. As a privacy engineering strategy, PIAs are heralded as one of the main approaches to privacy by design, supporting the early identification of threats and controls. However, there is still a shortage of empirical evidence on their uptake and proven effectiveness in practice. To better understand the current state of literature and research, this paper provides a comprehensive Scoping Review (ScR) on the topic of PIAs "in the wild", following the well-established Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. As a result, this ScR includes 45 studies, providing an extensive synthesis of the existing body of knowledge, classifying types of research and publications, appraising the methodological quality of primary research, and summarising the positive and negative aspects of PIAs in practice, as reported by studies. This ScR also identifies significant research gaps (e.g., evidence gaps from contradictory results and methodological gaps from research design deficiencies), future research pathways, and implications for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers developing and evaluating PIA frameworks. As we conclude, there is still a significant need for more primary research on the topic, both qualitative and quantitative. A critical appraisal of qualitative studies (n=28) revealed deficiencies in the methodological quality, and only four quantitative studies were identified, suggesting that current primary research remains incipient. Nonetheless, PIAs can be regarded as a prominent sub-area in the broader field of Empirical Privacy Engineering, warranting further research toward more evidence-based practices.</description>

      <title>On Central Primitives for Quantum Cryptography with Classical Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17715v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent work has introduced the "Quantum-Computation Classical-Communication" (QCCC) (Chung et. al.) setting for cryptography. There has been some evidence that One Way Puzzles (OWPuzz) are the natural central cryptographic primitive for this setting (Khurana and Tomer). For a primitive to be considered central it should have several characteristics. It should be well behaved (which for this paper we will think of as having amplification, combiners, and universal constructions); it should be implied by a wide variety of other primitives; and it should be equivalent to some class of useful primitives. We present combiners, correctness and security amplification, and a universal construction for OWPuzz. Our proof of security amplification uses a new and cleaner version construction of EFI from OWPuzz (in comparison to the result of Khurana and Tomer) that generalizes to weak OWPuzz and is the most technically involved section of the paper. It was previously known that OWPuzz are implied by other primitives of interest including commitments, symmetric key encryption, one way state generators (OWSG), and therefore pseudorandom states (PRS). However we are able to rule out OWPuzz's equivalence to many of these primitives by showing a black box separation between general OWPuzz and a restricted class of OWPuzz (those with efficient verification, which we call EV-OWPuzz). We then show that EV-OWPuzz are also implied by most of these primitives, which separates them from OWPuzz as well. This separation also separates extending PRS from highly compressing PRS answering an open question of Ananth et. al.</description>

      <title>Time-Frequency Jointed Imperceptible Adversarial Attack to Brainprint Recognition with Deep Learning Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10021v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: EEG-based brainprint recognition with deep learning models has garnered much attention in biometric identification. Yet, studies have indicated vulnerability to adversarial attacks in deep learning models with EEG inputs. In this paper, we introduce a novel adversarial attack method that jointly attacks time-domain and frequency-domain EEG signals by employing wavelet transform. Different from most existing methods which only target time-domain EEG signals, our method not only takes advantage of the time-domain attack's potent adversarial strength but also benefits from the imperceptibility inherent in frequency-domain attack, achieving a better balance between attack performance and imperceptibility. Extensive experiments are conducted in both white- and grey-box scenarios and the results demonstrate that our attack method achieves state-of-the-art attack performance on three datasets and three deep-learning models. In the meanwhile, the perturbations in the signals attacked by our method are barely perceptible to the human visual system.</description>

Abstract: We present the first study of the robustness of existing watermarking techniques on Python code generated by large language models. Although existing works showed that watermarking can be robust for natural language, we show that it is easy to remove these watermarks on code by semantic-preserving transformations.</description>

      <title>Cutting through buggy adversarial example defenses: fixing 1 line of code breaks Sabre</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03672v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sabre is a defense to adversarial examples that was accepted at IEEE S&amp;P 2024. We first reveal significant flaws in the evaluation that point to clear signs of gradient masking. We then show the cause of this gradient masking: a bug in the original evaluation code. By fixing a single line of code in the original repository, we reduce Sabre's robust accuracy to 0%. In response to this, the authors modify the defense and introduce a new defense component not described in the original paper. But this fix contains a second bug; modifying one more line of code reduces robust accuracy to below baseline levels. After we released the first version of our paper online, the authors introduced another change to the defense; by commenting out one line of code during attack we reduce the robust accuracy to 0% again.</description>

      <title>Facilitating Feature and Topology Lightweighting: An Ethereum Transaction Graph Compression Method for Malicious Account Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08278v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ethereum has become one of the primary global platforms for cryptocurrency, playing an important role in promoting the diversification of the financial ecosystem. However, the relative lag in regulation has led to a proliferation of malicious activities in Ethereum, posing a serious threat to fund security. Existing regulatory methods usually detect malicious accounts through feature engineering or large-scale transaction graph mining. However, due to the immense scale of transaction data and malicious attacks, these methods suffer from inefficiency and low robustness during data processing and anomaly detection. In this regard, we propose an Ethereum Transaction Graph Compression method named TGC4Eth, which assists malicious account detection by lightweighting both features and topology of the transaction graph. At the feature level, we select transaction features based on their low importance to improve the robustness of the subsequent detection models against feature evasion attacks; at the topology level, we employ focusing and coarsening processes to compress the structure of the transaction graph, thereby improving both data processing and inference efficiency of detection models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TGC4Eth significantly improves the computational efficiency of existing detection models while preserving the connectivity of the transaction graph. Furthermore, TGC4Eth enables existing detection models to maintain stable performance and exhibit high robustness against feature evasion attacks.</description>

      <title>Watermarking Language Models for Many Adaptive Users</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11109v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study watermarking schemes for language models with provable guarantees. As we show, prior works offer no robustness guarantees against adaptive prompting: when a user queries a language model more than once, as even benign users do. And with just a single exception (Christ and Gunn, 2024), prior works are restricted to zero-bit watermarking: machine-generated text can be detected as such, but no additional information can be extracted from the watermark. Unfortunately, merely detecting AI-generated text may not prevent future abuses.
  We introduce multi-user watermarks, which allow tracing model-generated text to individual users or to groups of colluding users, even in the face of adaptive prompting. We construct multi-user watermarking schemes from undetectable, adaptively robust, zero-bit watermarking schemes (and prove that the undetectable zero-bit scheme of Christ, Gunn, and Zamir (2024) is adaptively robust). Importantly, our scheme provides both zero-bit and multi-user assurances at the same time. It detects shorter snippets just as well as the original scheme, and traces longer excerpts to individuals.
  The main technical component is a construction of message-embedding watermarks from zero-bit watermarks. Ours is the first generic reduction between watermarking schemes for language models. A challenge for such reductions is the lack of a unified abstraction for robustness -- that marked text is detectable even after edits. We introduce a new unifying abstraction called AEB-robustness. AEB-robustness provides that the watermark is detectable whenever the edited text "approximates enough blocks" of model-generated output.</description>

      <title>Breaking Free: Efficient Multi-Party Private Set Union Without Non-Collusion Assumptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07011v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-party private set union (MPSU) protocol enables $m$ $(m &gt; 2)$ parties, each holding a set, to collectively compute the union of their sets without revealing any additional information to other parties. There are two main categories of MPSU protocols: The first builds on public-key techniques. All existing works in this category involve a super-linear number of public-key operations, resulting in poor practical efficiency. The second builds on oblivious transfer and symmetric-key techniques. The only existing work in this category is proposed by Liu and Gao (ASIACRYPT 2023), which features the best concrete performance among all existing protocols, despite its super-linear computation and communication. Unfortunately, it does not achieve the standard semi-honest security, as it inherently relies on a non-collusion assumption, which is unlikely to hold in practice. Therefore, the problem of constructing a practical MPSU protocol based on oblivious transfer and symmetric-key techniques in standard semi-honest model remains open. Furthermore, there is no MPSU protocol achieving both linear computation and linear communication complexity, which leaves another unresolved problem. In this work, we resolve these two open problems. We propose the first MPSU protocol based on oblivious transfer and symmetric-key techniques in the standard semi-honest model. This protocol is $4.9-9.3 \times$ faster than Liu and Gao in the LAN setting. Concretely, our protocol requires only $3.6$ seconds in online phase for 3 parties with sets of $2^{20}$ items each. We propose the first MPSU protocol achieving both linear computation and linear communication complexity, based on public-key operations. This protocol has the lowest overall communication costs and shows a factor of $3.0-36.5\times$ improvement in terms of overall communication compared to Liu and Gao.</description>

      <title>Ents: An Efficient Three-party Training Framework for Decision Trees by Communication Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07948v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-party training frameworks for decision trees based on secure multi-party computation enable multiple parties to train high-performance models on distributed private data with privacy preservation. The training process essentially involves frequent dataset splitting according to the splitting criterion (e.g. Gini impurity). However, existing multi-party training frameworks for decision trees demonstrate communication inefficiency due to the following issues: (1) They suffer from huge communication overhead in securely splitting a dataset with continuous attributes. (2) They suffer from huge communication overhead due to performing almost all the computations on a large ring to accommodate the secure computations for the splitting criterion.
  In this paper, we are motivated to present an efficient three-party training framework, namely Ents, for decision trees by communication optimization. For the first issue, we present a series of training protocols based on the secure radix sort protocols to efficiently and securely split a dataset with continuous attributes. For the second issue, we propose an efficient share conversion protocol to convert shares between a small ring and a large ring to reduce the communication overhead incurred by performing almost all the computations on a large ring. Experimental results from eight widely used datasets show that Ents outperforms state-of-the-art frameworks by $5.5\times \sim 9.3\times$ in communication sizes and $3.9\times \sim 5.3\times$ in communication rounds. In terms of training time, Ents yields an improvement of $3.5\times \sim 6.7\times$. To demonstrate its practicality, Ents requires less than three hours to securely train a decision tree on a widely used real-world dataset (Skin Segmentation) with more than 245,000 samples in the WAN setting.</description>

      <title>Deciphering the Definition of Adversarial Robustness for post-hoc OOD Detectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15104v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs is critical for safely deploying deep learning models in real-world scenarios. In recent years, many OOD detectors have been developed, and even the benchmarking has been standardized, i.e. OpenOOD. The number of post-hoc detectors is growing fast and showing an option to protect a pre-trained classifier against natural distribution shifts, claiming to be ready for real-world scenarios. However, its efficacy in handling adversarial examples has been neglected in the majority of studies. This paper investigates the adversarial robustness of the 16 post-hoc detectors on several evasion attacks and discuss a roadmap towards adversarial defense in OOD detectors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17094v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Automated market makers (AMMs) are a form of decentralized cryptocurrency exchanges and considered a prime example of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) applications. Their popularity and high trading activity have resulted in millions of on-chain transactions leading to serious scalability issues. In this paper, we address the on-chain storage overhead problem of AMMs by utilizing a new sidechain architecture as a layer 2 solution, building a system called ammBoost. Our system reduces the amount of on-chain transactions, boosts throughput, and supports blockchain pruning. We devise several techniques to enable layer 2 processing for AMMs while preserving correctness and security of the underlying AMM. We also build a proof-of-concept of ammBoost for a Uniswap-inspired use case to empirically evaluate its performance. Our experiments show that ammBoost decreases the gas cost by 94.53% and the chain growth by at least 80%, and that it can support up to 500x of the daily traffic volume observed for Uniswap in practice.</description>

      <title>Protecting the 'Stop Using My Data' Right through Blockchain-assisted Evidence Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17694v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In order to provide personalized services to users, Internet-based platforms collect and utilize user-generated behavioral data. Although the 'stop using my data' right should be a fundamental data right, which allows individuals to request their personal data to be no longer utilized by online platforms, the existing preventive data protection measures (e.g., cryptographic data elimination, differential privacy) are unfortunately not applicable. This work aims to develop the first Evidence Generation Framework for deterring post-acquisition data right violations. We formulated the 'stop using my data' problem, which captures a vantage facet of the multi-faceted notion of 'right to be forgotten'. We designed and implemented the first blockchain-assisted system to generate evidence for deterring the violations of the 'stop using my data' right. Our system employs a novel two-stage evidence generation protocol whose efficacy is ensured by a newly proposed Lemma. To validate our framework, we conducted a case study on recommendation systems with systematic evaluation experiments using two real-world datasets: the measured success rate exceeds 99%.</description>

      <title>ASCENT: Amplifying Power Side-Channel Resilience via Learning &amp; Monte-Carlo Tree Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19549v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Power side-channel (PSC) analysis is pivotal for securing cryptographic hardware. Prior art focused on securing gate-level netlists obtained as-is from chip design automation, neglecting all the complexities and potential side-effects for security arising from the design automation process. That is, automation traditionally prioritizes power, performance, and area (PPA), sidelining security. We propose a "security-first" approach, refining the logic synthesis stage to enhance the overall resilience of PSC countermeasures. We introduce ASCENT, a learning-and-search-based framework that (i) drastically reduces the time for post-design PSC evaluation and (ii) explores the security-vs-PPA design space. Thus, ASCENT enables an efficient exploration of a large number of candidate netlists, leading to an improvement in PSC resilience compared to regular PPA-optimized netlists. ASCENT is up to 120x faster than traditional PSC analysis and yields a 3.11x improvement for PSC resilience of state-of-the-art PSC countermeasures</description>

      <title>Good Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill codes from the NTRU cryptosystem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.02432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.02432v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new class of random Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) codes derived from the cryptanalysis of the so-called NTRU cryptosystem. The derived codes are good in that they exhibit constant rate and average distance scaling $\Delta \propto \sqrt{n}$ with high probability, where $n$ is the number of bosonic modes, which is a distance scaling equivalent to that of a GKP code obtained by concatenating single mode GKP codes into a qubit-quantum error correcting code with linear distance. The derived class of NTRU-GKP codes has the additional property that decoding for a stochastic displacement noise model is equivalent to decrypting the NTRU cryptosystem, such that every random instance of the code naturally comes with an efficient decoder. This construction highlights how the GKP code bridges aspects of classical error correction, quantum error correction as well as post-quantum cryptography. We underscore this connection by discussing the computational hardness of decoding GKP codes and propose, as a new application, a simple public key quantum communication protocol with security inherited from the NTRU cryptosystem.</description>

      <title>On the evolution of data breach reporting patterns and frequency in the United States: a cross-state analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.04786v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the emergence of data breaches is crucial for cyber insurance. However, analyses of data breach frequency trends in the current literature lead to contradictory conclusions. We put forward that those discrepancies may be (at least partially) due to inconsistent data collection standards, as well as reporting patterns, over time and space. We set out to carefully control both. In this paper, we conduct a joint analysis of state Attorneys General's publications on data breaches across eight states (namely, California, Delaware, Indiana, Maine, Montana, North Dakota, Oregon, and Washington), all of which are subject to established data collection standards-namely, state data breach (mandatory) notification laws. Thanks to our explicit recognition of these notification laws, we are capable of modelling frequency of breaches in a consistent and comparable way over time. Hence, we are able to isolate and capture the complexities of reporting patterns, adequately estimate IBNRs, and yield a highly reliable assessment of historical frequency trends in data breaches. Our analysis also provides a comprehensive comparison of data breach frequency across the eight U.S. states, extending knowledge on state-specific differences in cyber risk, which has not been extensively discussed in the current literature. Furthermore, we uncover novel features not previously discussed in the literature, such as differences in cyber risk frequency trends between large and small data breaches. Overall, we find that the reporting delays are lengthening. We also elicit commonalities and heterogeneities in reporting patterns across states, severity levels, and time periods. After adequately estimating IBNRs, we find that frequency is relatively stable before 2020 and increasing after 2020. This is consistent across states. Implications of our findings for cyber insurance are discussed.</description>

      <title>Can LLMs Keep a Secret? Testing Privacy Implications of Language Models via Contextual Integrity Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.17884v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The interactive use of large language models (LLMs) in AI assistants (at work, home, etc.) introduces a new set of inference-time privacy risks: LLMs are fed different types of information from multiple sources in their inputs and are expected to reason about what to share in their outputs, for what purpose and with whom, within a given context. In this work, we draw attention to the highly critical yet overlooked notion of contextual privacy by proposing ConfAIde, a benchmark designed to identify critical weaknesses in the privacy reasoning capabilities of instruction-tuned LLMs. Our experiments show that even the most capable models such as GPT-4 and ChatGPT reveal private information in contexts that humans would not, 39% and 57% of the time, respectively. This leakage persists even when we employ privacy-inducing prompts or chain-of-thought reasoning. Our work underscores the immediate need to explore novel inference-time privacy-preserving approaches, based on reasoning and theory of mind.</description>

      <title>SECOMP: Formally Secure Compilation of Compartmentalized C Programs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.16277v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Undefined behavior in C often causes devastating security vulnerabilities. One practical mitigation is compartmentalization, which allows developers to structure large programs into mutually distrustful compartments with clearly specified privileges and interactions. In this paper we introduce SECOMP, a compiler for compartmentalized C code that comes with machine-checked proofs guaranteeing that the scope of undefined behavior is restricted to the compartments that encounter it and become dynamically compromised. These guarantees are formalized as the preservation of safety properties against adversarial contexts, a secure compilation criterion similar to full abstraction, and this is the first time such a strong criterion is proven for a mainstream programming language. To achieve this we extend the languages of the CompCert verified C compiler with isolated compartments that can only interact via procedure calls and returns, as specified by cross-compartment interfaces. We adapt the passes and optimizations of CompCert as well as their correctness proofs to this compartment-aware setting. We then use compiler correctness as an ingredient in a larger secure compilation proof that involves several proof engineering novelties, needed to scale formally secure compilation up to a C compiler.</description>

      <title>Recovering the Pre-Fine-Tuning Weights of Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10208v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dominant paradigm in generative modeling consists of two steps: i) pre-training on a large-scale but unsafe dataset, ii) aligning the pre-trained model with human values via fine-tuning. This practice is considered safe, as no current method can recover the unsafe, pre-fine-tuning model weights. In this paper, we demonstrate that this assumption is often false. Concretely, we present Spectral DeTuning, a method that can recover the weights of the pre-fine-tuning model using a few low-rank (LoRA) fine-tuned models. In contrast to previous attacks that attempt to recover pre-fine-tuning capabilities, our method aims to recover the exact pre-fine-tuning weights. Our approach exploits this new vulnerability against large-scale models such as a personalized Stable Diffusion and an aligned Mistral.</description>

Abstract: Cryptocurrencies have evolved into an important asset class, providing a variety of benefits. However, they also present significant risks, such as market volatility and the potential for misuse in illegal activities. These risks underline the urgent need for a comprehensive regulatory framework to ensure consumer protection, market integrity, and financial stability. Yet, the global landscape of cryptocurrency regulation remains complex, marked by substantial variations in regulatory frameworks among different countries. This paper aims to study these differences by investigating the regulatory landscapes across various jurisdictions. We first discuss regulatory challenges and considerations, and then conduct a comparative analysis of international regulatory stances, approaches, and measures. We hope our study offers practical insights to enhance the understanding of global trends in cryptocurrency regulation.</description>

      <title>Jailbreak Vision Language Models via Bi-Modal Adversarial Prompt</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04031</link>

Abstract: In the realm of large vision language models (LVLMs), jailbreak attacks serve as a red-teaming approach to bypass guardrails and uncover safety implications. Existing jailbreaks predominantly focus on the visual modality, perturbing solely visual inputs in the prompt for attacks. However, they fall short when confronted with aligned models that fuse visual and textual features simultaneously for generation. To address this limitation, this paper introduces the Bi-Modal Adversarial Prompt Attack (BAP), which executes jailbreaks by optimizing textual and visual prompts cohesively. Initially, we adversarially embed universally harmful perturbations in an image, guided by a few-shot query-agnostic corpus (e.g., affirmative prefixes and negative inhibitions). This process ensures that image prompt LVLMs to respond positively to any harmful queries. Subsequently, leveraging the adversarial image, we optimize textual prompts with specific harmful intent. In particular, we utilize a large language model to analyze jailbreak failures and employ chain-of-thought reasoning to refine textual prompts through a feedback-iteration manner. To validate the efficacy of our approach, we conducted extensive evaluations on various datasets and LVLMs, demonstrating that our method significantly outperforms other methods by large margins (+29.03% in attack success rate on average). Additionally, we showcase the potential of our attacks on black-box commercial LVLMs, such as Gemini and ChatGLM.</description>
