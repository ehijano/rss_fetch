      <title>Implementation of high-efficiency, lightweight residual spiking neural network processor based on field-programmable gate arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the development of hardware-optimized deployment of spiking neural networks (SNNs), SNN processors based on field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) have become a research hotspot due to their efficiency and flexibility. However, existing methods rely on multi-timestep training and reconfigurable computing architectures, which increases computational and memory overhead, thus reducing deployment efficiency. This work presents an efficient and lightweight residual SNN accelerator that combines algorithm and hardware co-design to optimize inference energy efficiency. In terms of the algorithm, we employ single-timesteps training, integrate grouped convolutions, and fuse batch normalization (BN) layers, thus compressing the network to only 0.69M parameters. Quantization-aware training (QAT) further constrains all parameters to 8-bit precision. In terms of hardware, the reuse of intra-layer resources maximizes FPGA utilization, a full pipeline cross-layer architecture improves throughput, and on-chip block RAM (BRAM) stores network parameters and intermediate results to improve memory efficiency. The experimental results show that the proposed processor achieves a classification accuracy of 87.11% on the CIFAR-10 dataset, with an inference time of 3.98 ms per image and an energy efficiency of 183.5 FPS/W. Compared with mainstream graphics processing unit (GPU) platforms, it achieves more than double the energy efficiency. Furthermore, compared with other SNN processors, it achieves at least a 4x faster inference speed and a 5x higher energy efficiency.</description>

      <title>Optimal Traffic Relief Road Design using Bilevel Programming and Greedy Seeded Simulated Annealing: A Case Study of Kinshasa</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context: The city of Kinshasa faces severe traffic congestion, requiring strategic infrastructure capacity enhancements. Although a comprehensive master plan has been proposed, its implementation requires substantial financial investment, which remains constrained in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), an emerging economy. This research proposes a traffic flow based algorithm to support the development of priority road segments. The objective is to enable more effective prioritisation of road construction projects and facilitate the optimal allocation of limited infrastructure budgets.
  Methods: The study was conducted by formulating a standard transport network design problem (TNDP) that included estimated origin demand data specific to the city of Kinshasa. Given the high computational nature of the 30 node network design, TNDP relevant metaheuristics (GA, ACO, PSO, SA, TS, Greedy) were used selectively and hybridised to achieve high quality, stable solutions. A greedy search seeded simulated annealing and Tabu search were devised to achieve the design goals.
  Results: Greedy Simulated Annealing and Greedy Tabu search yielded the best travel time reduction and the most stable solutions compared to other solvers, also improving network edge betweenness centrality by nearly a scale of two and a half.
  Conclusions: Road priorities were proposed, including junctions connecting the Bandundu and Kongo Central entry point to main attraction centres (Limete Poids Lourd, Gombe, Airport) and additional inner city areas (Ngaliema, Selembao, Lemba, Masina, Kimwenza).</description>

      <title>ChronoPlastic Spiking Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer a biologically grounded and energy-efficient alternative to conventional neural architectures; however, they struggle with long-range temporal dependencies due to fixed synaptic and membrane time constants. This paper introduces ChronoPlastic Spiking Neural Networks (CPSNNs), a novel architectural principle that enables adaptive temporal credit assignment by dynamically modulating synaptic decay rates conditioned on the state of the network. CPSNNs maintain multiple internal temporal traces and learn a continuous time-warping function that selectively preserves task-relevant information while rapidly forgetting noise. Unlike prior approaches based on adaptive membrane constants, attention mechanisms, or external memory, CPSNNs embed temporal control directly within local synaptic dynamics, preserving linear-time complexity and neuromorphic compatibility. We provide a formal description of the model, analyze its computational properties, and demonstrate empirically that CPSNNs learn long-gap temporal dependencies significantly faster and more reliably than standard SNN baselines. Our results suggest that adaptive temporal modulation is a key missing ingredient for scalable temporal learning in spiking systems.</description>

      <title>Energy-Efficient Eimeria Parasite Detection Using a Two-Stage Spiking Neural Network Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coccidiosis, a disease caused by the Eimeria parasite, represents a major threat to the poultry and rabbit industries, demanding rapid and accurate diagnostic tools. While deep learning models offer high precision, their significant energy consumption limits their deployment in resource-constrained environments. This paper introduces a novel two-stage Spiking Neural Network (SNN) architecture, where a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network is first converted into a spiking feature extractor and then coupled with a lightweight, unsupervised SNN classifier trained with Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity (STDP). The proposed model sets a new state-of-the-art, achieving 98.32\% accuracy in Eimeria classification. Remarkably, this performance is accomplished with a significant reduction in energy consumption, showing an improvement of more than 223 times compared to its traditional ANN counterpart. This work demonstrates a powerful synergy between high accuracy and extreme energy efficiency, paving the way for autonomous, low-power diagnostic systems on neuromorphic hardware.</description>

      <title>Evolutionary optimization of spatially-distributed multi-sensors placement for indoor surveillance environments with security levels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The surveillance multisensor placement is an important optimization problem that consists of positioning several sensors of different types to maximize the coverage of a determined area while minimizing the cost of the deployment. In this work, we tackle a modified version of the problem, consisting of spatially distributed multisensor placement for indoor surveillance. Our approach is focused on security surveillance of sensible indoor spaces, such as military installations, where distinct security levels can be considered. We propose an evolutionary algorithm to solve the problem, in which a novel special encoding,integer encoding with binary conversion, and effective initialization have been defined to improve the performance and convergence of the proposed algorithm. We also consider the probability of detection for each surveillance point, which depends on the distance to the sensor at hand, to better model real-life scenarios. We have tested the proposed evolutionary approach in different instances of the problem, varying both size and difficulty, and obtained excellent results in terms of the cost of sensors placement and convergence time of the algorithm.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Continuous Dynamic Multi-Objective Optimization: Survey and Generalized Test Suite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic multi-objective optimization (DMOO) has recently attracted increasing interest from both academic researchers and engineering practitioners, as numerous real-world applications that evolve over time can be naturally formulated as dynamic multi-objective optimization problems (DMOPs). This growing trend necessitates advanced benchmarks for the rigorous evaluation of optimization algorithms under realistic conditions. This paper introduces a comprehensive and principled framework for constructing highly realistic and challenging DMOO benchmarks. The proposed framework features several novel components: a generalized formulation that allows the Pareto-optimal Set (PS) to change on hypersurfaces, a mechanism for creating controlled variable contribution imbalances to generate heterogeneous landscapes, and dynamic rotation matrices for inducing time-varying variable interactions and non-separability. Furthermore, we incorporate a temporal perturbation mechanism to simulate irregular environmental changes and propose a generalized time-linkage mechanism that systematically embeds historical solution quality into future problems, thereby capturing critical real-world phenomena such as error accumulation and time-deception. Extensive experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, demonstrating its superiority over conventional benchmarks in terms of realism, complexity, and its capability for discriminating state-of-the-art algorithmic performance. This work establishes a new standard for dynamic multi-objective optimization benchmarking, providing a powerful tool for the development and evaluation of next-generation algorithms capable of addressing the complexities of real-world dynamic systems.</description>

      <title>STEMNIST: Spiking Tactile Extended MNIST Neuromorphic Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tactile sensing is essential for robotic manipulation, prosthetics and assistive technologies, yet neuromorphic tactile datasets remain limited compared to their visual counterparts. We introduce STEMNIST, a large-scale neuromorphic tactile dataset extending ST-MNIST from 10 digits to 35 alphanumeric classes (uppercase letters A--Z and digits 1--9), providing a challenging benchmark for event-based haptic recognition. The dataset comprises 7,700 samples collected from 34 participants using a custom \(16\times 16\) tactile sensor array operating at 120 Hz, encoded as 1,005,592 spike events through adaptive temporal differentiation. Following EMNIST's visual character recognition protocol, STEMNIST addresses the critical gap between simplified digit classification and real-world tactile interaction scenarios requiring alphanumeric discrimination. Baseline experiments using conventional CNNs (90.91% test accuracy) and spiking neural networks (89.16%) establish performance benchmarks. The dataset's event-based format, unrestricted spatial variability and rich temporal structure makes it suitable for testing neuromorphic hardware and bio-inspired learning algorithms. STEMNIST enables reproducible evaluation of tactile recognition systems and provides a foundation for advancing energy-efficient neuromorphic perception in robotics, biomedical engineering and human-machine interfaces. The dataset, documentation and codes are publicly available to accelerate research in neuromorphic tactile computing.</description>

      <title>Yukthi Opus: A Multi-Chain Hybrid Metaheuristic for Large-Scale NP-Hard Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Yukthi Opus (YO), a multi-chain hybrid metaheuristic designed for NP-hard optimization under explicit evaluation budget constraints. YO integrates three complementary mechanisms in a structured two-phase architecture: Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) for global exploration, greedy local search for exploitation, and simulated annealing with adaptive reheating to enable controlled escape from local minima. A dedicated burn-in phase allocates evaluations to probabilistic exploration, after which a hybrid optimization loop refines promising candidates. YO further incorporates a spatial blacklist mechanism to avoid repeated evaluation of poor regions and a multi-chain execution strategy to improve robustness and reduce sensitivity to initialization.
  We evaluate YO on three benchmarks: the Rastrigin function (5D) with ablation studies, the Traveling Salesman Problem with 50 to 200 cities, and the Rosenbrock function (5D) with comparisons against established optimizers including CMA-ES, Bayesian optimization, and accelerated particle swarm optimization. Results show that MCMC exploration and greedy refinement are critical for solution quality, while simulated annealing and multi-chain execution primarily improve stability and variance reduction. Overall, YO achieves competitive performance on large and multimodal problems while maintaining predictable evaluation budgets, making it suitable for expensive black-box optimization settings.</description>

      <title>Multi-strategy Improved Northern Goshawk Optimization for WSN Coverage Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To enhance the coverage rate of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), this paper proposes an advanced optimization strategy based on a multi-strategy integrated Northern Goshawk Optimization (NGO) algorithm. Specifically, multivariate chaotic mapping is first employed to improve the randomness and uniformity of the initial population. To further bolster population diversity and prevent the algorithm from stagnating in local optima, a bidirectional population evolutionary dynamics strategy is incorporated following the pursuit-and-evasion phase, thereby facilitating the attainment of the global optimal solution. Extensive simulations were conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed multi-strategy NGO in WSN coverage. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms existing benchmarks in terms of both coverage enhancement and node connectivity.</description>

      <title>Toward Thermodynamic Reservoir Computing: Exploring SHA-256 ASICs as Potential Physical Substrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a theoretical framework--Holographic Reservoir Computing (HRC)--which hypothesizes that the thermodynamic noise and timing dynamics in voltage-stressed Bitcoin mining ASICs (BM1366) could potentially serve as a physical reservoir computing substrate. We present the CHIMERA (Conscious Hybrid Intelligence via Miner-Embedded Resonance Architecture) system architecture, which treats the SHA-256 hashing pipeline not as an entropy source, but as a deterministic diffusion operator whose timing characteristics under controlled voltage and frequency conditions may exhibit computationally useful dynamics. We report preliminary observations of non-Poissonian variability in inter-arrival time statistics during edge-of-stability operation, which we term the "Silicon Heartbeat" hypothesis. Theoretical analysis based on Hierarchical Number System (HNS) representations suggests that such architectures could achieve O(log n) energy scaling compared to traditional von Neumann O(2^n) dependencies. However, we emphasize that these are theoretical projections requiring experimental validation. We present the implemented measurement infrastructure, acknowledge current limitations, and outline the experimental program necessary to confirm or refute these hypotheses. This work contributes to the emerging field of thermodynamic computing by proposing a novel approach to repurposing obsolete cryptographic hardware for neuromorphic applications.</description>

      <title>Discount Model Search for Quality Diversity Optimization in High-Dimensional Measure Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quality diversity (QD) optimization searches for a collection of solutions that optimize an objective while attaining diverse outputs of a user-specified, vector-valued measure function. Contemporary QD algorithms focus on low-dimensional measures because high-dimensional measures are prone to distortion, where many solutions found by the QD algorithm map to similar measures. For example, the CMA-MAE algorithm guides measure space exploration with a histogram in measure space that records so-called discount values. However, CMA-MAE stagnates in domains with high-dimensional measure spaces because solutions with similar measures fall into the same histogram cell and thus receive identical discount values. To address these limitations, we propose Discount Model Search (DMS), which guides exploration with a model that provides a smooth, continuous representation of discount values. In high-dimensional measure spaces, this model enables DMS to distinguish between solutions with similar measures and thus continue exploration. We show that DMS facilitates new QD applications by introducing two domains where the measure space is the high-dimensional space of images, which enables users to specify their desired measures by providing a dataset of images rather than hand-designing the measure function. Results in these domains and on high-dimensional benchmarks show that DMS outperforms CMA-MAE and other black-box QD algorithms.</description>

      <title>Evo-TFS: Evolutionary Time-Frequency Domain-Based Synthetic Minority Oversampling Approach to Imbalanced Time Series Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time series classification is a fundamental machine learning task with broad real-world applications. Although many deep learning methods have proven effective in learning time-series data for classification, they were originally developed under the assumption of balanced data distributions. Once data distribution is uneven, these methods tend to ignore the minority class that is typically of higher practical significance. Oversampling methods have been designed to address this by generating minority-class samples, but their reliance on linear interpolation often hampers the preservation of temporal dynamics and the generation of diverse samples. Therefore, in this paper, we propose Evo-TFS, a novel evolutionary oversampling method that integrates both time- and frequency-domain characteristics. In Evo-TFS, strongly typed genetic programming is employed to evolve diverse, high-quality time series, guided by a fitness function that incorporates both time-domain and frequency-domain characteristics. Experiments conducted on imbalanced time series datasets demonstrate that Evo-TFS outperforms existing oversampling methods, significantly enhancing the performance of time-domain and frequency-domain classifiers.</description>

      <title>A Wachspress-based transfinite formulation for exactly enforcing Dirichlet boundary conditions on convex polygonal domains in physics-informed neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a Wachspress-based transfinite formulation on convex polygonal domains for exact enforcement of Dirichlet boundary conditions in physics-informed neural networks. This approach leverages prior advances in geometric design such as blending functions and transfinite interpolation over convex domains. For prescribed Dirichlet boundary function $\mathcal{B}$, the transfinite interpolant of $\mathcal{B}$, $g : \bar P \to C^0(\bar P)$, $\textit{lifts}$ functions from the boundary of a two-dimensional polygonal domain to its interior. The trial function is expressed as the difference between the neural network's output and the extension of its boundary restriction into the interior of the domain, with $g$ added to it. This ensures kinematic admissibility of the trial function in the deep Ritz method. Wachspress coordinates for an $n$-gon are used in the transfinite formula, which generalizes bilinear Coons transfinite interpolation on rectangles to convex polygons. The neural network trial function has a bounded Laplacian, thereby overcoming a limitation in a previous contribution where approximate distance functions were used to exactly enforce Dirichlet boundary conditions. For a point $\boldsymbol{x} \in \bar{P}$, Wachspress coordinates, $\boldsymbol{\lambda} : \bar P \to [0,1]^n$, serve as a geometric feature map for the neural network: $\boldsymbol{\lambda}$ encodes the boundary edges of the polygonal domain. This offers a framework for solving problems on parametrized convex geometries using neural networks. The accuracy of physics-informed neural networks and deep Ritz is assessed on forward, inverse, and parametrized geometric Poisson boundary-value problems.</description>

      <title>SerpentFlow: Generative Unpaired Domain Alignment via Shared-Structure Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Domain alignment refers broadly to learning correspondences between data distributions from distinct domains. In this work, we focus on a setting where domains share underlying structural patterns despite differences in their specific realizations. The task is particularly challenging in the absence of paired observations, which removes direct supervision across domains. We introduce a generative framework, called SerpentFlow (SharEd-structuRe decomPosition for gEnerative domaiN adapTation), for unpaired domain alignment. SerpentFlow decomposes data within a latent space into a shared component common to both domains and a domain-specific one. By isolating the shared structure and replacing the domain-specific component with stochastic noise, we construct synthetic training pairs between shared representations and target-domain samples, thereby enabling the use of conditional generative models that are traditionally restricted to paired settings. We apply this approach to super-resolution tasks, where the shared component naturally corresponds to low-frequency content while high-frequency details capture domain-specific variability. The cutoff frequency separating low- and high-frequency components is determined automatically using a classifier-based criterion, ensuring a data-driven and domain-adaptive decomposition. By generating pseudo-pairs that preserve low-frequency structures while injecting stochastic high-frequency realizations, we learn the conditional distribution of the target domain given the shared representation. We implement SerpentFlow using Flow Matching as the generative pipeline, although the framework is compatible with other conditional generative approaches. Experiments on synthetic images, physical process simulations, and a climate downscaling task demonstrate that the method effectively reconstructs high-frequency structures consistent with underlying low-frequency patterns, supporting shared-structure decomposition as an effective strategy for unpaired domain alignment.</description>

      <title>Modelling the emergence of open-ended cultural evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04828v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Humans stand alone in terms of their potential to collectively and cumulatively change their culture in an open-ended manner. This open-endedness provides societies with the ability to continually expand their resources and to increase their capacity to store, transmit and process information at a collective-level. Here, we propose that the production of resources arises from the interaction between cultural systems (a society's repertoire of interdependent techniques, artifacts, norms and knowledge) and search spaces (an ensemble of needs, problems and goals facing a society). Starting from this premise we develop a macro-level model wherein both cultural systems and search spaces are subject to evolutionary dynamics. By manipulating the extent to which these dynamics are characterised by stochastic or selection-like processes, we demonstrate that open-ended growth is extremely rare, historically contingent and only possible when cultural systems and search spaces co-evolve. Here, stochastic factors must be strong enough to continually perturb the dynamics into a far-from-equilibrium state, whereas selection-like factors help maintain effectiveness and ensure the sustained production of resources. Only when this co-evolutionary dynamic maintains effective cultural systems, supports the ongoing expansion of the search space and leads to an increased provision of resources do we observe open-ended cultural evolution.</description>

      <title>Improved Runtime Guarantees for the SPEA2 Multi-Objective Optimizer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07150v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Together with the NSGA-II, the SPEA2 is one of the most widely used domination-based multi-objective evolutionary algorithms. For both algorithms, the known runtime guarantees are linear in the population size; for the NSGA-II, matching lower bounds exist. With a careful study of the more complex selection mechanism of the SPEA2, we show that it has very different population dynamics. From these, we prove runtime guarantees for the OneMinMax, LeadingOnesTrailingZeros, and OneJumpZeroJump benchmarks that depend less on the population size. For example, we show that the SPEA2 with parent population size $\mu \ge n - 2k + 3$ and offspring population size $\lambda$ computes the Pareto front of the OneJumpZeroJump benchmark with gap size $k$ in an expected number of $O( (\lambda+\mu)n + n^{k+1})$ function evaluations. This shows that the best runtime guarantee of $O(n^{k+1})$ is not only achieved for $\mu = \Theta(n)$ and $\lambda = O(n)$ but for arbitrary $\mu, \lambda = O(n^k)$. Thus, choosing suitable parameters -- a key challenge in using heuristic algorithms -- is much easier for the SPEA2 than the NSGA-II.</description>

      <title>MD-SNN: Membrane Potential-aware Distillation on Quantized Spiking Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04443v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer a promising and energy-efficient alternative to conventional neural networks, thanks to their sparse binary activation. However, they face challenges regarding memory and computation overhead due to complex spatio-temporal dynamics and the necessity for multiple backpropagation computations across timesteps during training. To mitigate this overhead, compression techniques such as quantization are applied to SNNs. Yet, naively applying quantization to SNNs introduces a mismatch in membrane potential, a crucial factor for the firing of spikes, resulting in accuracy degradation. In this paper, we introduce Membrane-aware Distillation on quantized Spiking Neural Network (MD-SNN), which leverages membrane potential to mitigate discrepancies after weight, membrane potential, and batch normalization quantization. To our knowledge, this study represents the first application of membrane potential knowledge distillation in SNNs. We validate our approach on various datasets, including CIFAR10, CIFAR100, N-Caltech101, and TinyImageNet, demonstrating its effectiveness for both static and dynamic data scenarios. Furthermore, for hardware efficiency, we evaluate the MD-SNN with SpikeSim platform, finding that MD-SNNs achieve 14.85X lower energy-delay-area product (EDAP), 2.64X higher TOPS/W, and 6.19X higher TOPS/mm2 compared to floating point SNNs at iso-accuracy on N-Caltech101 dataset.</description>

      <title>Identification of fixations and saccades in eye-tracking data using adaptive threshold-based method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23926v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Properties of ocular fixations and saccades are highly stochastic during many experimental tasks, and their statistics are often used as proxies for various aspects of cognition. Although distinguishing saccades from fixations is not trivial, experimentalists generally use common ad-hoc thresholds in detection algorithms. This neglects inter-task and inter-individual variability in oculomotor dynamics, and potentially biases the resulting statistics. In this article, we introduce and evaluate an adaptive method based on a Markovian approximation of eye-gaze dynamics, using saccades and fixations as states such that the optimal threshold minimizes state transitions. Applying this to three common threshold-based algorithms (velocity, angular velocity, and dispersion), we evaluate the overall accuracy against a multi-threshold benchmark as well as robustness to noise. We find that a velocity threshold achieves the highest baseline accuracy (90-93\%) across both free-viewing and visual search tasks. However, velocity-based methods degrade rapidly under noise when thresholds remain fixed, with accuracy falling below 20% at high noise levels. Adaptive threshold optimization via K-ratio minimization substantially improves performance under noisy conditions for all algorithms. Adaptive dispersion thresholds demonstrate superior noise robustness, maintaining accuracy above 81% even at extreme noise levels ({\sigma} = 50 px), though a precision-recall trade-off emerges that favors fixation detection at the expense of saccade identification. In addition to demonstrating our parsimonious adaptive thresholding method, these findings provide practical guidance for selecting and tuning classification algorithms based on data quality and analytical priorities.</description>

      <title>Personalized Spiking Neural Networks with Ferroelectric Synapses for EEG Signal Processing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.00020v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are strongly affected by non-stationary neural signals that vary across sessions and individuals, limiting the generalization of subject-agnostic models and motivating adaptive and personalized learning on resource-constrained platforms. Programmable memristive hardware offers a promising substrate for such post-deployment adaptation; however, practical realization is challenged by limited weight resolution, device variability, nonlinear programming dynamics, and finite device endurance. In this work, we show that spiking neural networks (SNNs) can be deployed on ferroelectric memristive synaptic devices for adaptive EEG-based motor imagery decoding under realistic device constraints. We fabricate, characterize, and model ferroelectric synapses. We evaluate a convolutional-recurrent SNN architecture under two complementary deployment strategies: (i) device-aware training using a ferroelectric synapse model, and (ii) transfer of software-trained weights followed by low-overhead on-device re-tuning. To enable efficient adaptation, we introduce a device-aware weight-update strategy in which gradient-based updates are accumulated digitally and converted into discrete programming events only when a threshold is exceeded, emulating nonlinear, state-dependent programming dynamics while reducing programming frequency. Both deployment strategies achieve classification performance comparable to state-of-the-art software-based SNNs. Furthermore, subject-specific transfer learning achieved by retraining only the final network layers improves classification accuracy. These results demonstrate that programmable ferroelectric hardware can support robust, low-overhead adaptation in spiking neural networks, opening a practical path toward personalized neuromorphic processing of neural signals.</description>

      <title>Geometry-induced Regularization in Deep ReLU Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08269v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural networks with a large number of parameters often do not overfit, owing to implicit regularization that favors \lq good\rq{} networks. Other related and puzzling phenomena include properties of flat minima, saddle-to-saddle dynamics, and neuron alignment. To investigate these phenomena, we study the local geometry of deep ReLU neural networks. We show that, for a fixed architecture, as the weights vary, the image of a sample $X$ forms a set whose local dimension changes. The parameter space is partitioned into regions where this local dimension remains constant. The local dimension is invariant under the natural symmetries of ReLU networks (i.e., positive rescalings and neuron permutations). We establish then that the network's geometry induces a regularization, with the local dimension serving as a key measure of regularity. Moreover, we relate the local dimension to a new notion of flatness of minima and to saddle-to-saddle dynamics. For shallow networks, we also show that the local dimension is connected to the number of linear regions perceived by $X$, offering insight into the effects of regularization. This is further supported by experiments and linked to neuron alignment. Our analysis offers, for the first time, a simple and unified geometric explanation that applies to all learning contexts for these phenomena, which are usually studied in isolation. Finally, we explore the practical computation of the local dimension and present experiments on the MNIST dataset, which highlight geometry-induced regularization in this setting.</description>

      <title>Squintability and Other Metrics for Assessing Projection Pursuit Indexes, and Guiding Optimization Choices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13663v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The projection pursuit (PP) guided tour optimizes a criterion function, known as the PP index, to gradually reveal projections of interest from high-dimensional data through animation. Optimization of some PP indexes can be non-trivial, if they are non-smooth functions, or when the optimum has a small "squint angle", detectable only from close proximity. Here, measures for calculating the smoothness and squintability properties of the PP index are defined. These are used to investigate the performance of a recently introduced swarm-based algorithm, Jellyfish Search Optimizer (JSO), for optimizing PP indexes. The performance of JSO in detecting the target pattern (pipe shape) is compared with existing optimizers in PP. Additionally, JSO's performance on detecting the sine-wave shape is evaluated using different PP indexes (hence different smoothness and squintability) across various data dimensions (d = 4, 6, 8, 10, 12) and JSO hyper-parameters. We observe empirically that higher squintability improves the success rate of the PP index optimization, while smoothness has no significant effect. The JSO algorithm has been implemented in the R package, `tourr`, and functions to calculate smoothness and squintability measures are implemented in the `ferrn` package.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.25781v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), whose design is inspired-rather than dictated-by the Kolmogorov superposition theorem, have emerged as a structured alternative to MLPs. This review provides a systematic and comprehensive overview of the rapidly expanding KAN literature.
  The review is organized around three core themes: (i) clarifying the relationships between KANs and Kolmogorov superposition theory (KST), MLPs, and classical kernel methods; (ii) analyzing basis functions as a central design axis; and (iii) summarizing recent advances in accuracy, efficiency, regularization, and convergence.
  Finally, we provide a practical "Choose-Your-KAN" guide and outline open research challenges and future directions. The accompanying GitHub repository serves as a structured reference for ongoing KAN research.</description>

      <title>SIP-BMM: Constructing the Capability--Efficiency Pareto Set for LLMs via Structural Importance Prior Bayesian Model Merging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09972v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Constructing a Pareto set is pivotal for navigating the capability--efficiency trade-offs in Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing merging techniques remain inadequate for this task. Coarse-grained, model-level methods yield only a sparse set of suboptimal solutions, while fine-grained, layer-wise approaches suffer from the curse of dimensionality, rendering the search space computationally intractable. To resolve this dichotomy, we propose Structural Importance Prior Bayesian Model Merging (SIP-BMM), a framework that automatically constructs the LLM Pareto set. SIP-BMM renders high-dimensional layer-wise search tractable by introducing an importance-aware Sparse Axis-Aligned Subspace Bayesian Optimization (SAASBO) strategy. By leveraging a structural importance prior derived from task-vector differences, our method guides SAASBO to automatically identify critical layers, thereby dramatically reducing the effective dimensionality without sacrificing the granularity of full-model control. The entire process is automated within an evolutionary loop driven by the Log-Noisy Expected Hypervolume Improvement ($q$NEHVI) acquisition function. Experiments demonstrate that SIP-BMM discovers a stronger and denser Pareto front than competitive baselines, enabling agile model selection tailored to diverse operational constraints. Code is available at: https://github.com/MiLab-HITSZ/2026-SIPBMM.</description>
