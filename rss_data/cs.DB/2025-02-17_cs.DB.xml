      <title>Tradeoffs in Processing Queries and Supporting Updates over an ML-Enhanced R-tree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) techniques have been successfully applied to design various learned database index structures for both the one- and multi-dimensional spaces. Particularly, a class of traditional multi-dimensional indexes has been augmented with ML models to design ML-enhanced variants of their traditional counterparts. This paper focuses on the R-tree multi-dimensional index structure as it is widely used for indexing multi-dimensional data. The R-tree has been augmented with machine learning models to enhance the R-tree performance. The AI+R-tree is an ML-enhanced R-tree index structure that augments a traditional disk-based R-tree with an ML model to enhance the R-tree's query processing performance, mainly, to avoid navigating the overlapping branches of the R-tree that do not yield query results, e.g., in the presence of high-overlap among the rectangles of the R-tree nodes. We investigate the empirical tradeoffs in processing dynamic query workloads and in supporting updates over the AI+R-tree. Particularly, we investigate the impact of the choice of ML models over the AI+R-tree query processing performance. Moreover, we present a case study of designing a custom loss function for a neural network model tailored to the query processing requirements of the AI+R-tree. Furthermore, we present the design tradeoffs for adopting various strategies for supporting dynamic inserts, updates, and deletes with the vision of realizing a mutable AI+R-tree. Experiments on real datasets demonstrate that the AI+R-tree can enhance the query processing performance of a traditional R-tree for high-overlap range queries by up to 5.4X while achieving up to 99% average query recall.</description>

      <title>RIPOST: Two-Phase Private Decomposition for Multidimensional Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) is considered as the gold standard for data privacy. While the problem of answering simple queries and functions under DP guarantees has been thoroughly addressed in recent years, the problem of releasing multidimensional data under DP remains challenging. In this paper, we focus on this problem, in particular on how to construct privacy-preserving views using a domain decomposition approach. The main idea is to recursively split the domain into sub-domains until a convergence condition is met. The resulting sub-domains are perturbed and then published in order to be used to answer arbitrary queries. Existing methods that have addressed this problem using domain decomposition face two main challenges: (i) efficient privacy budget management over a variable and undefined decomposition depth $h$; and (ii) defining an optimal data-dependent splitting strategy that minimizes the error in the sub-domains while ensuring the smallest possible decomposition. To address these challenges, we present RIPOST, a multidimensional data decomposition algorithm that bypasses the constraint of predefined depth $h$ and applies a data-aware splitting strategy to optimize the quality of the decomposition results.The core of RIPOST is a two-phase strategy that separates non-empty sub-domains at an early stage from empty sub-domains by exploiting the properties of multidimensional datasets, and then decomposes the resulting sub-domains with minimal inaccuracies using the mean function. Moreover, RIPOST introduces a privacy budget distribution that allows decomposition without requiring prior computation of the depth $h$. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrated that \texttt{RIPOST} outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of data utility and accuracy on a variety of datasets and test cases</description>

      <title>Large Language Models and Synthetic Data for Monitoring Dataset Mentions in Research Papers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tracking how data is mentioned and used in research papers provides critical insights for improving data discoverability, quality, and production. However, manually identifying and classifying dataset mentions across vast academic literature is resource-intensive and not scalable. This paper presents a machine learning framework that automates dataset mention detection across research domains by leveraging large language models (LLMs), synthetic data, and a two-stage fine-tuning process. We employ zero-shot extraction from research papers, an LLM-as-a-Judge for quality assessment, and a reasoning agent for refinement to generate a weakly supervised synthetic dataset. The Phi-3.5-mini instruct model is pre-fine-tuned on this dataset, followed by fine-tuning on a manually annotated subset. At inference, a ModernBERT-based classifier efficiently filters dataset mentions, reducing computational overhead while maintaining high recall. Evaluated on a held-out manually annotated sample, our fine-tuned model outperforms NuExtract-v1.5 and GLiNER-large-v2.1 in dataset extraction accuracy. Our results highlight how LLM-generated synthetic data can effectively address training data scarcity, improving generalization in low-resource settings. This framework offers a pathway toward scalable monitoring of dataset usage, enhancing transparency, and supporting researchers, funders, and policymakers in identifying data gaps and strengthening data accessibility for informed decision-making.</description>

      <title>Applying Process Mining on Scientific Workflows: a Case Study on High Performance Computing Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.02833v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Computer-based scientific experiments are becoming increasingly data-intensive, necessitating the use of High-Performance Computing (HPC) clusters to handle large scientific workflows. These workflows result in complex data and control flows within the system, making analysis challenging. This paper focuses on the extraction of case IDs from SLURM-based HPC cluster logs, a crucial step for applying mainstream process mining techniques. The core contribution is the development of methods to correlate jobs in the system, whether their interdependencies are explicitly specified or not. We present our log extraction and correlation techniques, supported by experiments that validate our approach, enabling comprehensive documentation of workflows and identification of performance bottlenecks.</description>

      <title>Towards Automated Cross-domain Exploratory Data Analysis through Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07214v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Exploratory data analysis (EDA), coupled with SQL, is essential for data analysts involved in data exploration and analysis. However, data analysts often encounter two primary challenges: (1) the need to craft SQL queries skillfully, and (2) the requirement to generate suitable visualization types that enhance the interpretation of query results. Due to its significance, substantial research efforts have been made to explore different approaches to address these challenges, including leveraging large language models (LLMs). However, existing methods fail to meet real-world data exploration requirements primarily due to (1) complex database schema; (2) unclear user intent; (3) limited cross-domain generalization capability; and (4) insufficient end-to-end text-to-visualization capability.
  This paper presents TiInsight, an automated SQL-based cross-domain exploratory data analysis system. First, we propose hierarchical data context (i.e., HDC), which leverages LLMs to summarize the contexts related to the database schema, which is crucial for open-world EDA systems to generalize across data domains. Second, the EDA system is divided into four components (i.e., stages): HDC generation, question clarification and decomposition, text-to-SQL generation (i.e., TiSQL), and data visualization (i.e., TiChart). Finally, we implemented an end-to-end EDA system with a user-friendly GUI interface in the production environment at PingCAP. We have also open-sourced all APIs of TiInsight to facilitate research within the EDA community. Through extensive evaluations by a real-world user study, we demonstrate that TiInsight offers remarkable performance compared to human experts. Specifically, TiSQL achieves an execution accuracy of 86.3% on the Spider dataset using GPT-4. It also demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on the Bird dataset.</description>

      <title>Is Long Context All You Need? Leveraging LLM's Extended Context for NL2SQL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12372v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across a range of natural language processing tasks. In particular, improvements in reasoning abilities and the expansion of context windows have opened new avenues for leveraging these powerful models. NL2SQL is challenging in that the natural language question is inherently ambiguous, while the SQL generation requires a precise understanding of complex data schema and semantics. One approach to this semantic ambiguous problem is to provide more and sufficient contextual information.
  In this work, we explore the performance and the latency trade-offs of the extended context window (a.k.a., long context) offered by Google's state-of-the-art LLM (\textit{gemini-1.5-pro}). We study the impact of various contextual information, including column example values, question and SQL query pairs, user-provided hints, SQL documentation, and schema. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to study how the extended context window and extra contextual information can help NL2SQL generation with respect to both accuracy and latency cost. We show that long context LLMs are robust and do not get lost in the extended contextual information. Additionally, our long-context NL2SQL pipeline based on Google's \textit{gemini-pro-1.5} achieve strong performances on various benchmark datasets without finetuning and expensive self-consistency based techniques.</description>
