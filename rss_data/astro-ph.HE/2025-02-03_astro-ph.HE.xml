      <title>Magnetic field evolution of X-ray emitting radio-quiet pulsars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The intense magnetic fields present in neutron stars are closely linked to their observed temperature and spectral characteristics, timing properties, including spin period and its derivatives. Therefore, a comprehensive theoretical analysis of magnetic field evolution is essential for understanding how the strength of the magnetic field change over time. The decay rate of magnetic field in isolated, non-accreting neutron stars can be assessed by evaluating the second derivative of the spin frequency. Another method to estimate this rate involves monitoring an increase in thermal emission beyond what is expected from standard cooling processes, assuming no additional heating mechanisms are present. Our findings indicate that for X-ray emitting isolated neutron stars, the evolution rate of spin period derivative aligns with the dissipation rate of magnetic energy from the dipolar field, provided that a substantial portion of the released energy is emitted as X-rays. The time scale of magnetic field decay is found to be much shorter than typical age of radio pulsars.</description>

      <title>Novel Scalings of Neutron Star Properties from Analyzing Dimensionless Tolman--Oppenheimer--Volkoff Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The TOV equations govern the radial evolution of pressure and energy density in static neutron stars (NSs) in hydrodynamical equilibrium. Using the reduced pressure and energy density with respect to the NS central energy density, the original TOV equations can be recast into dimensionless forms. While the traditionally used integral approach for solving the original TOV equations require an input nuclear Equation of State (EOS), the dimensionless TOV equations can be anatomized by using the reduced pressure and energy density as polynomials of the reduced radial coordinate without using any input nuclear EOS. Interesting and novel perspectives about NS core EOS can be extracted directly from NS observables using this new approach based on Intrinsic and Perturbative Analyses of the Dimensionless (IPAD) TOV equations (IPAD-TOV). In this review, we first discuss the length and energy density scales of NSs as well as the dimensionless TOV equations for scaled variables and their perturbative solutions near NS cores. We then review several new insights into NS physics gained from using the IPAD-TOV. We also demonstrate that the strong-field gravity plays a fundamental role in extruding a peak in the density/radius profile of the speed of sound squared (SSS) in massive NS cores independent of the nuclear EOS. Finally, some future perspectives of NS research using the IPAD-TOV are outlined.</description>

      <title>Localizing Dynamically-Formed Black Hole Binaries in Milky Way Globular Clusters with LISA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamical formation of binary black holes (BBHs) in globular clusters (GCs) may contribute significantly to the observed gravitational wave (GW) merger rate. Furthermore, LISA may detect many BBH sources from GCs at mHz frequencies, enabling the characterization of such systems within the Milky Way and nearby Universe. In this work, we use Monte Carlo N-body simulations to construct a realistic sample of Galactic clusters, thus estimating the population, detectability, and parameter measurement accuracy of BBHs hosted within them. In particular, we show that the GW signal from $0.7\pm 0.7$, $2.0\pm 1.7$, $3.6\pm 2.3$, $13.4\pm 4.7$ BBHs in Milky Way GCs can exceed the signal-to-noise ratio threshold of $\rm SNR =30$, 5, 3, and 1 for a 10-year LISA observation, with $\sim 50\%$ of detectable sources exhibiting high eccentricities ($e\gtrsim0.9$). Moreover, the Fisher matrix and Bayesian analyses of the GW signals indicate these systems typically feature highly-resolved orbital frequencies ($\delta f_{\rm orb}/ f_{\rm orb} \sim 10^{-7}-10^{-5}$) and eccentricities ($\delta e/ e \sim 10^{-3}-0.1$), as well as a measurable total mass when SNR exceeds $\sim20$. Notably, BBHs with $\rm SNR\gtrsim 20$ can be confidently localized to specific GCs within the Milky Way, with an angular resolution of $\sim 10-100$ arc minutes. The detection and localization of even a single BBH in a Galactic GC would allow accurate tracking of its long-term orbital evolution, enable a direct test of the role of GCs in BBH formation, and provide a unique probe into the evolutionary history of Galactic clusters.</description>

      <title>The BTSbot-nearby discovery of SN 2024jlf: rapid, autonomous follow-up probes interaction in an 18.5 Mpc Type IIP supernova</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present observations of the Type IIP supernova (SN) 2024jlf, including spectroscopy beginning just 0.7 days ($\sim$17 hours) after first light. Rapid follow-up was enabled by the new $\texttt{BTSbot-nearby}$ program, which involves autonomously triggering target-of-opportunity requests for new transients in Zwicky Transient Facility data that are coincident with nearby ($D&lt;60$ Mpc) galaxies and identified by the $\texttt{BTSbot}$ machine learning model. Early photometry and non-detections shortly prior to first light show that SN 2024jlf initially brightened by $&gt;$4 mag/day, quicker than $\sim$90% of Type II SNe. Early spectra reveal weak flash ionization features: narrow, short-lived ($1.3 &lt; \tau ~\mathrm{[d]} &lt; 1.8$) emission lines of H$\alpha$, He II, and C IV. Assuming a wind velocity of $v_w=50$ km s$^{-1}$, these properties indicate that the red supergiant progenitor exhibited enhanced mass-loss in the last year before explosion. We constrain the mass-loss rate to $10^{-4} &lt; \dot{M}~\mathrm{[M_\odot~yr^{-1}]} &lt; 10^{-3}$ by matching observations to model grids from two independent radiative hydrodynamics codes. $\texttt{BTSbot-nearby}$ automation minimizes spectroscopic follow-up latency, enabling the observation of ephemeral early-time phenomena exhibited by transients.</description>

      <title>The initial mass-remnant mass relation for core collapse supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The first direct detection of gravitational waves in 2015 marked the beginning of a new era for the study of compact objects. Upcoming detectors, such as the Einstein Telescope, are expected to add thousands of binary coalescences to the list. However, from a theoretical perspective, our understanding of compact objects is hindered by many uncertainties, and a comprehensive study of the nature of stellar remnants from core-collapse supernovae is still lacking. In this work, we investigate the properties of stellar remnants using a homogeneous grid of rotating and non-rotating massive stars at various metallicities from Limongi and Chieffi 2018. We simulate the supernova explosion of the evolved progenitors using the HYdrodynamic Ppm Explosion with Radiation diffusION (HYPERION) code (Limongi and Chieffi 2020), assuming a thermal bomb model calibrated to match the main properties of SN1987A. We find that the heaviest black hole that can form depends on the initial stellar rotation, metallicity, and the assumed criterion for the onset of pulsational pair-instability supernovae. Non-rotating progenitors at $\big[\rm Fe/H \big]=-3$ can form black holes up to $\sim 87 M_\odot$, falling within the theorized pair-instability mass gap. Conversely, enhanced wind mass loss prevents the formation of BHs more massive than $\sim 41.6 M_\odot$ from rotating progenitors. We use our results to study the black hole mass distribution from a population of $10^6$ isolated massive stars following a Kroupa initial mass function. Finally, we provide fitting formulas to compute the mass of compact remnants as a function of stellar progenitor properties. Our up-to-date prescriptions can be easily implemented in rapid population synthesis codes.</description>

      <title>Extracting the Temperature Analytically In Hydrodynamics Simulations with Gas and Radiation Pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerical hydrodynamics simulations of gases dominated by ideal, nondegenerate matter pressure and thermal radiation pressure in equilibrium entail finding the temperature as part of the evolution. Since the temperature is not typically a variable that is evolved independently, it must be extracted from the the evolved variables (e.g. the rest-mass density and specific internal energy). This extraction requires solving a quartic equation, which, in many applications, is done numerically using an iterative root-finding method. Here we show instead how the equation can be solved analytically and provide explicit expressions for the solution. We also derive Taylor expansions in limiting regimes and discuss the respective advantages and disadvantages of the iterative versus analytic approaches to solving the quartic.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Rays Masquerading as Hot CGM Gas: An Inverse-Compton Origin for Diffuse X-ray Emission in the Circumgalactic Medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations have argued that Milky Way (MW), Andromeda, and lower-mass galaxies exhibit extended soft X-ray diffuse halos to radii $R\gtrsim100\,$kpc in the circumgalactic medium (CGM). If interpreted as thermal emission, the shallow surface brightness profiles $S_{X}\propto R^{-1}$ are difficult to explain and contradict other observations. We show that such halos instead arise from inverse Compton (IC) scattering of CMB photons with GeV cosmic ray (CR) electrons. GeV electrons have ~Gyr lifetimes and escape the galaxy, forming a shallow extended profile out to $\gtrsim100\,$kpc, where IC off the CMB should produce soft, thermal-like X-ray spectra peaked at ~keV. The observed keV halo luminosities and brightness profiles agree well with those expected for CRs observed in the local interstellar medium (LISM) escaping the galaxy, with energetics consistent with known CRs from SNe and/or AGN, around galaxies with stellar masses $M_{\ast}\lesssim2\times 10^{11}\,M_{\odot}$. At higher masses observed X-ray luminosities are larger than predicted from IC and should be dominated by hot gas. In the MW+M31, the same models of escaping CRs reproduce gamma-ray observations if we assume an LISM-like proton-to-electron ratio and CR-pressure-dominated halo. In all other halos, the radio and $\gamma$-ray brightness is below detectable limits. If true, the observations provide qualitatively new constraints on CGM and CR physics: X-ray brightness directly traces the CR lepton energy density in the CGM. This agrees with LISM values within 10 kpc, which following the profile expected for escaping CRs in the CGM. The inferred CR pressure is a major part of the MW CGM pressure budget. X-ray surface brightness and luminosity allows one to further determine the CGM diffusivity at radii $\sim10-1000\,$kpc. These also agree with LISM values at small radii but increase in the CGM.</description>

      <title>Tidal disruption events as origin of the eROSITA and Fermi bubbles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context: The recently discovered spherical eROSITA bubbles arise up to a latitude of $\pm$80\deg-85\deg in the X-ray regime of the Milky Way halo. Similar to the $\gamma$-ray Fermi bubbles, they evolve around the Galactic center, making a common origin plausible. However, the driving mechanism and evolution of both bubbles are still under debate. Aims: We want to investigate whether hydrodynamic energy injections at the Galactic center, such as e.g. tidal disruption events (TDEs), could have inflated both bubbles. The supermassive black hole Sagittarius A* is expected to tidally disrupt a star every 10-100 kyr, potentially leading to an outflow from the central region that drives a shock propagating into the Galactic halo due to its vertically declining density distribution, ultimately forming a superbubble blown out of the disk similar to the eROSITA and Fermi bubbles. Methods: We model TDEs in the Galaxy using three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations, considering different Milky Way mass models and TDE rates. We then generate synthetic X-ray maps and compare them to observations. Results: Our simulation results of a $\beta$-model Milky Way halo show that superbubbles, blown for 16 Myr by regular energy injections at the Galactic center that occur every 100 kyr, can have a shape, shell stability, size, and evolution time similar to estimates for the eROSITA bubbles, and an overall structure reminiscent to the Fermi bubbles. The $\gamma$-rays in our model would stem from cosmic ray interactions at the contact discontinuity, where they were previously accelerated by first order Fermi acceleration at in situ shocks. Conclusions: Regular TDEs in the past 10-20 Myr near the Galactic center could have driven an outflow resulting in both, the X-ray emission of the eROSITA bubbles and the $\gamma$-ray emission of the Fermi bubbles.</description>

      <title>Chandra Follow-up Observations of Swift-BAT-selected AGNs III</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cosmic X-ray background (CXB) is dominated by the obscured and unobscured coronal light of active galactic nuclei (AGN). At energies below 10 keV, the CXB can be well explained by models taking into account the known AGN and the observed distribution of their obscuring, line-of-sight column densities, $N_{\rm H,l.o.s}$. However, at energies around the Compton reflection hump ($\sim30$ keV), the models fall short of the data. This suggests the existence of a population of as yet undetected Compton-thick AGN ($N_{\rm H,l.o.s}&gt;1.5\times10^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$) whose X-ray spectra are dominated by the light that has been reprocessed by the obscuring material. In this work, we continue the effort to find and catalog all local ($z&lt;0.05$) Compton-thick (CT) AGN. To this end, we obtained soft X-ray data with Chandra for six local BAT detected sources lacking ROSAT (0.1-2.4 keV) counterparts, indicating potential obscuration. We fit their spectra with Bayesian and least squares methods using two different models, borus02 and UXCLUMPY. We compare the results of the different models and methods and find that the $N_{\rm H,l.o.s}$ is consistently measured in each case. Three of the sources also were observed with XMM-Newton allowing the opportunity to search for variability in soft X-ray flux or $N_{\rm H,l.o.s}$. From this sample, we find one strong CT candidate (NGC 5759) and one weaker CT candidate (CGCG 1822.3+2053). Furthermore, we find tentative evidence of $N_{\rm H,l.o.s}$ variability in 2MASX J17253053-4510279, which has $N_{\rm H,l.o.s}&lt;10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$.</description>

      <title>Spectral Insights and Evolutionary Pathways of Globular Cluster ULX in NGC 1399: A Two-Decade X-ray and Optical Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present new multi-wavelength observations of two ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) hosted by globular clusters (GCs) in the giant elliptical NGC 1399, focusing on CXO J0338318-352604 (GCU7), only the second GC ULX known to have luminous optical emission lines. Notably, only NII and OIII emission is observed in the optical spectra, suggesting H-poor material. Previous work suggested the possibility that the properties of GCU7 could be explained by the tidal disruption of a horizontal branch star by an intermediate-mass black hole. We use new data to show that the lack of evolution in the X-ray or optical properties of the source over the last 20 years rules out this scenario. Instead, we use CLOUDY simulations to demonstrate that the optical emission lines are consistent with an outflow from an ultra-compact X-ray binary where a compact object - likely a neutron star (NS) - is accreting above the Eddington limit from a helium white dwarf (He WD). This binary would have dynamically formed from a direct collision between a NS and a red giant, or else via an exchange interaction. The ULX is predicted to evolve to lower mass transfer rates over time and eventually become a doppelganger to the well-studied ultra-compact X-ray binaries in Galactic GCs such as 4U 1820-30. These results show the utility of using extragalactic GCs to study short-lived phases in dynamical binary evolution that occur too rarely to be observed in Galactic clusters.</description>

      <title>Dark photon constraints using the UHE gamma-ray emission from galactic sources. A Phenomenological Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context: Dark photons (Dph) appear in theories beyond the Standard Model of particles (SM). Under certain conditions, it is possible to have a mixing between SM photons and Dphs that should be observed as anomalies in the spectrum of astrophysical sources. Aim: To either find evidence of, or set constraints on the existence of Dphs with masses in the range of $\mu\text{eV}$ using observations of two galactic sources observed at TeV energies. Methods: Using the flux of the Crab Nebula and MGRO J1908+06 at TeV energies reported by HAWC and LHAASO observatories, and assuming a model where Dphs can mix with SM photons in the vacuum; we compute the Test Statistic (TS) to search for evidence of Dphs in the form of variations/attenuation in the observed spectrum. Results: We do not find statistically significant evidence of the existence of $\mu\text{eV}$ Dphs. Then, we compute the 68\% C.L. and 95\% C.L. exclusion regions for Dphs with masses in the range from $10^{-8}$ to $10^{-5}~\text{eV}$ and mixing angles with values between 0.01 and 1.0.</description>

      <title>Exploring Constraints on Axion-like Particles with the Observations for blazar Mrk 501</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Oscillations between axion-like particles (ALPs) and photons in astrophysical magnetic fields can lead to irregularities in the high energy gamma ray spectra of blazars. The magnetic field within the blazar jet plays a crucial role in shaping these effects, with its strength in the emission region being an important parameter determined by multi-wavelength observations. However, the origin of the high energy bump observed in the spectral energy distribution of some blazars is a topic of debate, with both leptonic and hadronic scenarios providing plausible explanations that result in different magnetic field strengths in the emission region. In this study, we investigate the impact of magnetic field configurations on the constraints of ALP parameters. We consider both leptonic and hadronic emission scenarios for the blazar Mrk 501 and derive the corresponding jet magnetic field strengths. Additionally, we explore two jet magnetic field models: one with a toroidal component and the other with helical and tangled components. By analyzing the spectra of Mrk 501 observed by MAGIC and Fermi-LAT from 2017-06-17 to 2019-07-23, which are well-described by both emission scenarios, we derive constraints on the ALP parameters. Our results demonstrate that both the emission scenario and the magnetic field structure play a significant role in deriving these constraints, with the hadronic model leading to much more stringent limits compared to the leptonic model.</description>

      <title>Energy evolution of cosmic-ray mass and intensity measured by the Pierre Auger Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Pierre Auger Observatory has conducted measurements of the energy spectrum and mass composition of cosmic rays using different methods. Utilizing both surface and fluorescence detectors (SD and FD), the Observatory provides unprecedented precision in understanding these particles. While primarily designed to measure ultra-high energy cosmic rays, the FD's high-elevation telescopes and the dense arrays of SD stations enable observations down to 6 PeV and 60 PeV, respectively. To determine the depth of shower maximum, a critical parameter for identifying primary particle types, both direct longitudinal profile measurements from the FD and indirect signal analyses from the SD are employed. An energy evolution of the mass of primary particles, as well as of the spectral index of the flux intensity, are observed and characterized by features described in the presented work. The measurements benefit from the joint operation of the FD and SD, delivering a systematic uncertainty of 14% in energy determination and an accumulated exposure reaching 80 000 km$^2$ sr yr at the highest energies.</description>

      <title>The evolution of cosmic ray electrons in the cosmic web: seeding by AGN, star formation and shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several processes in the Universe convert a fraction of gas kinetic energy into the acceleration of relativistic electrons, making them observable at radio wavelengths, or contributing to a dormant reservoir of low-energy cosmic rays in cosmic structures. We present a new suite of cosmological simulations, with simple galaxy formation models calibrated to work at a specific spatial resolution, tailored to study all most important processes of injection of relativistic electrons in evolving large-sale structures: accretion and merger shocks, feedback from active galactic nuclei and winds from star forming regions. We also follow the injection of magnetic fields by active galactic nuclei and star formation, and compute the observational signatures of these mechanisms. We find that the injection of cosmic ray electrons by shocks is the most volume filling process, and that it also dominates the energy density of fossil relativistic electrons in halos. The combination of the seeding mechanisms studied in this work, regardless of the uncertainties related to physical or numerical uncertainties, is more than enough to fuel large-scale radio emissions with a large amount of seed fossil electrons. We derive an approximated formula to predict the number of fossil cosmic ray electrons injected by z=0 by the total activity of shocks, AGN and star formation in the volume of halos. By looking at the maximum possible contribution to the magnetisation of the cosmic web by all our simulated sources, we conclude that galaxy formation-related processes, alone, cannot explain the values of Faraday Rotation of background polarised sources recently detected using LOFAR.</description>

      <title>Convective stability analysis of massive neutron stars formed in binary mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform fully general-relativistic hydrodynamics simulations of binary neutron star mergers over $100\,\rm ms$ post-merger to investigate the dynamics of remnant massive neutron stars (NSs). Our focus is mainly on the analysis of convective stability and mode characteristics of the massive NSs. We derive stability criteria for hot, differentially rotating relativistic stars that account for both buoyant and rotational restoring forces, and apply them for the first time to the post-merger massive NSs. Our results show no evidence of large-scale convective instability, as both angle-averaged specific entropy and specific angular momentum increase outward within the massive NSs. Rotational effects significantly enhance stability for local regions that would be otherwise unstable by the Schwarzschild criterion. Additionally, our mode analysis of matter fields and gravitational waves reveals no excitation of inertial modes after the damping of quadrupolar $f$-modes in the massive NSs, contrasting with previous studies. As in many previous works, we observe the excitation of an $m=1$ one-armed mode. However, we also find that the growth of the $m=1$ mode amplitude after the merger may correlate strongly with the violation of linear momentum conservation, indicating that we cannot reject the possibility that the excitation of the one-armed mode has a numerical origin.</description>

      <title>Kilonova Emission from Neutron Star Mergers with Different Equations of State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kilonova is an optical-infrared transient powered by the radioactive decay of heavy nuclei from binary neutron star mergers. Its observational characteristics depend on the mass and the nuclide composition of meger ejecta, which are sensitive to the equation of state (EoS) of neutron star. We use astrophysical conditions derived from different EoSs as nucleosynthesis inputs to explore the impact of various EoS on the $r$-process nucleosynthesis and the kilonova emission. Our results show that both the abundance patterns of merger ejecta and kilonova light curves are strongly dependent on the neutron star EoSs. Given the mass of two neutron stars, the merger with a softer EoS tends to generate a larger amount of ejected material, and may lead to a brighter kilonova peak luminosity. The relationship between the neutron star EoS and the peak luminosity provides a probe for constraining the properties of EoS in multi-messenger observations of neutron star mergers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.19322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Various phenomena of physics beyond that of the Standard Model could occur at high scale. Ultra-high energy cosmic rays are the only particles available to explore scales above a few dozens of TeV. Although these explorations are much more limited than those carried out with colliders, they provide a series of constraints in several topics such as tests of Lorentz invariance, dark matter, phase transitions in the early universe or sterile neutrinos. Several of these constraints are reviewed in these proceedings of UHECR2024 based on searches for anomalous characteristics in extensive air showers or searches for ultra-high energy gamma rays and neutrinos.</description>

      <title>CRexit: how different cosmic ray transport modes affect thermal instability in the circumgalactic medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The circumgalactic medium (CGM) plays a critical role in galaxy evolution, influencing gas flows, feedback processes, and galactic dynamics. Observations show a substantial cold gas reservoir in the CGM, but the mechanisms driving its formation and evolution remain unclear. Cosmic rays (CRs), as a source of non-thermal pressure, are increasingly recognized as key regulators of cold gas dynamics. This study explores how CRs affect cold clouds that condense from the hot CGM via thermal instability (TI). Using 3D CR-magnetohydrodynamic (CRMHD) simulations with AREPO, we assess the impact of various CR transport models on cold gas evolution. Under purely advective CR transport, CR pressure significantly suppresses the collapse of thermally unstable regions, altering the CGM's structure. In contrast, realistic CR transport models reveal that CRs escape collapsing regions via streaming and diffusion along magnetic fields, diminishing their influence on the thermal and dynamic structure of the cold CGM. The ratio of the CR escape time to the cloud collapse time emerges as a critical factor in determining the impact of CRs on TI. CRs remain confined within cold clouds when effective CR diffusion is slow which maximizes their pressure support and inhibits collapse. Fast effective CR diffusion, as realized in our 2-moment CRMHD model, facilitates rapid CR escape, reducing their stabilizing effect. This realistic CR transport model shows a wide dynamic range of the effective CR diffusion coefficient, ranging from $10^{29}$ to $10^{30}\,\mathrm{cm^{2}\,s^{-1}}$ for thermally- to CR-dominated atmospheres, respectively. In addition to these CR transport-related effects, we demonstrate that high numerical resolution is crucial to avoid spuriously large clouds formed in low-resolution simulations, which would result in overly long CR escape times and artificially amplified CR pressure support.</description>

      <title>Anisotropies in the Circumgalactic Medium of Disk Galaxies: Milky Way-like Bubbles or Star Formation-driven Outflows?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gamma and X-ray observatories have revealed spectacular structures in the emission of the tenuous hot gas surrounding the Milky Way (MW), known as the Fermi and eROSITA bubbles. Galaxy formation simulations suggest that MW-like bubbles could be ubiquitous, but their emission may be too faint to detect with today's instruments in individual external galaxies. In this paper, we present an analysis of stacked Chandra observations of 93 nearby galaxies. We detected soft, diffuse X-rays from the CGM, extending up to 14 kpc, with a luminosity of $(4.2\pm0.7)\times10^{39}$ erg/s in the $0.3-2$ keV band. To probe its spatial distribution, we constructed an azimuthal profile and found a significant enhancement along the galactic minor axis. When dividing our sample by stellar mass, central supermassive black hole mass, and star formation rate, we found that only high star formation rate galaxies exhibit significant anisotropies in the CGM emission. To investigate whether the observed anisotropies could be attributed to MW-like bubbles, we compared our results with TNG50 simulations. In these simulations, X-ray bubbles are strongly correlated with mass of the central supermassive black hole and typically extend to much larger, $\sim50$ kpc, scales. We conclude that the observed anisotropies are either caused by AGN-driven MW-like bubbles confined to smaller, $\sim10$ kpc, scales, or by star formation- or starburst-driven bubbles/outflows.</description>

      <title>Mass flows in the Galactic Center by supernovae of the circumnuclear disk</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. The circumnuclear disk (CND) is presently the main supply of mass for the accretion onto the supermassive black hole (SMBH) in the Galactic Center (GC). While the accretion is relatively slow, it has been suspected that local episodic explosive events play an important role in the temporary mass inflow toward the SMBH, while also affecting the evolution of the CND. Aims. The aim of this study is to follow the changes in mass flows caused by supernova (SN) explosions nestled in or near the CND. Methods. We perform simulations with the grid-based MHD code FLASH of the inner 5 pc of the Milky Way GC, including gravitational potential, rotation, magnetic field, central wind source, and the warm gas of the CND, all mimicking the observed physical properties. Results. Assuming a M$_\mathrm{SN}=10$ M$_\odot$ as the mass of the precursor of the core-collapse SN event at various locations within 2 pc from the GC, we detect a temporary increase in the accretion rate, transferring an additional 2-60 M$_\odot$ of warm gas to the immediate vicinity of the SMBH, depending on the explosion site. At the same time, the kinetic energy of the SN blows away even mass from the CND; the additional warm gas leaving the simulation domain after the explosion is on the order of $\sim100$ M$_\odot$. In the studied cases, the impact on mass flows and the turbulence caused by the explosion cease after $\sim250$ kyr.</description>

      <title>Electroweak clouds supported by magnetically charged black holes: Analytic treatment along the existence-line</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has recently been revealed [R. Gervalle and M. S. Volkov, Phys. Rev. Lett. (2024)] that magnetically charged black holes of the composed Einstein-Weinberg-Salam field theory can support bound-state hairy configurations of electroweak fields. In the present paper we study, using {\it analytical} techniques, the physical and mathematical properties of the supported linearized electroweak fields (spatially regular electroweak 'clouds') in the dimensionless large-mass $\mu\equiv m_{\text{w}} r_+\gg1$ regime of the composed black-hole-field system (here $m_{\text{w}}$ is the mass of the supported W-boson field and $r_+$ is the outer horizon radius of the central supporting black hole). In particular, we derive a remarkably compact formula for the discrete resonance spectrum $\{\mu_k(n)\}_{k=0}^{k=\infty}$ that characterizes the composed black-hole-linearized-field configurations, where the integer $n\equiv 2Pe\in\mathbb{Z}$ characterizes the discrete charge parameter $P$ of the central magnetic Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole and $e$ is the electron charge. The physical significance of the analytically derived resonant spectrum stems from the fact that, in the dimensionless large-charge $n\gg1$ regime, the fundamental (largest) eigenvalue $\mu_0(n)$ determines the critical existence-line of the composed Einstein-Weinberg-Salam theory, a boundary line that separates hairy magnetic-black-hole-electroweak-field bound-state configurations from bald magnetic Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes.</description>

      <title>Rapid follow-up of infant supernovae with the Gran Telescopio de Canarias</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.19108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The first few hours of a supernova contain significant information about the progenitor system. The most modern wide-field surveys that scan the sky repeatedly every few days can discover all kinds of transients in those early epochs. At such times, some progenitor footprints may be visible, elucidating critical explosion parameters and helping to distinguish between leading explosion models. A dedicated spectroscopic classification programme using the optical spectrograph OSIRIS mounted to the Gran Telescopio de Canarias was set up to try to obtain observations of supernova at those early epochs. With the time awarded, we obtained spectra for 10 SN candidates, which we present here. Half of them were thermonuclear SNe, while the other half were core-collapse SNe. Most (70\%) were observed within the first six days of the estimated explosion, with two being captured within the first 48 hours. We present a characterization of the spectra, together with other public ancillary photometry from ZTF and ATLAS. This programme shows the need for an accompanying rapid-response spectroscopic programme to existing and future deep photometric wide-field surveys located at the right longitude to be able to trigger observations in a few hours after the discovery of the supernova candidate. Both the future La Silla Southern Supernova Survey (LS4) and the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) both located in Chile will be providing discovery and follow up of most of the transients in the southern hemisphere. This paper demonstrates that with a rapid spectroscopic programme and stringent triggering criteria, obtaining a sample of SN with spectra within a day of the explosion is possible.</description>

      <title>Effective theory for stochastic particle acceleration, with application to magnetized turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The physics of particle acceleration in turbulent plasmas is a topic of broad interest, which is making rapid progress thanks to dedicated, large-scale numerical experiments. The first part of this paper presents an effective theory of stochastic Fermi acceleration, which subsumes all forms of non-resonant acceleration in ideal electric fields and is applicable in generic settings. It combines an exact equation connecting the energization rate to the statistics of the velocity field with a statistical model of particle transport through the structures (i.e., the regions of strong velocity gradients). In a second part, this formalism is applied to MHD turbulence to obtain a comprehensive assessment of the scale-by-scale contributions to the advection and diffusion coefficients. Acceleration is found to be maximal on scales where particles can be trapped inside structures for an eddy turn-around timescale, or in intense structures associated with sharp bends of the magnetic field lines in large-amplitude turbulence (as reported earlier). These fast acceleration regimes, which are inhomogeneous in space, pave the way for a rich phenomenology. We discuss the scalings obtained, their interpretation and show that the findings compare satisfactorily with existing numerical results.</description>

      <title>High-cadence observations of galactic nuclei by the future two-band UV-photometry mission QUVIK</title>

Abstract: The Quick Ultra-Violet Kilonova surveyor (QUVIK), a two-band UV space telescope approved for funding as a Czech national science and technology mission, will focus on detecting early UV light of kilonovae (Werner et al., 2024). In addition, it will study the UV emission of stars and stellar systems (Krti\v{c}ka et al., 2024) as well as the intense and variable emission of active galactic nuclei (AGN) or galactic nuclei activated by tidal disruption events (Zaja\v{c}ek et al., 2024). In this contribution, we describe the role of this small ($\sim 30$-cm diameter) UV telescope for studying bright, nearby AGN. With its NUV and FUV bands, the telescope will perform high-cadence ($\sim$ 0.1-1 day) two-band photometric monitoring of nearby AGN ($z&lt;1$), which will allow us to probe accretion disk sizes/temperature profiles via photometric reverberation mapping. Thanks to its versatility, QUVIK will be able to perform a moderately fast repointing ($&lt;20$ min) to target candidates for tidal disruption events (TDEs). Early detection of the UV emission following a TDE optical flare, in combination with the subsequent two-band UV monitoring performed simultaneously with other observatories, will enable us to infer the time delay (or its lack of) between the optical, UV, and X-ray emission. In combination with theoretical models, it will be possible to shed more light on the origin of the UV/optical emission of TDEs. Furthermore, the two-band monitoring of nuclear transients will be beneficial in distinguishing between TDEs (nearly constant blue colour) and supernovae (progressive reddening).</description>

      <title>Spin oscillations of neutrinos scattered by the supermassive black hole in the galactic center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the propagation and spin oscillations of neutrinos in their scattering by a supermassive black hole (SMBH) surrounded by a realistic accretion disk. We use a semi-analytical model of a thick accretion disk which can co-rotate and counter-rotate with respect to BH. Moreover, we assume that a disk contains only a toroidal magnetic magnetic field of moderate strength. Spin precession of neutrinos, which are supposed to be Dirac particles, is caused by the interaction of the neutrino magnetic moment with the magnetic field in the disk. We consider the incoming flux of neutrinos having an arbitrary angle with respect to the BH spin since the recent results of the Event Horizon Telescope indicate that the BH spin in the galactic center is not always perpendicular to the galactic plane. For our study, we consider a large number of incoming test neutrinos. We briefly discuss our results and their applications in the observations of astrophysical neutrinos.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.05720v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We draw attention to two unanswered questions in radio pulsars' theory. The first one concerns the inclination angles between magnetic and rotation axes. We show that the very existence of interpulse pulsars indicates that all possible angles are realized. The second one is the question of the break of the death line on the PPdot-diagram. We show that this break can be easily explained by a very mechanism of secondary plasma generation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17908v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a pipeline to infer the equation of state of neutron stars from observations based on deep neural networks. In particular, using the standard (deterministic), as well as Bayesian (probabilistic) deep networks, we explore how one can infer the interior speed of sound of the star given a set of mock observations of total stellar mass, stellar radius and tidal deformability. We discuss in detail the construction of our simulated dataset of stellar observables starting from the solution of the gravitational equations, as well as the relevant architectures for the deep networks, along with their performance and accuracy. We further explain how our pipeline is capable to detect a possible QCD phase transition in the stellar core. Our results show that deep networks offer a promising tool towards solving the inverse problem of neutron stars, and the accurate inference of their interior from future stellar observations.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Interactions in White Dwarf Binaries as Mechanism for Long-Period Radio Transients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05978v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A growing population of long-period radio transients has been discovered and their physical origin is still up to debate. Recently, a new such source named ILT J1101 + 5521 was discovered, which is in a white dwarf (WD) -- red dwarf (RD) binary system, with the observed 125.5 min period in radio emission being identified as the orbital period and the radio emission occurs at the inferior conjunction of the WD. We suggest that the radio emission properties of the system can be well explained within the framework of the unipolar inductor magnetic interaction model between the magnetized WD and the RD with low magnetization, with a relativistic version of electron cyclotron maser emission being the most likely radiation mechanism. We suggest that this mechanism can interpret at least some long-period radio transients, especially the ultra-long period sub-population. Within this model, high energy emission in X-rays via relativistically boosted cyclotron radiation and $\gamma$-rays via inverse Compton scattering off stellar light are expected, but the predicted luminosities are relatively low. This model likely applies to the ultra-long period population of LPRTs. The short-period population of LPRTs is likely powered by other engines such as slow magnetars.</description>

      <title>Searching radio signals from two magnetars and a high-magnetic field pulsar and the serendipitous discovery of a new radio pulsar PSR J1935+2200</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15960v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetars are slowly rotating, highly magnetized young neutron stars that can show transient radio phenomena for radio pulses and fast radio bursts. We conducted radio observations of from two magnetars SGR$~$J1935+2154 and 3XMM$~$J185246.6+003317 and a high-magnetic field pulsar PSR$~$J1846$-$0258 using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). We performed single pulse and periodicity searches and did not detect radio signals from them. From the piggyback data recorded by other FAST telescope beams when we observed the magnetar SGR$~$1935+2154, we serendipitously discovered a new radio pulsar, PSR$~$J1935+2200. We carried out the follow-up observations and obtained the timing solution based on these new observations and the archive FAST data. PSR$~$J1935+2200 is an isolated old pulsar, with a spin period of $0.91$s, a spin-period derivative of $9.19 \times 10^{-15}$~s~s$^{-1}$, and a characteristic age of $1.57$ Myr. It is a weak pulsar with a flux density of 9.8 $\mu$Jy at 1.25 GHz. Discovery of a new pulsar from the long FAST observations of 30 minutes implies that there may be more weak older pulsars in the Galactic disk to be discovered.</description>

      <title>The FAST Galactic Plane Pulsar Snapshot survey: VI. The discovery of 473 new pulsars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15961v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) is the most sensitive telescope at the $L$-band (1.0-1.5 GHz) and has been used to carry out the FAST Galactic Plane Pulsar Snapshot (GPPS) survey in the last 5 yr. Up to now, the survey has covered one-fourth of the planned areas within $\pm10^{\circ}$ from the Galactic plane visible by FAST, and discovered 751 pulsars. After the first publication of the discovery of 201 pulsars and one rotating radio transient (RRAT) in 2021 and 76 RRATs in 2023, here we report the discovery of 473 new pulsars from the FAST GPPS survey, including 137 new millisecond pulsars and 30 new RRATs. We find 34 millisecond pulsars discovered by the GPPS survey which can be timed with a precision better than 3 $\mu$s by using FAST 15 minute observations and can be used for pulsar timing arrays. The GPPS survey has discovered eight pulsars with periods greater than 10 s including one with 29.77 s. The integrated profiles of pulsars and individual pulses of RRATs are presented. During the FAST GPPS survey, we also detected previously known pulsars and updated parameters for 52 pulsars. In addition, we discovered two fast radio bursts plus one probable case with high dispersion measures indicating their extragalactic origin.</description>

      <title>The FAST Galactic Plane Pulsar Snapshot Survey: VII. Six millisecond pulsars in compact orbits with massive white dwarf companions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03063v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Binary millisecond pulsars with a massive white dwarf (WD) companion are intermediate-mass binary pulsars (IMBPs). They are formed via the Case BB Roche-lobe overflow evolution channel if they are in compact orbits with an orbital period of less than 1 day. They are fairly rare in the known pulsar population; only five such IMBPs have been discovered before, and one of them is in a globular cluster. Here we report six IMBPs in compact orbits: PSRs J0416+5201, J0520+3722, J1919+1341, J1943+2210, J1947+2304 and J2023+2853, discovered during the Galactic Plane Pulsar Snapshot survey by using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope, doubling the number of such IMBPs due to the high survey sensitivity in the short survey time of 5 minutes. Follow-up timing observations show that they all have either a CO WD or an ONeMg WD companion with a mass greater than about 0.8~$M_\odot$ in a very circular orbit with an eccentricity in the order of $\lesssim10^{-5}$. PSR J0416+5201 should be an ONeMg WD companion with a remarkable minimum mass of 1.28 $M_\odot$. These massive WD companions lead to a detectable Shapiro delay for PSRs J0416+5201, J0520+3722, J1943+2210, and J2023 +2853, indicating that their orbits are highly inclined. From the measurement of the Shapiro delay, the pulsar mass of J1943+2210 was constrained to be 1.84$^{\,+0.11}_{-0.09}$~$M_\odot$, and that of PSR J2023+2853 to be 1.28$^{\,+0.06}_{-0.05}$~$M_\odot$.</description>

      <title>Survey of Radiative, Two-Temperature Magnetically Arrested Simulations of the Black Hole M87* I: Turbulent Electron Heating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12448v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a set of eleven two-temperature, radiative, general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (2TGRRMHD) simulations of the black hole M87* in the magnetically arrested (MAD) state, surveying different values of the black hole spin $a_*$. Our 3D simulations self-consistently evolve the temperatures of separate electron and ion populations under the effects of adiabatic compression/expansion, viscous heating, Coulomb coupling, and synchrotron, bremsstrahlung, and inverse Compton radiation. We adopt a sub-grid heating prescription from gyrokinetic simulations of plasma turbulence. Our simulations have accretion rates $\dot{M}=(0.5-1.5)\times10^{-6}\dot{M}_{\rm Edd}$ and radiative efficiencies $\epsilon_{\rm rad}=3-35\%$. We compare our simulations to a fiducial set of otherwise identical single-fluid GRMHD simulations and find no significant changes in the outflow efficiency or black hole spindown parameter. Our simulations produce an effective adiabatic index for the two-temperature plasma of $\adi\approx1.55$, larger than the $\adi=13/9$ value often adopted in single-fluid GRMHD simulations. We find moderate ion-to-electron temperature ratios in the 230 GHz emitting region of $R=T_{\rm i}/T_{\rm e}{\approx}5$. While total intensity 230 GHz images from our simulations are consistent with Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) results, our images have significantly more beam-scale linear polarization ($\langle|m|\rangle\approx 30\%$) than is observed in EHT images of M87* ($\langle|m|\rangle&lt;10\%$). We find a trend of the average linear polarization pitch angle $\angle\beta_2$ with black hole spin consistent with what is seen in single-fluid GRMHD simulations, and we provide a simple fitting function for $\angle\beta_2(a_*)$ motivated by the wind-up of magnetic field lines by black hole spin in the Blandford-Znajek mechanism.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19012v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Phase transitions can play an important role in the cosmological constant problem, allowing the underlying vacuum energy, and therefore the value of the cosmological constant, to change. Deep within the core of neutron stars, the local pressure may be sufficiently high to trigger the QCD phase transition, thus generating a shift in the value of the cosmological constant. The gravitational effects of such a transition should then be imprinted on the properties of the star. Working in the framework of General Relativity, we provide a new model of the stellar interior, allowing for a QCD and a vacuum energy phase transition. We determine the impact of a vacuum energy jump on mass-radius relations, tidal deformability-radius relations, I-Love-Q relations and on the combined tidal deformability measured in neutron star binaries.</description>

      <title>On the overlap reduction function of pulsar timing array searches for gravitational waves in modified gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04464v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) searches for gravitational waves (GWs) aim to detect a characteristic correlation pattern in the timing residuals of galactic millisecond pulsars. This pattern is described by the PTA overlap reduction function (ORF) \Gamma_ab(\xi_ab), which is known as the Hellings--Downs (HD) curve in general relativity (GR). In theories of modified gravity, the HD curve often receives corrections. Assuming, e.g., a subluminal GW phase velocity, one finds a drastically enhanced ORF in the limit of small angular separations between pulsar a and pulsar b in the sky, \xi_ab --&gt; 0. In particular, working in harmonic space and performing an approximate resummation of all multipole contributions, the auto correlation coefficient \Gamma_aa seems to diverge. In this paper, we confirm that this divergence is unphysical and provide an exact and analytical expression for \Gamma_aa in dependence of the pulsar distance L_a and the GW phase velocity v_ph. In the GR limit and assuming a large pulsar distance, our expression reduces to \Gamma_aa = 1. In the case of subluminal phase velocity, we show that the regularization of the naive divergent result is a finite-distance effect, meaning that \Gamma_aa scales linearly with fL_a, where f is the GW frequency. For superluminal phase velocity (subluminal group velocity), which is relevant in the case of massive gravity, we correct an earlier analytical result for \Gamma_ab. Our results pave the way for fitting modified-gravity theories with nonstandard phase velocity to PTA data, which requires a proper understanding of the auto correlation coefficient \Gamma_aa.</description>

      <title>Quark Stars as Hideouts For Color-spin-locked Quark Matter: Implications for Powering High-energy Electromagnetic Emissions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15811v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The possibility of compact stars as hideouts for color-spin-locked (CSL) quark matter (QM) is investigated in both MIT bag model and Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model. Within the framework of NJL model, the idea of absolutely stable quark matter and the existence of conventional pure quark star (QS) are not supported; in addition, there appears to be no stable hybrid configuration above $2M_\odot$ as the hideout for CSL QM. The stable configurations of massive strange quark stars could be reproduced in the MIT bag model with QCD corrections being taken into account; moreover, they could act as the hiding place for the CSL QM. An interesting scenario is proposed that the phase transition to the CSL phase could occur in the cooling process. The CSL quark matter is an electromagnetic (EM) superconductor of Type-I, and a complete Meissner effect is expected. However, the analysis for this sizable superconductor indicates that most of the magnetic field is frozen inside the quark core with a critical strength, while in some special cases a small fraction could be expelled from a thin layer near the surface in a short time. The analysis on energetics and time scale suggests that this process could act as an inducement mechanism to power typical fast radio bursts, but as a single source of energy, it is unlikely to generate other EM emissions such as gamma-ray bursts and giant flares.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave propagation beyond General Relativity: geometric optic expansion and lens-induced dispersion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07164v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The nature of gravity can be tested by how gravitational waves (GWs) are emitted, detected, and propagate through the universe. Propagation tests are powerful, as small deviations compound over cosmological distances. However, GW propagation tests of theories beyond Einstein's general relativity (GR) are limited by the high degree of symmetry of the average cosmological spacetime. Deviations from homogeneity, i.e. gravitational lenses, allow for new interactions, e.g., between standard GW polarization and new scalar or vector fields, with different spin. Therefore, GW lensing beyond GR offers novel tests of cosmological gravity. Here we present the theory of GW propagation beyond GR in the short-wave expansion, including corrections to the leading-order amplitude and phase for the first time. As an example, we compute the dispersive (frequency-dependent) corrections to all metric and scalar field perturbations in Brans-Dicke, the simplest modified theory exhibiting GW dispersion. GW lensing effects are too small to observe in Brans-Dicke theories compatible with solar system and binary pulsar limits. Nevertheless, our formalism opens the possibility of novel tests of gravity, including dark-energy theories and screening mechanisms.</description>

Abstract: The stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) can be observed in the nanohertz band using a pulsar timing array (PTA). Here a computationally efficient state-space framework is developed for analysing SGWB data, in which the stochastic gravitational wave strain at Earth is tracked with a non-linear Kalman filter and separated simultaneously from intrinsic, achromatic pulsar spin wandering. The filter is combined with a nested sampler to estimate the parameters of the model, and to calculate a Bayes factor for selecting between models with and without a SGWB. The procedure extends previous state-space formulations of PTA data analysis applied to individually resolvable binary black hole sources. The performance of the new algorithm is tested on synthetic data from the first International PTA Mock Data Challenge. It is shown that the algorithm distinguishes a SGWB from pure noise for $A_{\rm gw} \geq 3 \times 10^{-14}$, where $A_{\rm gw}$ denotes the standard normalization factor for a power spectral density with power-law exponent $-13/3$. Additional, systematic validation tests are also performed with synthetic data generated independently by adjusting the injected parameters to cover astrophysically plausible ranges. Full posterior distributions are recovered and tested for accuracy. The state-space procedure is memory-light and evaluates the likelihood for a standard-sized PTA dataset in $\lesssim 10^{-1}$ s without optimization on a standard central processing unit.</description>
