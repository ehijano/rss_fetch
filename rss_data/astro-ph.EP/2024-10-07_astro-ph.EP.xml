      <title>On the origin of transition disk cavities: Pebble-accreting protoplanets vs Super-Jupiters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protoplanetary disks surrounding young stars are the birth places of planets. Among them, transition disks with inner dust cavities of tens of au are sometimes suggested to host massive companions. Yet, such companions are often not detected. Some transition disks exhibit a large amount of gas inside the dust cavity and relatively high stellar accretion rates, which contradicts typical models of gas-giant-hosting systems. Therefore, we investigate whether a sequence of low-mass planets can produce cavities in the dust disk. We evolve the disks with low-mass accreting embryos in combination with 1D dust transport and 3D pebble accretion, to investigate the reduction of the pebble flux at the embryos' orbits. We vary the planet and disk properties. We find that multiple pebble-accreting planets can efficiently decrease the dust surface density, resulting in dust cavities consistent with transition disks. The number of low-mass planets necessary to sweep up all pebbles decreases with decreasing turbulent strength and is preferred when the dust Stokes number is $10^{-2}-10^{-4}$. Compared to dust rings caused by pressure bumps, those by efficient pebble accretion exhibit more extended outer edges. We also highlight the observational reflections: the transition disks with rings featuring extended outer edges tend to have a large gas content in the dust cavities and rather high stellar accretion rates. We propose that planet-hosting transition disks consist of two groups. In Group A disks, planets have evolved into gas giants, opening deep gaps in the gas disk. Pebbles concentrate in pressure maxima, forming dust rings. In Group B, multiple Neptunes (unable to open deep gas gaps) accrete incoming pebbles, causing the appearance of inner dust cavities. The morphological discrepancy of these rings may aid in distinguishing between the two groups using high-resolution ALMA observations.</description>

      <title>How Meteor Showers Can Guide the Search for Long Period Comets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With orbital periods longer than 200 years, most long-period comets (LPCs) remain undiscovered until they are in-bound towards perihelion. The comets that pass close to Earth's orbit are Potentially Hazardous Objects (PHOs). Those with orbital periods up to ~4000 years tend to have passed close to Earth's orbit in a previous orbit and produced a meteoroid stream dense enough to be detected at Earth as a meteor shower. In anticipation of Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), we investigate how these meteor showers can guide dedicated searches for their parent comets. Assuming search parameters informed by LSST, we calculated where the 17 known parent bodies of long-period comet meteor showers would have been discovered based on a cloud of synthetic comets generated from the shower properties as measured at Earth. We find that the synthetic comets predict the on-sky location of the parent comets at the time of their discovery. The parent comet's location on average would have been 1.51 $\pm$1.19$\deg$ from a line fit through the synthetic comet cloud. The difference between the heliocentric distance of the parent and mean heliocentric distance of synthetic comets on the line was 2.09 $\pm$1.89 au for comets with unknown absolute nuclear magnitudes and 0.96 $\pm$0.80 au for comets with known absolute nuclear magnitudes. We applied this method to the $\sigma$-Hydrids, the proposed meteor shower of Comet Nishimura, and found that it successfully matched the pre-covery location of this comet 8 months prior to Nishimura's discovery.</description>

      <title>The Outcome of Collisions between Gaseous Clumps formed by Disk Instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The disk instability model is a promising pathway for giant planet formation in various conditions. At the moment, population synthesis models are used to investigate the outcomes of this theory, where a key ingredient of the disk population evolution are collisions of self-gravitating clumps formed by the disk instabilities. In this study, we explore the wide range of dynamics between the colliding clumps by performing state-of-the-art Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics simulations with a hydrogen-helium mixture equation of state and investigate the parameter space of collisions between clumps of different ages, masses (1--10 Jupiter mass), various impact conditions (head-on to oblique collisions) and a range of relative velocities. We find that the perfect merger assumption used in population synthesis models is rarely satisfied and that the outcomes of most of the collisions lead to erosion, disruption or a hit-and-run. We also show that in some cases collisions can initiate the dynamical collapse of the clump. We conclude that population synthesis models should abandon the simplifying assumption of perfect merging. Relaxing this assumption will significantly affect the inferred population of planets resulting from the disk instability model.</description>

      <title>An Extremely Elongated Cloud over Arsia Mons Volcano on Mars: II. Mesoscale modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a previous work (Hern\'andez-Bernal et al. 2021) we performed an observational analysis of the Arsia Mons Elongated Cloud (AMEC), which stands out due to its impressive size and shape, quick dynamics, and the fact that it happens during the martian dusty season. Observations show that its morphology can be split in a head, on the western slope of the volcano of around 120 km in diameter; and a tail, that expands to the west reaching more than 1000 km in length, making the AMEC the longest orographic cloud observed so far in the solar system. In this work we run the LMD (Laboratoire de M\'et\'eorologie Dynamique) Mesoscale Model to gain insight into the physics of the AMEC. We note that it is coincident in terms of local time and seasonality with the fastest winds on the summit of Arsia Mons. A downslope windstorm on the western slope is followed by a hydraulic-like jump triggering a strong vertical updraft that propagates upwards in the atmosphere, causing a drop in temperatures of down to 30K at 40-50 km in altitude, spatially and temporarily coincident with the observed head of the AMEC. However the model does not reproduce the microphysics of this cloud: the optical depth is too low and the expansion of the tail does not happen in the model. The observed diurnal cycle is correctly captured by the model for the head of the cloud. This work raises new questions that will guide future observations of the AMEC.</description>

      <title>Constraining the Presence of Companion Planets in Hot Jupiter Planetary System Using TTV Observation from TESS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The presence of another planetary companion in a transiting exoplanet system can impact its transit light curve, leading to sinusoidal transit timing variations (TTV). By utilizing both $\chi^2$ and RMS analysis, we have combined the TESS observation data with an N-body simulation to investigate the existence of an additional planet in the system and put a limit on its mass. We have developed CMAT, an efficient and user-friendly tool for fitting transit light curves and calculating TTV with a theoretical period, based on which we can give a limit on its hidden companion's mass. We use 260 hot Jupiter systems from the complete TESS data set to demonstrate the use of CMAT. Our findings indicate that, for most systems, the upper mass limit of a companion planet can be restricted to several Jupiter masses. This constraint becomes stronger near resonance orbits, such as the 1:2, 2:1, 3:1, and 4:1 mean motion resonance, where the limit is reduced to several Earth masses. These findings align with previous studies suggesting that a lack of companion planets with resonance in hot Jupiter systems could potentially support the high eccentricity migration theory. Additionally, we observed that the choice between $\chi^2$ or {root mean square (RMS)} method does not significantly affect the upper limit on companion mass; however, $\chi^2$ analysis may result in weaker restrictions but is statistically more robust compared to RMS analysis in most cases.</description>

      <title>sunset: A database of synthetic atmospheric-escape transmission spectra for nearly every transiting planet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studying atmospheric escape from exoplanets can provide important clues about the formation and evolution of exoplanets. Observational evidence of atmospheric escape has been obtained through transit spectroscopy in strong spectral lines of various atomic species. In recent years, the number of exoplanets that have been targeted in this way has grown rapidly, mainly by observations of the metastable helium triplet. Even with this larger sample of exoplanets, many aspects of atmospheric escape remain not fully understood, such as the role of the stellar high-energy spectrum and planetary magnetic field, highlighting the need for additional observations. This work aims to identify the best targets for observations in various spectral lines. Using the atmospheric escape code sunbather, we calculate a synthetic transmission spectrum of nearly every transiting exoplanet currently known. This database of spectra, named sunset, is publicly available. We introduce metrics based on the spectral line strengths and system distance or magnitude, which allow swift identification of the most favorable targets. By analyzing the complete set of spectra from a demographic perspective, we find that the strengths of many spectral lines do not correlate strongly with the atmospheric mass-loss rate, suggesting that a nondetection does not immediately rule out an escaping atmosphere. Our model spectra show only a weak correlation between the XUV (X-ray and extreme UV) flux and the helium line strength, affirming that the absence of such a trend found by observational works is in fact as expected. A direct comparison between our synthetic spectra and the sample of observed metastable helium spectra shows that they are generally consistent within the large model uncertainties. This suggests that by and large, photoevaporation is able to explain the current metastable helium census.</description>

      <title>Localised ejection of dust and chunks on comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko: testing how comets work</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend an existing thermophysical activity model of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko to include pressure buildup inside the pebbles making up the nucleus. We test various quantities of H$_{2}$O and CO$_{2}$, in order to simulate the material inside and outside of proposed water enriched bodies (WEBs). We find that WEBs can reproduce the peak water flux observed by Rosetta, but that the addition of a time-resolved heat-flow reduces the water fluxes away from perihelion as compared to the previously assumed equilibrium model. Our modelled WEBs eject dust continuously but with a rate that is much higher than the observed erosion and mass-loss, thus requiring an active area smaller than the total comet surface area or very large quantities of dust fallback. When simulating the CO$_{2}$-rich non-WEB material, we only find the ejection of large chunks under specific conditions (e.g.~low diffusivities between the pebbles or intense insolation at southern summer), whilst we also find CO$_{2}$ outgassing rates that are much greater than observed. This is a general problem in models where CO$_{2}$ drives erosion, alongside difficulties in simultaneously ejecting chunks from deep whilst eroding the surface layer. We therefore conclude that ejection of chunks by CO$_{2}$ must be a localised phenomenon, occurring separately in space or time from surface erosion and water emission. Simulating the global production rates of gas, dust, and chunks from a comet thus remains challenging, while the activity mechanism is shown to be very sensitive to the material structure (i.e.~porosity and diffusivity) at various scales.</description>

      <title>A General, Differentiable Transit Model for Ellipsoidal Occulters: Derivation, Application, and Forecast of Planetary Oblateness and Obliquity Constraints with JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Increasingly precise space-based photometry uncovers higher-order effects in transits, eclipses and phase curves which can be used to characterize exoplanets in novel ways. The subtle signature induced by a rotationally deformed exoplanet is determined by the planet's oblateness and rotational obliquity, which provide a wealth of information about a planet's formation, internal structure, and dynamical history. However, these quantities are often strongly degenerate and require sophisticated methods to convincingly constrain. We develop a new semi-analytic model for an ellipsoidal object occulting a spherical body with arbitrary surface maps expressed in terms of spherical harmonics. We implement this model in an open-source Jax-based Python package eclipsoid, allowing just-in-time compilation and automatic differentiation. We then estimate the precision obtainable with JWST observations of the long period planet population and demonstrate the best current candidates for studies of oblateness and obliquity. We test our method on the JWST NIRSpec transit of the inflated warm Neptune WASP-107 b and place an upper bound on its projected oblateness $f&lt;0.23$, which corresponds to a rotation period of $P_{\mathrm{rot}}&gt;13$h if the planet is not inclined to our line of sight. Further studies of long-period exoplanets will necessitate discarding the assumption of planets as spherical bodies. Eclipsoid provides a general framework allowing rotational deformation to be modelled in transits, occultations, phase curves, transmission spectra and more.</description>

      <title>The Feasibility of Asynchronous Rotation via Thermal Tides for Diverse Atmospheric Compositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The equilibrium rotation rate of a planet is determined by the sum of torques acting on its solid body. For planets with atmospheres, the dominant torques are usually the gravitational tide, which acts to slow the planet's rotation rate, and the atmospheric thermal tide, which acts to spin up the planet. Previous work demonstrated that rocky planets with thick atmospheres may produce strong enough thermal tides to avoid tidal locking, but a study of how the strength of the thermal tide depends on atmospheric properties has not been done. In this work, we use a combination of simulations from a global climate model and analytic theory to explore how the thermal tide depends on the shortwave and longwave optical depth of the atmosphere, the surface pressure, and the absorbed stellar radiation. We find that for planets in the habitable zones of M stars only high-pressure but low-opacity atmospheres permit asynchronous rotation owing to the weakening of the thermal tide at high longwave and shortwave optical depths. We conclude that asynchronous rotation may be very unlikely around low-mass stars, which may limit the potential habitability of planets around M stars.</description>

      <title>JWST/NIRISS reveals the water-rich "steam world" atmosphere of GJ 9827 d</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With sizable volatile envelopes but smaller radii than the solar system ice giants, sub-Neptunes have been revealed as one of the most common types of planet in the galaxy. While the spectroscopic characterization of larger sub-Neptunes (2.5-4R$_\oplus$) has revealed hydrogen-dominated atmospheres, smaller sub-Neptunes (1.6--2.5R$_\oplus$) could either host thin, rapidly evaporating hydrogen-rich atmospheres or be stable metal-rich "water worlds" with high mean molecular weight atmospheres and a fundamentally different formation and evolutionary history. Here, we present the 0.6--2.8$\mu$m JWST NIRISS/SOSS transmission spectrum of GJ 9827 d, the smallest (1.98 R$_\oplus$) warm (T$_\mathrm{eq, A_B=0.3} \sim 620$K) sub-Neptune where atmospheric absorbers have been detected to date. Our two transit observations with NIRISS/SOSS, combined with the existing HST/WFC3 spectrum, enable us to break the clouds-metallicity degeneracy. We detect water in a highly metal-enriched "steam world" atmosphere (O/H of $\sim 4$ by mass and H$_2$O found to be the background gas with a volume mixing ratio of &gt;31%). We further show that these results are robust to stellar contamination through the transit light source effect. We do not detect escaping metastable He, which, combined with previous nondetections of escaping He and H, supports the steam atmosphere scenario. In water-rich atmospheres, hydrogen loss driven by water photolysis happens predominantly in the ionized form which eludes observational constraints. We also detect several flares in the NIRISS/SOSS light-curves with far-UV energies of the order of 10$^{30}$ erg, highlighting the active nature of the star. Further atmospheric characterization of GJ 9827 d probing carbon or sulfur species could reveal the origin of its high metal enrichment.</description>

Abstract: We present a novel orbit parameterization in spherical coordinates. This parameterization enables the mixing of varying and invariant orbital parameters, and clarifies the physics of the orbit. It also simplifies the process of placing synthetic populations at exactly specified locations on the sky, which is particularly useful for survey design and simulation studies.</description>

      <title>The assembly, characterization, and performance of SISTINE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02893v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Suborbital Imaging Spectrograph for Transition region Irradiance from Nearby Exoplanet host stars (SISTINE) is a rocket-borne ultraviolet (UV) imaging spectrograph designed to probe the radiation environment of nearby stars. SISTINE operates over a bandpass of 98 -- 127 and 130 -- 158 nm, capturing a broad suite of emission lines tracing the full 10$^4$ -- 10$^5$ K formation temperature range critical for reconstructing the full UV radiation field incident on planets orbiting solar-type stars. SISTINE serves as a platform for key technology developments for future ultraviolet observatories. SISTINE operates at moderate resolving power ($R\sim$1500) while providing spectral imaging over an angular extent of $\sim$6', with $\sim$2" resolution at the slit center. The instrument is composed of an f/14 Cassegrain telescope that feeds a 2.1x magnifying spectrograph, utilizing a blazed holographically ruled diffraction grating and a powered fold mirror. Spectra are captured on a large format microchannel plate (MCP) detector consisting of two 113 x 42 mm segments each read out by a cross delay-line anode. Several novel technologies are employed in SISTINE to advance their technical maturity in support of future NASA UV/optical astronomy missions. These include enhanced aluminum lithium fluoride coatings (eLiF), atomic layer deposition (ALD) protective optical coatings, and ALD processed large format MCPs. SISTINE was launched a total of three times with two of the three launches successfully observing targets Procyon A and $\alpha$ Centauri A and B.</description>

      <title>The Visual Monitoring Camera (VMC) on Mars Express: a new science instrument made from an old webcam orbiting Mars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02999</link>

Abstract: The Visual Monitoring Camera (VMC) is a small imaging instrument onboard Mars Express with a field of view of ~40x30 degrees. The camera was initially intended to provide visual confirmation of the separation of the Beagle 2 lander and has similar technical specifications to a typical webcam of the 2000s. In 2007, a few years after the end of its original mission, VMC was turned on again to obtain full-disk images of Mars to be used for outreach purposes. As VMC obtained more images, the scientific potential of the camera became evident, and in 2018 the camera was given an upgraded status of a new scientific instrument, with science goals in the field of Martian atmosphere meteorology. The wide Field of View of the camera combined with the orbit of Mars Express enable the acquisition of full-disk images of the planet showing different local times, which for a long time has been rare among orbital missions around Mars. The small data volume of images also allows videos that show the atmospheric dynamics of dust and cloud systems to be obtained. This paper is intended to be the new reference paper for VMC as a scientific instrument, and thus provides an overview of the updated procedures to plan, command and execute science observations of the Martian atmosphere. These observations produce valuable science data that is calibrated and distributed to the community for scientific use.</description>

      <title>Detection of a space capsule entering Earth's atmosphere with distributed acoustic sensing (DAS)</title>

Abstract: On 24 September 2023, the Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification, and Security Regolith Explorer (OSIRIS-REx) Sample Return Capsule entered the Earth's atmosphere after successfully collecting samples from an asteroid. The known trajectory and timing of this return provided a rare opportunity to strategically instrument sites to record geophysical signals produced by the capsule as it traveled at hypersonic speeds through the atmosphere. We deployed two optical-fiber distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) interrogators to sample over 12 km of surface-draped, fiber-optic cables along with six co-located seismometer-infrasound sensor pairs, spread across two sites near Eureka, NV. This campaign-style rapid deployment is the first reported recording of a sample return capsule entry with any distributed fiber optic sensing technology. The DAS interrogators recorded an impulsive arrival with an extended coda which had features that were similar to recordings from both the seismometers and infrasound sensors. While the signal-to-noise of the DAS data was lower than the seismic-infrasound data, the extremely dense spacing of fiber-optic sensors allowed for more phases to be clearly distinguished and the continuous transformation of the wavefront as it impacted the ground could be visualized. Unexpectedly, the DAS recordings contain less low-frequency content than is present in both the seismic and infrasound data. The deployment conditions strongly affected the recorded DAS data, in particular, we observed that fiber selection and placement exert strong controls on data quality.</description>

      <title>Novel Constraints on Companions to the Helix Nebula Central Star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Helix is a visually striking and the nearest planetary nebula, yet any companions responsible for its asymmetric morphology have yet to be identified. In 2020, low-amplitude photometric variations with a periodicity of 2.8 d were reported based on Cycle 1 TESS observations. In this work, with the inclusion of two additional sectors, these periodic light curves are compared with lcurve simulations of irradiated companions in such an orbit. Based on the light curve modelling, there are two representative solutions: i) a Jupiter-sized body with 0.102 Rsol and an arbitrarily small orbital inclination i=1 deg, and ii) a 0.021 Rsol exoplanet with i approx. 25 deg, essentially aligned with the Helix Nebular inclination. Irradiated substellar companion models with equilibrium temperature 4970 K are constructed and compared with existing optical spectra and infrared photometry, where Jupiter-sized bodies can be ruled out, but companions modestly larger than Neptune are still allowed. Additionally, any spatially-unresolved companions are constrained based on the multi-wavelength, photometric spectral energy distribution of the central star. No ultracool dwarf companion earlier than around L5 is permitted within roughly 1200 au, leaving only faint white dwarfs and cold brown dwarfs as possible surviving architects of the nebular asymmetries. While a planetary survivor is a tantalizing possibility, it cannot be ruled out that the light curve modulation is stellar in nature, where any substellar companion requires confirmation and may be possible with JWST observations.</description>

      <title>Shaking and Tumbling: Short- and Long-Timescale Mechanisms for Resurfacing of Near-Earth Asteroid Surfaces from Planetary Tides and Predictions for the 2029 Earth Encounter by (99942) Apophis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04864</link>

Abstract: Spectral characterization of near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) has revealed a continuum of space-weathered states for the surfaces of S-complex NEAs, with Q-class NEAs, an S-complex subclass, most closely matching the un-weathered surfaces of ordinary chondrite meteorites. Dynamical calculations of the orbital evolution of S-complex NEAs revealed that Q-class NEAs tend to have close encounters with terrestrial planets, suggesting that planetary tides may play a role in refreshing NEA surfaces. However, the exact physical mechanism(s) that drive resurfacing through tidal encounters and the encounter distance at which these mechanisms are effective, has remained unclear. Through the lens of the upcoming (99942) Apophis encounter with Earth in 2029, we investigate the potential for surface mobilization through tidally-driven seismic shaking over short-timescales during encounter and subsequent surface slope evolution over longer-timescales driven by tumbling. We perform multi-scale numerical modeling and find that the 2029 encounter will induce short-term tidally-driven discrete seismic events that lead to high-frequency (&gt;0.1 Hz) surface accelerations that reach magnitudes similar to Apophis' gravity, and that may be detectable by modern seismometers. It is still unclear if the shaking we model translates to widespread particle mobilization and/or lofting. We also find there will be a significant change in Apophis' tumbling spin state that could lead to longer-term surface refreshing in response to tumbling-induced surface slope changes. We propose that through these mechanisms, space-weathered S-class asteroid surfaces may become refreshed through the exposure of unweathered underlying material. These results will be tested by the future exploration of Apophis by NASA's OSIRIS-APEX.</description>

      <title>A Fourth Planet in the Kepler-51 System Revealed by Transit Timing Variations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01625v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kepler-51 is a $\lesssim 1\,\mathrm{Gyr}$-old Sun-like star hosting three transiting planets with radii $\approx 6$-$9\,R_\oplus$ and orbital periods $\approx 45$-$130\,\mathrm{days}$. Transit timing variations (TTVs) measured with past Kepler and Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations have been successfully modeled by considering gravitational interactions between the three transiting planets, yielding low masses and low mean densities ($\lesssim 0.1\,\mathrm{g/cm^3}$) for all three planets. However, the transit time of the outermost transiting planet Kepler-51d recently measured by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) 10 years after the Kepler observations is significantly discrepant from the prediction made by the three-planet TTV model, which we confirmed with ground-based and follow-up HST observations. We show that the departure from the three-planet model is explained by including a fourth outer planet, Kepler-51e, in the TTV model. A wide range of masses ($\lesssim M_\mathrm{Jup}$) and orbital periods ($\lesssim 10\,\mathrm{yr}$) are possible for Kepler-51e. Nevertheless, all the coplanar solutions found from our brute-force search imply masses $\lesssim 10\,M_\oplus$ for the inner transiting planets. Thus their densities remain low, though with larger uncertainties than previously estimated. Unlike other possible solutions, the one in which Kepler-51e is around the $2:1$ mean motion resonance with Kepler-51d implies low orbital eccentricities ($\lesssim 0.05$) and comparable masses ($\sim 5\,M_\oplus$) for all four planets, as is seen in other compact multi-planet systems. This work demonstrates the importance of long-term follow-up of TTV systems for probing longer period planets in a system.</description>
