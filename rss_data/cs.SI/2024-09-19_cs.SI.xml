      <title>Towards Opinion Shaping: A Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach in Bot-User Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper aims to investigate the impact of interference in social network algorithms via user-bot interactions, focusing on the Stochastic Bounded Confidence Model (SBCM). This paper explores two approaches: positioning bots controlled by agents into the network and targeted advertising under various circumstances, operating with an advertising budget. This study integrates the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm and its variants to experiment with different Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). Finally, experimental results demonstrate that this approach can result in efficient opinion shaping, indicating its potential in deploying advertising resources on social platforms.</description>

      <title>Community Shaping in the Digital Age: A Temporal Fusion Framework for Analyzing Discourse Fragmentation in Online Social Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research presents a framework for analyzing the dynamics of online communities in social media platforms, utilizing a temporal fusion of text and network data. By combining text classification and dynamic social network analysis, we uncover mechanisms driving community formation and evolution, revealing the influence of real-world events. We introduced fourteen key elements based on social science theories to evaluate social media dynamics, validating our framework through a case study of Twitter data during major U.S. events in 2020. Our analysis centers on discrimination discourse, identifying sexism, racism, xenophobia, ableism, homophobia, and religious intolerance as main fragments. Results demonstrate rapid community emergence and dissolution cycles representative of discourse fragments. We reveal how real-world circumstances impact discourse dominance and how social media contributes to echo chamber formation and societal polarization. Our comprehensive approach provides insights into discourse fragmentation, opinion dynamics, and structural aspects of online communities, offering a methodology for understanding the complex interplay between online interactions and societal trends.</description>

      <title>A novel DFS/BFS approach towards link prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowledge graphs have been shown to play a significant role in current knowledge mining fields, including life sciences, bioinformatics, computational social sciences, and social network analysis. The problem of link prediction bears many applications and has been extensively studied. However, most methods are restricted to dimension reduction, probabilistic model, or similarity-based approaches and are inherently biased. In this paper, we provide a definition of graph prediction for link prediction and outline related work to support our novel approach, which integrates centrality measures with classical machine learning methods. We examine our experimental results in detail and identify areas for potential further research. Our method shows promise, particularly when utilizing randomly selected nodes and degree centrality.</description>

      <title>My Views Do Not Reflect Those of My Employer: Differences in Behavior of Organizations' Official and Personal Social Media Accounts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On social media, the boundaries between people's private and public lives often blur. The need to navigate both roles, which are governed by distinct norms, impacts how individuals conduct themselves online, and presents methodological challenges for researchers. We conduct a systematic exploration on how an organization's official Twitter accounts and its members' personal accounts differ. Using a climate change Twitter data set as our case, we find substantial differences in activity and connectivity across the organizational levels we examined. The levels differed considerably in their overall retweet network structures, and accounts within each level were more likely to have similar connections than accounts at different levels. We illustrate the implications of these differences for applied research by showing that the levels closer to the core of the organization display more sectoral homophily but less triadic closure, and how each level consists of very different group structures. Our results show that the common practice of solely analyzing accounts from a single organizational level, grouping together all levels, or excluding certain levels can lead to a skewed understanding of how organizations are represented on social media.</description>

      <title>Spectral clustering of time-evolving networks using the inflated dynamic Laplacian for graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex time-varying networks are prominent models for a wide variety of spatiotemporal phenomena. The functioning of networks depends crucially on their connectivity, yet reliable techniques for determining communities in spacetime networks remain elusive. We adapt successful spectral techniques from continuous-time dynamics on manifolds to the graph setting to fill this gap. We formulate an {\it inflated dynamic Laplacian} for graphs and develop a spectral theory to underpin the corresponding algorithmic realisations. We develop spectral clustering approaches for both multiplex and non-multiplex networks, based on the eigenvectors of the inflated dynamic Laplacian and specialised Sparse EigenBasis Approximation (SEBA) post-processing of these eigenvectors. We demonstrate that our approach can outperform the Leiden algorithm applied both in spacetime and layer-by-layer, and we analyse voting data from the US senate (where senators come and go as congresses evolve) to quantify increasing polarisation in time.</description>

      <title>LitFM: A Retrieval Augmented Structure-aware Foundation Model For Citation Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the advent of large language models (LLMs), managing scientific literature via LLMs has become a promising direction of research. However, existing approaches often overlook the rich structural and semantic relevance among scientific literature, limiting their ability to discern the relationships between pieces of scientific knowledge, and suffer from various types of hallucinations. These methods also focus narrowly on individual downstream tasks, limiting their applicability across use cases. Here we propose LitFM, the first literature foundation model designed for a wide variety of practical downstream tasks on domain-specific literature, with a focus on citation information. At its core, LitFM contains a novel graph retriever to integrate graph structure by navigating citation graphs and extracting relevant literature, thereby enhancing model reliability. LitFM also leverages a knowledge-infused LLM, fine-tuned through a well-developed instruction paradigm. It enables LitFM to extract domain-specific knowledge from literature and reason relationships among them. By integrating citation graphs during both training and inference, LitFM can generalize to unseen papers and accurately assess their relevance within existing literature. Additionally, we introduce new large-scale literature citation benchmark datasets on three academic fields, featuring sentence-level citation information and local context. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of LitFM, achieving 28.1% improvement on retrieval task in precision, and an average improvement of 7.52% over state-of-the-art across six downstream literature-related tasks</description>

      <title>A Property Encoder for Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph machine learning, particularly using graph neural networks, fundamentally relies on node features. Nevertheless, numerous real-world systems, such as social and biological networks, often lack node features due to various reasons, including privacy concerns, incomplete or missing data, and limitations in data collection. In such scenarios, researchers typically resort to methods like structural and positional encoding to construct node features. However, the length of such features is contingent on the maximum value within the property being encoded, for example, the highest node degree, which can be exceedingly large in applications like scale-free networks. Furthermore, these encoding schemes are limited to categorical data and might not be able to encode metrics returning other type of values. In this paper, we introduce a novel, universally applicable encoder, termed PropEnc, which constructs expressive node embedding from any given graph metric. PropEnc leverages histogram construction combined with reverse index encoding, offering a flexible method for node features initialization. It supports flexible encoding in terms of both dimensionality and type of input, demonstrating its effectiveness across diverse applications. PropEnc allows encoding metrics in low-dimensional space which effectively avoids the issue of sparsity and enhances the efficiency of the models. We show that \emph{PropEnc} can construct node features that either exactly replicate one-hot encoding or closely approximate indices under various settings. Our extensive evaluations in graph classification setting across multiple social networks that lack node features support our hypothesis. The empirical results conclusively demonstrate that PropEnc is both an efficient and effective mechanism for constructing node features from diverse set of graph metrics.</description>

      <title>PieClam: A Universal Graph Autoencoder Based on Overlapping Inclusive and Exclusive Communities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose PieClam (Prior Inclusive Exclusive Cluster Affiliation Model): a probabilistic graph model for representing any graph as overlapping generalized communities. Our method can be interpreted as a graph autoencoder: nodes are embedded into a code space by an algorithm that maximizes the log-likelihood of the decoded graph, given the input graph. PieClam is a community affiliation model that extends well-known methods like BigClam in two main manners. First, instead of the decoder being defined via pairwise interactions between the nodes in the code space, we also incorporate a learned prior on the distribution of nodes in the code space, turning our method into a graph generative model. Secondly, we generalize the notion of communities by allowing not only sets of nodes with strong connectivity, which we call inclusive communities, but also sets of nodes with strong disconnection, which we call exclusive communities. To model both types of communities, we propose a new type of decoder based the Lorentz inner product, which we prove to be much more expressive than standard decoders based on standard inner products or norm distances. By introducing a new graph similarity measure, that we call the log cut distance, we show that PieClam is a universal autoencoder, able to uniformly approximately reconstruct any graph. Our method is shown to obtain competitive performance in graph anomaly detection benchmarks.</description>

      <title>"It Might be Technically Impressive, But It's Practically Useless to Us": Practices, Challenges, and Opportunities for Cross-Functional Collaboration around AI within the News Industry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, an increasing number of news organizations have integrated artificial intelligence (AI) into their workflows, leading to a further influx of AI technologists and data workers into the news industry. This has initiated cross-functional collaborations between these professionals and journalists. While prior research has explored the impact of AI-related roles entering the news industry, there is a lack of studies on how cross-functional collaboration unfolds between AI professionals and journalists. Through interviews with 17 journalists, 6 AI technologists, and 3 AI workers with cross-functional experience from leading news organizations, we investigate the current practices, challenges, and opportunities for cross-functional collaboration around AI in today's news industry. We first study how journalists and AI professionals perceive existing cross-collaboration strategies. We further explore the challenges of cross-functional collaboration and provide recommendations for enhancing future cross-functional collaboration around AI in the news industry.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the role of supernatural entities and the effect of missing data in Irish sagas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For over a decade, complex networks have been applied to mythological texts in order to quantitatively compare them. This has allowed us to identify similarities between texts in different cultures, as well as to quantify the significance of some heroic characters. Analysing a full mythology of a culture requires gathering data from many individual myths which is time consuming and often impractical. In this work, we attempt to bypass this by analysing the network of characters in a dictionary of mythological characters. We show that the top characters identified by different centrality measures are consistent with central figures in the Irish sagas. Although much of Irish mythology has been lost, we demonstrate that these most central characters are highly robust to a large random removal of edges.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12097v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Finding the perfect match between a job proposal and a set of freelancers is not an easy task to perform at scale, especially in multiple languages. In this paper, we propose a novel neural retriever architecture that tackles this problem in a multilingual setting. Our method encodes project descriptions and freelancer profiles by leveraging pre-trained multilingual language models. The latter are used as backbone for a custom transformer architecture that aims to keep the structure of the profiles and project. This model is trained with a contrastive loss on historical data. Thanks to several experiments, we show that this approach effectively captures skill matching similarity and facilitates efficient matching, outperforming traditional methods.</description>

      <title>The Bayan Algorithm: Detecting Communities in Networks Through Exact and Approximate Optimization of Modularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.04562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.04562v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Community detection is a classic network problem with extensive applications in various fields. Its most common method is using modularity maximization heuristics which rarely return an optimal partition or anything similar. Partitions with globally optimal modularity are difficult to compute, and therefore have been underexplored. Using structurally diverse networks, we compare 30 community detection methods including our proposed algorithm that offers optimality and approximation guarantees: the Bayan algorithm. Unlike existing methods, Bayan globally maximizes modularity or approximates it within a factor. Our results show the distinctive accuracy and stability of maximum-modularity partitions in retrieving planted partitions at rates higher than most alternatives for a wide range of parameter settings in two standard benchmarks. Compared to the partitions from 29 other algorithms, maximum-modularity partitions have the best medians for description length, coverage, performance, average conductance, and well clusteredness. These advantages come at the cost of additional computations which Bayan makes possible for small networks (networks that have up to 3000 edges in their largest connected component). Bayan is several times faster than using open-source and commercial solvers for modularity maximization, making it capable of finding optimal partitions for instances that cannot be optimized by any other existing method. Our results point to a few well performing algorithms, among which Bayan stands out as the most reliable method for small networks. A Python implementation of the Bayan algorithm (bayanpy) is publicly available through the package installer for Python (pip).</description>

      <title>Characterizing the Structure of Online Conversations Across Reddit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.14836v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The proliferation of social media platforms has afforded social scientists unprecedented access to vast troves of data on human interactions, facilitating the study of online behavior at an unparalleled scale. These platforms typically structure conversations as threads, forming tree-like structures known as "discussion trees." This paper examines the structural properties of online discussions on Reddit by analyzing both global (community-level) and local (post-level) attributes of these discussion trees. We conduct a comprehensive statistical analysis of a year's worth of Reddit data, encompassing a quarter of a million posts and several million comments. Our primary objective is to disentangle the relative impacts of global and local properties and evaluate how specific features shape discussion tree structures. The results reveal that both local and global features contribute significantly to explaining structural variation in discussion trees. However, local features, such as post content and sentiment, collectively have a greater impact, accounting for a larger proportion of variation in the width, depth, and size of discussion trees. Our analysis also uncovers considerable heterogeneity in the impact of various features on discussion structures. Notably, certain global features play crucial roles in determining specific discussion tree properties. These features include the subreddit's topic, age, popularity, and content redundancy. For instance, posts in subreddits focused on politics, sports, and current events tend to generate deeper and wider discussion trees. This research enhances our understanding of online conversation dynamics and offers valuable insights for both content creators and platform designers. By elucidating the factors that shape online discussions, our work contributes to ongoing efforts to improve the quality and effectiveness of digital discourse.</description>

      <title>LLaVA-Docent: Instruction Tuning with Multimodal Large Language Model to Support Art Appreciation Education</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06264v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the development of various AI systems to support learning in various domains, AI assistance for art appreciation education has not been extensively explored. Art appreciation, often perceived as an unfamiliar and challenging endeavor for most students, can be more accessible with a generative AI enabled conversation partner that provides tailored questions and encourages the audience to deeply appreciate artwork. This study explores the application of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in art appreciation education, with a focus on developing LLaVA-Docent, a model designed to serve as a personal tutor for art appreciation. Our approach involved design and development research, focusing on iterative enhancement to design and develop the application to produce a functional MLLM-enabled chatbot along with a data design framework for art appreciation education. To that end, we established a virtual dialogue dataset that was generated by GPT-4, which was instrumental in training our MLLM, LLaVA-Docent. The performance of LLaVA-Docent was evaluated by benchmarking it against alternative settings and revealed its distinct strengths and weaknesses. Our findings highlight the efficacy of the MMLM-based personalized art appreciation chatbot and demonstrate its applicability for a novel approach in which art appreciation is taught and experienced.</description>

Abstract: Graph generation has emerged as a crucial task in machine learning, with significant challenges in generating graphs that accurately reflect specific properties. Existing methods often fall short in efficiently addressing this need as they struggle with the high-dimensional complexity and varied nature of graph properties. In this paper, we introduce the Neural Graph Generator (NGG), a novel approach which utilizes conditioned latent diffusion models for graph generation. NGG demonstrates a remarkable capacity to model complex graph patterns, offering control over the graph generation process. NGG employs a variational graph autoencoder for graph compression and a diffusion process in the latent vector space, guided by vectors summarizing graph statistics. We demonstrate NGG's versatility across various graph generation tasks, showing its capability to capture desired graph properties and generalize to unseen graphs. We also compare our generator to the graph generation capabilities of different LLMs. This work signifies a shift in graph generation methodologies, offering a more practical and efficient solution for generating diverse graphs with specific characteristics.</description>

      <title>Centrality measures and opinion dynamics in two-layer networks with replica nodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18780</link>

Abstract: We examine two-layer networks and centrality measures defined on them. We propose two fast and accurate algorithms to approximate the game-theoretic centrality measures and examine connection between centrality measures and characteristics of opinion dynamic processes on such networks. As an example, we consider a Zachary's karate club social network and extend it by adding the second (internal) layer of communication. Internal layer represents the idea that individuals can share their real opinions with their close friends. The structures of the external and internal layers may be different. As characteristics of opinion dynamic processes we mean consensus time and winning rate of a particular opinion. We find significantly strong positive correlation between internal graph density and consensus time, and significantly strong negative correlation between centrality of authoritative nodes and consensus time.</description>
