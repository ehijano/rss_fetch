      <title>Random Walks and the Meeting Time for Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a random walk on a tree $G=(V,E)$. For $v,w \in V$, let the hitting time $H(v,w)$ denote the expected number of steps required for the random walk started at $v$ to reach $w$, and let $\pi_v = \mathrm{deg}(v)/2|E|$ denote the stationary distribution for the random walk. We characterize the extremal tree structures for the meeting time $T_{\mathrm{meet}}(G) = \max_{w \in V} \sum_{v \in V} \pi_v H(v,w)$. For fixed order $n$ and diameter $d$, the meeting time is maximized by the broom graph. The meeting time is minimized by the balanced double broom graph, or a slight variant, depending on the relative parities of $n$ and $d$.</description>

      <title>The asymptotic rank of adjacency matrices of weighted configuration models over arbitrary fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the asymptotic rank of adjacency matrices of a large class of edge-weighted configuration models. Here, the weight of a (multi-)edge can be any fixed non-zero element from an arbitrary field, as long as it is independent of the (multi-)graph. Our main result demonstrates that the asymptotic behavior of the normalized rank of the adjacency matrix neither depends on the fixed edge-weights, nor on which field they are chosen from. Our approach relies on a novel adaptation of the component exploration method of \cite{janson2009new}, which enables the application of combinatorial techniques from \cite{coja2022rank, HofMul25}.</description>

      <title>Plabic Tangles and Cluster Promotion Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by the BCFW recurrence for tilings of the amplituhedron, we introduce the general framework of `plabic tangles' that utilizes plabic graphs to define rational maps between products of Grassmannians called `promotions'. The central conjecture of the paper is that promotion maps are quasi-cluster homomorphisms, which we prove for several classes of promotions. In order to define promotion maps, we utilize $m$-vector-relation configurations ($m$-VRCs) on plabic graphs. We relate $m$-VRCs to the degree (a.k.a `intersection number') of the amplituhedron map on positroid varieties and characterize all plabic trees with intersection number one and their VRCs. Finally, we show that promotion maps admit an operad structure and, supported by the class of `$4$-mass box' promotion, we point at new positivity properties for non-rational maps beyond cluster algebras. Promotion maps have important connections to the geometry and cluster structure of the amplituhedron and singularities of scattering amplitudes in planar $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills theory.</description>

      <title>Lorentzian polynomials and matroids over triangular hyperfields 1: Topological aspects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lorentzian polynomials serve as a bridge between continuous and discrete convexity, connecting analysis and combinatorics. In this article, we study the topology of the space $\mathbb{P}\textrm{L}_J$ of Lorentzian polynomials on $J$ modulo $\mathbb{R}_{&gt;0}$, which is nonempty if and only if $J$ is the set of bases of a polymatroid. We prove that $\mathbb{P}\textrm{L}_J$ is a manifold with boundary of dimension equal to the Tutte rank of $J$, and more precisely, that it is homeomorphic to a closed Euclidean ball with the Dressian of $J$ removed from its boundary. Furthermore, we show that $\mathbb{P}\textrm{L}_J$ is homeomorphic to the thin Schubert cell $\textrm{Gr}_J(\mathbb{T}_q)$ of $J$ over the triangular hyperfield $\mathbb{T}_q$, introduced by Viro in the context of tropical geometry and Maslov dequantization, for any $q&gt;0$. This identification enables us to apply the representation theory of polymatroids developed in a companion paper, as well as earlier work by the first and fourth authors on foundations of matroids, to give a simple explicit description of $\mathbb{P}\textrm{L}_J$ up to homeomorphism in several key cases. Our results show that $\mathbb{P}\textrm{L}_J$ always admits a compactification homeomorphic to a closed Euclidean ball. They can also be used to answer a question of Br\"and\'en in the negative by showing that the closure of $\mathbb{P}\textrm{L}_J$ within the space of all polynomials modulo $\mathbb{R}_{&gt;0}$ is not homeomorphic to a closed Euclidean ball in general. In addition, we introduce the Hausdorff compactification of the space of rescaling classes of Lorentzian polynomials and show that the Chow quotient of a complex Grassmannian maps naturally to this compactification. This provides a geometric framework that connects the asymptotic structure of the space of Lorentzian polynomials with classical constructions in algebraic geometry.</description>

      <title>Cliques and High Odd Holes in Graphs with Chromatic Number Equal to Maximum Degree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that if $G$ is a connected graph with $\chi(G) = \Delta(G)$ and $G\neq \overline{C_7}$, then $G$ contains either $K_{\Delta(G)}$ or an odd hole where every vertex has degree at least $\Delta(G)-1$ in $G$. This extends earlier work by Chen, Lan, Lin and Zhou, who proved the result for $\Delta(G)\geq 7$.</description>

      <title>Backbone colouring of chordal graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A proper $k$-colouring of a graph $G=(V,E)$ is a function $c: V(G)\to \{1,\ldots,k\}$ such that $c(u)\neq c(v)$ for every edge $uv\in E(G)$. The chromatic number $\chi(G)$ is the minimum $k$ such that there exists a proper $k$-colouring of $G$. Given a spanning subgraph $H$ of $G$, a $q$-backbone $k$-colouring of $(G,H)$ is a proper $k$-colouring $c$ of $G$ such that $\lvert c(u)-c(v)\rvert \ge q$ for every edge $uv\in E(H)$. The $q$-backbone chromatic number ${\rm BBC}_q(G,H)$ is the smallest $k$ for which there exists a $q$-backbone $k$-colouring of $(G,H)$. In their seminal paper, Broersma et al.~\cite{BFGW07} ask whether, for any chordal graph $G$ and any spanning forest $H$ of $G$, we have that ${\rm BBC}_2(G,H)\leq \chi(G)+O(1)$.
  In this work, we first show that this is true as long as $H$ is bipartite and $G$ is an interval graph in which each vertex belongs to at most two maximal cliques. We then show that this does not extend to bipartite graphs as backbone by exhibiting a family of chordal graphs $G$ with spanning bipartite subgraphs $H$ satisfying ${\rm BBC}_2(G,H)\geq \frac{5\chi(G)}{3}$. Then, we show that if $G$ is chordal and $H$ has bounded maximum average degree (in particular, if $H$ is a forest), then ${\rm BBC}_2(G,H)\leq \chi(G)+O(\sqrt{\chi(G)})$. We finally show that ${\rm BBC}_2(G,H)\leq \frac{3}{2}\chi(G)+O(1)$ holds whenever $G$ is chordal and $H$ is $C_4$-free.</description>

      <title>Chromatic discrepancy of locally $s$-colourable graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The chromatic discrepancy of a graph $G$, denoted $\phi(G)$, is the least over all proper colourings $\sigma$ of $G$ of the greatest difference between the number of colours $|\sigma(V(H))|$ spanned by an induced subgraph $H$ of $G$ and its chromatic number $\chi(H)$. We prove that the chromatic discrepancy of a triangle-free graph $G$ is at least $\chi(G)-2$. This is best possible and positively answers a question raised by Aravind, Kalyanasundaram, Sandeep, and Sivadasan.
  More generally, we say that a graph $G$ is locally $s$-colourable if the closed neighbourhood of any vertex $v\in V(G)$ is properly $s$-colourable; in particular, a triangle-free graph is locally $2$-colourable. We conjecture that every locally $s$-colourable graph $G$ satisfies $\phi(G) \geq \chi(G)-s$, and show that this would be almost best possible. We prove the conjecture when $\chi(G) \le 11s/6$, and as a partial result towards the general case, we prove that every locally $s$-colourable graph $G$ satisfies $\phi(G) \geq \chi(G) - s\ln \chi(G)$.
  If the conjecture holds, it implies in particular, for every integer $\ell\geq 2$, that any graph $G$ without any copy of $C_{\ell+1}$, the cycle of length $\ell+1$, satisfies $\phi(G) \geq \chi(G) - \ell$. When $\ell \ge 3$ and $G\neq K_\ell$, we conjecture that we actually have $\phi(G)\ge \chi(G) - \ell + 1$, and prove it in the special case $\ell = 3$ or $\chi(G) \le 5\ell/3$. In general, we further obtain that every $C_{\ell+1}$-free graph $G$ satisfies $\phi(G) \geq \chi(G) - O_{\ell}(\ln \ln \chi(G))$. We do so by determining an almost tight bound on the chromatic number of balls of radius at most $\ell/2$ in $G$, which could be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Quadratic relations for ninth variations of Schur functions and application to Schur multiple zeta functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Macdonald's ninth variation of Schur functions is a broad generalization of the classical Schur function and its variants, defined via the Jacobi-Trudi determinant formula. In this paper, we establish various algebraic relations for $S^{(r)}_{\lambda/\mu}(X)$, a class of the ninth variation introduced by Nakagawa, Noumi, Shirakawa, and Yamada, by combining the Jacobi-Trudi formula with determinant formulas such as the Desnanot-Jacobi adjoint matrix theorem and the Pl\"ucker relations, which generalize the corresponding relations for Schur functions. As an application, we investigate algebraic relations for "diagonally constant" Schur multiple zeta functions and examine their specific special values when the shape is rectangular.</description>

      <title>On universal graphs for trees and treewidth $k$ graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $s(n)$ be the minimum number of edges in a graph that contains every $n$-vertex tree as a subgraph. Chung and Graham [J. London Math. Soc. 1983] claim to prove that $s(n)\leqslant O(n\log n)$. We point out a mistake in their proof. The previously best known upper bound is $s(n)\leqslant O(n(\log n)(\log\log n)^{2})$ by Chung, Graham and Pippenger [Proc. Hungarian Coll. on Combinatorics 1976], the proof of which is missing many crucial details. We give a fully self-contained proof of the new and improved upper bound $s(n)\leqslant O(n(\log n)(\log\log n))$. The best known lower bound is $s(n)\geqslant \Omega(n\log n)$.
  We generalise these results for graphs of treewidth $k$. For an integer $k\geqslant 1$, let $s_k(n)$ be the minimum number of edges in a graph that contains every $n$-vertex graph with treewidth $k$ as a subgraph. So $s(n)=s_1(n)$. We show that $\Omega(k n\log n) \leqslant s_k(n) \leqslant O(kn(\log n)(\log\log n))$.</description>

      <title>The Subgraphs of Order Six of the Family of Strongly Regular Graphs with Parameters $\lambda=1$ and $\mu=2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strongly regular graphs are highly symmetrical and can be described fully with just a few parameters yet the existence of many of them is still under the question. Due to this uncertainty, it is of immense interest to study their structure, in particular to obtain all the possible subgraphs of lower order. In this paper we study the family of strongly regular graphs with parameters $\lambda =1$ and $\mu =2$ and establish all their subgraphs of order six.</description>

Abstract: Barnette's conjecture states that every cubic, bipartite, planar and 3-connected graph is Hamiltonian. Goodey verified Barnette's conjecture for all graphs with faces of size up to 6.
  We substantially strengthen Goodey's result by proving Hamiltonicity for cubic, bipartite, planar and (2-)connected graphs with faces of size up to 8. Parts of the proof are computational, including a distinction of 339.068.624 cases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.03568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a derivation D on the ring ${\Lambda}$ of symmetric functions and investigate its combinatorial, algebraic and geometric properties. More precisely, we show that D restricts to a quasi-isometry, with respect to the Hall product, on the graded component of ${\Lambda}$ of each positive degree and provide a chain-rule formula with respect to the plethysm operation. Furthermore, we relate the geometric shape of D(f), where f $\in {\Lambda}$ is an homogeneous symmetric function, to that of f. An application to the shape of the partitions appearing in a given plethysms is proved.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.03634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a Dirac graph, and let $S$ be a vertex subset of $G$, chosen uniformly at random. How likely is the induced subgraph $G[S]$ to be Hamiltonian? This question, proposed by Erd\H{o}s and Faudree in 1996, was recently resolved by Dragani\'c, Keevash and M\"uyesser, in the setting of graphs. In this paper, we study a similar question for tournaments -- if $T$ is a tournament of high minimum degree, how likely is it for a random induced subtournament of $T$ to be Hamiltonian? We prove an optimal bound on this probability, and extend the results to the regime where the subset is not sampled uniformly at random, but according to a $p$-biased measure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02941v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explicitly describe the tropicalization of a cluster variety of finite type C, realizing it as the space of axially symmetric phylogenetic trees. We also find all occurring sign patterns of coordinates, for both the cluster variety and the cluster configuration space. We realize the corresponding signed tropicalizations as subfans of the tropicalization, with each such subfan dual to either a cyclohedron or an associahedron. As additional results, we construct Gr\"obner and tropical bases for the defining ideals of both varieties, and classify the arising toric degenerations.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the symmetric group of degree greater than three cannot be embedded into the Riordan group with coefficients in any commutative ring. We also prove the impossibility to embed finite non-abelian simple groups. As a closely related topic, we show why all truncated Riordan groups are solvable, in stark contrast to the unsolvability of the infinite-sized Riordan groups. Finally, we give an explicit embedding of the alternating group $A_4$ into the Lagrange subgroup with coefficients in a certain commutative ring, and prove that $A_4$ cannot be embedded into a substitution group, and hence, a Nottingham group.</description>

      <title>Temporal Exploration of Random Spanning Tree Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Temporal Graph Exploration problem (TEXP) takes as input a temporal graph, i.e., a sequence of graphs $(G_i)_{i\in \mathbb{N}}$ on the same vertex set, and asks for a walk of shortest length visiting all vertices, where the $i$-th step uses an edge from $G_i$. If each such $G_i$ is connected, then an exploration of length $n^2$ exists, and this is known to be the best possible up to a constant. More fine-grained lower and upper bounds have been obtained for restricted temporal graph classes, however, for several fundamental classes, a large gap persists between known bounds, and it remains unclear which properties of a temporal graph make it inherently difficult to explore.
  Motivated by this limited understanding and the central role of the Temporal Graph Exploration problem in temporal graph theory, we study the problem in a randomised setting. We introduce the Random Spanning Tree (RST) model, which consists of a set of $n$-vertex trees together with an arbitrary probability distribution $\mu$ over this set. A random temporal graph generated by the RST model is a sequence of independent samples drawn from $\mu$.
  We initiate a systematic study of the Temporal Graph Exploration problem in such random temporal graphs and establish tight general bounds on exploration time. Our first main result proves that any RST model can, with high probability (w.h.p.), be explored in $O(n^{3/2})$ time, and we show that this bound is tight up to a constant factor. This demonstrates a fundamental difference between the adversarial and random settings. Our second main result shows that if all trees of an RST are subgraphs of a fixed graph with $m$ edges then, w.h.p.\ , it can be explored in $O(m)$ time.</description>

      <title>Adjacent vertex distinguishing total coloring of 3-degenerate graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A total coloring of a simple undirected graph $G$ is an assignment of colors to its vertices and edges such that the colors given to the vertices form a proper vertex coloring, the colors given to the edges form a proper edge coloring, and the color of every edge is different from that of its two endpoints. That is, $\phi:V(G)\cup E(G)\rightarrow\mathbb{N}$ is a total coloring of $G$ if $\phi(u)\neq\phi(v)$ and $\phi(uv)\neq\phi(u)$ for all $uv\in E(G)$, and $\phi(uv)\neq\phi(uw)$ for any $u \in V(G)$ and distinct $v,w \in N(u)$ (here, $N(u)$ denotes the set of neighbours of $u$). A total coloring $\phi$ of a graph $G$ is said to be ``Adjacent Vertex Distinguishing'' (or AVD for short) if for all $uv\in E(G)$, we have that $\phi(\{u\}\cup\{uw:w\in N(u)\})\neq\phi(\{v\}\cup\{vw\colon w\in N(v)\})$. The AVD Total Coloring Conjecture of Zhang, Chen, Li, Yao, Lu, and Wang (Science in China Series A: Mathematics, 48(3):289--299, 2005) states that every graph $G$ has an AVD total coloring using at most $\Delta(G)+3$ colors, where $\Delta(G)$ denotes the maximum degree of $G$. For some $s\in\mathbb{N}$, a graph $G$ is said to be $s$-degenerate if every subgraph of $G$ has minimum degree at most $s$. Miao, Shi, Hu, and Luo (Discrete Mathematics, 339(10):2446--2449, 2016) showed that the AVD Total Coloring Conjecture is true for 2-degenerate graphs. We verify the conjecture for 3-degenerate graphs.</description>

      <title>On the diameter and girth of zero-divisor graphs of inverse semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $S$ be an inverse semigroup with zero and let $Z(S)^\times$ be its set of non-zero divisors with respect to the natural partial order $\le $ on $S$, that is, $a \in Z(S)^\times $ if there exists $b\in S\setminus\{0\}$ with $\omega(a, b) = \{c \in S: c \leq a\ \mbox{and}\ c \leq b\}=\{0\}$. The set $Z(S)^\times$ makes up the vertices of the corresponding {\it zero-divisor graph} $\Gamma (S)$, with two distinct vertices $a, b$ forming an edge if $\omega(a, b)=\{0\}$. We characterize {\it zero-divisor graphs} of inverse semigroups in terms of their diameter and girth. We also classify inverse semigroups without zero by building a connection between the diameter (girth) and the least group congruence $\sigma$ on an inverse semigroup without zero. Finally, we give a description of the diameter and girth of graph inverse semigoups $I(G)$ in terms of the set of vertices and the set of edges of a graph $G$.</description>

      <title>Notes and computations on forbidden differences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore from several perspectives the following question: given $X\subseteq \mathbb{Z}$ and $N\in \mathbb{N}$, what is the maximum size $D(X,N)$ of $A\subseteq \{1,2,\dots,N\}$ before $A$ is forced to contain two distinct elements that differ by an element of $X$? The set of forbidden differences, $X$, is called \textit{intersective} if $D(X,N)=o(N)$, with the most well-studied examples being $X=S=\{n^2: n\in \mathbb{N}\}$ and $X=\mathcal{P}-1=\{p-1: p\text{ prime}\}$. In addition to some new results, including exact formulas and estimates for $D(X,N)$ in some non-intersective cases like $X=\mathcal{P}$ and $X=S+k$, $k\in \mathbb{N}$, we also provide a comprehensive survey of known bounds and extensive computational data. In particular, we utilize an existing algorithm for finding maximum cliques in graphs to determine $D(S,N)$ for $N\leq 300$ and $D(\mathcal{P}-1,N)$ for $N\leq 500$. None of these exact values appear previously in the literature.</description>

Abstract: The Ramsey number $R(k)$ is the minimum $n \in \mathbb{N}$ such that every red-blue colouring of the edges of the complete graph $K_n$ on $n$ vertices contains a monochromatic copy of $K_k$. We prove that \[ R(k) \leqslant (4 - \varepsilon)^k \] for some constant $\varepsilon &gt; 0$. This is the first exponential improvement over the upper bound of Erd\H{o}s and Szekeres, proved in 1935.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.14887v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Crystal graphs are powerful combinatorial tools for working with the plactic monoid and symmetric functions. Quasi-crystal graphs are an analogous concept for the hypoplactic monoid and quasi-symmetric functions. This paper makes a combinatorial study of these objects. We explain a previously-observed isomorphism of components of the quasi-crystal graph, and provide an explicit description using a new combinatorial structure called a quasi-array. Then two conjectures of Maas-Gari\'epy on the interaction of fundamental quasi-symmetric functions and Schur functions and on the arrangement of quasi-crystal components within crystal components are answered, the former positively, the latter negatively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15306v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the concept of $k$-integral graphs. A graph $\Gamma$ is called $k$-integral if the extension degree of the splitting field of the characteristic polynomial of $\Gamma$ over rational field $\mathbb Q$ is equal to $k$. We prove that the set of all finite connected graphs with given algebraic degree and maximum degree is finite. $1$-integral graphs are just integral ones, graphs all of whose eigenvalues are integer. We study
  $2$-integral Cayley graphs over finite groups $G$ with respect to Cayley sets which are a union of conjugacy classes of $G$. Among other general results, we completely characterize all finite abelian groups having a connected $2$-integral Cayley graph with valency $2,3,4$ and $5$.
  Furthermore, we classify finite groups $G$ for which all Cayley graphs over $G$ with bounded valency are $2$-integral.</description>

      <title>Listing faces of polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02584v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the problem of listing faces of combinatorial polytopes, such as hypercubes, permutahedra, associahedra, and their generalizations, namely graph associahedra and quotientopes. Firstly, we consider the face lattice, which is the inclusion order of all faces of a polytope, and we seek a Hamiltonian cycle in its cover graph, i.e., for any two consecutive faces, one must be a subface of the other, and their dimensions differ by $1$. We construct such Hamiltonian cycles for hypercubes, permutahedra, $B$-permutahedra, associahedra, 3-dimensional polytopes, graph associahedra of chordal graphs, and quotientopes. Secondly, we consider facet-Hamiltonian cycles, which are cycles on the skeleton of a polytope that enter and leave every facet exactly once. This notion was recently introduced by Akitaya, Cardinal, Felsner, Kleist, and Lauff [SODA 2025], where the authors conjectured that $B$-permutahedra admit a facet-Hamiltonian cycle for all dimensions. We construct such facet-Hamiltonian cycles in this paper, thus establishing their conjecture as a theorem. A key tool we use are so-called rhombic strips, which are certain planar spanning subgraphs of the cover graph of the face lattice. Specifically, we construct a rhombic strip in the face lattice of the hypercube of any dimension, and characterize the existence of rhombic strips in the face lattice of 3-dimensional polytopes. Our constructions yield time- and space-efficient algorithms for computing the aforementioned cycles and thus for listing the corresponding combinatorial objects, including ordered set partitions and dissections of a convex polygon.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08752v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Eulerian tonnetz, which associates three minor chords to each major chord and three major chords to each minor chord, can be represented by a bipartite graph with twelve white vertices signifying major chords and twelve black vertices signifying minor chords. This so-called Levi graph uniquely determines the combinatorial geometry of a remarkable configuration of twelve points and twelve lines in the real projective plane with the property that three points lie on each line and three lines pass through each point. Interesting features of the tonnetz, such as the existence of the four principal hexacycles and the three principal octacycles, crucial for the understanding of nineteenth-century voice leading, can be read off rather directly as properties of the configuration. We show how analogous tone networks can be constructed for pentatonic music and twelve-tone music.</description>

Abstract: We study the Wiener index of a class of trees with fixed diameter and order. A double broom is a tree such that there exist two vertices $u$ and $v$, such that each leaf of $T$ is adjacent to $u$ or $v$. We prove that for a tree $T$ of diameter $d$ and (sufficiently large) order $n$ such that $n\leq d-2+4 \left\lfloor \sqrt{ \frac{d-1}{2}} \right\rfloor$, $T$ has maximum Wiener index (in the class of trees of diameter $d$ and order $n$) if and only if $T$ is a balanced double broom. Our results are sharp up to a small constant.</description>

The ASEP is inspired by processes in statistical mechanics, and involves particles of various species moving around a lattice. The particles do not change species.

      <title>Fast algorithms for Vizing's theorem on bounded degree graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.05408v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vizing's theorem states that every graph $G$ of maximum degree $\Delta$ can be properly edge-colored using $\Delta + 1$ colors. The fastest currently known $(\Delta+1)$-edge-coloring algorithm for general graphs is due to Sinnamon and runs in time $O(m\sqrt{n})$, where $n :=|V(G)|$ and $m :=|E(G)|$. We investigate the case when $\Delta$ is constant, i.e., $\Delta = O(1)$. In this regime, the runtime of Sinnamon's algorithm is $O(n^{3/2})$, which can be improved to $O(n \log n)$, as shown by Gabow, Nishizeki, Kariv, Leven, and Terada. Here we give an algorithm whose running time is only $O(n)$, which is obviously best possible. Prior to this work, no linear-time $(\Delta+1)$-edge-coloring algorithm was known for any $\Delta \geq 4$. Using some of the same ideas, we also develop new algorithms for $(\Delta+1)$-edge-coloring in the $\mathsf{LOCAL}$ model of distributed computation. Namely, when $\Delta$ is constant, we design a deterministic $\mathsf{LOCAL}$ algorithm with running time $\tilde{O}(\log^5 n)$ and a randomized $\mathsf{LOCAL}$ algorithm with running time $O(\log ^2 n)$. Although our focus is on the constant $\Delta$ regime, our results remain interesting for $\Delta$ up to $\log^{o(1)} n$, since the dependence of their running time on $\Delta$ is polynomial. The key new ingredient in our algorithms is a novel application of the entropy compression method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.13975v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The general linear group $GL_{n}$, along with its adjoint simple group $PGL_n$, can be described by means of weighted planar networks. In this paper we give a network description for simple Lie groups of types $B$ and $C$. The corresponding networks are axially symmetric modulo a sequence of cluster mutations along the axis of symmetry. We extend to this setting the result of Gekhtman, Shapiro, and Vainshtein on the Poisson property of Postnikov's boundary measurement map. We also show that $B$ and $C$ type networks with positive weights parametrize the totally nonnegative part of the respective group. Finally, we construct network parametrizations of double Bruhat cells in symplectic and odd-dimensional orthogonal groups, and identify the corresponding face weights with Fock-Goncharov cluster coordinates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03935v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish a link between open positroid varieties in the Grassmannians $G(k,n)$ and certain moduli spaces of complexes of vector bundles over Kodaira cycle $C^n$, using the shifted Poisson structure on the latter moduli spaces and relating them to a certain twist of the standard Poisson structure on $G(k,n)$. %by a bivector field on its maximal torus. This link allows us to solve a classification problem for extensions of vector bundles over $C^n$. Based on this solution we further classify the symplectic leaves of all positroid varieties in $G(k,n)$ with respect to the twisted standard Poisson structure. Moreover, we get an explicit description of the moduli stack of symplectic leaves of $G(k,n)$ with the twisted standard Poisson structure as an open substack of the stack of vector bundles on $C^n$.</description>

      <title>A New Construction of Non-Binary Deletion Correcting Codes and their Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13534v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-binary codes correcting multiple deletions have recently attracted a lot of attention. In this work, we focus on multiplicity-free codes, a family of non-binary codes where all symbols are distinct. Our main contribution is a new explicit construction of such codes, based on set and permutation codes. We show that our multiplicity-free codes can correct multiple deletions and provide a decoding algorithm. We also show that, for a certain regime of parameters, our constructed codes have size larger than all the previously known non-binary codes correcting multiple deletions.</description>

      <title>Gauged permutation invariant tensor quantum mechanics, least common multiples and the inclusion-exclusion principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18813v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive the canonical ensemble partition functions for gauged permutation invariant tensor quantum harmonic oscillator thermodynamics, finding surprisingly simple expressions with number-theoretic characteristics. These systems have a gauged symmetry of $S_N$, the symmetric group of all permutations of a set of $N$ objects. The symmetric group acts on tensor variables $ \Phi_{ i_1, \cdots , i_s } $, where the $s$ indices each range over $ \{ 1, 2, \cdots , N \} $ and have the standard $S_N$ action of permutations. The result is a sum over partitions of $N$ and the summand is a product admitting simple expressions, which depend on the least common multiples (LCMs) of subsets of the parts of the partition. The inclusion-exclusion principle of combinatorics plays a central role in the derivation of these expressions. The behaviour of these partition functions under inversion of the Boltzmann factor $ x = e^{ - \beta } $ is governed by universal sequences associated with invariants of symmetric groups and alternating groups. The partition functions allow the development of a high temperature expansion analogous to the $s=2$ matrix case. The calculation of an $s$-dependent breakdown point leads to a critical Boltzmann factor $ x_c = { \log N \over sN^{ s-1}}$ as the leading large $N$ approximation.</description>

      <title>Fano schemes of sub-maximal elementary symmetric functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19163v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Denote by $E_r$ the $r^{th}$ elementary symmetric polynomial in $\dim V$ variables for a vector space $V$ over an infinite field $\Bbbk$. We describe the rational points on the Fano scheme $F_{d-1}(Z(E_{\dim V-1}))$ of projective $(d-1)$-spaces contained in the zero locus of $E_{\dim V-1}$. Isolated points exist precisely for $\dim V=2d$, in which case they are in bijection with the $1\cdot 3\cdots (2d-1)$ pairings on a $2d$-element set. This, in particular, confirming a conjecture of Ambartsoumian, Auel and Jebelli to the effect that (over $\mathbb{R}$) all isolated points are recoverable via integral star transforms with appropriate symbols.</description>

      <title>Graphs with tree decompositions of small graphs and realizing them as the Reeb graphs of real algebraic functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00729v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have been interested in graphs and realizing them as Reeb graphs of explicit real algebraic functions.
  The Reeb graph of a differentiable function is the quotient space of the manifold of the domain, regarded as the space consisting of all components of preimages of all single points. Reeb graphs have been fundamental and strong tools in geometry of manifolds since the birth of theory of Morse functions, in the former half of the 20th century. We can easily see that the Reeb graph of the natural height of the unit sphere whose dimension is at least $2$ is a graph with exactly one edge and two edges.
  We are concerned with realizations of graphs decomposed into trees nicely, each vertex of which corresponds to a graph with exactly one edge and two edges or a graph with exactly two edges homeomorphic to a circle.</description>
