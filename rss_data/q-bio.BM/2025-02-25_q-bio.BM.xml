      <title>Auto-ADMET: An Effective and Interpretable AutoML Method for Chemical ADMET Property Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) has been playing important roles in drug discovery in the past years by providing (pre-)screening tools for prioritising chemical compounds to pass through wet lab experiments. One of the main ML tasks in drug discovery is to build quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models, associating the molecular structure of chemical compounds with an activity or property. These properties -- including absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity (ADMET) -- are essential to model compound behaviour, activity and interactions in the organism. Although several methods exist, the majority of them do not provide an appropriate model's personalisation, yielding to bias and lack of generalisation to new data since the chemical space usually shifts from application to application. This fact leads to low predictive performance when completely new data is being tested by the model. The area of Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) emerged aiming to solve this issue, outputting tailored ML algorithms to the data at hand. Although an important task, AutoML has not been practically used to assist cheminformatics and computational chemistry researchers often, with just a few works related to the field. To address these challenges, this work introduces Auto-ADMET, an interpretable evolutionary-based AutoML method for chemical ADMET property prediction. Auto-ADMET employs a Grammar-based Genetic Programming (GGP) method with a Bayesian Network Model to achieve comparable or better predictive performance against three alternative methods -- standard GGP method, pkCSM and XGBOOST model -- on 12 benchmark chemical ADMET property prediction datasets. The use of a Bayesian Network model on Auto-ADMET's evolutionary process assisted in both shaping the search procedure and interpreting the causes of its AutoML performance.</description>

      <title>Co-evolution-based Metal-binding Residue Prediction with Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In computational structural biology, predicting metal-binding sites and their corresponding metal types is challenging due to the complexity of protein structures and interactions. Conventional sequence- and structure-based prediction approaches cannot capture the complex evolutionary relationships driving these interactions to facilitate understanding, while recent co-evolution-based approaches do not fully consider the entire structure of the co-evolved residue network. In this paper, we introduce MBGNN (Metal-Binding Graph Neural Network) that utilizes the entire co-evolved residue network and effectively captures the complex dependencies within protein structures via graph neural networks to enhance the prediction of co-evolved metal-binding residues and their associated metal types. Experimental results on a public dataset show that MBGNN outperforms existing co-evolution-based metal-binding prediction methods, and it is also competitive against recent sequence-based methods, showing the potential of integrating co-evolutionary insights with advanced machine learning to deepen our understanding of protein-metal interactions. The MBGNN code is publicly available at https://github.com/SRastegari/MBGNN.</description>

      <title>Constrained Shape Analysis with Applications to RNA Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In many applications of shape analysis, lengths between some landmarks are constrained. For instance, biomolecules often have some bond lengths and some bond angles constrained, and variation occurs only along unconstrained bonds and constrained bonds' torsions where the latter are conveniently modelled by dihedral angles. Our work has been motivated by low resolution biomolecular chain RNA where only some prominent atomic bonds can be well identified. Here, we propose a new modelling strategy for such constrained shape analysis starting with a product of polar coordinates (polypolars), where, due to constraints, for example, some radial coordinates should be omitted, leaving products of spheres (polyspheres). We give insight into these coordinates for particular cases such as five landmarks which are motivated by a practical RNA application. We also discuss distributions for polypolar coordinates and give a specific methodology with illustration when the constrained size-and-shape variables are concentrated. There are applications of this in clustering and we give some insight into a modified version of the MINT-AGE algorithm.</description>

      <title>Auxiliary Discrminator Sequence Generative Adversarial Networks (ADSeqGAN) for Few Sample Molecule Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16446v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce Auxiliary Discriminator Sequence Generative Adversarial Networks (ADSeqGAN), a novel approach for molecular generation in small-sample datasets. Traditional generative models often struggle with limited training data, particularly in drug discovery, where molecular datasets for specific therapeutic targets, such as nucleic acids binders and central nervous system (CNS) drugs, are scarce. ADSeqGAN addresses this challenge by integrating an auxiliary random forest classifier as an additional discriminator into the GAN framework, significantly improves molecular generation quality and class specificity.
  Our method incorporates pretrained generator and Wasserstein distance to enhance training stability and diversity. We evaluate ADSeqGAN on a dataset comprising nucleic acid-targeting and protein-targeting small molecules, demonstrating its superior ability to generate nucleic acid binders compared to baseline models such as SeqGAN, ORGAN, and MolGPT. Through an oversampling strategy, ADSeqGAN also significantly improves CNS drug generation, achieving a higher yield than traditional de novo models. Critical assessments, including docking simulations and molecular property analysis, confirm that ADSeqGAN-generated molecules exhibit strong binding affinities, enhanced chemical diversity, and improved synthetic feasibility.
  Overall, ADSeqGAN presents a novel framework for generative molecular design in data-scarce scenarios, offering potential applications in computational drug discovery. We have demonstrated the successful applications of ADSeqGAN in generating synthetic nucleic acid-targeting and CNS drugs in this work.</description>

      <title>Lambda-ABF-OPES: Faster Convergence with High Accuracy in Alchemical Free Energy Calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting the binding affinity between small molecules and target macromolecules while combining both speed and accuracy, is a cornerstone of modern computational drug discovery which is critical for accelerating therapeutic development. Despite recent progresses in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, such as advanced polarizable force fields and enhanced-sampling techniques, estimating absolute binding free energies (ABFE) remains computationally challenging. To overcome these difficulties, we introduce a highly efficient, hybrid methodology that couples the Lambda-Adaptive Biasing Force (Lambda-ABF) scheme with On-the-fly Probability Enhanced Sampling (OPES). This approach achieves up to a nine-fold improvement in sampling efficiency and computational speed compared to the original Lambda-ABF when used in conjunction with the AMOEBA polarizable force field, yielding converged results at a fraction of the cost of standard techniques.</description>

      <title>FABind+: Enhancing Molecular Docking through Improved Pocket Prediction and Pose Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20261v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Molecular docking is a pivotal process in drug discovery. While traditional techniques rely on extensive sampling and simulation governed by physical principles, these methods are often slow and costly. The advent of deep learning-based approaches has shown significant promise, offering increases in both accuracy and efficiency. Building upon the foundational work of FABind, a model designed with a focus on speed and accuracy, we present FABind+, an enhanced iteration that largely boosts the performance of its predecessor. We identify pocket prediction as a critical bottleneck in molecular docking and propose a novel methodology that significantly refines pocket prediction, thereby streamlining the docking process. Furthermore, we introduce modifications to the docking module to enhance its pose generation capabilities. In an effort to bridge the gap with conventional sampling/generative methods, we incorporate a simple yet effective sampling technique coupled with a confidence model, requiring only minor adjustments to the regression framework of FABind. Experimental results and analysis reveal that FABind+ remarkably outperforms the original FABind, achieves competitive state-of-the-art performance, and delivers insightful modeling strategies. This demonstrates FABind+ represents a substantial step forward in molecular docking and drug discovery. Our code is in https://github.com/QizhiPei/FABind.</description>

      <title>Steering Protein Family Design through Profile Bayesian Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07671v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Protein family design emerges as a promising alternative by combining the advantages of de novo protein design and mutation-based directed evolution.In this paper, we propose ProfileBFN, the Profile Bayesian Flow Networks, for specifically generative modeling of protein families. ProfileBFN extends the discrete Bayesian Flow Network from an MSA profile perspective, which can be trained on single protein sequences by regarding it as a degenerate profile, thereby achieving efficient protein family design by avoiding large-scale MSA data construction and training. Empirical results show that ProfileBFN has a profound understanding of proteins. When generating diverse and novel family proteins, it can accurately capture the structural characteristics of the family. The enzyme produced by this method is more likely than the previous approach to have the corresponding function, offering better odds of generating diverse proteins with the desired functionality.</description>

      <title>Optimistic Games for Combinatorial Bayesian Optimization with Application to Protein Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18582v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) is a powerful framework to optimize black-box expensive-to-evaluate functions via sequential interactions. In several important problems (e.g. drug discovery, circuit design, neural architecture search, etc.), though, such functions are defined over large $\textit{combinatorial and unstructured}$ spaces. This makes existing BO algorithms not feasible due to the intractable maximization of the acquisition function over these domains. To address this issue, we propose $\textbf{GameOpt}$, a novel game-theoretical approach to combinatorial BO. $\textbf{GameOpt}$ establishes a cooperative game between the different optimization variables, and selects points that are game $\textit{equilibria}$ of an upper confidence bound acquisition function. These are stable configurations from which no variable has an incentive to deviate$-$ analog to local optima in continuous domains. Crucially, this allows us to efficiently break down the complexity of the combinatorial domain into individual decision sets, making $\textbf{GameOpt}$ scalable to large combinatorial spaces. We demonstrate the application of $\textbf{GameOpt}$ to the challenging $\textit{protein design}$ problem and validate its performance on four real-world protein datasets. Each protein can take up to $20^{X}$ possible configurations, where $X$ is the length of a protein, making standard BO methods infeasible. Instead, our approach iteratively selects informative protein configurations and very quickly discovers highly active protein variants compared to other baselines.</description>
