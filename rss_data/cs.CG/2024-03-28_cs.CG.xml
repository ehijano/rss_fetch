      <title>On Orbital Labeling with Circular Contours</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Schematic depictions in text books and maps often need to label specific point features with a text label. We investigate one variant of such a labeling, where the image contour is a circle and the labels are placed as circular arcs along the circumference of this circle. To map the labels to the feature points, we use orbital-radial leaders, which consist of a circular arc concentric with the image contour circle and a radial line to the contour. In this paper, we provide a framework, which captures various dimensions of the problem space as well as several polynomial time algorithms and complexity results for some problem variants.</description>

      <title>A census of graph-drawing algorithms based on generalized transversal structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define graph drawing algorithms which simultaneously generalize several classical ones. More precisely, we consider the following algorithms:
  (a) Fusy's algorithm for the straight-line grid drawing of planar triangulations, based on transversal structures,
  (b) Barri\`ere and Huemmer's algorithm for the straight-line grid drawing of planar quadrangulations, based on separating decompositions,
  (c) He's algorithm for the orthogonal drawing of 3-valent planar maps, based on transversal structures,
  (d) Bernardi \&amp; Fusy 's algorithm for the orthogonal drawing of 4-valent planar maps, based on 2-orientations.
  We present an algorithm generalizing (a) and (b) which produces a straight line grid drawing for planar maps with faces of degree at most 4, and we present an algorithm generalizing (c) and (d) which produces an orthogonal drawing for planar maps with vertices of degree at most 4. Our two algorithms are based on a class of combinatorial structures called grand-Schnyder woods.</description>

      <title>Tessellation and interactive visualization of four-dimensional spacetime geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses two problems needed to support four-dimensional ($3d + t$) spacetime numerical simulations. The first contribution is a general algorithm for producing conforming spacetime meshes of moving geometries. Here, the surface points of the geometry are embedded in a four-dimensional space as the geometry moves in time. The geometry is first tessellated at prescribed time steps and then these tessellations are connected in the parameter space of each geometry entity to form tetrahedra. In contrast to previous work, this approach allows the resolution of the geometry to be controlled at each time step. The only restriction on the algorithm is the requirement that no topological changes to the geometry are made (i.e. the hierarchical relations between all geometry entities are maintained) as the geometry moves in time. The validity of the final mesh topology is verified by ensuring the tetrahedralizations represent a closed 3-manifold. For some analytic problems, the $4d$ volume of the tetrahedralization is also verified. The second problem addressed in this paper is the design of a system to interactively visualize four-dimensional meshes, including tetrahedra (embedded in $4d$) and pentatopes. Algorithms that either include or exclude a geometry shader are described, and the efficiency of each approach is then compared. Overall, the results suggest that visualizing tetrahedra (either those bounding the domain, or extracted from a pentatopal mesh) using a geometry shader achieves the highest frame rate, in the range of $20-30$ frames per second for meshes with about $50$ million tetrahedra.</description>

      <title>Topological Optimal Transport for Geometric Cycle Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological data analysis is a powerful tool for describing topological signatures in real world data. An important challenge in topological data analysis is matching significant topological signals across distinct systems. In geometry and probability theory, optimal transport formalises notions of distance and matchings between distributions and structured objects. We propose to combine these approaches, constructing a mathematical framework for optimal transport-based matchings of topological features. Building upon recent advances in the domains of persistent homology and optimal transport for hypergraphs, we develop a transport-based methodology for topological data processing. We define measure topological networks, which integrate both geometric and topological information about a system, introduce a distance on the space of these objects, and study its metric properties, showing that it induces a geodesic metric space of non-negative curvature. The resulting Topological Optimal Transport (TpOT) framework provides a transport model on point clouds that minimises topological distortion while simultaneously yielding a geometrically informed matching between persistent homology cycles.</description>

      <title>A stability theorem for bigraded persistence barcodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.14694v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define bigraded persistent homology modules and bigraded barcodes of a finite pseudo-metric space X using the ordinary and double homology of the moment-angle complex associated with the Vietoris-Rips filtration of X. We prove a stability theorem for the bigraded persistent double homology modules and barcodes.</description>
