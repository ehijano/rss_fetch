      <title>RoboBERT: An End-to-end Multimodal Robotic Manipulation Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Embodied intelligence integrates multiple modalities, enabling agents to understand images, language, and actions simultaneously. However, existing models always depend on additional datasets or extensive pre-training to maximize performance improvements, consuming abundant training time and expensive hardware cost. To tackle this issue, we present RoboBERT, a novel end-to-end robotic manipulation model integrated with a unique training strategy. This model utilizes a CNN-based diffusion policy, enhancing and stabilizing the effectiveness of this model by separating training processes for different modalities. It also underscores the importance of data augmentation, verifying various techniques to significantly boost performance. Unlike models that depend on extra data or large foundation models, RoboBERT achieves a highly competitive success rate while using only language-labeled expert demonstrations and maintaining a relatively smaller model size. Specifically, RoboBERT achieves an average length of 4.52 on the CALVIN benchmark for \(ABCD \rightarrow D\) task, setting a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) record. Furthermore, when tested on a real robot, the model demonstrates superior performance, achieving a higher success rate than other methods trained with the same data. We propose that these concepts and methodologies of RoboBERT demonstrate extensive versatility and compatibility, contributing significantly to the development of lightweight multimodal robotic models.

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the increasing prevalence of autonomous vehicles (AVs), their vulnerability to various types of attacks has grown, presenting significant security challenges. In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL)-based approach for designing optimal stealthy integrity attacks on AV actuators. We also analyze the limitations of state-of-the-art RL-based secure controllers developed to counter such attacks. Through extensive simulation experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method.</description>

      <title>Fast and Safe Scheduling of Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an experimental analysis of a fast heuristic algorithm that was designed to generate a fast, collision-free schedule for a set of robots on a path graph. The experiments confirm the algorithm's effectiveness in producing collision-free schedules as well as achieving the optimal solution when all tasks assigned to the robots are of equal duration. Additionally, we provide an integer linear programming formulation that guarantees an optimal solution for this scheduling problem on any input graph, at the expense of significantly greater computational resources. We prove the correctness of our integer linear program. By comparing the solutions of these two algorithms, including the time required by the schedule itself, and the run time of each algorithm, we show that the heuristic algorithm is optimal or near optimal in nearly all cases, with a far faster run time than the integer linear program.</description>

      <title>Visual-Haptic Model Mediated Teleoperation for Remote Ultrasound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tele-ultrasound has the potential greatly to improve health equity for countless remote communities. However, practical scenarios involve potentially large time delays which cause current implementations of telerobotic ultrasound (US) to fail. Using a local model of the remote environment to provide haptics to the expert operator can decrease teleoperation instability, but the delayed visual feedback remains problematic. This paper introduces a robotic tele-US system in which the local model is not only haptic, but also visual, by re-slicing and rendering a pre-acquired US sweep in real time to provide the operator a preview of what the delayed image will resemble. A prototype system is presented and tested with 15 volunteer operators. It is found that visual-haptic model-mediated teleoperation (MMT) compensates completely for time delays up to 1000 ms round trip in terms of operator effort and completion time while conventional MMT does not. Visual-haptic MMT also significantly outperforms MMT for longer time delays in terms of motion accuracy and force control. This proof-of-concept study suggests that visual-haptic MMT may facilitate remote robotic tele-US.</description>

      <title>End-to-End Predictive Planner for Autonomous Driving with Consistency Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trajectory prediction and planning are fundamental components for autonomous vehicles to navigate safely and efficiently in dynamic environments. Traditionally, these components have often been treated as separate modules, limiting the ability to perform interactive planning and leading to computational inefficiency in multi-agent scenarios. In this paper, we present a novel unified and data-driven framework that integrates prediction and planning with a single consistency model. Trained on real-world human driving datasets, our consistency model generates samples from high-dimensional, multimodal joint trajectory distributions of the ego and multiple surrounding agents, enabling end-to-end predictive planning. It effectively produces interactive behaviors, such as proactive nudging and yielding to ensure both safe and efficient interactions with other road users. To incorporate additional planning constraints on the ego vehicle, we propose an alternating direction method for multi-objective guidance in online guided sampling. Compared to diffusion models, our consistency model achieves better performance with fewer sampling steps, making it more suitable for real-time deployment. Experimental results on Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD) demonstrate our method's superiority in trajectory quality, constraint satisfaction, and interactive behavior compared to various existing approaches.</description>

      <title>COMBO-Grasp: Learning Constraint-Based Manipulation for Bimanual Occluded Grasping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of occluded robot grasping, i.e. grasping in situations where the desired grasp poses are kinematically infeasible due to environmental constraints such as surface collisions. Traditional robot manipulation approaches struggle with the complexity of non-prehensile or bimanual strategies commonly used by humans in these circumstances. State-of-the-art reinforcement learning (RL) methods are unsuitable due to the inherent complexity of the task. In contrast, learning from demonstration requires collecting a significant number of expert demonstrations, which is often infeasible. Instead, inspired by human bimanual manipulation strategies, where two hands coordinate to stabilise and reorient objects, we focus on a bimanual robotic setup to tackle this challenge. In particular, we introduce Constraint-based Manipulation for Bimanual Occluded Grasping (COMBO-Grasp), a learning-based approach which leverages two coordinated policies: a constraint policy trained using self-supervised datasets to generate stabilising poses and a grasping policy trained using RL that reorients and grasps the target object. A key contribution lies in value function-guided policy coordination. Specifically, during RL training for the grasping policy, the constraint policy's output is refined through gradients from a jointly trained value function, improving bimanual coordination and task performance. Lastly, COMBO-Grasp employs teacher-student policy distillation to effectively deploy point cloud-based policies in real-world environments. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that COMBO-Grasp significantly improves task success rates compared to competitive baseline approaches, with successful generalisation to unseen objects in both simulated and real-world environments.</description>

      <title>A Cooperative Bearing-Rate Approach for Observability-Enhanced Target Motion Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-based target motion estimation is a fundamental problem in many robotic tasks. The existing methods have the limitation of low observability and, hence, face challenges in tracking highly maneuverable targets. Motivated by the aerial target pursuit task where a target may maneuver in 3D space, this paper studies how to further enhance observability by incorporating the \emph{bearing rate} information that has not been well explored in the literature. The main contribution of this paper is to propose a new cooperative estimator called STT-R (Spatial-Temporal Triangulation with bearing Rate), which is designed under the framework of distributed recursive least squares. This theoretical result is further verified by numerical simulation and real-world experiments. It is shown that the proposed STT-R algorithm can effectively generate more accurate estimations and effectively reduce the lag in velocity estimation, enabling tracking of more maneuverable targets.</description>

      <title>Ground-Optimized 4D Radar-Inertial Odometry via Continuous Velocity Integration using Gaussian Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radar ensures robust sensing capabilities in adverse weather conditions, yet challenges remain due to its high inherent noise level. Existing radar odometry has overcome these challenges with strategies such as filtering spurious points, exploiting Doppler velocity, or integrating with inertial measurements. This paper presents two novel improvements beyond the existing radar-inertial odometry: ground-optimized noise filtering and continuous velocity preintegration. Despite the widespread use of ground planes in LiDAR odometry, imprecise ground point distributions of radar measurements cause naive plane fitting to fail. Unlike plane fitting in LiDAR, we introduce a zone-based uncertainty-aware ground modeling specifically designed for radar. Secondly, we note that radar velocity measurements can be better combined with IMU for a more accurate preintegration in radar-inertial odometry. Existing methods often ignore temporal discrepancies between radar and IMU by simplifying the complexities of asynchronous data streams with discretized propagation models. Tackling this issue, we leverage GP and formulate a continuous preintegration method for tightly integrating 3-DOF linear velocity with IMU, facilitating full 6-DOF motion directly from the raw measurements. Our approach demonstrates remarkable performance (less than 1% vertical drift) in public datasets with meticulous conditions, illustrating substantial improvement in elevation accuracy. The code will be released as open source for the community: https://github.com/wooseongY/Go-RIO.</description>

      <title>Open-Source Factor Graph Optimization Package for GNSS: Examples and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: State estimation methods using factor graph optimization (FGO) have garnered significant attention in global navigation satellite system (GNSS) research. FGO exhibits superior estimation accuracy compared with traditional state estimation methods that rely on least-squares or Kalman filters. However, only a few FGO libraries are specialized for GNSS observations. This paper introduces an open-source GNSS FGO package named gtsam\_gnss, which has a simple structure and can be easily applied to GNSS research and development. This package separates the preprocessing of GNSS observations from factor optimization. Moreover, it describes the error function of the GNSS factor in a straightforward manner, allowing for general-purpose inputs. This design facilitates the transition from ordinary least-squares-based positioning to FGO and supports user-specific GNSS research. In addition, gtsam\_gnss includes analytical examples involving various factors using GNSS data in real urban environments. This paper presents three application examples: the use of a robust error model, estimation of integer ambiguity in the carrier phase, and combination of GNSS and inertial measurements from smartphones. The proposed framework demonstrates excellent state estimation performance across all use cases.</description>

      <title>Learning Humanoid Standing-up Control across Diverse Postures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Standing-up control is crucial for humanoid robots, with the potential for integration into current locomotion and loco-manipulation systems, such as fall recovery. Existing approaches are either limited to simulations that overlook hardware constraints or rely on predefined ground-specific motion trajectories, failing to enable standing up across postures in real-world scenes. To bridge this gap, we present HoST (Humanoid Standing-up Control), a reinforcement learning framework that learns standing-up control from scratch, enabling robust sim-to-real transfer across diverse postures. HoST effectively learns posture-adaptive motions by leveraging a multi-critic architecture and curriculum-based training on diverse simulated terrains. To ensure successful real-world deployment, we constrain the motion with smoothness regularization and implicit motion speed bound to alleviate oscillatory and violent motions on physical hardware, respectively. After simulation-based training, the learned control policies are directly deployed on the Unitree G1 humanoid robot. Our experimental results demonstrate that the controllers achieve smooth, stable, and robust standing-up motions across a wide range of laboratory and outdoor environments.

      <title>CordViP: Correspondence-based Visuomotor Policy for Dexterous Manipulation in Real-World</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving human-level dexterity in robots is a key objective in the field of robotic manipulation. Recent advancements in 3D-based imitation learning have shown promising results, providing an effective pathway to achieve this goal. However, obtaining high-quality 3D representations presents two key problems: (1) the quality of point clouds captured by a single-view camera is significantly affected by factors such as camera resolution, positioning, and occlusions caused by the dexterous hand; (2) the global point clouds lack crucial contact information and spatial correspondences, which are necessary for fine-grained dexterous manipulation tasks. To eliminate these limitations, we propose CordViP, a novel framework that constructs and learns correspondences by leveraging the robust 6D pose estimation of objects and robot proprioception. Specifically, we first introduce the interaction-aware point clouds, which establish correspondences between the object and the hand. These point clouds are then used for our pre-training policy, where we also incorporate object-centric contact maps and hand-arm coordination information, effectively capturing both spatial and temporal dynamics. Our method demonstrates exceptional dexterous manipulation capabilities with an average success rate of 90\% in four real-world tasks, surpassing other baselines by a large margin. Experimental results also highlight the superior generalization and robustness of CordViP to different objects, viewpoints, and scenarios. Code and videos are available on https://aureleopku.github.io/CordViP.</description>

      <title>Learning to Group and Grasp Multiple Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simultaneously grasping and transporting multiple objects can significantly enhance robotic work efficiency and has been a key research focus for decades. The primary challenge lies in determining how to push objects, group them, and execute simultaneous grasping for respective groups while considering object distribution and the hardware constraints of the robot. Traditional rule-based methods struggle to flexibly adapt to diverse scenarios. To address this challenge, this paper proposes an imitation learning-based approach. We collect a series of expert demonstrations through teleoperation and train a diffusion policy network, enabling the robot to dynamically generate action sequences for pushing, grouping, and grasping, thereby facilitating efficient multi-object grasping and transportation. We conducted experiments to evaluate the method under different training dataset sizes, varying object quantities, and real-world object scenarios. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach can effectively and adaptively generate multi-object grouping and grasping strategies. With the support of more training data, imitation learning is expected to be an effective approach for solving the multi-object grasping problem.</description>

      <title>Robot Data Curation with Mutual Information Estimators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The performance of imitation learning policies often hinges on the datasets with which they are trained. Consequently, investment in data collection for robotics has grown across both industrial and academic labs. However, despite the marked increase in the quantity of demonstrations collected, little work has sought to assess the quality of said data despite mounting evidence of its importance in other areas such as vision and language. In this work, we take a critical step towards addressing the data quality in robotics. Given a dataset of demonstrations, we aim to estimate the relative quality of individual demonstrations in terms of both state diversity and action predictability. To do so, we estimate the average contribution of a trajectory towards the mutual information between states and actions in the entire dataset, which precisely captures both the entropy of the state distribution and the state-conditioned entropy of actions. Though commonly used mutual information estimators require vast amounts of data often beyond the scale available in robotics, we introduce a novel technique based on k-nearest neighbor estimates of mutual information on top of simple VAE embeddings of states and actions. Empirically, we demonstrate that our approach is able to partition demonstration datasets by quality according to human expert scores across a diverse set of benchmarks spanning simulation and real world environments. Moreover, training policies based on data filtered by our method leads to a 5-10% improvement in RoboMimic and better performance on real ALOHA and Franka setups.</description>

      <title>A Real-to-Sim-to-Real Approach to Robotic Manipulation with VLM-Generated Iterative Keypoint Rewards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Task specification for robotic manipulation in open-world environments is challenging, requiring flexible and adaptive objectives that align with human intentions and can evolve through iterative feedback. We introduce Iterative Keypoint Reward (IKER), a visually grounded, Python-based reward function that serves as a dynamic task specification. Our framework leverages VLMs to generate and refine these reward functions for multi-step manipulation tasks. Given RGB-D observations and free-form language instructions, we sample keypoints in the scene and generate a reward function conditioned on these keypoints. IKER operates on the spatial relationships between keypoints, leveraging commonsense priors about the desired behaviors, and enabling precise SE(3) control. We reconstruct real-world scenes in simulation and use the generated rewards to train reinforcement learning (RL) policies, which are then deployed into the real world-forming a real-to-sim-to-real loop. Our approach demonstrates notable capabilities across diverse scenarios, including both prehensile and non-prehensile tasks, showcasing multi-step task execution, spontaneous error recovery, and on-the-fly strategy adjustments. The results highlight IKER's effectiveness in enabling robots to perform multi-step tasks in dynamic environments through iterative reward shaping.</description>

      <title>Re$^3$Sim: Generating High-Fidelity Simulation Data via 3D-Photorealistic Real-to-Sim for Robotic Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-world data collection for robotics is costly and resource-intensive, requiring skilled operators and expensive hardware. Simulations offer a scalable alternative but often fail to achieve sim-to-real generalization due to geometric and visual gaps. To address these challenges, we propose a 3D-photorealistic real-to-sim system, namely, RE$^3$SIM, addressing geometric and visual sim-to-real gaps. RE$^3$SIM employs advanced 3D reconstruction and neural rendering techniques to faithfully recreate real-world scenarios, enabling real-time rendering of simulated cross-view cameras within a physics-based simulator. By utilizing privileged information to collect expert demonstrations efficiently in simulation, and train robot policies with imitation learning, we validate the effectiveness of the real-to-sim-to-real pipeline across various manipulation task scenarios. Notably, with only simulated data, we can achieve zero-shot sim-to-real transfer with an average success rate exceeding 58%. To push the limit of real-to-sim, we further generate a large-scale simulation dataset, demonstrating how a robust policy can be built from simulation data that generalizes across various objects.

      <title>TranSplat: Surface Embedding-guided 3D Gaussian Splatting for Transparent Object Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transparent object manipulation remains a sig- nificant challenge in robotics due to the difficulty of acquiring accurate and dense depth measurements. Conventional depth sensors often fail with transparent objects, resulting in in- complete or erroneous depth data. Existing depth completion methods struggle with interframe consistency and incorrectly model transparent objects as Lambertian surfaces, leading to poor depth reconstruction. To address these challenges, we propose TranSplat, a surface embedding-guided 3D Gaussian Splatting method tailored for transparent objects. TranSplat uses a latent diffusion model to generate surface embeddings that provide consistent and continuous representations, making it robust to changes in viewpoint and lighting. By integrating these surface embeddings with input RGB images, TranSplat effectively captures the complexities of transparent surfaces, enhancing the splatting of 3D Gaussians and improving depth completion. Evaluations on synthetic and real-world transpar- ent object benchmarks, as well as robot grasping tasks, show that TranSplat achieves accurate and dense depth completion, demonstrating its effectiveness in practical applications. We open-source synthetic dataset and model: https://github. com/jeongyun0609/TranSplat</description>

      <title>Generative AI-Enhanced Cooperative MEC of UAVs and Ground Stations for Unmanned Surface Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing deployment of unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) require computational support and coverage in applications such as maritime search and rescue. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can offer low-cost, flexible aerial services, and ground stations (GSs) can provide powerful supports, which can cooperate to help the USVs in complex scenarios. However, the collaboration between UAVs and GSs for USVs faces challenges of task uncertainties, USVs trajectory uncertainties, heterogeneities, and limited computational resources. To address these issues, we propose a cooperative UAV and GS based robust multi-access edge computing framework to assist USVs in completing computational tasks. Specifically, we formulate the optimization problem of joint task offloading and UAV trajectory to minimize the total execution time, which is in the form of mixed integer nonlinear programming and NP-hard to tackle. Therefore, we propose the algorithm of generative artificial intelligence-enhanced heterogeneous agent proximal policy optimization (GAI-HAPPO). The proposed algorithm integrates GAI models to enhance the actor network ability to model complex environments and extract high-level features, thereby allowing the algorithm to predict uncertainties and adapt to dynamic conditions. Additionally, GAI stabilizes the critic network, addressing the instability of multi-agent reinforcement learning approaches. Finally, extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms the existing benchmark methods, thus highlighting the potentials in tackling intricate, cross-domain issues in the considered scenarios.</description>

      <title>Robot-Initiated Social Control of Sedentary Behavior: Comparing the Impact of Relationship- and Target-Focused Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To design social robots to effectively promote health behavior change, it is essential to understand how people respond to various health communication strategies employed by these robots. This study examines the effectiveness of two types of social control strategies from a social robot, relationship-focused strategies (emphasizing relational consequences) and target-focused strategies (emphasizing health consequences), in encouraging people to reduce sedentary behavior. A two-session lab experiment was conducted (n = 135), where participants first played a game with a robot, followed by the robot persuading them to stand up and move using one of the strategies. Half of the participants joined a second session to have a repeated interaction with the robot. Results showed that relationship-focused strategies motivated participants to stay active longer. Repeated sessions did not strengthen participants' relationship with the robot, but those who felt more attached to the robot responded more actively to the target-focused strategies. These findings offer valuable insights for designing persuasive strategies for social robots in health communication contexts.</description>

      <title>Continual Learning through Human-Robot Interaction: Human Perceptions of a Continual Learning Robot in Repeated Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.16332v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For long-term deployment in dynamic real-world environments, assistive robots must continue to learn and adapt to their environments. Researchers have developed various computational models for continual learning (CL) that can allow robots to continually learn from limited training data, and avoid forgetting previous knowledge. While these CL models can mitigate forgetting on static, systematically collected datasets, it is unclear how human users might perceive a robot that continually learns over multiple interactions with them. In this paper, we developed a system that integrates CL models for object recognition with a Fetch mobile manipulator robot and allows human participants to directly teach and test the robot over multiple sessions. We conducted an in-person study with 60 participants that interacted with our system in 300 sessions (5 sessions per participant). We conducted a between-subject study with three different CL models to understand human perceptions of continual learning robots over multiple sessions. Our results suggest that participants' perceptions of trust, competence, and usability of a continual learning robot significantly decrease over multiple sessions if the robot forgets previously learned objects. However, the perceived task load on participants for teaching and testing the robot remains the same over multiple sessions even if the robot forgets previously learned objects. Our results also indicate that state-of-the-art CL models might perform unreliably when applied on robots interacting with human participants. Further, continual learning robots are not perceived as very trustworthy or competent by human participants, regardless of the underlying continual learning model or the session number.</description>

      <title>Robotic Grasping of Harvested Tomato Trusses Using Vision and Online Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.17170v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Currently, truss tomato weighing and packaging require significant manual work. The main obstacle to automation lies in the difficulty of developing a reliable robotic grasping system for already harvested trusses. We propose a method to grasp trusses that are stacked in a crate with considerable clutter, which is how they are commonly stored and transported after harvest. The method consists of a deep learning-based vision system to first identify the individual trusses in the crate and then determine a suitable grasping location on the stem. To this end, we have introduced a grasp pose ranking algorithm with online learning capabilities. After selecting the most promising grasp pose, the robot executes a pinch grasp without needing touch sensors or geometric models. Lab experiments with a robotic manipulator equipped with an eye-in-hand RGB-D camera showed a 100% clearance rate when tasked to pick all trusses from a pile. 93% of the trusses were successfully grasped on the first try, while the remaining 7% required more attempts.</description>

      <title>Optimal Spatial-Temporal Triangulation for Bearing-Only Cooperative Motion Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.15846v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vision-based cooperative motion estimation is an important problem for many multi-robot systems such as cooperative aerial target pursuit. This problem can be formulated as bearing-only cooperative motion estimation, where the visual measurement is modeled as a bearing vector pointing from the camera to the target. The conventional approaches for bearing-only cooperative estimation are mainly based on the framework distributed Kalman filtering (DKF). In this paper, we propose a new optimal bearing-only cooperative estimation algorithm, named spatial-temporal triangulation, based on the method of distributed recursive least squares, which provides a more flexible framework for designing distributed estimators than DKF. The design of the algorithm fully incorporates all the available information and the specific triangulation geometric constraint. As a result, the algorithm has superior estimation performance than the state-of-the-art DKF algorithms in terms of both accuracy and convergence speed as verified by numerical simulation. We rigorously prove the exponential convergence of the proposed algorithm. Moreover, to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm under practical challenging conditions, we develop a vision-based cooperative aerial target pursuit system, which is the first of such fully autonomous systems so far to the best of our knowledge.</description>

      <title>Inferring Belief States in Partially-Observable Human-Robot Teams</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11955v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the real-time estimation of human situation awareness using observations from a robot teammate with limited visibility. In human factors and human-autonomy teaming, it is recognized that individuals navigate their environments using an internal mental simulation, or mental model. The mental model informs cognitive processes including situation awareness, contextual reasoning, and task planning. In teaming domains, the mental model includes a team model of each teammate's beliefs and capabilities, enabling fluent teamwork without the need for explicit communication. However, little work has applied team models to human-robot teaming. In this work we compare the performance of two models, logical predicates and large language models, at estimating user situation awareness over varying visibility conditions. Our results indicate that the methods are largely resilient to low-visibility conditions in our domain, however opportunities exist to improve their overall performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17070v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bipedal robots are gaining global recognition due to their potential applications and advancements in artificial intelligence, particularly through Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). While DRL has significantly advanced bipedal locomotion, the development of a unified framework capable of handling a wide range of tasks remains an ongoing challenge. This survey systematically categorises, compares, and analyses existing DRL frameworks for bipedal locomotion, organising them into end-to-end and hierarchical control schemes. End-to-end frameworks are evaluated based on their learning approaches, while hierarchical frameworks are examined in terms of layered structures that integrate learning-based or traditional model-based methods. We provide a detailed evaluation of the composition, strengths, limitations, and capabilities of each framework. Additionally, this survey identifies key research gaps and proposes future directions aimed at creating a more integrated and efficient framework for bipedal locomotion, with wide-ranging applications in real-world environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13573v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Defining reward functions for skill learning has been a long-standing challenge in robotics. Recently, vision-language models (VLMs) have shown promise in defining reward signals for teaching robots manipulation skills. However, existing work often provides reward guidance that is too coarse, leading to insufficient learning processes. In this paper, we address this issue by implementing more fine-grained reward guidance. We decompose tasks into simpler sub-tasks, using this decomposition to offer more informative reward guidance with VLMs. We also propose a VLM-based self imitation learning process to speed up learning. Empirical evidence demonstrates that our algorithm consistently outperforms baselines such as CLIP, LIV, and RoboCLIP. Specifically, our algorithm achieves a $5.4 \times$ higher average success rates compared to the best baseline, RoboCLIP, across a series of manipulation tasks.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents SPI-DP, a novel first-order optimizer capable of optimizing robot programs with respect to both high-level task objectives and motion-level constraints. To that end, we introduce DGPMP2-ND, a differentiable collision-free motion planner for serial N-DoF kinematics, and integrate it into an iterative, gradient-based optimization approach for generic, parameterized robot program representations. SPI-DP allows first-order optimization of planned trajectories and program parameters with respect to objectives such as cycle time or smoothness subject to e.g. collision constraints, while enabling humans to understand, modify or even certify the optimized programs. We provide a comprehensive evaluation on two practical household and industrial applications.</description>

      <title>Annealed Winner-Takes-All for Motion Forecasting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11172v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In autonomous driving, motion prediction aims at forecasting the future trajectories of nearby agents, helping the ego vehicle to anticipate behaviors and drive safely. A key challenge is generating a diverse set of future predictions, commonly addressed using data-driven models with Multiple Choice Learning (MCL) architectures and Winner-Takes-All (WTA) training objectives. However, these methods face initialization sensitivity and training instabilities. Additionally, to compensate for limited performance, some approaches rely on training with a large set of hypotheses, requiring a post-selection step during inference to significantly reduce the number of predictions. To tackle these issues, we take inspiration from annealed MCL, a recently introduced technique that improves the convergence properties of MCL methods through an annealed Winner-Takes-All loss (aWTA). In this paper, we demonstrate how the aWTA loss can be integrated with state-of-the-art motion forecasting models to enhance their performance using only a minimal set of hypotheses, eliminating the need for the cumbersome post-selection step. Our approach can be easily incorporated into any trajectory prediction model normally trained using WTA and yields significant improvements. To facilitate the application of our approach to future motion forecasting models, the code is made publicly available: https://github.com/valeoai/MF_aWTA.</description>

Abstract: In real-world scenarios, many robotic manipulation tasks are hindered by occlusions and limited fields of view, posing significant challenges for passive observation-based models that rely on fixed or wrist-mounted cameras. In this paper, we investigate the problem of robotic manipulation under limited visual observation and propose a task-driven asynchronous active vision-action model.Our model serially connects a camera Next-Best-View (NBV) policy with a gripper Next-Best Pose (NBP) policy, and trains them in a sensor-motor coordination framework using few-shot reinforcement learning. This approach allows the agent to adjust a third-person camera to actively observe the environment based on the task goal, and subsequently infer the appropriate manipulation actions.We trained and evaluated our model on 8 viewpoint-constrained tasks in RLBench. The results demonstrate that our model consistently outperforms baseline algorithms, showcasing its effectiveness in handling visual constraints in manipulation tasks.</description>

      <title>GravMAD: Grounded Spatial Value Maps Guided Action Diffusion for Generalized 3D Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20154v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Robots' ability to follow language instructions and execute diverse 3D manipulation tasks is vital in robot learning. Traditional imitation learning-based methods perform well on seen tasks but struggle with novel, unseen ones due to variability. Recent approaches leverage large foundation models to assist in understanding novel tasks, thereby mitigating this issue. However, these methods lack a task-specific learning process, which is essential for an accurate understanding of 3D environments, often leading to execution failures. In this paper, we introduce GravMAD, a sub-goal-driven, language-conditioned action diffusion framework that combines the strengths of imitation learning and foundation models. Our approach breaks tasks into sub-goals based on language instructions, allowing auxiliary guidance during both training and inference. During training, we introduce Sub-goal Keypose Discovery to identify key sub-goals from demonstrations. Inference differs from training, as there are no demonstrations available, so we use pre-trained foundation models to bridge the gap and identify sub-goals for the current task. In both phases, GravMaps are generated from sub-goals, providing GravMAD with more flexible 3D spatial guidance compared to fixed 3D positions. Empirical evaluations on RLBench show that GravMAD significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, with a 28.63% improvement on novel tasks and a 13.36% gain on tasks encountered during training. Evaluations on real-world robotic tasks further show that GravMAD can reason about real-world tasks, associate them with relevant visual information, and generalize to novel tasks. These results demonstrate GravMAD's strong multi-task learning and generalization in 3D manipulation. Video demonstrations are available at: https://gravmad.github.io.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18647v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data scaling has revolutionized fields like natural language processing and computer vision, providing models with remarkable generalization capabilities. In this paper, we investigate whether similar data scaling laws exist in robotics, particularly in robotic manipulation, and whether appropriate data scaling can yield single-task robot policies that can be deployed zero-shot for any object within the same category in any environment. To this end, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study on data scaling in imitation learning. By collecting data across numerous environments and objects, we study how a policy's generalization performance changes with the number of training environments, objects, and demonstrations. Throughout our research, we collect over 40,000 demonstrations and execute more than 15,000 real-world robot rollouts under a rigorous evaluation protocol. Our findings reveal several intriguing results: the generalization performance of the policy follows a roughly power-law relationship with the number of environments and objects. The diversity of environments and objects is far more important than the absolute number of demonstrations; once the number of demonstrations per environment or object reaches a certain threshold, additional demonstrations have minimal effect. Based on these insights, we propose an efficient data collection strategy. With four data collectors working for one afternoon, we collect sufficient data to enable the policies for two tasks to achieve approximately 90% success rates in novel environments with unseen objects.</description>

      <title>EdgeFlowNet: 100FPS@1W Dense Optical Flow For Tiny Mobile Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14576v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optical flow estimation is a critical task for tiny mobile robotics to enable safe and accurate navigation, obstacle avoidance, and other functionalities. However, optical flow estimation on tiny robots is challenging due to limited onboard sensing and computation capabilities. In this paper, we propose EdgeFlowNet , a high-speed, low-latency dense optical flow approach for tiny autonomous mobile robots by harnessing the power of edge computing. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by deploying EdgeFlowNet on a tiny quadrotor to perform static obstacle avoidance, flight through unknown gaps and dynamic obstacle dodging. EdgeFlowNet is about 20 faster than the previous state-of-the-art approaches while improving accuracy by over 20% and using only 1.08W of power enabling advanced autonomy on palm-sized tiny mobile robots.</description>

      <title>NMM-HRI: Natural Multi-modal Human-Robot Interaction with Voice and Deictic Posture via Large Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00785v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Translating human intent into robot commands is crucial for the future of service robots in an aging society. Existing Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) systems relying on gestures or verbal commands are impractical for the elderly due to difficulties with complex syntax or sign language. To address the challenge, this paper introduces a multi-modal interaction framework that combines voice and deictic posture information to create a more natural HRI system. The visual cues are first processed by the object detection model to gain a global understanding of the environment, and then bounding boxes are estimated based on depth information. By using a large language model (LLM) with voice-to-text commands and temporally aligned selected bounding boxes, robot action sequences can be generated, while key control syntax constraints are applied to avoid potential LLM hallucination issues. The system is evaluated on real-world tasks with varying levels of complexity using a Universal Robots UR3e manipulator. Our method demonstrates significantly better performance in HRI in terms of accuracy and robustness. To benefit the research community and the general public, we will make our code and design open-source.</description>

      <title>Noise-conditioned Energy-based Annealed Rewards (NEAR): A Generative Framework for Imitation Learning from Observation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14856v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a new imitation learning framework based on energy-based generative models capable of learning complex, physics-dependent, robot motion policies through state-only expert motion trajectories. Our algorithm, called Noise-conditioned Energy-based Annealed Rewards (NEAR), constructs several perturbed versions of the expert's motion data distribution and learns smooth, and well-defined representations of the data distribution's energy function using denoising score matching. We propose to use these learnt energy functions as reward functions to learn imitation policies via reinforcement learning. We also present a strategy to gradually switch between the learnt energy functions, ensuring that the learnt rewards are always well-defined in the manifold of policy-generated samples. We evaluate our algorithm on complex humanoid tasks such as locomotion and martial arts and compare it with state-only adversarial imitation learning algorithms like Adversarial Motion Priors (AMP). Our framework sidesteps the optimisation challenges of adversarial imitation learning techniques and produces results comparable to AMP in several quantitative metrics across multiple imitation settings.</description>

      <title>STRIDE: Automating Reward Design, Deep Reinforcement Learning Training and Feedback Optimization in Humanoid Robotics Locomotion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04692v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Humanoid robotics presents significant challenges in artificial intelligence, requiring precise coordination and control of high-degree-of-freedom systems. Designing effective reward functions for deep reinforcement learning (DRL) in this domain remains a critical bottleneck, demanding extensive manual effort, domain expertise, and iterative refinement. To overcome these challenges, we introduce STRIDE, a novel framework built on agentic engineering to automate reward design, DRL training, and feedback optimization for humanoid robot locomotion tasks. By combining the structured principles of agentic engineering with large language models (LLMs) for code-writing, zero-shot generation, and in-context optimization, STRIDE generates, evaluates, and iteratively refines reward functions without relying on task-specific prompts or templates. Across diverse environments featuring humanoid robot morphologies, STRIDE outperforms the state-of-the-art reward design framework EUREKA, achieving an average improvement of round 250% in efficiency and task performance. Using STRIDE-generated rewards, simulated humanoid robots achieve sprint-level locomotion across complex terrains, highlighting its ability to advance DRL workflows and humanoid robotics research.</description>

      <title>AToM: Adaptive Theory-of-Mind-Based Human Motion Prediction in Long-Term Human-Robot Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05792v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Humans learn from observations and experiences to adjust their behaviours towards better performance. Interacting with such dynamic humans is challenging, as the robot needs to predict the humans accurately for safe and efficient operations. Long-term interactions with dynamic humans have not been extensively studied by prior works. We propose an adaptive human prediction model based on the Theory-of-Mind (ToM), a fundamental social-cognitive ability that enables humans to infer others' behaviours and intentions. We formulate the human internal belief about others using a game-theoretic model, which predicts the future motions of all agents in a navigation scenario. To estimate an evolving belief, we use an Unscented Kalman Filter to update the behavioural parameters in the human internal model. Our formulation provides unique interpretability to dynamic human behaviours by inferring how the human predicts the robot. We demonstrate through long-term experiments in both simulations and real-world settings that our prediction effectively promotes safety and efficiency in downstream robot planning. Code will be available at https://github.com/centiLinda/AToM-human-prediction.git.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Grasping of Moving Objects in Dense Clutter via Global-to-Local Detection and Static-to-Dynamic Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05916v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Robotic grasping is facing a variety of real-world uncertainties caused by non-static object states, unknown object properties, and cluttered object arrangements. The difficulty of grasping increases with the presence of more uncertainties, where commonly used learning-based approaches struggle to perform consistently across varying conditions. In this study, we integrate the idea of similarity matching to tackle the challenge of grasping novel objects that are simultaneously in motion and densely cluttered using a single RGBD camera, where multiple uncertainties coexist. We achieve this by shifting visual detection from global to local states and operating grasp planning from static to dynamic scenes. Notably, we introduce optimization methods to enhance planning efficiency for this time-sensitive task. Our proposed system can adapt to various object types, arrangements and movement speeds without the need for extensive training, as demonstrated by real-world experiments.

      <title>Space-Aware Instruction Tuning: Dataset and Benchmark for Guide Dog Robots Assisting the Visually Impaired</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07183v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Guide dog robots offer promising solutions to enhance mobility and safety for visually impaired individuals, addressing the limitations of traditional guide dogs, particularly in perceptual intelligence and communication. With the emergence of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), robots are now capable of generating natural language descriptions of their surroundings, aiding in safer decision-making. However, existing VLMs often struggle to accurately interpret and convey spatial relationships, which is crucial for navigation in complex environments such as street crossings. We introduce the Space-Aware Instruction Tuning (SAIT) dataset and the Space-Aware Benchmark (SA-Bench) to address the limitations of current VLMs in understanding physical environments. Our automated data generation pipeline focuses on the virtual path to the destination in 3D space and the surroundings, enhancing environmental comprehension and enabling VLMs to provide more accurate guidance to visually impaired individuals. We also propose an evaluation protocol to assess VLM effectiveness in delivering walking guidance. Comparative experiments demonstrate that our space-aware instruction-tuned model outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms. We have fully open-sourced the SAIT dataset and SA-Bench, along with the related code, at https://github.com/byungokhan/Space-awareVLM</description>

      <title>Robot Instance Segmentation with Few Annotations for Grasping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01302v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ability of robots to manipulate objects relies heavily on their aptitude for visual perception. In domains characterized by cluttered scenes and high object variability, most methods call for vast labeled datasets, laboriously hand-annotated, with the aim of training capable models. Once deployed, the challenge of generalizing to unfamiliar objects implies that the model must evolve alongside its domain. To address this, we propose a novel framework that combines Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) with Learning Through Interaction (LTI), allowing a model to learn by observing scene alterations and leverage visual consistency despite temporal gaps without requiring curated data of interaction sequences. As a result, our approach exploits partially annotated data through self-supervision and incorporates temporal context using pseudo-sequences generated from unlabeled still images. We validate our method on two common benchmarks, ARMBench mix-object-tote and OCID, where it achieves state-of-the-art performance. Notably, on ARMBench, we attain an $\text{AP}_{50}$ of $86.37$, almost a $20\%$ improvement over existing work, and obtain remarkable results in scenarios with extremely low annotation, achieving an $\text{AP}_{50}$ score of $84.89$ with just $1 \%$ of annotated data compared to $72$ presented in ARMBench on the fully annotated counterpart.</description>

      <title>VIPeR: Visual Incremental Place Recognition with Adaptive Mining and Continual Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21416v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Visual place recognition (VPR) is an essential component of many autonomous and augmented/virtual reality systems. It enables the systems to robustly localize themselves in large-scale environments. Existing VPR methods demonstrate attractive performance at the cost of heavy pre-training and limited generalizability. When deployed in unseen environments, these methods exhibit significant performance drops. Targeting this issue, we present VIPeR, a novel approach for visual incremental place recognition with the ability to adapt to new environments while retaining the performance of previous environments. We first introduce an adaptive mining strategy that balances the performance within a single environment and the generalizability across multiple environments. Then, to prevent catastrophic forgetting in lifelong learning, we draw inspiration from human memory systems and design a novel memory bank for our VIPeR. Our memory bank contains a sensory memory, a working memory and a long-term memory, with the first two focusing on the current environment and the last one for all previously visited environments. Additionally, we propose a probabilistic knowledge distillation to explicitly safeguard the previously learned knowledge. We evaluate our proposed VIPeR on three large-scale datasets, namely Oxford Robotcar, Nordland, and TartanAir. For comparison, we first set a baseline performance with naive finetuning. Then, several more recent lifelong learning methods are compared. Our VIPeR achieves better performance in almost all aspects with the biggest improvement of 13.65% in average performance.</description>

      <title>EmbodiedSAM: Online Segment Any 3D Thing in Real Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11811v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Embodied tasks require the agent to fully understand 3D scenes simultaneously with its exploration, so an online, real-time, fine-grained and highly-generalized 3D perception model is desperately needed. Since high-quality 3D data is limited, directly training such a model in 3D is almost infeasible. Meanwhile, vision foundation models (VFM) has revolutionized the field of 2D computer vision with superior performance, which makes the use of VFM to assist embodied 3D perception a promising direction. However, most existing VFM-assisted 3D perception methods are either offline or too slow that cannot be applied in practical embodied tasks. In this paper, we aim to leverage Segment Anything Model (SAM) for real-time 3D instance segmentation in an online setting. This is a challenging problem since future frames are not available in the input streaming RGB-D video, and an instance may be observed in several frames so object matching between frames is required. To address these challenges, we first propose a geometric-aware query lifting module to represent the 2D masks generated by SAM by 3D-aware queries, which is then iteratively refined by a dual-level query decoder. In this way, the 2D masks are transferred to fine-grained shapes on 3D point clouds. Benefit from the query representation for 3D masks, we can compute the similarity matrix between the 3D masks from different views by efficient matrix operation, which enables real-time inference. Experiments on ScanNet, ScanNet200, SceneNN and 3RScan show our method achieves leading performance even compared with offline methods. Our method also demonstrates great generalization ability in several zero-shot dataset transferring experiments and show great potential in open-vocabulary and data-efficient setting. Code and demo are available at https://xuxw98.github.io/ESAM/, with only one RTX 3090 GPU required for training and evaluation.</description>

Abstract: Recently, visual grounding and multi-sensors setting have been incorporated into perception system for terrestrial autonomous driving systems and Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs), yet the high complexity of modern learning-based visual grounding model using multi-sensors prevents such model to be deployed on USVs in the real-life. To this end, we design a low-power multi-task model named NanoMVG for waterway embodied perception, guiding both camera and 4D millimeter-wave radar to locate specific object(s) through natural language. NanoMVG can perform both box-level and mask-level visual grounding tasks simultaneously. Compared to other visual grounding models, NanoMVG achieves highly competitive performance on the WaterVG dataset, particularly in harsh environments and boasts ultra-low power consumption for long endurance.</description>

      <title>Interactive incremental learning of generalizable skills with local trajectory modulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05655v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The problem of generalization in learning from demonstration (LfD) has received considerable attention over the years, particularly within the context of movement primitives, where a number of approaches have emerged. Recently, two important approaches have gained recognition. While one leverages via-points to adapt skills locally by modulating demonstrated trajectories, another relies on so-called task-parameterized models that encode movements with respect to different coordinate systems, using a product of probabilities for generalization. While the former are well-suited to precise, local modulations, the latter aim at generalizing over large regions of the workspace and often involve multiple objects. Addressing the quality of generalization by leveraging both approaches simultaneously has received little attention. In this work, we propose an interactive imitation learning framework that simultaneously leverages local and global modulations of trajectory distributions. Building on the kernelized movement primitives (KMP) framework, we introduce novel mechanisms for skill modulation from direct human corrective feedback. Our approach particularly exploits the concept of via-points to incrementally and interactively 1) improve the model accuracy locally, 2) add new objects to the task during execution and 3) extend the skill into regions where demonstrations were not provided. We evaluate our method on a bearing ring-loading task using a torque-controlled, 7-DoF, DLR SARA robot.</description>

Abstract: We present DriveGPT, a scalable behavior model for autonomous driving. We model driving as a sequential decision-making task, and learn a transformer model to predict future agent states as tokens in an autoregressive fashion. We scale up our model parameters and training data by multiple orders of magnitude, enabling us to explore the scaling properties in terms of dataset size, model parameters, and compute. We evaluate DriveGPT across different scales in a planning task, through both quantitative metrics and qualitative examples, including closed-loop driving in complex real-world scenarios. In a separate prediction task, DriveGPT outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and exhibits improved performance by pretraining on a large-scale dataset, further validating the benefits of data scaling.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning-Based Estimation Of Wave Direction For Unmanned Surface Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16205v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs) have become critical tools for marine exploration, environmental monitoring, and autonomous navigation. Accurate estimation of wave direction is essential for improving USV navigation and ensuring operational safety, but traditional methods often suffer from high costs and limited spatial resolution. This paper proposes a machine learning-based approach leveraging LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks to predict wave direction using sensor data collected from USVs. Experimental results show the capability of the LSTM model to learn temporal dependencies and provide accurate predictions, outperforming simpler baselines.</description>

Abstract: Manipulating objects with varying geometries and deformable objects is a major challenge in robotics. Tasks such as insertion with different objects or cloth hanging require precise control and effective modelling of complex dynamics. In this work, we frame this problem through the lens of a heterogeneous graph that comprises smaller sub-graphs, such as actuators and objects, accompanied by different edge types describing their interactions. This graph representation serves as a unified structure for both rigid and deformable objects tasks, and can be extended further to tasks comprising multiple actuators. To evaluate this setup, we present a novel and challenging reinforcement learning benchmark, including rigid insertion of diverse objects, as well as rope and cloth manipulation with multiple end-effectors. These tasks present a large search space, as both the initial and target configurations are uniformly sampled in 3D space. To address this issue, we propose a novel graph-based policy model, dubbed Heterogeneous Equivariant Policy (HEPi), utilizing $SE(3)$
  equivariant message passing networks as the main backbone to exploit the geometric symmetry. In addition, by modeling explicit heterogeneity, HEPi can outperform Transformer-based and non-heterogeneous equivariant policies in terms of average returns, sample efficiency, and generalization to unseen objects.</description>
