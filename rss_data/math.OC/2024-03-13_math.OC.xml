      <title>A Computational Method for $H_2$-optimal Estimator and State Feedback Controller Synthesis for PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present solvable, convex formulations of $H_2$-optimal state estimation and state-feedback control problems for a general class of linear Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) with one spatial dimension. These convex formulations are derived by using an analysis and control framework called the `Partial Integral Equation' (PIE) framework, which utilizes the PIE representation of infinite-dimensional systems. Since PIEs are parameterized by Partial Integral (PI) operators that form an algebra, $H_2$-optimal estimation and control problems for PIEs can be formulated as Linear PI Inequalities (LPIs). Furthermore, if a PDE admits a PIE representation, then the stability and $H_2$ performance of the PIE system implies that of the PDE system. Consequently, the optimal estimator and controller obtained for a PIE using LPIs provide the same stability and performance when applied to the corresponding PDE. These LPI optimization problems can be solved computationally using semi-definite programming solvers because such problems can be formulated using Linear Matrix Inequalities by using positive matrices to parameterize a cone of positive PI operators. We illustrate the application of these methods by constructing observers and controllers for some standard PDE examples.</description>

      <title>The Randomized Block Coordinate Descent Method in the H\"older Smooth Setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work provides the first convergence analysis for the Randomized Block Coordinate Descent method for minimizing a function that is both H\"older smooth and block H\"older smooth. Our analysis applies to objective functions that are non-convex, convex, and strongly convex. For non-convex functions, we show that the expected gradient norm reduces at an $O\left(k^{\frac{\gamma}{1+\gamma}}\right)$ rate, where $k$ is the iteration count and $\gamma$ is the H\"older exponent. For convex functions, we show that the expected suboptimality gap reduces at the rate $O\left(k^{-\gamma}\right)$. In the strongly convex setting, we show this rate for the expected suboptimality gap improves to $O\left(k^{-\frac{2\gamma}{1-\gamma}}\right)$ when $\gamma&gt;1$ and to a linear rate when $\gamma=1$. Notably, these new convergence rates coincide with those furnished in the existing literature for the Lipschitz smooth setting.</description>

      <title>Exponential Stability of Parametric Optimization-Based Controllers via Lur'e Contractivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, we investigate sufficient conditions for the exponential stability of LTI systems driven by controllers derived from parametric optimization problems. Our primary focus is on parametric projection controllers, namely parametric programs whose objective function is the squared distance to a nominal controller. Leveraging the virtual system method of analysis and a novel contractivity result for Lur'e systems, we establish a sufficient LMI condition for the exponential stability of an LTI system with a parametric projection-based controller. Separately, we prove additional results for single-integrator systems. Finally, we apply our results to state-dependent saturated control systems and control barrier function-based control and provide numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Globalized distributionally robust optimization with multi core sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is essential to capture the true probability distribution of uncertain data in the distributionally robust optimization (DRO). The uncertain data presents multimodality in numerous application scenarios, in the sense that the probability density function of the uncertain data has two or more modes (local maximums). In this paper, we propose a globalized distributionally robust optimization framework with multiple core sets (MGDRO) to handle the multimodal data. This framework captures the multimodal structure via a penalty function composed of the minimum distances from the random vector to all core sets. Under some assumptions, the MGDRO model can be reformulated as tractable semi-definite programs for both moment-based and metric-based ambiguity sets. We applied the MGDRO models to a multi-product newswendor problem with multimodal demands. The numerical results turn out that the MGDRO models outperform traditional DRO models and other multimodal models greatly.</description>

      <title>Schr{\"o}dinger eigenfunctions sharing the same modulus and applications to the control of quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate when linearly independent eigenfunctions of the Schr\''odinger operator may have the same modulus. General properties are established and the one-dimensional case is treated in full generality. The study is motivated by its application to the bilinear control of the Schr{\"o}dinger equation. By assuming that the potentials of interaction satisfy a saturation property and by adapting a strategy recently proposed by Duca and Nersesyan, we discuss when the system can be steered arbitrarily fast between energy levels. Extensions of the previous results to quantum graphs are finally presented.</description>

      <title>Regret Analysis of Policy Optimization over Submanifolds for Linearly Constrained Online LQG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancement in online optimization and control has provided novel tools to study online linear quadratic regulator (LQR) problems, where cost matrices are varying adversarially over time. However, the controller parameterization of existing works may not satisfy practical conditions like sparsity due to physical connections. In this work, we study online linear quadratic Gaussian problems with a given linear constraint imposed on the controller. Inspired by the recent work of [1] which proposed, for a linearly constrained policy optimization of an offline LQR, a second order method equipped with a Riemannian metric that emerges naturally in the context of optimal control problems, we propose online optimistic Newton on manifold (OONM) which provides an online controller based on the prediction on the first and second order information of the function sequence. To quantify the proposed algorithm, we leverage the notion of regret defined as the sub-optimality of its cumulative cost to that of a (locally) minimizing controller sequence and provide the regret bound in terms of the path-length of the minimizer sequence. Simulation results are also provided to verify the property of OONM.</description>

      <title>Controllability of continuous networks and a kernel-based learning approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Residual deep neural networks are formulated as interacting particle systems leading to a description through neural differential equations, and, in the case of large input data, through mean-field neural networks. The mean-field description allows also the recast of the training processes as a controllability problem for the solution to the mean-field dynamics. We show theoretical results on the controllability of the linear microscopic and mean-field dynamics through the Hilbert Uniqueness Method and propose a computational approach based on kernel learning methods to solve numerically, and efficiently, the training problem. Further aspects of the structural properties of the mean-field equation will be reviewed.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the Impact of Vaccine Hesitancy on the Allocation of Vital Resources During COVID-19 Pandemic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted significant challenges in the allocation of vital healthcare resources. Existing epidemiological models, specifically compartmental models, aimed to predict the spread of the COVID-19 virus and its impact on the population, but they overlooked the influence of \ac{VH} on disease dynamics, including the expected number of hospitalizations and fatalities. We propose improvements to the \ac{SEIR} model for COVID-19 by incorporating the influence of vaccination, \ac{VH}, and resource availability on the disease dynamics. We collect publicly available data and perform data analysis to capture \ac{VH} dynamic changes over time and develop scenario paths for \ac{VH}. We simulate the proposed compartmental model for each \ac{VH} path to explain the impacts of public attitudes toward vaccination, the impacts of healthcare resources on patient outcomes, and the timing of vaccination rollout on the progression and severity of the epidemic. Our analysis demonstrates that reducing \ac{VH} improves health outcomes, reinforcing the importance of addressing \ac{VH} to curb the spread of infectious diseases. Our results show that adequate levels of critical healthcare resources are crucial for minimizing fatalities and also highlight the life-saving impact of timely and effective vaccination programs.</description>

      <title>System Design Approach for Control of Differentially Private Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to concurrently design dynamic controllers and correlated differential privacy noise in dynamic control systems. An increase in privacy noise increases the system's privacy but adversely affects the system's performance. Our approach optimizes the noise distribution while shaping closed-loop system dynamics such that the privacy noise has the least impact on system performance and the most effect on system privacy. We further add privacy noise to both control input and system output to privatize the system's state for an adversary with access to both communication channels and direct output measurements. The study also suggests tailored privacy bounds for different states, providing a comprehensive framework for jointly optimizing system performance and privacy in the context of differential privacy.</description>

      <title>Mechanics of Next Token Prediction with Self-Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transformer-based language models are trained on large datasets to predict the next token given an input sequence. Despite this simple training objective, they have led to revolutionary advances in natural language processing. Underlying this success is the self-attention mechanism. In this work, we ask: $\textit{What}$ $\textit{does}$ $\textit{a}$ $\textit{single}$ $\textit{self-attention}$ $\textit{layer}$ $\textit{learn}$ $\textit{from}$ $\textit{next-token}$ $\textit{prediction?}$ We show that training self-attention with gradient descent learns an automaton which generates the next token in two distinct steps: $\textbf{(1)}$ $\textbf{Hard}$ $\textbf{retrieval:}$ Given input sequence, self-attention precisely selects the $\textit{high-priority}$ $\textit{input}$ $\textit{tokens}$ associated with the last input token. $\textbf{(2)}$ $\textbf{Soft}$ $\textbf{composition:}$ It then creates a convex combination of the high-priority tokens from which the next token can be sampled. Under suitable conditions, we rigorously characterize these mechanics through a directed graph over tokens extracted from the training data. We prove that gradient descent implicitly discovers the strongly-connected components (SCC) of this graph and self-attention learns to retrieve the tokens that belong to the highest-priority SCC available in the context window. Our theory relies on decomposing the model weights into a directional component and a finite component that correspond to hard retrieval and soft composition steps respectively. This also formalizes a related implicit bias formula conjectured in [Tarzanagh et al. 2023]. We hope that these findings shed light on how self-attention processes sequential data and pave the path toward demystifying more complex architectures.</description>

      <title>Early Directional Convergence in Deep Homogeneous Neural Networks for Small Initializations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the gradient flow dynamics that arise when training deep homogeneous neural networks, starting with small initializations. The present work considers neural networks that are assumed to have locally Lipschitz gradients and an order of homogeneity strictly greater than two. This paper demonstrates that for sufficiently small initializations, during the early stages of training, the weights of the neural network remain small in norm and approximately converge in direction along the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) points of the neural correlation function introduced in [1]. Additionally, for square loss and under a separability assumption on the weights of neural networks, a similar directional convergence of gradient flow dynamics is shown near certain saddle points of the loss function.</description>

      <title>Discretization of Total Variation in Optimization with Integrality Constraint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce discretizations of infinite-dimensional optimization problems with total variation regularization and integrality constraints on the optimization variables. We advance the discretization of the dual formulation of the total variation term with Raviart--Thomas functions which is known from literature for certain convex problems. Since we have an integrality constraint, the previous analysis from Caillaud and Chambolle [10] does not hold anymore. Even weaker $\Gamma$-convergence results do not hold anymore because the recovery sequences generally need to attain non-integer values to recover the total variation of the limit function. We solve this issue by introducing a discretization of the input functions on an embedded, finer mesh. A superlinear coupling of the mesh sizes implies an averaging on the coarser mesh of the Raviart--Thomas ansatz, which enables to recover the total variation of integer-valued limit functions with integer-valued discretized input functions. Moreover, we are able to estimate the discretized total variation of the recovery sequence by the total variation of its limit and an error depending on the mesh size ratio. For the discretized optimization problems, we additionally add a constraint that vanishes in the limit and enforces compactness of the sequence of minimizers, which yields their convergence to a minimizer of the original problem. This constraint contains a degree of freedom whose admissible range is determined. Its choice may have a strong impact on the solutions in practice as we demonstrate with an example from imaging.</description>

      <title>Tangential Fixpoint Iterations for Gromov-Wasserstein Barycenters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) transport problem is a relaxation of classic optimal transport, which seeks a transport between two measures while preserving their internal geometry. Due to meeting this theoretical underpinning, it is a valuable tool for the analysis of objects that do not possess a natural embedding or should be studied independently of it. Prime applications can thus be found in e.g. shape matching, classification and interpolation tasks. To tackle the latter, one theoretically justified approach is the employment of multi-marginal GW transport and GW barycenters, which are Fr\'echet means with respect to the GW distance. However, because the computation of GW itself already poses a quadratic and non-convex optimization problem, the determination of GW barycenters is a hard task and algorithms for their computation are scarce. In this paper, we revisit a known procedure for the determination of Fr\'echet means in Riemannian manifolds via tangential approximations in the context of GW. We provide a characterization of barycenters in the GW tangent space, which ultimately gives rise to a fixpoint iteration for approximating GW barycenters using multi-marginal plans. We propose a relaxation of this fixpoint iteration and show that it monotonously decreases the barycenter loss. In certain cases our proposed method naturally provides us with barycentric embeddings. The resulting algorithm is capable of producing qualitative shape interpolations between multiple 3d shapes with support sizes of over thousands of points in reasonable time. In addition, we verify our method on shape classification and multi-graph matching tasks.</description>

      <title>Implicit Regularization of Gradient Flow on One-Layer Softmax Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study gradient flow on the exponential loss for a classification problem with a one-layer softmax attention model, where the key and query weight matrices are trained separately. Under a separability assumption on the data, we show that when gradient flow achieves the minimal loss value, it further implicitly minimizes the nuclear norm of the product of the key and query weight matrices. Such implicit regularization can be described by a Support Vector Machine (SVM) problem with respect to the attention weights. This finding contrasts with prior results showing that the gradient descent induces an implicit regularization on the Frobenius norm on the product weight matrix when the key and query matrices are combined into a single weight matrix for training. For diagonal key and query matrices, our analysis builds upon the reparameterization technique and exploits approximate KKT conditions of the SVM associated with the classification data. Moreover, the results are extended to general weights configurations given proper alignment of the weight matrices' singular spaces with the data features at initialization.</description>

      <title>Learning How to Strategically Disclose Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strategic information disclosure, in its simplest form, considers a game between an information provider (sender) who has access to some private information that an information receiver is interested in. While the receiver takes an action that affects the utilities of both players, the sender can design information (or modify beliefs) of the receiver through signal commitment, hence posing a Stackelberg game. However, obtaining a Stackelberg equilibrium for this game traditionally requires the sender to have access to the receiver's objective. In this work, we consider an online version of information design where a sender interacts with a receiver of an unknown type who is adversarially chosen at each round. Restricting attention to Gaussian prior and quadratic costs for the sender and the receiver, we show that $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret is achievable with full information feedback, where $T$ is the total number of interactions between the sender and the receiver. Further, we propose a novel parametrization that allows the sender to achieve $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret for a general convex utility function. We then consider the Bayesian Persuasion problem with an additional cost term in the objective function, which penalizes signaling policies that are more informative and obtain $\mathcal{O}(\log(T))$ regret. Finally, we establish a sublinear regret bound for the partial information feedback setting and provide simulations to support our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Boundary controllability for a fourth order degenerate parabolic equation with a singular potential</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove the null controllability of a one-dimensional fourth-order degenerate parabolic equation with a singular potential. Here, we analyze cases where boundary control conditions are applied at the left endpoint. We utilize a spectral decomposition involving Bessel functions and their zeros in a convenient weighted Sobolev space for a degenerate parabolic operator with specific boundary conditions. We establish the well-posedness of the system using semigroup operator theory. Subsequently, we employ the moment method by Fattorini and Russell to obtain an upper estimate of the cost of controllability. Additionally, we derive a lower estimate of the cost of controllability using a representation theorem for analytic functions of exponential type.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2203.12199v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates a novel gradient algorithm, AGEM, using both energy and momentum, for addressing general non-convex optimization problems. The solution properties of the AGEM algorithm, including aspects such as uniformly boundedness and convergence to critical points, are examined. The dynamic behavior is studied through a comprehensive analysis of a high-resolution ODE system. This ODE system, being nonlinear, is derived by taking the limit of the discrete scheme while preserving the momentum effect through a rescaling of the momentum parameter. The paper emphasizes the global well-posedness of the ODE system and the time-asymptotic convergence of solution trajectories. Furthermore, we establish a linear convergence rate for objective functions that adhere to the Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz condition.</description>

      <title>Extension of the Partial Integral Equation Representation to GPDE Input-Output Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2205.03735v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has been shown that the existence of a Partial Integral Equation (PIE) representation of a Partial Differential Equation (PDE) simplifies many numerical aspects of analysis, simulation, and optimal control. However, the PIE representation has not previously been extended to many of the complex, higher-order PDEs such as may be encountered in speculative or data-based models. In this paper, we propose PIE representations for a large class of such PDE models, including higher-order derivatives, boundary-valued inputs, and coupling with Ordinary Differential Equations. The main technical contribution which enables this extension is a generalization of Cauchy's rule for repeated integration. The process of conversion of a complex PDE model to a PIE is simplified through a PDE modeling interface in the open-source software PIETOOLS. Several numerical tests and illustrations are used to demonstrate the results.</description>

      <title>Adaptive proximal algorithms for convex optimization under local Lipschitz continuity of the gradient</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.04431v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Backtracking linesearch is the de facto approach for minimizing continuously differentiable functions with locally Lipschitz gradient. In recent years, it has been shown that in the convex setting it is possible to avoid linesearch altogether, and to allow the stepsize to adapt based on a local smoothness estimate without any backtracks or evaluations of the function value. In this work we propose an adaptive proximal gradient method, adaPG, that uses novel estimates of the local smoothness modulus which leads to less conservative stepsize updates and that can additionally cope with nonsmooth terms. This idea is extended to the primal-dual setting where an adaptive three-term primal-dual algorithm, adaPD, is proposed which can be viewed as an extension of the PDHG method. Moreover, in this setting the "essentially" fully adaptive variant adaPD$^+$ is proposed that avoids evaluating the linear operator norm by invoking a backtracking procedure, that, remarkably, does not require extra gradient evaluations. Numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms compared to the state of the art.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.00471v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study time-inconsistent recursive stochastic control problems, i.e., for which the Bellman principle of optimality does not hold. For this class of problems classical optimal controls may fail to exist, or to be relevant in practice, and dynamic programming is not easily applicable. Therefore, the notion of optimality is defined through a game-theoretic framework by means of subgame perfect equilibrium: we interpret our preference changes which, realistically, are inconsistent over time, as players in a game for which we want to find a Nash equilibrium. The approach followed in our work relies on the stochastic (Pontryagin) maximum principle: we adapt the classical spike variation technique to obtain a characterisation of equilibrium strategies in terms of a generalised second-order Hamiltonian function defined through pairs of backward stochastic differential equations, even in the multidimensional case. The theoretical results are applied in the financial field to finite horizon investment-consumption policies with non-exponential actualisation. Here the existence of non-trivial equilibrium policies is also ascertained.</description>

Abstract: Developing large-scale distributed methods that are robust to the presence of adversarial or corrupted workers is an important part of making such methods practical for real-world problems. In this paper, we propose an iterative approach that is adversary-tolerant for convex optimization problems. By leveraging simple statistics, our method ensures convergence and is capable of adapting to adversarial distributions. Additionally, the efficiency of the proposed methods for solving convex problems is shown in simulations with the presence of adversaries. Through simulations, we demonstrate the efficiency of our approach in the presence of adversaries and its ability to identify adversarial workers with high accuracy and tolerate varying levels of adversary rates.</description>

Abstract: An adaptive observer is proposed to estimate the synaptic distribution between neurons asymptotically from the measurement of a part of the neuronal activity and a delayed neural field evolution model. The convergence of the observer is proved under a persistency of excitation condition. Then, the observer is used to derive a feedback law ensuring asymptotic stabilization of the neural fields. Finally, the feedback law is modified to ensure simultaneously practical stabilization of the neural fields and asymptotic convergence of the observer under additional restrictions on the system. Numerical simulations confirm the relevance of the approach.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Bidding Strategy of Energy Storage in an Energy Market with Carbon Emission Allocation Based on Aumann-Shapley Prices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.00207v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Energy storage (ES) can help decarbonize power systems by transferring green renewable energy across time. How to unlock the potential of ES in cutting carbon emissions by appropriate market incentives has become a crucial, albeit challenging, problem. This paper fills the research gap by proposing a novel electricity market with carbon emission allocation and then investigating the real-time bidding strategy of ES in the proposed market. First, a carbon emission allocation mechanism based on Aumann-Shapley prices is developed and integrated into the electricity market clearing process to give combined electricity and emission prices. A parametric linear programming-based algorithm is proposed to calculate the carbon emission allocation more accurately and efficiently. Second, the real-time bidding strategy of ES in the proposed market is studied. To be specific, we derive the real-time optimal ES operation strategy as a function of the combined electricity and emission price using Lyapunov optimization. Based on this, the real-time bidding cost curve and bounds of ES in the proposed market can be deduced. Numerical experiments show the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed method. Its advantages over the existing methods are also demonstrated by comparisons.</description>

      <title>Shape Optimization of hemolysis for shear thinning flows in moving domains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.10048v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the $3$D problem of shape optimization of blood flows in moving domains. Such a geometry is adopted to take into account the modeling of rotating systems and blood pumps for instance. The blood flow is described by generalized Navier-Stokes equations, in the particular case of shear-thinning flows. For a sequence of converging moving domains, we show that a sequence of associated solutions to blood equations converges to a solution of the problem written on the limit moving domain. Thus, we extended the result given in (Soko\l{}owski, Stebel, 2014, in \textit{Evol. Eq. Control Theory}) for $q \geq 11/5$, to the range $6/5&lt; q &lt; 11/5$, where $q$ is the exponent of the rheological law. This shape continuity property allows us to show the existence of minimal shapes for a class of functionals depending on the blood velocity field and its gradient. This allows to consider in particular the problem of hemolysis minimization in blood flows, namely the minimization of red blood cells damage.</description>

      <title>Distributed Gradient Tracking Methods with Guarantees for Computing a Solution to Stochastic MPECs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.09356v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a class of hierarchical multi-agent optimization problems over networks where agents seek to compute an approximate solution to a single-stage stochastic mathematical program with equilibrium constraints (MPEC). MPECs subsume several important problem classes including Stackelberg games, bilevel programs, and traffic equilibrium problems, to name a few. Our goal in this work is to provably resolve stochastic MPECs in distributed regimes where the agents only have access to their local objectives and an inexact best-response to the lower-level equilibrium problem. To this end, we devise a new method called randomized smoothed distributed zeroth-order gradient tracking (rs-DZGT). This is a novel gradient tracking scheme where agents employ a zeroth-order implicit scheme to approximate their (unavailable) local gradients. Leveraging the properties of a randomized smoothing technique, we establish the convergence of the method and derive complexity guarantees for computing a stationary point of an optimization problem with a smoothed implicit global objective. We also provide preliminary numerical experiments where we compare the performance of rs-DZGT on networks under different settings with that of its centralized counterpart.</description>

      <title>The Exponential Stabilization of a Heat and Piezoelectric Beam Interaction with Static or Hybrid Feedback Controllers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.05306v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates a strongly-coupled system of partial differential equations (PDE) governing heat transfer in a copper rod, longitudinal vibrations, and total charge accumulation at electrodes within a magnetizable piezoelectric beam. Conducted within the transmission line framework, the analysis reveals profound interactions between traveling electromagnetic and mechanical waves in magnetizable piezoelectric beams, despite disparities in their velocities. Findings suggest that in the open-loop scenario, the interaction of heat and beam dynamics lacks exponential stability solely considering thermal effects. To confront this challenge, two types of boundary-type state feedback controllers are proposed: (i) employing static feedback controllers entirely and (ii) adopting a hybrid approach wherein the electrical controller dynamically enhances system dynamics. In both cases, solutions of the PDE systems demonstrate exponential stability through meticulously formulated Lyapunov functions with diverse multipliers. The proposed proof technique establishes a robust foundation for demonstrating the exponential stability of Finite-Difference-based model reductions as the discretization parameter approaches zero.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents a universal trust-region method simultaneously incorporating quadratic regularization and the ball constraint. We introduce a novel mechanism to set the parameters in the proposed method that unifies the analysis for convex and nonconvex optimization. Our method exhibits an iteration complexity of $\tilde O(\epsilon^{-3/2})$ to find an approximate second-order stationary point for nonconvex optimization. Meanwhile, the analysis reveals that the universal method attains an $O(\epsilon^{-1/2})$ complexity bound for convex optimization and can be accelerated. These results are complementary to the existing literature as the trust-region method was historically conceived for nonconvex optimization. Finally, we develop an adaptive universal method to address practical implementations. The numerical results show the effectiveness of our method in both nonconvex and convex problems.</description>

Abstract: The average cost optimality is known to be a challenging problem for partially observable stochastic control, with few results available beyond the finite state, action, and measurement setup, for which somewhat restrictive conditions are available. In this paper, we present explicit and easily testable conditions for the existence of solutions to the average cost optimality equation where the state space is compact. In particular, we present a new contraction based analysis, which is new to the literature to our knowledge, building on recent regularity results for non-linear filters. Beyond establishing existence, we also present several implications of our analysis that are new to the literature: (i) robustness to incorrect priors (ii) near optimality of policies based on quantized approximations, (iii) near optimality of policies with finite memory, and (iv) convergence in Q-learning. In addition to our main theorem, each of these represents a novel contribution for average cost criteria.</description>

      <title>A globalization of L-BFGS for nonconvex unconstrained optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03805v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a modified limited memory BFGS (L-BFGS) method that converges globally and linearly for nonconvex objective functions. Its distinguishing feature is that it turns into L-BFGS if its iterates cluster at a point near which the objective is strongly convex with Lipschitz gradients, thereby inheriting the outstanding effectiveness of the classical method. These strong convergence guarantees are enabled by a novel form of cautious updating, where it is decided anew in each iteration which of the stored vectors are used for updating and which ones are skipped. Moreover, the convergence results also hold for memory size zero, yielding a new globalization of the Barzilai-Borwein method with strong convergence guarantees. The convergence analysis is carried out in infinite dimensional Hilbert space and also strengthens existing convergence results for L-BFGS-type methods, including for L-BFGS. In particular, we show that the Wolfe-Powell conditions already imply global convergence if the gradient of the objective is continuous. This is a finding of interest in its own right as it is largely independent of the underlying optimization method. We illustrate the results in numerical experiments. Additionally, these experiments indicate that if the parameters of the cautious updating are suitably chosen, the modified method agrees entirely with L-BFGS, suggesting that L-BFGS is inherently cautious. An implementation of the method is available on arXiv.</description>

      <title>Scenario Predict-then-Optimize for Data-Driven Online Inventory Routing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.17787v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The real-time joint optimization of inventory replenishment and vehicle routing is essential for cost-efficiently operating one-warehouse, multiple-retailer systems. This is complex, as future demand predictions should capture correlation retailer demand, and based upon such predictions, replenishment and routing decisions must be taken. Traditionally, such decisions are made by either making distributional assumptions or using machine-learning-based point forecasts. The former approach ignores nonstationary demand patterns, while the latter approach only provides a point forecast ignoring the inherent forecast error. Consequently, in practice, service levels often do not meet their targets, and truck fill rates fall short, harming the efficiency and sustainability of daily operations. We propose Scenario Predict-then-Optimize. This fully data-driven approach for online inventory routing consists of two subsequent steps at each real-time decision epoch. The scenario-predict step exploits neural networks, specifically multi-horizon quantile recurrent neural networks, to predict future demand quantiles, upon which we design a scenario sampling approach. The subsequent scenario-optimize step then solves a scenario-based stochastic programming approximation. Results show that our approach outperforms the classic Predict-then-Optimize paradigm and empirical sampling methods. We show this both on synthetic data and real-life data. Our approach is appealing to practitioners. It is fast, does not rely on distributional assumptions, and does not face the burden of single-scenario forecasts. We show it is robust for various demand and cost parameters, enhancing the efficiency and sustainability of daily replenishment and routing decisions. Finally, Scenario Predict-then-Optimize is general and can be easily extended to account for other operational constraints, making it a useful tool in practice.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04689v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a new flow-based method for global optimization of Lipschitz functions, called Stein Boltzmann Sampling (SBS). Our method samples from the Boltzmann distribution that becomes asymptotically uniform over the set of the minimizers of the function to be optimized. Candidate solutions are sampled via the \emph{Stein Variational Gradient Descent} algorithm. We prove the asymptotic convergence of our method, introduce two SBS variants, and provide a detailed comparison with several state-of-the-art global optimization algorithms on various benchmark functions. The design of our method, the theoretical results, and our experiments, suggest that SBS is particularly well-suited to be used as a continuation of efficient global optimization methods as it can produce better solutions while making a good use of the budget.</description>

We use the LQR algorithm to efficiently solve the primal component of the Newton-KKT system, and use a dual LQR backward pass to solve its dual component. We also present a new parallel algorithm for solving the dual component of the Newton-KKT system in $O(\log(N))$ parallel time, where $N$ is the number of stages. Combining it with (S\"{a}rkk\"{a} and Garc\'{i}a-Fern\'{a}ndez, 2023), we are able to solve the full Newton-KKT system in $O(\log(N))$ parallel time. The remaining parts of our method have constant parallel time complexity per iteration. Therefore, this paper provides, for the first time, a practical, highly parallelizable (for example, with a GPU) method for solving nonlinear discrete-time optimal control problems. As our algorithm is a specialization of NPSQP (Gill et al. 1992), it inherits its generic properties, including global convergence, fast local convergence, and the lack of need for second order corrections or dimension expansions, improving on existing direct multiple shooting approaches such as acados (Verschueren et al. 2022), ALTRO (Howell et al. 2019), GNMS (Giftthaler et al. 2018), FATROP (Vanroye et al. 2023), and FDDP (Mastalli et al. 2020).</description>

      <title>Tightly Bounded Polynomials via Flexible Discretizations for Dynamic Optimization Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07707v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Polynomials are widely used to represent the trajectories of states and/or inputs. It has been shown that a polynomial can be bounded by its coefficients, when expressed in the Bernstein basis. However, in general, the bounds provided by the Bernstein coefficients are not tight. We propose a method for obtaining numerical solutions to dynamic optimization problems, where a flexible discretization is used to achieve tight polynomial bounds. The proposed method is used to solve a constrained cart-pole swing-up optimal control problem. The flexible discretization eliminates the conservatism of the Bernstein bounds and enables a lower cost, in comparison with non-flexible discretizations. A theoretical result on obtaining tight polynomial bounds with a finite discretization is presented. In some applications with linear dynamics, the non-convexity introduced by the flexible discretization may be a drawback.</description>

      <title>Dimension reduction, exact recovery, and error estimates for sparse reconstruction in phase space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2112.09743v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An important theme in modern inverse problems is the reconstruction of time-dependent data from only finitely many measurements. To obtain satisfactory reconstruction results in this setting it is essential to strongly exploit temporal consistency between the different measurement times. The strongest consistency can be achieved by reconstructing data directly in phase space, the space of positions and velocities. However, this space is usually too high-dimensional for feasible computations. We introduce a novel dimension reduction technique, based on projections of phase space onto lower-dimensional subspaces, which provably circumvents this curse of dimensionality: Indeed, in the exemplary framework of superresolution we prove that known exact reconstruction results stay true after dimension reduction, and we additionally prove new error estimates of reconstructions from noisy data in optimal transport metrics which are of the same quality as one would obtain in the non-dimension-reduced case.</description>

      <title>Can Direct Latent Model Learning Solve Linear Quadratic Gaussian Control?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.14511v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the task of learning state representations from potentially high-dimensional observations, with the goal of controlling an unknown partially observable system. We pursue a direct latent model learning approach, where a dynamic model in some latent state space is learned by predicting quantities directly related to planning (e.g., costs) without reconstructing the observations. In particular, we focus on an intuitive cost-driven state representation learning method for solving Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) control, one of the most fundamental partially observable control problems. As our main results, we establish finite-sample guarantees of finding a near-optimal state representation function and a near-optimal controller using the directly learned latent model. To the best of our knowledge, despite various empirical successes, prior to this work it was unclear if such a cost-driven latent model learner enjoys finite-sample guarantees. Our work underscores the value of predicting multi-step costs, an idea that is key to our theory, and notably also an idea that is known to be empirically valuable for learning state representations.</description>

      <title>Equitable Data-Driven Facility Location and Resource Allocation to Fight the Opioid Epidemic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.06179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.06179v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The opioid epidemic is a crisis that has plagued the United States (US) for decades. One central issue is inequitable access to treatment for opioid use disorder (OUD), which puts certain populations at a higher risk of opioid overdose. We integrate a predictive dynamical model and a prescriptive optimization problem to compute high-quality opioid treatment facility and treatment budget allocations for each US state. Our predictive model is a differential equation-based epidemiological model that captures opioid epidemic dynamics. We use a process inspired by neural ODEs to fit this model to opioid epidemic data for each state and obtain estimates for unknown parameters in the model. We then incorporate this epidemiological model into a mixed-integer optimization problem (MIP) that aims to minimize opioid overdose deaths and the number of people with OUD. We develop strong relaxations based on McCormick envelopes to efficiently compute approximate solutions to our MIPs with a mean optimality gap of 3.99%. Our method provides socioeconomically equitable solutions, as it incentivizes investments in areas with higher social vulnerability (from the US Centers for Disease Control's Social Vulnerability Index) and opioid prescribing rates. On average, our approach decreases the number of people with OUD by 9.03 $\pm$ 1.772%, increases the number of people in treatment by 88.75 $\pm$ 26.223%, and decreases opioid-related deaths by 0.58 $\pm$ 0.111% after 2 years compared to baseline epidemiological model predictions. Our solutions show that policy-makers should target adding treatment facilities to counties that have fewer facilities than their population share and are more socially vulnerable. We demonstrate that our optimization approach should help inform these decisions, as it yields population health benefits in comparison to benchmarks based solely on population and social vulnerability.</description>

      <title>Contextual Bandits with Budgeted Information Reveal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.18511v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Contextual bandit algorithms are commonly used in digital health to recommend personalized treatments. However, to ensure the effectiveness of the treatments, patients are often requested to take actions that have no immediate benefit to them, which we refer to as pro-treatment actions. In practice, clinicians have a limited budget to encourage patients to take these actions and collect additional information. We introduce a novel optimization and learning algorithm to address this problem. This algorithm effectively combines the strengths of two algorithmic approaches in a seamless manner, including 1) an online primal-dual algorithm for deciding the optimal timing to reach out to patients, and 2) a contextual bandit learning algorithm to deliver personalized treatment to the patient. We prove that this algorithm admits a sub-linear regret bound. We illustrate the usefulness of this algorithm on both synthetic and real-world data.</description>

      <title>Reverse Diffusion Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.02037v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a Monte Carlo sampler from the reverse diffusion process. Unlike the practice of diffusion models, where the intermediary updates -- the score functions -- are learned with a neural network, we transform the score matching problem into a mean estimation one. By estimating the means of the regularized posterior distributions, we derive a novel Monte Carlo sampling algorithm called reverse diffusion Monte Carlo (rdMC), which is distinct from the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. We determine the sample size from the error tolerance and the properties of the posterior distribution to yield an algorithm that can approximately sample the target distribution with any desired accuracy. Additionally, we demonstrate and prove under suitable conditions that sampling with rdMC can be significantly faster than that with MCMC. For multi-modal target distributions such as those in Gaussian mixture models, rdMC greatly improves over the Langevin-style MCMC sampling methods both theoretically and in practice. The proposed rdMC method offers a new perspective and solution beyond classical MCMC algorithms for the challenging complex distributions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.16767v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two-layer spreading processes on unidirectionally dependent networks are studied, where the spreading infection of diseases or malware in one layer can trigger cascading failures in another layer and lead to secondary disasters, e.g., disrupting public services, supply chains, or power distribution. We utilize the dynamic message-passing method to devise efficient algorithms for inferring the system states, which allows one to investigate systematically the nature of such complex intertwined spreading processes and evaluate their impact. Based on the dynamic message-passing framework and optimal control, we further develop an effective optimization algorithm for mitigating network failures.</description>

      <title>Lower Bounds on the Complexity of Mixed-Integer Programs for Stable Set and Knapsack</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.16711v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Standard mixed-integer programming formulations for the stable set problem on $n$-node graphs require $n$ integer variables. We prove that this is almost optimal: We give a family of $n$-node graphs for which every polynomial-size MIP formulation requires $\Omega(n/\log^2 n)$ integer variables. By a polyhedral reduction we obtain an analogous result for $n$-item knapsack problems. In both cases, this improves the previously known bounds of $\Omega(\sqrt{n}/\log n)$ by Cevallos, Weltge &amp; Zenklusen (SODA 2018).
  To this end, we show that there exists a family of $n$-node graphs whose stable set polytopes satisfy the following: any $(1+\varepsilon/n)$-approximate extended formulation for these polytopes, for some constant $\varepsilon &gt; 0$, has size $2^{\Omega(n/\log n)}$. Our proof extends and simplifies the information-theoretic methods due to G\"o\"os, Jain &amp; Watson (FOCS 2016, SIAM J. Comput. 2018) who showed the same result for the case of exact extended formulations (i.e. $\varepsilon = 0$).</description>

      <title>Boundary Output Feedback Stabilization for a Novel Magnetizable Piezoelectric Beam Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.13986v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A magnetizable piezoelectric beam model, free at both ends, is considered. Piezoelectric materials have a strong interaction of electromagnetic and acoustic waves, whose wave propagation speeds differ substantially. The corresponding strongly-coupled PDE model describes the longitudinal vibrations and the total charge accumulation at the electrodes of the beam. It is known that the PDE model with appropriately chosen collocated state feedback controllers is known to have exponentially stable solutions. However, the collocated controller design is not always feasible since the performance of controllers may not be good enough, and moreover, a small increment of feedback controller gains can easily make the closed-loop system unstable. Therefore, a non-collocated controller and observer design is considered for the first time for this model. In particular, two state feedback controllers are designed at the right end to recover the states so that the boundary output feedback controllers can be designed as a replacement of the states with the estimate from the observers on the left end. By a carefully-constructed Lyapunov function, it is proved that the both the observer and the observer error dynamics have uniformly exponential stable solutions. This framework offers a substantial foundation for the model reductions by Finite Differences.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.01082v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transformer training is notoriously difficult, requiring a careful design of optimizers and use of various heuristics. We make progress towards understanding the subtleties of training Transformers by carefully studying a simple yet canonical linearized shallow Transformer model. Specifically, we train linear Transformers to solve regression tasks, inspired by J.~von Oswald et al.~(ICML 2023), and K.~Ahn et al.~(NeurIPS 2023). Most importantly, we observe that our proposed linearized models can reproduce several prominent aspects of Transformer training dynamics. Consequently, the results obtained in this paper suggest that a simple linearized Transformer model could actually be a valuable, realistic abstraction for understanding Transformer optimization.</description>

      <title>BICM-compatible Rate Adaptive Geometric Constellation Shaping Using Optimized Many-to-one Labeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09444v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, a rate adaptive geometric constellation shaping (GCS) scheme which is fully backward-compatible with existing state of the art bit-interleaved coded modulation (BICM) systems is proposed and experimentally demonstrated. The system relies on optimization of the positions of the quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) points on the I/Q plane for maximized achievable information rate, while maintaining quantization and fiber nonlinear noise robustness. Furthermore, `dummy' bits are multiplexed with coded bits before mapping to symbols. Rate adaptivity is achieved by tuning the ratio of coded and `dummy' bits, while maintaining a fixed forward error-correction block and a fixed modulation format size. The points' positions and their labeling are optimized using automatic differentiation. The proposed GCS scheme is compared to a time-sharing hybrid (TH) QAM modulation and the now mainstream probabilistic amplitude shaping (PAS) scheme. The TH without shaping is outperformed for all studied data rates in a simulated linear channel by up to 0.7 dB. In a linear channel, PAS is shown to outperform the proposed GCS scheme, while similar performances are reported for PAS and the proposed GCS in a simulated nonlinear fiber channel. The GCS scheme is experimentally demonstrated in a multi-span recirculating loop coherent optical fiber transmission system with a total distance of up to 3000 km. Near-continuous zero-error flexible throughput is reported as a function of the transmission distance. Up to 1-2 spans of increased reach gains are achieved at the same net data rate w.r.t. conventional QAM. At a given distance, up to 0.79 bits/2D symbol of gain w.r.t. conventional QAM is achieved. In the experiment, similar performance to PAS is demonstrated.</description>

      <title>Controllability for forward stochastic parabolic equations with dynamic boundary conditions without extra forces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15537v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we continue the study of some controllability issues for the forward stochastic parabolic equation with dynamic boundary conditions. The main novelty in the present paper consists of considering only one control without extra forces in the noise parts. Utilizing an adequate spectral inequality and the iterative Lebeau-Robiano strategy, we first establish an observability inequality for the corresponding adjoint backward stochastic system. The null controllability result is then established by the classical duality approach. As a consequence of the null controllability property, an approximate controllability result is proved.</description>

      <title>ASAP-MPC: An Asynchronous Update Scheme for Online Motion Planning with Nonlinear Model Predictive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06263v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) scheme targeted at motion planning for mechatronic motion systems, such as drones and mobile platforms. NMPC-based motion planning typically requires low computation times to be able to provide control inputs at the required rate for system stability, disturbance rejection, and overall performance. Although there exist various ways in literature to reduce the solution times in NMPC, such times may not be low enough to allow real-time implementations. This paper presents ASAP-MPC, an approach to handle varying, sometimes restrictively large, solution times with an asynchronous update scheme, always allowing for full convergence and real-time execution. The NMPC algorithm is combined with a linear state feedback controller tracking the optimised trajectories for improved robustness against possible disturbances and plant-model mismatch. ASAP-MPC seamlessly merges trajectories, resulting from subsequent NMPC solutions, providing a smooth and continuous overall trajectory for the motion system. This frameworks applicability to embedded applications is shown on two different experiment setups where a state-of-the-art method fails: a quadcopter flying through a cluttered environment in hardware-in-the-loop simulation and a scale model truck-trailer manoeuvring in a structured lab environment.</description>
