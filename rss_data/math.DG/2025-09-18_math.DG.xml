      <title>Structure of non-solvable cyclic metric Lie algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a systematic study of the structure of non-solvable cyclic metric Lie algebras. A cyclic metric is a symmetric bilinear form satisfying a cyclic cocycle condition, which arises naturally in the contexts of non-associative algebras and homogeneous pseudo-Riemannian manifolds. Firstly, we drive some sufficient conditions for a cyclic metric Lie algebra to be an orthogonal direct product of its semisimple and solvable parts. Then we introduce the notion of cyclic quadruples to analyze the interaction between semisimple and radical components. Finally, we use the double extension method to provide a complete characterization of non-degenerate cyclic metric Lie algebras that are neither semisimple nor solvable, over the fields of complex and real numbers.</description>

      <title>Laplace comparison on K\"ahler Ricci flow and convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We first prove a uniform integral Laplace comparison result for the K\"ahler Ricci flow on Fano manifolds which depends only on the initial metric. As an application, using Cheeger-Colding theory and previous results by some of the authors, we give a direct and independent proof of the Hamilton-Tian conjecture on convergence of K\"ahler-Ricci flows, modulo a codimension 4 singular set. We also expounded on some existing literature on this conjecture.</description>

      <title>On the Yau-Tian-Donaldson conjecture for weighted cscK metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a version, formulated in terms of non-Archimedean pluripotential theory, of the Yau-Tian-Donaldson conjecture for constant scalar curvature and, more generally, weighted extremal K\"ahler metrics with prescribed compact symmetry group on an arbitrary polarized projective manifold. This is accomplished by extending important previous work of Chi Li to the weighted case, and by establishing general slope formulas for the relevant weighted entropy and energy functionals. Among other things, our approach relies on key a priori estimates for cscK metrics due to Chen-Cheng (recently extended to the weighted case by Di Nezza-Jubert-Lahdili and Han-Liu), and on a crucial estimate for psh envelopes due to Berman-Demailly-Di Nezza-Trapani.</description>

      <title>Lower bounds for the eigenvalues of the Hodge Laplacian on certain non-convex domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish geometric lower bounds for the smallest positive eigenvalue of the Hodge Laplacian in the class of non-convex domains given by Euclidean annular regions with a convex outer boundary and a spherical inner boundary. These bounds are then extended to convex domains with multiple holes, where we derive lower bounds for certain higher order exact eigenvalues, and under additional geometric assumptions, also for the smallest positive eigenvalue. For $1$-forms on compact manifolds with boundary, we provide a general lower bound on the smallest exact eigenvalue - corresponding to the first positive Neumann eigenvalue - which, in certain respects, is better than the classical Cheeger inequality. Furthermore, we emphasise the necessity of the "contact radius" in the lower bounds of the main results. Our proofs employ local-to-global arguments via an explicit isomorphism between C\v{e}ch cohomology and de Rham cohomology to obtain Poincar\'e-type inequalities with explicit geometric dependence, and utilise certain generalised versions of the Cheeger-McGowan gluing lemma.</description>

      <title>A YTD correspondence for constant scalar curvature metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a compact K\"ahler manifold, we provide a uniform YTD correspondence that characterizes the existence of a unique constant scalar curvature metric using ample/K\"ahler test configurations. The main point of our approach is to replace the $K$ energy with much better behaving variants, whose properties are similar to the Ding energy from the Fano case. Connections with the non-Archimedean point of view on K-stability are also briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Tian--Yau metrics: Fredholm theory, Hodge cohomology and moduli spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the natural geometric elliptic operators on a class of complete Riemannian manifolds which include the 4-dimensional ALH* gravitational instantons and their higher dimensional Calabi-Yau analogues asymptotic to the model Calabi Ansatz metrics. Some of these were initially constructed by Tian and Yau, later by Hein and most recently by Y. Chen, and we call these Tian-Yau spaces. They have played an important role in the degeneration theory of K3 metrics, cf. Hein-Sun-Viaclosky-Zhang and Sun-Zhang, in the increasingly refined classification of gravitational instantons (cf. Collins-Jacob-Lin, Lee-Lin), and other areas. We show that these elliptic operators can be analyzed using the $\mathbf{a}$-pseudodifferential calculus of Grieser and Hunsicker, and use this to determine the space of $L^2$ harmonic forms in the four-dimensional setting, as well as the refined asymptotic regularity and local deformation theory of ALH* structures.</description>

      <title>Support-Projected Petz Monotone Geometry of Two-Qubit Families: Three-Channel Identity and Non-Reduction of Curvatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the information geometry of pure two-qubit variational families by pulling back arbitrary Petz monotone quantum metrics to circuit-defined submanifolds and making them intrinsic via support projection onto the active numerical range of the quantum Fisher information tensor. This framework strictly generalizes the symmetric logarithmic derivative (SLD/Bures) case and includes, as special examples, the Wigner-Yanase and Bogoliubov-Kubo-Mori metrics among many others. Our first main theorem proves a universal three-channel decomposition for every Petz monotone metric on any smooth two-parameter slice in terms of the population, coherence, and concurrence of the one-qubit reduction. Second, we show that neither the slice Gaussian curvature nor the ambient scalar curvature of the support-projected metric can, on any nonempty open set, be written as functions solely of concurrence or of the one-qubit entropy. Third, an entanglement-orthogonal gauge isolates the pure entanglement derivative channel and provides intrinsic curvature diagnostics. These results rigorously disprove the expectation that scalar or Gaussian curvatures of finite-dimensional monotone metrics could serve as universal entanglement monotones, extending the counterexamples previously known for the SLD/Bures metric, and complementing recent analyses in Gaussian quantum states. They also furnish a Petz-metric foundation for curvature-aware natural-gradient methods in variational quantum algorithms.</description>

      <title>Wohlhart's Three-Loop Mechanism: An Overconstrained and Shaky Linkage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper revisits a three-loop spatial linkage that was proposed in an ARK 2004 paper by Karl Wohlhart (as extension of a two-loop linkage proposed by Eddie Baker in 1980) and later analyzed in an ARK 2006 paper by Diez-Martinez et. al. A local analysis shows that this linkage has a finite degree of freedom (DOF) 3 (and is thus overconstrained) while in its reference configuration the differential DOF is 5. It is shown that its configuration space is locally a smooth manifold so that the reference configuration is not a c-space singularity. It is shown that the differential DOF is locally constant, which makes this linkage shaky (so that the reference configuration is not a singularity). The higher-order local analysis is facilitated by the computation of the kinematic tangent cone as well as a local approximation of the c-space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.15553v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that there are relative $\mathrm{SO}_0(2,q)$-character varieties of the punctured sphere which are compact, totally non-hyperbolic and contain a dense representation. This work fills a remaining case of the results of N. Tholozan and J. Toulisse. Our approach relies on the non-abelian Hodge correspondence and we study the moduli space of parabolic $\mathrm{SO}_0(2,q)$-Higgs bundles with some fixed weight. Additionally, we provide a construction based on Geometric Invariant Theory (GIT) to demonstrate that the considered moduli spaces can be viewed as a projective variety over $\mathbb{C}$.</description>

Abstract: Cartan gives the model of $(8, 15)$-distribution with the exceptional simple Lie algebra $F_4$ as its symmetry algebra in his paper (1893), which is published one year before his thesis. In the present paper, we study abnormal extremals (singular curves) of Cartan's model from viewpoints of sub-Riemannian geometry and geometric control theory.Then we construct the prolongation of Cartan's model based on the data related to its singular curves, and obtain the nilpotent graded Lie algebra which is isomorphic to the negative part of the graded Lie algebra $F_4$.</description>

      <title>Lorentzian Cheeger-Gromov convergence and temporal functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15441v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Uniqueness (up to isometries) and existence of limits are analyzed in the context of Cheeger-Gromov convergence of spacetimes. To face the non-compactness of the vector isometry group in the semi-Riemanian setting, standard \em{pointed} convergence is strenghtened to \em{anchored} convergence (which requires the convergence of a timelike direction in the Lorenzian case). Then, a local isometry between the neighborhoods of the basepoints is found, and extended globally under geodesic completeness and simple connectedness. In spacetimes, by using Cauchy temporal functions as both strengthenings of the anchor and tools to ``Wick rotate'' metrics, a new notion of convergence for globally hyperbolic spacetimes (including the case of timelike boundaries) is introduced. The machinery of Riemannian Cheeger-Gromov theory becomes applicable after revisiting the tools related to time functions and studying their connections with Sormani-Vega null distance. In particular, several results with interest on its own right are obtained such as: time functions are locally Lipschitz up to rescaling, global and local characterizations of $h$-steep functions, independence of steepness and $h$-steepness for temporal functions, compatibility of both conditions for Cauchy temporal functions, and the stability of the latter.</description>

      <title>The Character Map in Twisted Equivariant Nonabelian Cohomology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.06533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2011.06533v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The fundamental notion of non-abelian generalized cohomology gained recognition in algebraic topology as the non-abelian Poincar\'e-dual to "factorization homology", and in theoretical physics as providing flux-quantization for non-linear Gauss laws. However, already the archetypical example -- unstable Cohomotopy, first studied almost a century ago by Pontrjagin -- has remained underappreciated as a cohomology theory and has only recently received attention as a flux-quantizaton law ("Hypothesis H").
  Here we lay out a general construction of the analogue of the Chern character map on twisted equivariant non-abelian cohomology theories (with equivariantly simply-connected classifying spaces) and illustrate the construction by spelling out a twisted equivariant form of Cohomotopy as an archetypical and intriguing running example, essentially by computing its equivariant Sullivan model.
  We close with an outlook on the application of this result to the rigorous deduction of anyonic quantum states on M5-branes wrapped over Seifert 3-orbifolds.</description>

Abstract: We show that every open Riemann surface can be obtained by glueing together a countable collection of equilateral triangles, in such a way that every vertex belongs to finitely many triangles. Equivalently, it is a _Belyi surface_: There exists a holomorphic branched covering to the Riemann sphere that is branched only over three values. It follows that every Riemann surface is a branched cover of the sphere, branched only over finitely many points.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14251v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A novel procedure is presented which allows the construction of all axial vector fields on Riemannian two-spheres. Using these axial vector fields and the centre-of-mass unit sphere reference systems, a constructive definition of quasi-local spin-angular momentum is introduced. Balance relations are also derived, with respect to arbitrary Lie-propagated unit sphere reference systems, to characterize the angular momentum transports in spacetimes without symmetries.</description>

Abstract: The present paper is a continuation of the study of the interplay between the contact Hamiltonian dynamics and the moduli theory of (perturbed) contact instantons and its applications initiated in [Oh21b, Oh22a]. In this paper we prove Weinstein's conjecture and Arnold's chord conjecture in their full generalities. The two key ingredients lying in the background of our proof of Arnold's chord conjecture are the existence of the fundamental class of the Legendrian contact instanton cohomology modulo bubbling-off, and the evaluation transversality of the moduli space of contact instantons against the level set of conformal exponent function. Our proof of Weinstein's conjecture also utilizes the existence scheme of translated points of a contactomorphism developed in [Oh22a], especially associated to a contact Hamiltonian loop, via the geometric construction of the Legendrianization of contactomorphisms of $(Q,\lambda)$ in the contact product $M_Q = Q \times Q \times \mathbb R$ and its usage of the $\mathbb Z_2$ anti-contact involutive symmetry.</description>

      <title>Alexandrov estimates for polynomial operators by determinant majorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10879v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We obtain estimates on the supremum, infimum and oscillation of solutions for a wide class of inhomogeneous fully nonlinear elliptic equations on Euclidean domains where the differential operator is an I-central Garding-Dirichlet operator in the sense of Harvey-Lawson (2024). The argument combines two recent results: an Alexandrov estimate of Payne-Redaelli (2025) for locally semiconvex functions based on the area formula and a determinant majorization estimate of Harvey-Lawson (2024).
  The determinant majorization estimate has as a special case the arithmetic - geometric mean inequality, so the result includes the classical Alexandrov-Bakelman-Pucci estimate for linear operators. A potential theoretic approach is used involving subequation subharmonics and their dual subharmonics. Semiconvex approximation plays a crucial role.</description>

      <title>H\"older Regularity of Dirichlet Problem For The Complex Monge-Amp\`ere Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11329v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the Dirichlet problem for the complex Monge-Amp\`ere equation on a strictly pseudo-convex domain in Cn or a Hermitian manifold. Under the condition that the right-hand side lies in Lp function and the boundary data are H\"older continuous, we prove the global H\"older continuity of the solution.</description>
