      <title>Algorithmic and High-Frequency Trading Problems for Semi-Markov and Hawkes Jump-Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Algorithmic and High-Frequency trading (HFT) has become one of the main ways to complete transactions in many of today's major financial markets, with these transactions taking place inside what is called the limit order book (LOB). Developing sophisticated trading algorithms that accurately mimic LOB data is therefore a major topic in this area. In recent times, it has been proven that LOB data often follows non-Markovian dynamics, thus, we believe these models more accurately describe how the LOB would evolve. In this paper, we consider acquisition and liquidation problems for semi-Markov and Hawkes jump-diffusion models. We begin by developing jump-diffusion models to capture these dynamics and then proceed to use diffusion approximations for the jump parts. The optimal solutions to these trading problems are formulated under the stochastic optimal control framework and via numerical methods. Strategy simulations for the acquisition and liquidation problems are considered as well, where we show sample price paths for our price processes, average traded prices, inventory and trading speed paths. This analysis gives a general picture of how one could analyse how these strategies could perform under our more general price processes.</description>

      <title>Financial Stochastic Models Diffusion: From Risk-Neutral to Real-World Measure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research presents a comprehensive framework for transitioning financial diffusion models from the risk-neutral (RN) measure to the real-world (RW) measure, leveraging results from probability theory, specifically Girsanov's theorem. The RN measure, fundamental in derivative pricing, is contrasted with the RW measure, which incorporates risk premiums and better reflects actual market behavior and investor preferences, making it crucial for risk management. We address the challenges of incorporating real-world dynamics into financial models, such as accounting for market premiums, producing realistic term structures of market indicators, and fitting any arbitrarily given market curve. Our framework is designed to be general, applicable to a variety of diffusion models, including those with non-additive noise such as the CIR++ model. Through case studies involving Goldman Sachs' 2024 global credit outlook forecasts and the European Banking Authority (EBA) 2023 stress tests, we validate the robustness, practical relevance and applicability of our methodology. This work contributes to the literature by providing a versatile tool for better risk measures and enhancing the realism of financial models under the RW measure. Our model's versatility extends to stress testing and scenario analysis, providing practitioners with a powerful tool to evaluate various what-if scenarios and make well-informed decisions, particularly in pricing and risk management strategies.</description>

      <title>Fast and General Simulation of L\'evy-driven OU processes for Energy Derivatives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15483v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: L\'evy-driven Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) processes represent an intriguing class of stochastic processes that have garnered interest in the energy sector for their ability to capture typical features of market dynamics. However, in the current state of play, Monte Carlo simulations of these processes are not straightforward for two main reasons: i) algorithms are available only for some specific processes within this class; ii) they are often computationally expensive. In this paper, we introduce a new simulation technique designed to address both challenges. It relies on the numerical inversion of the characteristic function, offering a general methodology applicable to all L\'evy-driven OU processes. Moreover, leveraging FFT, the proposed methodology ensures fast and accurate simulations, providing a solid basis for the widespread adoption of these processes in the energy sector. Lastly, the algorithm allows an optimal control of the numerical error. We apply the technique to the pricing of energy derivatives, comparing the results with the existing benchmarks. Our findings indicate that the proposed methodology is at least one order of magnitude faster than the existing algorithms, while maintaining an equivalent level of accuracy.</description>
