      <title>Nonlinear management of the miscibility-immiscibility transition in binary Bose-Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate application of the nonlinearity management (NM, i.e., periodic variation of the strength of the inter-component repulsion) to the miscibility-immiscibility (MIM) transition across the critical point of a two-component BEC, both with and without the linear mixing (Rabi coupling, RC) between the components. To this end, we first identify, by means of a variational approximation and numerical solution, diverse stationary domain-wall (DW) structures supported by the system in the absence of the management. The approximate analytical solutions for the DWs are found to be in excellent agreement with their numerical counterparts. An analytical estimate is also produced for the upshift of the MIM transition caused by the pressure of the trapping potential in the case of a confined system. An exact DW solution is produced for the system including the P\"{o}schl-Teller potential, which is stable (unstable) if the potential is repulsive (attractive). Further, we find the spectrum of linear excitations in the spatially uniform mixed state, and thus establish parameter regions where the system is stable/unstable against demixing. In particular, RC upshifts the critical strength of the inter-component repulsion for the onset of the MIM transition. Eigenfrequencies of excitations on top of DW states are identified from numerical simulations through monitoring the evolution of perturbed states. Weak NM applied at the DW eigenfrequency reveals features of the nonlinear resonance. Stronger NM, under which the system periodically crosses the MIM-transition point, restricts the miscibility.</description>

      <title>Splitting of the three-body F\"orster resonance in Rb Rydberg atoms as a measure of dipole-dipole interaction strength</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Three-body F\"orster resonances controlled by a dc electric field are of interest for the implementation of three-qubit quantum gates with single atoms in optical traps using their laser excitation into strongly interacting Rydberg states. In our recent theoretical paper [Zh. Eksper. Teor. Fiz. 168(1), 14 (2025)] it was found that the proposed earlier three-body F\"orster resonance $3\times nP_{3/2} \to nS_{1/2} +(n+1)S_{1/2} +nP_{1/2} $ in Rb Rydberg atoms has a splitting, with one of the split components having weaker dependence of the resonant electric field (and the corresponding dynamic shift) on the distance $R$ between the atoms. Here we study this effect in more detail, since such a resonance is the most suitable for performing experiments on observing coherent oscillations of populations of collective three-body states and implementing three-qubit quantum gates based on them. For a linear spatial configuration of three interacting Rydberg atoms, the physical mechanism of this phenomenon is revealed and analytical formulas are obtained that describe the behavior of split structure of the F\"orster resonance depending on $R$. It is found that the splitting is a measure of the energy of the resonant dipole-dipole exchange interaction with an excitation hopping between neighboring Rydberg states $S$ and $P$.</description>

      <title>Quantum droplets in curved space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the formation of quantum droplets in curved spacetime, highlighting the significant influence of curvature on the formation and properties of these objects. While our computations encompass various dimensions, we primarily focus on 2-dimensions. Our findings reveal a novel class of curvature-driven quantum effects leading to the formation of quasi-stable liquid droplets, suggesting a feasible pathway for experimental observation, particularly in microgravity environments.</description>

      <title>Hybridization of the amplitude mode in a confined fermionic superfluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12645v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In phase transitions, spontaneous symmetry breaking results in a non-zero order parameter and two collective excitations: the Goldstone and the amplitude mode. These modes, which define key properties of superconductors and fermionic superfluids, are well-understood in homogeneous systems. However, their behavior under strong confinement remains largely unexplored, particularly when their excitation energy becomes comparable to the imposed discrete level spacing. In this scenario, hybridization between different collective modes is expected to take place. Here, we show how the amplitude mode hybridizes with a spatial mode in a confined fermionic superfluid. Using lattice modulation spectroscopy, we observe the evolution of the mode throughout the entire crossover from the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) state to Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) of molecules. In the BCS regime, the excitation energy is located at twice the pairing gap, then gradually becomes an in-gap excitation in the strongly correlated regime. Further to the BEC limit, the excitation energy approaches twice the level spacing. The spectral weight of this mode vanishes when approaching the superfluid critical temperature. Our experimental results are in excellent agreement with an effective field theory, providing strong evidence that amplitude oscillations hybridize with and eventually transform into breathing oscillations of the order parameter. The strong modification of the excitation spectrum reveals how confinement and finite-size effects impact fundamental modes of symmetry-broken states.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-enforced minimal entanglement and correlation in quantum spin chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20765v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The interplay between symmetry, entanglement and correlation is an interesting and important topic in quantum many-body physics. Within the framework of matrix product states, in this paper we study the minimal entanglement and correlation enforced by the $SO(3)$ spin rotation symmetry and lattice translation symmetry in a quantum spin-$J$ chain, with $J$ a positive integer. When neither symmetry is spontaneously broken, for a sufficiently long segment in a sufficiently large closed chain, we find that the minimal R\'enyi-$\alpha$ entropy compatible with these symmetries is $\min\{ -\frac{2}{\alpha-1}\ln(\frac{1}{2^\alpha}({1+\frac{1}{(2J+1)^{\alpha-1}}})), 2\ln(J+1) \}$, for any $\alpha\in\mathbb{R}^+$. In an infinitely long open chain with such symmetries, for any $\alpha\in\mathbb{R}^+$ the minimal R\'enyi-$\alpha$ entropy of half of the system is $\min\{ -\frac{1}{\alpha-1}\ln(\frac{1}{2^\alpha}({1+\frac{1}{(2J+1)^{\alpha-1}}})), \ln(J+1) \}$. When $\alpha\rightarrow 1$, these lower bounds give the symmetry-enforced minimal von Neumann entropies in these setups. Moreover, we show that no state in a quantum spin-$J$ chain with these symmetries can have a vanishing correlation length. Interestingly, the states with the minimal entanglement may not be a state with the minimal correlation length.</description>

      <title>FRG analysis for a relativistic BEC in arbitrary spatial dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17668v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A relativistic Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) is studied within the complex scalar field theory using the functional renormalization group (FRG) under the local potential approximation. We investigate fluctuation effects on the relativistic BEC through numerical analyses for various spatial dimensions and chemical potentials. Our numerical results are consistent with the Mermin-Wagner theorem, and this consistency is also analytically confirmed from the flow equation. We also discuss a numerical instability of the FRG in lower spatial dimensions, which is evadable for certain parameter choices.</description>
