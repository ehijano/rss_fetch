      <title>Algorithmic Monetary Policies for Blockchain Participation Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A central challenge in blockchain tokenomics is aligning short-term performance incentives with long-term decentralization goals. We propose a framework for algorithmic monetary policies that navigates this tradeoff in repeated participation games. Agents, characterized by type (capability) and stake, choose to participate or abstain at each round; the policy (probabilistically) selects high-type agents for task execution (maximizing throughput) while distributing rewards to sustain decentralization. We analyze equilibria under two agent behaviors: myopic (short-term utility maximization) and foresighted (multi-round planning). For myopic agents, performance-centric policies risk centralization, but foresight enables stable decentralization with some volatility to the token value. We further discuss virtual stake--a hybrid of type and stake--as an alternative approach. We show that the initial virtual stake distribution critically impacts long-term outcomes, suggesting that policies must indirectly manage decentralization.</description>

      <title>Online Resource Allocation via Static Bundle Pricing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online Resource Allocation addresses the problem of efficiently allocating limited resources to buyers with incomplete knowledge of future requests. In our setting, buyers arrive sequentially demanding a set of items, each with a value drawn from a known distribution. We study environments where buyers' valuations exhibit complementarities. In such settings, standard item-pricing mechanisms fail to leverage item multiplicities, while existing static bundle-pricing mechanisms rely on problem-specific arguments that do not generalize.
  We develop a unified technique for online resource allocation with complementarities for three domains: (i) single-minded combinatorial auctions with maximum bundle size $d$, (ii) general single-minded combinatorial auctions, and (iii) a graph-based routing model in which buyers request to route a unit of flow from a source node $s$ to a target node $t$ in a capacitated graph. Our approach yields static and anonymous bundle-pricing mechanisms whose performance improves exponentially with item capacities. For the $d$-single-minded setting with minimum item capacity $B$, we obtain an $O(d^{1/B})$-competitive mechanism, recovering the known $O(d)$ bound for unit capacities ($B=1$) and achieving exponentially better guarantees as capacities grow. For general single-minded combinatorial auctions and the graph-routing model, we obtain $O(m^{1/(B+1)})$-competitive mechanisms, where $m$ is the number of items.
  We complement these results with information-theoretic lower bounds. We show that no online algorithm can achieve a competitive ratio better than $\Omega((m/\ln m)^{1/(B+2)})$ in the general single-minded setting and $\Omega((d/\ln d)^{1/(B+1)})$ in the $d$-single-minded setting. In doing so, we reveal a deep connection to the extremal combinatorics problem of determining the maximum number of qualitatively independent partitions of a ground set.</description>

      <title>On the Edge of Core (Non-)Emptiness: An Automated Reasoning Approach to Approval-Based Multi-Winner Voting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Core stability is a natural and well-studied notion for group fairness in multi-winner voting, where the task is to select a committee from a pool of candidates. We study the setting where voters either approve or disapprove of each candidate; here, it remains a major open problem whether a core-stable committee always exists. In this work, we develop an approach based on mixed-integer linear programming for deciding whether and when core-stable committees are guaranteed to exist. In contrast to SAT-based approaches popular in computational social choice, our method can produce proofs for a specific number of candidates independent of the number of voters. In addition to these computational gains, our program lends itself to a novel duality-based reformulation of the core stability problem, from which we obtain new existence results in special cases. Further, we use our framework to reveal previously unknown relationships between core stability and other desirable properties, such as notions of priceability.</description>

      <title>Strategic Bid Shading in Real-Time Bidding Auctions in Ad Exchange Using Minority Game Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional auction theory posits that bid value exhibits a positive correlation with the probability of securing the auctioned object in ascending auctions. However, under uncertainty and incomplete information, as is characteristic in real-time advertising markets, truthful bidding may not always represent a dominant strategy or yield a Pure Strategy Nash Equilibrium. Real-Time Bidding (RTB) platforms operationalize impression-level auctions via programmatic interfaces, where advertisers compete in first-price auction settings and often resort to bid shading, i.e., strategically submitting bids below their private valuations to optimize payoff. 
This paper empirically investigates bid shading behaviors and strategic adaptation using large-scale RTB auction data from the Yahoo Webscope dataset. Integrating Minority Game Theory with clustering algorithms and variance-scaling diagnostics, we analyze equilibrium bidding behavior across temporally segmented impression markets. Our results reveal the emergence of minority-based bidding strategies, wherein agents partition hourly ad slots into submarkets and place bids strategically where they anticipate being in the numerical minority. This strategic heterogeneity facilitates reduced expenditure while enhancing win probability, functioning as an endogenous bid shading mechanism. The analysis highlights the computational and economic implications of minority strategies in shaping bidder dynamics and pricing outcomes in decentralized, high-frequency auction environments.</description>

      <title>Data Valuation for LLM Fine-Tuning: Efficient Shapley Value Approximation via Language Model Arithmetic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data is a critical asset for training large language models (LLMs), alongside compute resources and skilled workers. While some training data is publicly available, substantial investment is required to generate proprietary datasets, such as human preference annotations or to curate new ones from existing sources. As larger datasets generally yield better model performance, two natural questions arise. First, how can data owners make informed decisions about curation strategies and data sources investment? Second, how can multiple data owners collaboratively pool their resources to train superior models while fairly distributing the benefits? This problem, data valuation, which is not specific to large language models, has been addressed by the machine learning community through the lens of cooperative game theory, with the Shapley value being the prevalent solution concept. However, computing Shapley values is notoriously expensive for data valuation, typically requiring numerous model retrainings, which can become prohibitive for large machine learning models. In this work, we demonstrate that this computational challenge is dramatically simplified for LLMs trained with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). We show how the specific mathematical structure of DPO enables scalable Shapley value computation. We believe this observation unlocks many applications at the intersection of data valuation and large language models.</description>

      <title>Ev-Trust: A Strategy Equilibrium Trust Mechanism for Evolutionary Games in LLM-Based Multi-Agent Services</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid evolution of the Web toward an agent-centric paradigm, driven by large language models (LLMs), has enabled autonomous agents to reason, plan, and interact in complex decentralized environments. However, the openness and heterogeneity of LLM-based multi-agent systems also amplify the risks of deception, fraud, and misinformation, posing severe challenges to trust establishment and system robustness. To address this issue, we propose Ev-Trust, a strategy-equilibrium trust mechanism grounded in evolutionary game theory. This mechanism integrates direct trust, indirect trust, and expected revenue into a dynamic feedback structure that guides agents' behavioral evolution toward equilibria. Within a decentralized "Request-Response-Payment-Evaluation" service framework, Ev-Trust enables agents to adaptively adjust strategies, naturally excluding malicious participants while reinforcing high-quality collaboration. Furthermore, our theoretical derivation based on replicator dynamics equations proves the existence and stability of local evolutionary equilibria. Experimental results indicate that our approach effectively reflects agent trustworthiness in LLM-driven open service interaction scenarios, reduces malicious strategies, and increases collective revenue. We hope Ev-Trust can provide a new perspective on trust modeling for the agentic service web in group evolutionary game scenarios.</description>

      <title>Stackelberg Learning from Human Feedback: Preference Optimization as a Sequential Game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Stackelberg Learning from Human Feedback (SLHF), a new framework for preference optimization. SLHF frames the alignment problem as a sequential-move game between two policies: a Leader, which commits to an action, and a Follower, which responds conditionally on the Leader's action. This approach decomposes preference optimization into a refinement problem for the Follower and an optimization problem against an adversary for the Leader. Unlike Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), which assigns scalar rewards to actions, or Nash Learning from Human Feedback (NLHF), which seeks a simultaneous-move equilibrium, SLHF leverages the asymmetry of sequential play to capture richer preference structures. The sequential design of SLHF naturally enables inference-time refinement, as the Follower learns to improve the Leader's actions, and these refinements can be leveraged through iterative sampling. We compare the solution concepts of SLHF, RLHF, and NLHF, and lay out key advantages in consistency, data sensitivity, and robustness to intransitive preferences. Experiments on large language models demonstrate that SLHF achieves strong alignment across diverse preference datasets, scales from 0.5B to 8B parameters, and yields inference-time refinements that transfer across model families without further fine-tuning.</description>

      <title>Lower bounds for ranking-based pivot rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The existence of a polynomial pivot rule for the simplex method for linear programming, policy iteration for Markov decision processes, and strategy improvement for parity games each are prominent open problems in their respective fields. While numerous natural candidates for efficient rules have been eliminated, all existing lower bound constructions are tailored to individual or small sets of pivot rules. We introduce a unified framework for formalizing classes of rules according to the information about the input that they rely on. Within this framework, we show lower bounds for \emph{ranking-based} classes of rules that base their decisions on orderings of the improving pivot steps induced by the underlying data. Our first result is a superpolynomial lower bound for strategy improvement, obtained via a family of sink parity games, which applies to memory-based generalizations of Bland's rule that only access the input by comparing the ranks of improving edges in some global order. Our second result is a subexponential lower bound for policy iteration, obtained via a family of Markov decision processes, which applies to memoryless rules that only access the input by comparing improving actions according to their ranks in a global order, their reduced costs, and the associated improvements in objective value. Both results carry over to the simplex method for linear programming.</description>

      <title>The Illusion of Rationality: Tacit Bias and Strategic Dominance in Frontier LLM Negotiation Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09254v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being deployed as autonomous agents on behalf of institutions and individuals in economic, political, and social settings that involve negotiation. Yet this trend carries significant risks if their strategic behavior is not well understood. In this work, we revisit the NegotiationArena framework and run controlled simulation experiments on a diverse set of frontier LLMs across three multi turn bargaining games: Buyer Seller, Multi turn Ultimatum, and Resource Exchange. We ask whether improved general reasoning capabilities lead to rational, unbiased, and convergent negotiation strategies. Our results challenge this assumption. We find that models diverge into distinct, model specific strategic equilibria rather than converging to a unified optimal behavior. Moreover, strong numerical and semantic anchoring effects persist: initial offers are highly predictive of final agreements, and models consistently generate biased proposals by collapsing diverse internal valuations into rigid, generic price points. More concerningly, we observe dominance patterns in which some models systematically achieve higher payoffs than their counterparts. These findings underscore an urgent need to develop mechanisms to mitigate these issues before deploying such systems in real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>A First Order Meta Stackelberg Method for Robust Federated Learning (Technical Report)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.13273v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent research efforts indicate that federated learning (FL) systems are vulnerable to a variety of security breaches. While numerous defense strategies have been suggested, they are mainly designed to counter specific attack patterns and lack adaptability, rendering them less effective when facing uncertain or adaptive threats. This work models adversarial FL as a Bayesian Stackelberg Markov game (BSMG) between the defender and the attacker to address the lack of adaptability to uncertain adaptive attacks. We further devise an effective meta-learning technique to solve for the Stackelberg equilibrium, leading to a resilient and adaptable defense. The experiment results suggest that our meta-Stackelberg learning approach excels in combating intense model poisoning and backdoor attacks of indeterminate types.</description>

      <title>Managing Persuasion Robustly: The Optimality of Quota Rules</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.10024v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a sender-receiver model in which the receiver can commit to a decision rule before the sender determines the information policy. The decision rule can depend on the information structure chosen by the sender and the realized signals. This framework captures applications where a decision-maker (the receiver) seeks advice from an interested party (the sender). In these applications, the receiver frequently faces uncertainty regarding the sender's preferences and the set of feasible information structures. Consequently, we adopt a unified robust analysis framework that includes the max-min utility, the min-max regret, and the min-max competitive ratio as special cases. We show that the optimal decision rule is always a quota rule.</description>

      <title>Bandits with Preference Feedback: A Stackelberg Game Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16745v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bandits with preference feedback present a powerful tool for optimizing unknown target functions when only pairwise comparisons are allowed instead of direct value queries. This model allows for incorporating human feedback into online inference and optimization and has been employed in systems for fine-tuning large language models. The problem is well understood in simplified settings with linear target functions or over finite small domains that limit practical interest. Taking the next step, we consider infinite domains and nonlinear (kernelized) rewards. In this setting, selecting a pair of actions is quite challenging and requires balancing exploration and exploitation at two levels: within the pair, and along the iterations of the algorithm. We propose MAXMINLCB, which emulates this trade-off as a zero-sum Stackelberg game, and chooses action pairs that are informative and yield favorable rewards. MAXMINLCB consistently outperforms existing algorithms and satisfies an anytime-valid rate-optimal regret guarantee. This is due to our novel preference-based confidence sequences for kernelized logistic estimators.</description>
