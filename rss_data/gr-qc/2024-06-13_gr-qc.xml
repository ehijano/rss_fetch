      <title>Foundational Issues in Group Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper I offer an introduction to group field theory (GFT) and to some of the issues affecting the foundations of this approach to quantum gravity. I first introduce covariant GFT as the theory that one obtains by interpreting the amplitudes of certain spin foam models as Feynman amplitudes in a perturbative expansion. However, I argue that it is unclear that this definition of GFTs amounts to something beyond a computational rule for finding these transition amplitudes and that GFT doesn't seem able to offer any new insight into the foundations of quantum gravity. Then, I move to another formulation of GFT which I call canonical GFT and which uses the standard structures of quantum mechanics. This formulation is of extended use in cosmological applications of GFT, but I argue that it is only heuristically connected with the covariant version and spin foam models. Moreover, I argue that this approach is affected by a version of the problem of time which raises worries about its viability. Therefore, I conclude that there are serious concerns about the justification and interpretation of GFT in either version of it.</description>

      <title>Curvature of \k{appa}-Poincare and Doubly Special Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the \k{appa}-Poincare and the Magueijo-Smolin (MS) DSR in the context of the relative locality theory. This theory assigns connection, torsion and curvature to momentum space of every modified theory beyond special relativity. We obtain these quantities for the \k{appa}-Poincare and the MS DSR in all order of the Planck length, at the every point of the momentum space. The connection for the \k{appa}-Poincare theory and the MS DSR can be non-zero. The torsion for the \k{appa}-Poincare theory can also be non-zero, but it is zero for the MS DSR. The curvature for the \k{appa}-Poincare theory and the MS DSR are zero. We will find that the non-zero torsion and curvature of the momentum space implies a non-commutative spactime which is tangent to this momentum space. Also, we show that the torsion for every Abelian DSR theory is zero at the origin of the momentum space. At the end, we will discus dual spacetime transformations for the \k{appa}-Poincare theory and MS-DSR.</description>

      <title>Positive-energy Dirac particles in cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide general relativistic treatment of the single-component field described by Dirac's positive-energy wave equation of 1971. It is motivated by Bogomolny's proposal to regard that field as a possible candidate for dark matter. Our emphasis is on standard (flat) Friedmann-Robertson-Walker cosmology. The early universe is not considered, though there is a strong indication that the field may play a role in internally driven generation of cosmic anisotropy.</description>

      <title>Frozen boson stars in an infinite tower of higher-derivative gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a solution for a five-dimensional boson star under gravity with infinite tower of higher curvature corrections. We discover that when the coupling constant exceeds a certain threshold, an alternative configuration emerges, distinct from the conventional five-dimensional boson star. This new structure is characterized by a broader frequency range, with its minimum value approaching zero. At a truncation of $n=2$ for the correction order, the solution and its scalar curvature diverge as the frequency approaches zero. However, as the order of higher curvature corrections increases, the singularity at the center vanishes, resulting in a globally regular solution. Additionally, as the frequency approaches zero, the scalar field's radial distribution becomes concentrated within the critical radius $r_c$, forming what we term a ``frozen star". Beyond this radius, the metric of the frozen star almost degenerates into that of an extreme black hole. The solutions for such frozen stars offer a new avenue for exploring the enigmatic interiors of compact celestial bodies, enhancing our understanding of the internal structure of black holes under semi-classical conditions and potentially addressing the series of paradoxes associated with information loss due to singularities and horizons.</description>

      <title>Exponential gravity with logarithmic corrections in the presence of axion dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An exponential modified gravity with additional logarithmic corrections is considered with the presence of an axion-like scalar field in the role of dark matter. Axion fields are thought to become important at late-times when the axion-like scalar field oscillates around its vacuum expectation value, mimicking dark matter behaviour. The model is compared with the usual pressureless fluid description of dark matter. Both models are tested with observational data including some of the latest sources, providing similar fits in comparison with the $\Lambda$CDM model. Despite results are not statistically relevant to rule out any model, the number of free parameters still favours $\Lambda$CDM model, as shown by computing the goodness of the fits.</description>

      <title>Tunneling of Hawking Radiation in Starobinsky-Bel-Robinson gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine Hawking radiation for a Schwarszchild-type black hole in Starobinsky Bel Robinson (SBR) gravity and calculate the corrected Hawking Temperature using the tunnelling method. We then discuss the deviation of our Hawking temperature from the standard Schwarszchild result. We relate the corrections to the Hawking temperature beyond the semi-classical approximation. We highlight that starting with a modification of the classical black hole geometry and calculating the semi-classical Hawking temperature, yields temperature corrections comparable to those obtained when the classical background is kept unchanged and beyond semi-classical terms in the temperature are included.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic of the $f(Q)$ universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate thermodynamics of apparent horizon in the $f(Q)$ universe with trivial and nontrivial connections. We first explore the perspectives of the first law, generalized second law and $P-V$ phase transition with trivial connection. We show that the lowest-order correction of entropy has the same form as that in loop quantum gravity, and the critical exponents of the phase transition caused by the lowest-order correction are consistent with those in mean field theory. We then examine the thermodynamic implication of nontrivial connections. We find that nontrivial connections in the $f(Q)$ universe imply non-equilibrium states from the perspective of thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Numerical relativity simulations of compact binaries: comparison of cell- and vertex-centered adaptive meshes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given the compact binary evolution problem of numerical relativity, in the finite-difference, block-based, adaptive mesh refinement context, choices must be made on how evolved fields are to be discretized. In GR-Athena++, the space-time solver was previously fixed to be vertex-centered. Here, our recent extensions to a cell-centered treatment, are described. Simplifications in the handling of variables during the treatment of general relativistic magneto-hydrodynamical (GRMHD) evolution are found. A novelty is that performance comparison for the two choices of grid sampling is made within a single code-base. In the case of a binary black hole inspiral-merger problem, by evolving geometric fields on vertex-centers, an average $\sim 20\%$ speed increase is observed, when compared against cell-centered sampling. The opposite occurs in the GRMHD setting. A binary neutron star inspiral-merger-collapse problem, representative of typical production simulations is considered. We find that cell-centered sampling for the space-time solver improves performance, by a similar factor.</description>

      <title>Spherical collapse and black hole evaporation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider spherically symmetric gravity coupled to a spherically symmetric scalar field with a specific coupling which depends on the Areal Radius. Classical collapse is described by the Vaidya solution. The semiclassical Einstein equations are well defined. Their solution describes an evaporating black hole. A balance law at future null infinity relates the rate of change of a back reaction-corrected Bondi mass to a manifestly positive flux. Its detailed form suggests a quantum extension of future null infinity along which all information including that in the collapsing matter is expected to emerge.</description>

      <title>Measuring gravitational wave memory with LISA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational wave (GW) astronomy has revolutionized our capacity to explore nature. The next generation of observatories, among which the space-borne detector Laser Interferometer Space Antenna LISA, is expected to yield orders of magnitude of signal-to-noise ratio improvement, and reach fainter and novel features of General Relativity. Among them, an exciting possibility is the detection of GW memory. Interpreted as a permanent deformation of the background spacetime after a GW perturbation has passed through the detector, GW memory offers a novel avenue to proof-test General Relativity, access the non-linear nature of gravity, and provide complementary information for a better characterization of the GW source. Previous studies have shown that GW memory detection from individual mergers of massive black hole binaries is expected with LISA. However, these works have not simulated the proper time domain response of the detector to the GW memory. This work is filling this gap and presents the detection prospects of LISA regarding GW memory and the expected signature of GW memory on the data-streams using the most up-to-date LISA consortium simulations of the response, as well as GW memory time-series computation inherited from numerical relativity. We will confront the LISA observation window to massive black hole binary mergers' population forecasted with the state-of-the-art population models and evaluate the odds and the expected accuracies regarding GW memory observations in the LISA lifetime. We conclude that GW memory will be a key feature of several events detected by LISA, and will help to exploit the scientific potential of the mission fully.</description>

      <title>Two sides of the same coin: the F-statistic and the 5-vector method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work explores the relationship between two data-analysis methods used in the search for continuous gravitational waves in LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA data: the $\mathcal{F}$-statistic and the 5-vector method. We show that the 5-vector method can be derived from a maximum likelihood framework similar to the $\mathcal{F}$-statistic. Our analysis demonstrates that the two methods are statistically equivalent, providing the same detection probability for a given false alarm rate. We extend this comparison to multiple detectors, highlighting differences from the standard approach that simply combines 5-vectors from each detector. In our maximum likelihood approach, each 5-vector is weighted by the observation time and sensitivity of its respective detector, resulting in efficient estimators and analytical distributions for the detection statistic. Additionally, we present the analytical computation of sensitivity for different searches, expressed in terms of the minimum detectable amplitude.</description>

      <title>The Tolman-Ehrenfest criterion of thermal equilibrium in scalar-tensor gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Tolman-Ehrenfest criterion for the thermal equilibrium of a fluid at rest in a static general-relativistic geometry is generalized to scalar-tensor gravity. The gravitational scalar field, which fixes the strength of the effective gravitational coupling, plays a role in determining thermal equilibrium. As a result, heat sinks more in a gravitational field where the geometry is more curved, but also where gravity is stronger.</description>

      <title>Ringdown signatures of Kerr black holes immersed in a magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the quasinormal mode spectrum for Kerr black holes surrounded by an asymptotically uniform magnetic field, modeled with the Ernst-Wild geometry. A perturbative expansion in both the rotation parameter $a$ and the magnetic field $B$ allows separation of the perturbation equations, and we obtain the spectrum for a variety of scalar quasinormal modes over a range of parameters using the continued fraction method. We then interpolate the low-lying mode spectrum to construct an Ernst-Wild template for the ringdown, and use the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA analysis tool pyRing to assess the impact of the magnetosphere on the extraction of ringdown signatures from several observed binary black hole mergers.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An observer at rest with the expanding universe experiences some extra noise in the quantum vacuum, and so does an accelerated observer in a vacuum at rest (in Minkowski space). The literature mainly focuses on the ideal cases of exponential expansion (de-Sitter space) or uniform acceleration (Rindler trajectories) or both, but the real cosmic expansion is non-exponential and real accelerations are non-uniform. Here we use the frequency-time Wigner function of vacuum correlations to define time-dependent spectra. We found excellent Planck spectra for a class of realistic cosmological models, but also strongly non-Planckian, negative Wigner functions for a standard scenario testable with laboratory analogues.</description>

      <title>Warm Hawking Relics From Primordial Black Hole Domination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the cosmological impact of warm, dark-sector relic particles produced as Hawking radiation in a primordial-black-hole-dominated universe before big bang nucleosynthesis. If those dark-sector particles are stable, they would survive to the present day as "Hawking relics" and modify the subsequent growth of cosmological structure. We show that such relics are produced with much larger momenta, but in smaller quantities than the familiar thermal relics considered in standard cosmology. Consequently, Hawking relics with keV-MeV masses affect the growth of large-scale structure in a similar way to eV-scale thermal relics like massive neutrinos. We model their production and evolution, and show that their momentum distributions are broader than comparable relics with thermal distributions. Warm Hawking relics affect the growth of cosmological perturbations and we constrain their abundance to be less than $2\%$ of the dark matter over a broad range of their viable parameter space. Finally, we examine how future measurements of the matter power spectrum can distinguish Hawking relics from thermal particles.</description>

      <title>A New Model-Independent Precision Test of General Relativity using LISA Bright Standard Sirens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The upcoming Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), set for launch in the mid-2030s, will enhance our capability to probe the universe through gravitational waves (GWs) emitted from binary black holes (BBHs) across a broad range of cosmological distances. LISA is projected to observe three classes of BBHs: massive BBHs (MBBHs), extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs), and stellar mass BBHs. This study focuses on MBBHs, which are anticipated to occur in gas-rich environments conducive to producing powerful electromagnetic (EM) counterparts. This capability to precisely localize MBH events in the sky positions them as excellent candidates for bright sirens. By combining GW luminosity distance measurements from these bright sirens with Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements derived from galaxy clustering and sound horizon measurements from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), we propose a data-driven model-independent method to reconstruct deviations in the variation of the effective Planck mass (in conjunction with the Hubble constant) as a function of cosmic redshift. Using this multi-messenger technique, we achieve precise measurements of deviations in the effective Planck mass variation with redshift (z), with a precision ranging from approximately $2.4\%$ to $7.2\%$ from redshift $z=1$ to $z=6$ with a single event. Additionally, we achieved a measurement of the Hubble constant with a precision of about $1.3\%$, accounting for variations in the effective Planck mass over 4 years of observation time ($T_{\mathrm{obs}}$). This assumes that EM counterparts are detected for $75\%$ of the events. This precision improves with observation time as $T_{\mathrm{obs}}^{-1/2}$. This approach not only has the potential to reveal deviations from General Relativity but also to significantly expand our understanding of the universe's fundamental physical properties.</description>

      <title>Revisiting subregion holography using OPE blocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09027v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this short note, we revisit the entanglement wedge representation of AdS$_3$ bulk fields in terms of CFT operator product expansion (OPE) blocks for a general class of blocks. Given a boundary interval and its associated causal diamond, the OPEs involve boundary operators with or without spin, and located either at spacelike or timelike edges of the diamond. Only for a subset of these cases, can the OPE block be dual to a geodesic bulk field. We show that when applied to de Sitter, a suitable combination of Euclidean OPE blocks can represent a dS scalar integrated over the timelike extremal surfaces, which play an important role in defining pseudo-entropy. We also work out some simple higher dimensional examples.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone Boson Production from Inflaton Coupling during Reheating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The existence of pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson (pNGB) fields is a common feature in many models beyond the Standard Model, characterized by their exclusive derivative couplings. This paper investigates a scenario where a pNGB is coupled to the inflaton field during the reheating phase of the early universe. We calculate the perturbative decay rate of a coherently oscillating inflaton into pNGBs on a general basis, considering both constant and field-dependent couplings with monomial potentials at the minimum. As a concrete application, we explore the production of axions when the radial mode of the Peccei-Quinn (PQ) scalar serves as the inflaton, particularly in the presence of a large gravitational non-minimal coupling. Our findings suggest that the presence of pNGBs during reheating can lead to significant non-thermal relics, offering new constraints on inflationary reheating models and providing potential observational signatures in the form of dark radiation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the covariant proposal for the gravitational Compton amplitude for a Kerr black hole. Employing the covariant three- and four-point Compton amplitudes, we assemble the classical one-loop integrand on the maximal cut at all orders in spin, utilizing the method of unitarity. Expanding in powers of spin, we evaluate the one-loop amplitude up to $\mathcal O(G^2 a^8)$. Supplemented with extra contact contributions derived from the far-zone data of the Teukolsky solutions, the one-loop amplitude is in agreement with results available in the literature. We showcase the classical eikonal in the aligned-spin case at $\mathcal O(G^2 a^7)$.</description>

      <title>V-static metrics and the volume-renormalised mass</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09101v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: V-static metrics generalise the notion of static metrics, and stem from the work of Miao and Tam [arXiv:0807.2693], and Corvino, Eichmair and Miao [arXiv:1211.6168] on critical points of the volume functional over the space of compact manifolds with constant scalar curvature. In this article we show that these V-static metrics arise naturally in the context of asymptotically hyperbolic manifolds as critical points of the volume-renormalised mass, recently introduced by Dahl, Kr\"oncke and the author [arXiv:2307.06196].
  In particular, we show that critical points of the volume-renormalised mass over the space of constant scalar curvature asymptotically hyperbolic manifolds without boundary, or satisfying appropriate boundary conditions, are exactly V-static metrics. This is directly analogous to the relationship between critical points of the ADM mass and static metrics for asymptotically flat manifolds.</description>

      <title>Primordial black hole formation from self-resonant preheating?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the question of how generic is the formation of primordial black holes via self-resonant growth of inflaton fluctuations in the post-inflationary, preheating phase. Using analytical and lattice calculations, we find that primordial black hole production is far from being a generic outcome. Also, in most of the parameter space of viable inflationary models, the metric preheating term is subleading to the anharmonic terms and the approximation of a quadratic potential for describing the resonance dynamics is inadequate. Nonetheless, the anharmonicity of the potential cannot be used to rescue the mechanism: The generic outcome of the non-linear evolution of the scalar field in this case is the formation of metastable transients or oscillons, that do not generically collapse into black holes.</description>

      <title>Acceleration of the Universe without the Hubble tension with Kaniadakis holographic dark energy using the Hubble horizon as the IR cut-off</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a holographic dark energy model that incorporates the first-order approximate Kaniadaski entropy, utilizing the Hubble horizon, $1/H$, as the infrared cutoff. We investigate the cosmological evolution within this framework. The model introduces an extra parameter relative to the $\Lambda$CDM model. It posits a Universe that is initially dominated by dark matter, which then evolves to a phase where dark energy becomes the predominant component, with this transition occurring at a redshift of approximately $z \sim 0.419$. The energy density of dark energy is ultimately expected to become constant, thereby circumventing the potential issue of a "big rip". Employing the most recent Type Ia supernova and Hubble parameter data, we constrain the model's parameters and find a Hubble constant of $H_0=72.8$ km/s/Mpc, thereby resolving the Hubble tension issue. The estimated age of the Universe, based on the best-fit parameter values, is $14.2$ Gyr. Furthermore, we predict the number of strong gravitational lenses and conduct statefinder and $Om$ diagnostic analyses to validate and characterize the model.</description>

      <title>To curve, or not to curve: Is curvature-assisted quintessence observationally viable?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single-field models of accelerated expansion with nearly flat potentials, despite being able to provide observationally viable explanations for the early-time cosmic inflation and the late-time cosmic acceleration, are in strong tension with string theory evidence and the associated de Sitter swampland constraints. It has recently been argued that in an open universe, where the spatial curvature is negative (i.e., with $\Omega_k&gt;0$), a new stable fixed point arises, which may lead to viable single-field-based accelerated expansion with an arbitrarily steep potential. Here we show, through a dynamical systems analysis and a Bayesian statistical inference of cosmological parameters, that the additional cosmological solutions based on the new fixed point do not render steep-potential, single-field, accelerated expansion observationally viable. We mainly focus on quintessence models of dark energy, but we also argue that a similar conclusion can be drawn for cosmic inflation.</description>

      <title>Correlations and Signaling in the Schr\"{o}dinger-Newton Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Schr\"odinger-Newton model is a semi-classical theory in which, in addition to mutual attraction, massive quantum particles interact with their own gravitational fields. While there are many studies on the phenomenology of single particles, correlation dynamics in multipartite systems is largely unexplored. Here, we show that the Schr\"odinger-Newton interactions preserve the product form of initial states, yet on average it agrees with classical mechanics of continuous mass distributions. This leads to a simple test of the model, based on verifying bipartite gravitational evolution towards non-product states. We show using standard quantum mechanics that, with currently accessible single-particle parameters, two masses released from harmonic traps get correlated well before any observable entanglement is accumulated. Therefore, the Schr\"odinger-Newton model can be tested with setups aimed at observation of gravitational entanglement with significantly relaxed requirements on coherence time. We also present a mixed-state extension of the model that avoids superluminal signaling.</description>

Abstract: We prove uniform finite-time existence of solutions to the vacuum Einstein equations in polarized U(1) symmetry which have uniformly positive incoming $H^1$ energy supported on an arbitrarily small set in the 2 + 1 spacetime obtained by quotienting by the U(1) symmetry. We also construct a subclass of solutions for which the energy remains concentrated (along a U(1) family of geodesics) throughout its evolution. These results rely on three innovations: a direct treatment of the 2 + 1 Einstein equations in a null geodesic gauge, a novel parabolic scaling of the Einstein equations in this gauge, and a new Klainerman-Sobolev inequality on rectangular strips.</description>

      <title>Optical features of rotating quintessential charged black holes in de-Sitter spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.05860v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the most important and actual issues in relativistic astrophysics is testing gravity theories and obtaining constraint values for the parameters of black holes using observational data. In this research, we aimed to explore the optical features of a Kerr--Newman black hole model in the presence of a quintessential field, which may be a candidate for a dark-energy model with a nonzero cosmological constant. First, we obtain the equations of motion for photons using the Hamilton--Jacobi formalism. We also study the horizons and shapes of the apparent regions of the photon region around the said black hole. In various scenarios, we investigate shadows cast by the black hole using celestial coordinates. Furthermore, we analyze the effects of the quintessential field and black hole charge on the shadow radius and distortion. Furthermore, we look into the constraints on the spin and charge of supermassive black holes M87$^*$ and Sagittarius A$^*$ for different values of the quintessential field using their shadow size measured by the Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration. Finally, we study the effects of the quintessential field, black hole spin and charge on its energy emission rate by Hawking radiation and compare our results with those of the available literature.</description>

      <title>Bose-Einstein Condensate and Liquid Helium He$^4$: Implications of GUP and Modified Gravity Correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01159v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Utilizing the recently established connection between Palatini-like gravity and linear Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) models, we have formulated an approach that facilitates the examination of Bose gases. Our primary focus is on the ideal Bose-Einstein condensate and liquid helium, chosen as illustrative examples to underscore the feasibility of tabletop experiments in assessing gravity models. The non-interacting Bose-Einstein condensate imposes constraints on linear GUP and Palatini $f(R)$ gravity (Eddington-inspired Born-Infeld gravity) within the ranges of $-10^{12}\lesssim\sigma\lesssim 3\times 10^{24}{\text{ s}}/{\text{kg m}}$ and $-10^{-1}\lesssim\bar\beta\lesssim 10^{11} \text{ m}^2$ ($-4\times10^{-1}\lesssim\epsilon\lesssim 4\times 10^{11} \text{ m}^2$), respectively. In contrast, the properties of liquid helium suggest more realistic bounds, specifically $-10^{23}\lesssim\sigma\lesssim 10^{23}{\text{ s}}/{\text{kg m}}$ and $-10^{9}\lesssim\bar\beta\lesssim 10^{9} \text{ m}^2$. Additionally, we argue that the newly developed method employing Earth seismic waves provides improved constraints for quantum and modified gravity by approximately one order of magnitude.</description>

Abstract: A generation method of new metric in the case of static spherically symmetric space-time is derived. Using this approach, we construct a metric which describes Euler-Heisenberg black hole surrounded by perfect fluid dark matter and investigate its optical and thermodynamic properties. We found that radius of shadow will increase with the increase of dark matter effect, and more strong dark matter will diminish the light intensity of accretion disk generally. Moreover, in thermodynamics, when quantum electrodynamic parameter is positive, there will be a critical value of dark matter parameter, which determine the number of black hole's critical points.</description>

      <title>The pseudospectrum and spectrum (in)stability of quantum corrected Schwarzschild black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09907v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the pseudospectrum and spectrum (in)stability of quantum corrected Schwarzschild black hole. Methodologically, we use the hyperboloidal framework to cast the quasinormal mode (QNM) problem into an eigenvalue problem associated with a non-selfadjoint operator, and then the spectrum and pseudospectrum are depicted. Besides, the invariant subspace method is exploited to improve the computational efficiency for pseudospectrum. The investigation into the spectrum (in)stability entails two main aspects. On the one hand, we calculate the spectra of the quantum corrected black hole, then by the means of the migration ratio, the impact of the quantum correction effect on the Schwarzschild black hole has been studied. The results indicate that the so-called ``migration ratio instability" will occur for small black holes with small angular momentum number l. In the eikonal limit, the migration ratios remain the same for each overtone. On the other hand, we study the spectrum (in)stability of the quantum corrected black hole by directly adding some particular perturbations into the effective potential, where perturbations are located at the event horizon and null infinity, respectively. There are two interesting observations under the same perturbation energy norm. First, perturbations at infinity are more capable of generating spectrum instability than those at the event horizon. Second, we find that the peak distribution can lead to the instability of QNM spectrum more efficiently than the average distribution.</description>

      <title>Searches for Compact Binary Coalescence Events Using Neural Networks in LIGO/Virgo Third Observation Period</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12912v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the results on the search for the coalescence of compact binary mergers using convolutional neural networks and the LIGO/Virgo data for the O3 observation period. Two-dimensional images in time and frequency are used as input. The analysis is performed in three separate mass regions covering the range for the masses in the binary system from 0.2 to 100 solar masses, excluding very asymmetric mass configurations. We explore neural networks trained with input information from pairs of interferometers or all three interferometers together, concluding that the use of the maximum information available leads to an improved performance. A scan over the O3 data set, using the convolutional neural networks, is performed with different fake rate thresholds for claiming detection of at most one event per year or at most one event per week. The latter would correspond to a loose online selection still leading to affordable fake alarm rates. The efficiency of the neutral networks to detect the O3 catalog events is discussed. In the case of a fake rate threshold of at most one event per week, the scan leads to the detection of about 50% of the O3 catalog events. Once the search is limited to the catalog events within the mass range used for neural networks training, the detection efficiency increases up to 70%. A further improvement in the search efficiency, using the same kind of algorithms, will require the implementation of new criteria for the suppression of detector glitches.</description>

      <title>Analytically Separating the Source of the Teukolsky Equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.00604v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent gravitational wave detections from black hole mergers have underscored the critical role black hole perturbation theory and the Teukolsky equation play in understanding the behaviour of black holes. The separable nature of the Teukolsky equation has long been leveraged to study the vacuum linear Teukolsky equation; however, as theory and measurements advance, solving the sourced Teukolsky equation is becoming a frontier of research. In particular, second-order calculations, such as in quasi-normal mode and self-force problems, have extended sources. This paper presents a novel method for analytically separating the Teukolsky equation's source, aimed to improve efficiency. Separating the source is a non-trivial problem due to the angular and radial mixing of generic quantities in Kerr spacetime. We provide a proof-of-concept demonstration of our method and show that it is accurate, separating the Teukolsky source produced by the stress-energy tensor of an ideal gas cloud surrounding a Kerr black hole. The detailed application of our method is provided in an accompanying \textit{Mathematica} notebook. Our approach opens up a new avenue for accurate black hole perturbation theory calculations with sources in both the time and frequency domain.</description>

      <title>Testing disformal non-circular deformation of Kerr black holes with LISA</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16192v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There is strong observational evidence that almost every large galaxy has a supermassive black hole at its center. It is of fundamental importance to know whether such black holes are described by the standard Kerr solution in General Relativity (GR) or by another black hole solution. An interesting alternative is the so-called disformal Kerr black holes which exist within the framework of degenerate higher-order scalar-tensor (DHOST) theories of gravity. The departure from the standard Kerr black hole spacetime is parametrized by a parameter $D$, called $\textit{disformal parameter}$. In the present work, we discuss the capability of LISA to detect the disformal parameter. For this purpose, we study Extreme Mass Ratio Inspirals (EMRI's) around disformal Kerr black holes within the framework of the quadrupole hybrid formalism. Even when the disformal parameter is very small, its effect on the globally accumulated phase of the gravitational waveform of an EMRI can be significant due to the large number of cycles in the LISA band made by the small compact object. We show that LISA will in principle be able to detect and measure extremely small values of the disformal parameter which in turn, can be seen as an assessment of LISA's ability to detect very small deviations from the Kerr geometry.</description>

      <title>Cosmological constant as an integration constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00932v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The discrepancy between the observed value of the cosmological constant (CC) and its expected value from quantum field theoretical considerations motivates the search for a theory in which the CC is decoupled from the vacuum energy. In this article, we consider theories in which the CC is regarded as an integration constant. These theories include trace-free Einstein gravity, theories constructed from the Codazzi equation (which includes Cotton gravity and a gauge-gravity inspired theory), and conformal Killing gravity. We remark on a recent debate regarding the viability of Cotton gravity and find that while the Codazzi equation is indeed underdetermined, the solutions of the Codazzi equation trivialize to $\lambda g_{ab}$ on generic backgrounds, and that in principle, one can close the system with the divergence-free condition and an appropriate choice of initial data. We also propose a full variational principle (full in the sense that variations in all variables are considered) for each of the aforementioned theories that can incorporate the matter sector; in this manner, we can obtain the trace-free Einstein equations without a unimodular constraint.</description>

      <title>Effective Quantum Gravitational Collapse in a Polymer Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03279v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study how the presence of an area gap, different than zero, affects the gravitational collapse of a dust ball. The implementation of such discreteness is achieved through the framework of polymer quantization, a scheme inspired by loop quantum gravity (LQG). We study the collapse using variables which represent the area, in order to impose the non-zero area gap condition. The collapse is analyzed for both the flat and spherical Oppenheimer-Snyder models. In both scenarios the formation of the singularity is avoided, due to the inversion of the velocity at finite values of the sphere surface. This happens due to the presence of a negative pressure, with origins at a quantum level. When the inversion happens inside the black hole event horizon, we achieve a geometry transition to a white hole. When the inversion happens outside the event horizon, we find a new possible astrophysical object. A characterization of such hypothetical object is done. Some constraints on the value for the area gap are also imposed in order to maintain the link with our already established physical theories.</description>

      <title>Holographic Timelike Entanglement Entropy from Rindler Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.09803v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a Lorentzian invariant theory, the entanglement entropy should be a function of the domain of dependence of the subregion under consideration. More precisely, it should be a function of the domain of dependence and the appropriate cut-off. In this paper, we refine the concept of cut-off to make it applicable to timelike regions and assume that the usual entanglement entropy formula also applies to timelike intervals. Using the Rindler method, the timelike entanglement entropy can be regarded as the thermal entropy of the CFT after the Rindler transformation plus a constant $ic\pi/6$ with $c$ the central charge. The gravitational dual of the `covariant' timelike entanglement entropy is finally presented following this method.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background from Highly-Eccentric Stellar-Mass Binaries in the Milli-hertz Band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04832v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many gravitational wave (GW) sources are expected to have non-negligible eccentricity in the millihertz band. These highly eccentric compact object binaries may commonly serve as a progenitor stage of GW mergers, particularly in dynamical channels where environmental perturbations bring a binary with large initial orbital separation into a close pericenter passage, leading to efficient GW emission and a final merger. This work examines the stochastic GW background from highly eccentric ($e\gtrsim 0.9$), stellar-mass sources in the mHz band. Our findings suggest that these binaries can contribute a substantial GW power spectrum, potentially exceeding the LISA instrumental noise at $\sim 3-7$~mHz. This stochastic background is likely to be dominated by eccentric sources within the Milky Way, thus introducing anisotropy and time dependence in LISA's detection. However, given efficient search strategies to identify GW transients from highly eccentric binaries, the unresolvable noise level can be substantially lower, approaching $\sim 2$ orders of magnitude below the LISA noise curve. Therefore, we highlight the importance of characterizing stellar-mass GW sources with extreme eccentricity, especially their transient GW signals in the millihertz band.</description>

      <title>On classical de Sitter solutions and parametric control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07065v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Finding string backgrounds with de Sitter spacetime, where all approximations and corrections are controlled, is an open problem. We revisit the search for de Sitter solutions in the classical regime for specific type IIB supergravity compactifications on group manifolds, an under-explored corner of the landscape that offers an interesting testing ground for swampland conjectures. While the supergravity de Sitter solutions we obtain numerically are ambiguous in terms of their classicality, we find an analytic scaling that makes four out of six compactification radii, as well as the overall volume, arbitrarily large. This potentially provides parametric control over corrections. If we could show that these solutions, or others to be found, are fully classical, they would constitute a counterexample to conjectures stating that asymptotic de Sitter solutions do not exist. We discuss this point in great detail.</description>

      <title>Probing the quantum nature of gravity using a Bose-Einstein condensate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18460v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The effect of noise induced by gravitons has been investigated using a Bose-Einstein condensate. The gravitational wave perturbation is then considerd as a sum of discrete Fourier modes in the momentum space. Coming to an operatorial representation and quantizing the phase space variables via appropriately introduced canonincal commutation relations between the canonically conjugate variables corresponding to the graviton and bosonic part of the total system, one obtains a proper quantum gravity setup. Then we obtain the Bogoliubov coefficients from the solution of the time-dependent part of the pseudo-Goldstone boson and construct the covariance metric for the bosons initially being in a squeezed state. Using the stochastic average of the Fisher information, we obtain a lower bound on the amplitude parameter of the gravitational wave. As the entire calculation is done at zero temperature, the bosonic system, by construction, will behave as a Bose-Einstein condensate. For a Bose-Einstein condensate with a single mode, we observe that the lower bound of the expectation value of the square of the uncertainty in the amplitude measurement does not become infinite when the total observational term approaches zero. In order to sum over all possible momentum modes, we next consider a noise term with a suitable Gaussian weight factor which decays over time. We then obtain the lower bound on the final expectation value of the square of the variance in the amplitude parameter. Because of the noise induced by the graviton, there is a minimum value of the measurement time below which it is impossible to detect any gravitational wave using a Bose-Einstein condensate. Finally, we consider interaction between the phonon modes of the Bose-Einstein condensate which results in the decoherence. We observe that the decoherence effect becomes significant for gravitons with minimal squeezing.</description>

      <title>General relativistic force-free electrodynamics with a discontinuous Galerkin-finite difference hybrid method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01531v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Relativistic plasmas around compact objects can sometimes be approximated as being force-free. In this limit, the plasma inertia is negligible and the overall dynamics is governed by global electric currents. We present a novel numerical approach for simulating such force-free plasmas, which allows for high accuracy in smooth regions as well as capturing dissipation in current sheets. Using a high-order accurate discontinuous Galerkin method augmented with a conservative finite-difference method, we demonstrate efficient global simulations of black hole and neutron star magnetospheres. In addition to a series of challenging test problems, we show that our approach can-depending on the physical properties of the system and the numerical implementation-be up to 10x more efficient than conventional simulations, with a speedup of 2-3x for most problems we consider in practice.</description>

      <title>A minimal solution to the axion isocurvature problem from a non-minimal coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06441v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The main limitation for pre-inflationary breaking of Peccei-Quinn (PQ) symmetry is the upper bound on the Hubble rate during inflation from axion isocurvature fluctuations. This leads to a tension between high scale inflation and QCD axions with Grand Unified Theory (GUT) scale decay constants, which reduces the potential for a detection of tensor modes at next generation CMB experiments. We propose a mechanism that excplicitly breaks PQ symmetry via non-minimal coupling to gravity, that lifts the axion mass above the Hubble scale during inflation and has negligible impact on today's axion potential. The initially heavy axion gets trapped at an intermediate minimum during inflation given by the phase of the non-minimal coupling, before it moves to its true CP-conserving minimum after inflation. During this stage it undergoes coherent oscillations around an adiabatically decreasing minimum, which slightly dilutes the axion energy density, while still being able to explain the observed dark matter relic abundance. This scenario can be tested by the combination of next generation CMB surveys like CMB-S4 and LiteBIRD with haloscopes such as ABRACADABRA or CASPEr-Electric.</description>

      <title>Holographic RG flows in a 3d gauged supergravity at finite temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06515v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we consider finite-temperature holographic RG flows in $D=3$ $\mathcal{N}=(2,0)$ gauged truncated supergravity coupled to a sigma model with a hyperbolic target space. In the context of the holographic duality, fixed points (CFTs) at finite temperature are described by AdS black holes. We come from the gravity EOM to a 3d autonomous dynamical system, which critical points can be related to fixed points of dual field theories. Near-horizon black hole solutions correspond to infinite points of this system. We use Poincar\'e transformations to project the system on $\mathbf{R}^3$ into the 3d unit cylinder such that the infinite points are mapped onto the boundary of the cylinder. We explore numerically the space of solutions. We show that the exact RG flow at zero temperature is the separatrix for asymptotically AdS black hole solutions if the potential has one extremum, while for the potential with three extrema the separatrices are RG flows between AdS fixed points. We find near-horizon analytical solutions for asymptotically AdS black holes using the dynamical equations. We also present a method for constructing full analytical solutions.</description>
