      <title>The distribution of symmetry of Lorentzian naturally reductive nilmanifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study $2$-step nilpotent Lorentzian Lie groups $N$, which are naturally reductive with respect to a certain class of transitive subgroups of isometries. We describe the isotropy representation and prove that its fixed points give raise to the distribution of symmetry of $N$. This generalizes some known results for the Riemannian case.</description>

      <title>Parallel torsion and $G_2, Spin(7)$ instantons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Instanton properties of the characteristic connection $\nabla$ on an integrable $G_2$ manifold as well as instanton condition of the torsion connection $\nabla$ on a $Spin(7)$ manifold are investigated. It is shown that for an integrable $G_2$ manifold with $\nabla$-parallel Lee form the curvature of the characteristic connection is a $G_2$ instanton exactly when the torsion 3-form is $\nabla$-parallel. It is observed that on a compact $Spin(7)$ manifold with $\nabla$ closed torsion 3-form the torsion connection is a $Spin(7)$ instanton if and only if the torsion 3-form is parallel with respect to the torsion connection.</description>

      <title>Harmonic functions on minimal submanifold with cylindrical cone</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.10792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the relationship between the dimension of linear space of harmonic function with growth bounded by a fixed-degree polynomial on a minimal submanifold in Euclidean space and that on its one cylindrical tangent cone at infinity by using the method in [6, 7]. Specifically, if this degree does not coincide with any growth of polynomial-growth harmonic functions on the cone, then the corresponding dimensions are equal.</description>

      <title>The capillary Orlicz-Minkowski problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.10859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a Robin boundary analogue of the Orlicz-Minkowski problem, which seeks to find a capillary convex body with a prescribed capillary Orlicz surface area measure in the upper Euclidean half-space. We obtain the volume-normalized smooth solutions to the capillary even Orlicz-Minkowski problem by the continuity method. In addition, we also establish a capillary Orlicz-Brunn-Minkowski inequality and a capillary Orlicz-Minkowski inequality, which can change our solutions to a spherical cap under some conditions.</description>

      <title>Characterization of the Metric Completion of Immersed Open-Curve Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The completeness properties of spaces of immersed curves equipped with reparametrization-invariant Riemannian metrics have recently been the subject of active research. This thesis studies the metric completion of spaces of immersed open curves endowed with Sobolev-type metrics and examines a previously proposed conjecture that suggests the metric completion consists of a single additional point, representing all vanishing length Cauchy sequences. We disprove the conjecture in the setting of real-valued immersed curves by demonstrating the existence of multiple distinct limit points. Furthermore, we provide a nearly complete characterization of the metric structure of the metric completion in this case. These results lead to a revised conjecture regarding the structure of the metric completion in more general settings</description>

      <title>On the planar free elastic flow with small oscillation of curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The free elastic flow that begins at any curve exists for all time. If the initial curve is an $\omega$-fold covered circle (``$\omega$-circle'') the solution expands self-similarly. Very recently, Miura and the second author showed that (topological) $\omega$-circles that are close to multiply-covered round circles are asymptotically stable under the planar free elastic flow, which means that upon rescaling the rescaled flow converges smoothly to the stationary (in the rescaled setting) $\omega$-circle. Closeness in that work was measured via the derivative of the curvature scalar. In the present paper, we improve this by requiring closeness in terms of the curvature scalar itself. The convergence rate we obtain is sharp.</description>

      <title>Existence of uniform Temple charts and applications to null distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove that Temple's cylindrical future null coordinate charts can be constructed uniformly and we estimate the gradients of their optical functions. We then apply these charts to study a spacetime $(N,g)$ that has been converted into a definite metric space $(N,\hat{d}_\tau)$, where $\hat{d}_\tau$ is the null distance of Sormani and Vega defined using a locally anti-Lipschitz (in the sense of Chrusciel, Grant, and Minguzzi) generalized time function $\tau$. In particular, in the case when $\tau$ is Lipschitz we prove that $(N, \hat{d}_\tau)$ is a rectifiable metric space, where the causal structure is locally encoded by $\tau$ and $\hat{d}_\tau$. As a consequence, applying a classical theorem of Hawking and following a technique developed by Sakovich and Sormani, we can prove a Lorentzian isometry theorem, generalizing our earlier result.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness of tangent planes and (non-)removable singularities at infinity for collapsed translators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that mean curvature flow translators may exhibit non-removable singularities at infinity, due to jump discontinuities in their asymptotic profiles, and that oscillation can persist so as to yield a continuum of subsequential limit tangent planes. Nonetheless, we prove that as time $t\to\pm \infty$, any finite entropy, finite genus, embedded, collapsed translating soliton in $\mathbb{R}^3$ converges to a uniquely determined collection of planes.
  This requires global analysis of quasilinear soliton equations with non-perturbative drifts, which we analyze via sharp non-standard elliptic decay estimates for the drift Laplacian, implying improvements on the Evans-Spruck and Ecker-Huisken estimates in the soliton setting, and exploiting a link from potential theory of the Yukawa equation to heat flows with $L^\infty$-data on non-compact slice curves of these solitons.
  The structure theorem follows: such solitons decompose at infinity into standard regions asymptotic to planes or grim reaper cylinders. As one application, we classify collapsed translators of entropy two with empty limits as $t\to +\infty$.</description>

      <title>Engel CR submanifolds of $\mathbb{C}^3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11488v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a sufficient condition for an $\mathbb{S}^1$-bundle over a $3$-manifold to admit an immersion (or embedding) into $\mathbb{C}^3$ so that its complex tangencies define an Engel structure. In particular, every oriented $\mathbb{S}^1$-bundle over a closed, oriented $3$-manifold admits such an immersion. If the bundle is trivial, this immersion can be chosen to be an embedding and, moreover, infinitely many pairwise smoothly non-isotopic embeddings of this type can be constructed. These are the first examples of compact submanifolds of $\mathbb{C}^3$ whose complex tangencies are Engel, answering a question of Y. Eliashberg.</description>

      <title>Poincar{\'e} series for analytic convex bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Poincar{\'e} series associated to strictly convex bodies in the Euclidean space. These series are Laplace transforms of the distribution of lengths (measured with the Finsler metric associated to one of the bodies) from one convex body to a lattice. Assuming that the convex bodies have analytic boundaries, we prove that the Poincar{\'e} series, originally defined in the right complex half-plane, continues holomorphically to a conical neighborhood of this set, removing a countable set of cuts and points. The latter correspond to the spectrum of a dual elliptic operator. We describe singularities of the Poincar{\'e} series at each of these branching points. One of the steps of the proof consists in showing analytic continuation of the resolvent of multiplication operators by a real-valued analytic Morse function on the sphere as a branched holomorphic function, a result of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Cohomological Calibration and Curvature Constraints on Product Manifolds: A Topological Lower Bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a quantitative relationship between mixed cohomology classes and the geometric complexity of cohomologically calibrated metric connections with totally skew torsion on product manifolds. Extending the results of Pigazzini--Toda (2025), we show that the dimension of the off-diagonal curvature subspace of a connection $\nabla^C$ is bounded below by the sum of tensor ranks of the mixed K\"unneth components of its calibration class. The bound depends only on the mixed class $[\omega]_{\mathrm{mixed}}\in H^3(M;\mathbb{R})$, hence is topological and independent of the chosen product metric. This provides a computational criterion for geometric complexity and quantifies the interaction between topology and curvature, yielding a quantified version of ``forced irreducibility'' via the dimension of $\mathfrak{hol}_p^{\mathrm{off}}(\nabla^C)$.</description>

      <title>On the Geometry of $\varphi$-Static Perfect Fluid Space-Times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study the geometry of $\varphi$-static perfect fluid space-times ($\varphi$-SPFST, for short). In the context of Einstein's General Relativity, they arise from a space-time whose matter content is described by a perfect fluid in addition to a nonlinear field expressed by a smooth map $\varphi$ with values in a Riemannian manifold. Considering the Lorentzian manifold $\hat{M}$ in the form of a static warped product, we derive the fundamental equations via reduction of Einstein's Field Equations to the factors of the product. To set the stage for our main results, we discuss the validity of the classical Energy Conditions in the present setting and we introduce the formalism of $\varphi$-curvatures, which is a fundamental tool to merge the geometry of the manifold with that of the smooth map $\varphi$. We then present several mathematical settings in which similar structures arise. After computing two integrability conditions, we apply them to prove a number of rigidity results, both for manifolds with or without boundary. In each of the aforementioned results, the main assumption is given by the vanishing of some $\varphi$-curvature tensors and the conclusion is a local splitting of the metric into a warped product. Inspired by the classical Cosmic No Hair Conjecture of Boucher, Gibbons and Horowitz, we find sharp sufficient conditions on a compact $\varphi$-SPFST with boundary to be isometric to the standard hemisphere. We then describe the geometry of relatively compact domains in $M$ subject to an upper bound on the mean curvature of their boundaries. Finally, we study non-existence results for $\varphi$-SPFSTs, both via the existence of zeroes of the solutions of an appropriate ODE and with the aid of a suitable integral formula generalising in a precise sense the well-known Kazdan-Warner obstruction.</description>

      <title>Alexandrov estimates for polynomial operators by determinant majorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We obtain estimates on the supremum, infimum and oscillation of solutions for a wide class of inhomogeneous fully nonlinear elliptic equations on Euclidean domains where the differential operator is an I-central Garding-Dirichlet operator in the sense of Harvey-Lawson (2024). The argument combines two recent results: an Alexandrov estimate of Payne-Redaelli (2025) for locally semiconvex functions based on the area formula and a determinant majorization estimate of Harvey-Lawson (2024).
  The determinant majorization estimate has as a special case the arithmetic - geometric mean inequality, so the result includes the classical Alexandrov-Bakelman-Pucci estimate for linear operators. A potential theoretic approach is used involving subequation subharmonics and their dual subharmonics. Semiconvex approximation plays a crucial role.</description>

      <title>A new approach to the bialgebra theory for relative Poisson algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is natural to consider extending the typical construction of relative Poisson algebras from commutative differential algebras to the context of bialgebras. The known bialgebra structures for relative Poisson algebras, namely relative Poisson bialgebras, are equivalent to Manin triples of relative Poisson algebras with respect to the symmetric bilinear forms which are invariant on both the commutative associative and Lie algebras. However, they are not consistent with commutative and cocommutative differential antisymmetric infinitesimal (ASI) bialgebras as the bialgebra structures for commutative differential algebras. Alternatively, with the invariance replaced by the commutative $2$-cocycles on the Lie algebras, the corresponding Manin triples of relative Poisson algebras are proposed, which are shown to be equivalent to certain bialgebra structures, namely relative PCA bialgebras. They serve as another approach to the bialgebra theory for relative Poisson algebras, which can be naturally constructed from commutative and cocommutative differential ASI bialgebras. The notion of the relative PCA Yang-Baxter equation (RPCA-YBE) in a relative PCA algebra is introduced, whose antisymmetric solutions give coboundary relative PCA bialgebras. The notions of $\mathcal{O}$-operators of relative PCA algebras and relative pre-PCA algebras are also introduced to give antisymmetric solutions of the RPCA-YBE.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Dirichlet problem for the complex Monge-Amp\`ere equation on a strictly pseudo-convex domain in Cn or a Hermitian manifold. Under the condition that the right-hand side lies in Lp function and the boundary data are H\"older continuous, we prove the global H\"older continuity of the solution.</description>

      <title>Meromorphic open-string vertex algebras and Riemannian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1205.2977</link>
      <description>arXiv:1205.2977v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $M$ be a Riemannian manifold. For $p$ in $M$, the tensor algebra of the negative part of the (complex) affinization of the tangent space of $M$ at $p$ has a natural structure of a meromorphic open-string vertex algebra. These meromorphic open-string vertex algebras form a vector bundle over $M$ with a connection. We construct a sheaf $\mathcal{V}$ of meromorphic open-string vertex algebras on the sheaf of parallel sections of this vector bundle. Using covariant derivatives, we construct representations on the spaces of complex smooth functions of the algebras of parallel tensor fields. These representations are used to construct a sheaf $\mathcal{W}$ of left $\mathcal{V}$-modules generated by the sheaf of smooth functions. In particular, we obtain a meromorphic open-string vertex algebra $V_{M}$ of the global sections on M of the sheaf $\mathcal{V}$ and a left $V_{M}$-module $W_{M}$ of the global sections on M of the sheaf $\mathcal{W}$. By the definitions of meromorphic open-string vertex algebra and left module, we obtain, among many other properties, operator product expansion for vertex operators. We also show that the Laplacian on M is in fact a component of a vertex operator for the left $V_{M}$-module $W_{M}$ restricted to the space of smooth functions.</description>

      <title>The Constant Width Measure Set, the Spherical Measure Set and isoperimetric equalities for planar ovals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.02930</link>
      <description>arXiv:1605.02930v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce the Constant Width Measure Set, which measures the constant width property of an oval, i.e. the planar simple closed strictly convex curve. We study its geometrical properties.
  We find the exact relation between the length and the area of the region bounded by an oval $M$. Namely, the following equality is fulfilled: \begin{align*} L_{M}^2 &amp;=4\pi A_M+8\pi\left|\widetilde{A}_{\mathrm{E}_{\frac{1}{2}}(M)}\right|+\pi\left|\widetilde{A}_{\mathrm{CWMS}(M)}\right|, \end{align*} where $L_{M}, A_{M}, \widetilde{A}_{\mathrm{E}_{\frac{1}{2}}(M)}, \widetilde{A}_{\mathrm{CWMS}(M)}$ are the length of $M$, the area bounded by $M$, the oriented area of the Wigner caustic of $M$ and the oriented area of the Constant Width Measure Set of $M$, respectively.
  Furthermore we study the geometry of the Spherical Measure Set, which is an offset of a curve with a special distance. We show that the oriented area of this set of an oval $M$, $\widetilde{A}_{\mathrm{SMS}(M)}$, satisfies the following equality: \begin{align*} 4\left|\widetilde{A}_{\mathrm{SMS}(M)}\right|=8\left|\widetilde{A}_{\mathrm{E}_{\frac{1}{2}}(M)}\right|+\left|\widetilde{A}_{\mathrm{CWMS}(M)}\right|. \end{align*}</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17978v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We generalize the inverse Monge-Ampere flow, which was introduced in \cite{CHT17}, and provide conditions that guarantee the convergence of the flow without a priori assumption that $X$ has a K\"ahler-Einstein metric. We also show that if the underlying manifold does not admit K\"ahler-Einstein metric, then the flow develops Nadel multiplier ideal sheaves. In addition, we establish the linear lower bound for $\inf_X\varphi$, and the theorem of Darvas and He for the inverse Monge-Ampere flow.</description>

      <title>The Chromatic Tiling Theorem: Scaling Laws and the Separation Dimension of Fractal Partitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00892v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper establishes a rigorous, quantitative link between the combinatorial complexity of a fractal partition and the intrinsic geometry of its interfaces. We introduce the concept of the \emph{Separation Dimension} ($\sepdim$), a novel characteristic that quantifies the Hausdorff dimension of the boundaries between tiles. A natural but flawed approach would be to relate coloring complexity to the fractal's ambient topological boundary. We demonstrate that this extrinsic view is untenable for a vast class of self-similar sets. Instead, our intrinsic framework, centered on the Separation Dimension, provides the correct formulation. We define a new class of well-behaved partitions, termed \emph{Geometrically Regular Partitions (GRPs)}, and prove their existence on canonical fractals such as the Sierpinski Carpet. Our main result, the Chromatic Tiling Theorem, provides a sharp upper bound for the chromatic number ($\chi$) of the graph associated with such a partition, proving that it is bounded by $\chi(\tiling) \leq \Cconst (r_{\max}/r_{\min})^{\sepdim}$. This result demonstrates that the scaling of coloring complexity is governed not by the dimension of the fractal itself, but by the dimension of the separation set induced by the partition. We conclude by proposing the minimization of the separation dimension over all admissible partitions as a new variational problem in fractal geometry.</description>

      <title>Short-time existence of Lagrangian mean curvature flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10341v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In his paper `Conjectures on Bridgeland Stability', Joyce asked if one can desingularise the transverse intersection point of an immersed Lagrangian using JLT expanders such that one gets a Lagrangian mean curvature flow via the desingularisations. Begley and Moore answered this in the affirmative by constructing a family of desingularisations and showing that a certain limit along their flows satisfies LMCF along with convergence to the immersed Lagrangian in the sense of varifolds. We prove that there exists a solution with convergence in a stronger sense, using the notion of manifolds with corners and a-corners as introduced by Joyce. Our methods are a direct P.D.E. based approach, along the lines of the proof of short-time existence for network flow by Lira, Mazzeo, Pluda and Saez.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09104v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, for any n&gt;1, Carlotto and Schulz showed the existence of a minimal embedding in the 2n-dimensional unit sphere. In this paper, we show that the stability index of these embedded minimal hypersurfaces is at least n^2+4n+3. We also show that Yau's conjecture holds for these examples if and only if the solution of the differential equation z''(t)+a_n(t)z'(t)+(2n-1)z(t)=0 with z(0)=1 and z'(0)=0 satisfies z'(T)&gt;0. Here,T and the T-periodic function a_n(t) are determined in terms of the functions defining the minimal immersion.</description>

      <title>On 3-nondegenerate CR manifolds in dimension 7 (II): the intransitive case</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.02841v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate 3-nondegenerate CR structures in the lowest possible dimension 7 and show that 8 is the maximal dimension for the Lie algebra of symmetries of such structures. The next possible symmetry dimension is 6, and for the automorphism groups the dimension 7 is also realizable. This part (II) is devoted to the case where the symmetry algebra acts intransitively. We use various methods to bound its dimension and demonstrate the existence of infinitely many non-equivalent submaximally symmetric models. Summarizing, we get a stronger form of Beloshapka's conjecture on the symmetry dimension of hypersurfaces in $\mathbb{C}^4$.</description>

Abstract: Reduction theorem for Poisson manifolds with Hamiltonian Lie algebroids is presented. The notion of compatibility of a momentum section is introduced to the category of Hamiltonian Lie algebroids over Poisson manifolds. It is shown that a compatible momentum section is a Lie algebra homomorphism, and then the quotient space of the zero level set of a compatible momentum section proves to be a Poisson manifold.</description>

      <title>Approximation by invariant Dirac measures on non-positively curved manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04916v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the topology of the space of probability measures invariant under the geodesic flow, defined on the unit-tangent bundle of a compact Riemannian manifold with non-positive curvature. Building on a previous work by Coud\`ene and Schapira we introduce the set of \textit{weakly regular} vectors, denoted by $\mathcal{R}_w$: a vector in the unit tangent bundle of a Riemannian manifold is weakly regular if for all $\epsilon&gt;0$, its $\epsilon$-stable set and $\epsilon$-unstable set both intersect the set $\Omega_{NF}$ of non-wandering vectors whose orbit does not bound a flat strip. We show that every ergodic probability measure supported on $\mathcal{R}_w$ can be approximated by Dirac measures supported on periodic orbits in $\Omega_{NF}$. As a consequence, ergodicity is a generic property in the space of invariant measures supported on $\mathcal{R}_w$. We illustrate our findings using a famous example of rank-one manifold attributed to Heintze and Gromov, demonstrating that in this setting the inclusion $\Omega_{NF} \subset \mathcal{R}_w$ is proper and $\mathcal{R}_w$ is the maximal subset of the unit-tangent bundle satisfying the density property stated above. Finally, as a consequence of our main result, we describe the topology of the closure of the set of ergodic probability measures and provide a complete decomposition of the space of finite invariant measures on the unit-tangent bundle of the Heintze-Gromov manifold.</description>
