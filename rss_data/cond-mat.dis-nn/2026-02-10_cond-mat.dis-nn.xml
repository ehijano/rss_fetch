      <title>Limitations of SVD-Based Diagnostics for Non-Hermitian Many-Body Localization with Time-Reversal Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Singular value decomposition (SVD) has been used to construct Hermitian-like diagnostics for non-Hermitian many-body systems, but its reliability for identifying many-body localization (MBL) transitions -- particularly in time-reversal-symmetry (TRS) preserving settings -- remains unclear. Here we benchmark SVD-based diagnostics against exact diagonalization (ED) in TRS-preserving non-Hermitian hard-core-boson chains with nonreciprocal hopping, considering three representative potentials: a quasiperiodic potential, random disorder, and a Stark potential. We compare spectral statistics, half-chain entanglement entropy, inverse participation ratio, and spectral form factors. For the quasiperiodic and random-disorder models, ED yields mutually consistent transition estimates, whereas SVD systematically shifts the inferred critical disorder strength to larger values and can lead to different phase assignments. In contrast, for the clean Stark model ED and SVD locate a consistent critical tilt. Our results show that while SVD-based diagnostics capture qualitative trends, they are not generically reliable for quantitatively locating the MBL transition in TRS-preserving non-Hermitian many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Continuum model for the terahertz dielectric response of glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Boson peak dynamics in glasses produce a robust crossover in the terahertz (THz) dielectric response that standard Debye or Lorentz models do not capture. We develop a continuum description of this THz response, coupling an infrared-effective charge fluctuation spectrum to a frequency-dependent shear modulus, and apply it to glycerol glass. The model reproduces the measured complex dielectric function and the nearly linear infrared light-vibration coupling around the boson peak, and highlights the dominant role of transverse shear dynamics.</description>

      <title>Insensitive nonreciprocal edge breathers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We uncover subtle and previously unexplored phenomena arising from the interplay of nonlinearity and nonreciprocity in topological mechanical metamaterials. We study a nonreciprocal topological Klein-Gordon chain of asymmetrically coupled nonlinear oscillators, which serves as a minimal mass-spring model capturing the features of several active nonreciprocal metamaterials across mechanical, electronic, and acoustic platforms. We demonstrate that continuous families of nonreciprocal edge breathers (NEBs), namely boundary-localized, time-periodic waves, emerge from the linear edge mode as its amplitude increases. Remarkably, despite the absence of chiral or sublattice symmetries, we identify insensitive NEBs whose nonlinear frequency remains fixed to that of the linear edge mode with increasing nonlinearity. Our analysis reveals that the mechanism underlying this insensitivity stems from a competition between mode nonorthogonality and nonlinear interactions, yielding an exponential decay of the NEB nonlinear frequency shift with system size. Crucially, these insensitive NEBs also persist in the strongly nonlinear regime. Our work establishes a novel pathway toward realizing robust nonlinear topological waves in mechanical metamaterials without relying on symmetry-protected nonlinearities.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic modes of a quasiperiodic mobility-edge system in a quantum Otto cycle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate thermodynamic operation of a quasiperiodic lattice with an exact mobility edge, described by the Biddle--Das Sarma model. We use this model as the working medium of a quantum Otto cycle and map its operating mode as a function of the hopping-range parameter $p$, the initial and final potential strengths $V_i$ and $V_f$, and two idealized protocols for the isolated strokes. In a near-adiabatic (state-frozen) protocol, where the density matrix is approximately unchanged during the isolated strokes, the cycle supports only two modes: a \emph{heater} and an \emph{accelerator}. In an adiabatic protocol, where level populations are preserved while the spectrum is deformed, two additional modes appear: a \emph{heat engine} and a \emph{refrigerator}. Our results show that mobility-edge systems can realize multiple thermodynamic functions within a single platform and provide guidance for switching between modes by tuning $p$, $V_i$, and $V_f$.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the Hopfield Model Incorporating the Effects of Unlearning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze a variant of the Hopfield model that incorporates an unlearning mechanism based on spin correlations in the high-temperature regime. In the large system limit where extensively many patterns are stored, we employ the replica method under the replica symmetric ansatz to characterize the model analytically. Our analysis provides a systematic and self-consistent framework that yields order-parameter equations and stability conditions at finite temperatures over a wide range of parameter settings. The resulting theory accurately captures the behavior of the signal-to-noise ratio, the memory capacity, and the criteria for selecting optimal hyperparameters, in agreement with the qualitative findings of Nokura (1996 \textit{J. Phys. A: Math. Gen.} \textbf{29} 3871). Moreover, the theoretical predictions show good agreement with numerical simulations, supporting the conclusion that unlearning enhances memory capacity by suppressing spurious memories.</description>

      <title>Percolation and Threshold-like Behavior in Multiple Sclerosis Progression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study we investigate the Percolation Hypothesis for Multiple Sclerosis Progression. The methodology relies on cross-reference analysis centered around a question: What is the evidence for a Percolation/phase-transition hypothesis in Multiple Sclerosis (MS), especially the idea that the RRMS dynamic balance can abruptly break akin to crossing a percolation threshold into SPMS? We identify theoretical models invoking percolation/critical thresholds, network/connectome studies assessing percolation robustness or threshold-like behavior, clinical markers showing thresholds or early-warning signals, and counter-evidence arguing for gradual/continuum transitions.</description>

      <title>Structural coarse-graining enables noise-robust functional connectivity and reveals hidden inter-subject variability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Functional connectivity estimates are highly sensitive to analysis choices and can be dominated by noise when the number of sampled time points is small relative to network dimensionality. This issue is particularly acute in fMRI, where scan resolution is limited. Because scan duration is constrained by practical factors (e.g., motion and fatigue), many datasets remain statistically underpowered for high-dimensional correlation estimation. We introduce a framework that combines diffusion-based structural coarse-graining with spectral noise filtering to recover statistically reliable functional networks from temporally limited data. The method reduces network dimensionality by grouping regions according to diffusion-defined communication. This produces coarse-grained networks with dimensions compatible with available time points, enabling random matrix filtering of noise-dominated modes. We benchmark three common FC pipelines against our approach. We find that raw-signal correlations are strongly influenced by non-stationary fluctuations that can reduce apparent inter-subject variability under limited sampling conditions. In contrast, our pipeline reveals a broader, multimodal landscape of inter-subject variability. These large-scale organization patterns are largely obscured by standard pipelines. Together, these results provide a practical route to reliable functional networks under realistic sampling constraints. This strategy helps separate noise-driven artifacts from reproducible patterns of human brain variability.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Regimes of Multimodal Diffusion Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.04780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion based generative models have achieved unprecedented fidelity in synthesizing high dimensional data, yet the theoretical mechanisms governing multimodal generation remain poorly understood. Here, we present a theoretical framework for coupled diffusion models, using coupled Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes as a tractable model. By using the nonequilibrium statistical physics of dynamical phase transitions, we demonstrate that multimodal generation is governed by a spectral hierarchy of interaction timescales rather than simultaneous resolution. A key prediction is the ``synchronization gap'', a temporal window during the reverse generative process where distinct eigenmodes stabilize at different rates, providing a theoretical explanation for common desynchronization artifacts. We derive analytical conditions for speciation and collapse times under both symmetric and anisotropic coupling regimes, establishing strict bounds for coupling strength to avoid unstable symmetry breaking. We show that the coupling strength acts as a spectral filter that enforces a tunable temporal hierarchy on generation. We support these predictions through controlled experiments with diffusion models trained on MNIST datasets and exact score samplers. These results motivate time dependent coupling schedules that target mode specific timescales, offering a potential alternative to ad hoc guidance tuning.</description>

      <title>Efficient, Equivariant Predictions of Distributed Charge Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A machine learning (ML) based equivariant neural network for constructing distributed charge models (DCMs) of arbitrary resolution, DCM-net, is presented. DCMs efficiently and accurately model the anisotropy of the molecular electrostatic potential (ESP) and go beyond the point charge representation used in conventional molecular mechanics (MM) energy functions. This is particularly relevant for capturing the conformational dependence of the ESP (internal polarization) and chemically relevant features such as lone pairs or {\sigma}-holes. Across conformational space, the learned charge positions from DCM-net are stable and continuous. Across the QM9 chemical space, two-charge-per-atom models achieve accuracies comparable to fitted atomic dipoles for previously unseen molecules (0.75 (kcal/mol)/e). Three- and four-charge-per-atom models reach accuracies competitive with atomistic multipole expansions up to quadrupole level (0.55 (kcal/mol)/e). Pronounced improvements of the ESP are found around O and F atoms, both of which are known to feature strongly anisotropic fields, and for aromatic systems. Across the QM9 reference data set, molecular dipole moments improve by 0.1 D compared with fitted monopoles. Transfer learning on dipeptides yields a 0.2 (kcal/mol)/e ESP improvement for unseen samples and a two-fold MAE reduction for molecular dipole moments versus fitted monopoles. Overall, DCM-net offers a fast and physically meaningful approach to generating distributed charge models for running pure ML or mixed ML/MM based molecular simulations. level (0.55 (kcal/mol)/e).</description>

      <title>Graph neural network for multitask prediction of rheological and microstructural behavior in suspensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fast prediction of suspension rheology is fundamental for optimizing process efficiency and performance in numerous industrial settings. However, traditional simulations are computationally demanding due to explicit evaluation of contact networks and stress tensors in dense regimes approaching shear thickening and jamming. This study presents a microstructure-informed multitask learning framework based on the graph neural network (GNN) that learns an implicit mapping between particle configurations and emergent microstructural and rheological properties of suspensions. This model simultaneously predicts particle pressure $\Pi$, viscosity $\eta$, and friction coordination $Z_\mu$, in a dynamic steady-state, without explicit knowledge of interparticle forces. Here, semi-dilute to dense suspension systems in 2D were simulated across a wide range of shear stresses $\sigma$, spanning continuous, discontinuous shear thickening, and shear-jamming conditions. The trained models demonstrated high correlation coefficients ($R^2$ = 0.99) with narrow mean absolute error for packing fractions up to $\phi \le \phi_J^\mu$ for all predictive targets. However, prediction scatter increases near jamming conditions, attributed to inherent fluctuations in suspension behavior as the critical packing fraction is approached, yet predictions remain in excellent agreement, closely following the trend of the simulated flow curves across stress evolution. Once trained, the model can infer rheological responses directly from structural topology, avoiding explicit stress evaluation during prediction. The approach yields computationally efficient mesoscale surrogates for accelerated simulation with potential for real-time exploration of particulate suspension behavior.</description>

      <title>Yielding behaviour of glasses under shear deformation at constant pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computer simulations of yielding of glasses under shear have typically been performed under constant volume, strain controlled protocols. However, volumetric effects, such as the dilatancy associated with plastic rearrangements, and the observed reduction of density in shear bands, make it interesting to consider constant pressure shear protocols. We present a computational investigation on the nature of yielding of glasses under constant-pressure conditions, for different pressures. For uniform shear, the stress-strain curves at different pressures differ only by the stress scale. We find stable shear bands under cyclic shear whose steady-state width increases with an increase in external pressure, with density within shear bands being lower compared to the average values reached. Cyclically sheared well annealed glasses yield with a discontinuous dilation at the yield point, whereas the poorly annealed glasses undergo compaction before yielding accompanied by dilation. The external pressure influences the quantitative mechanical response of the glasses, but the qualitative behaviour is similar at different pressures, and remains the same as that of yielding at the constant-volume strain-controlled conditions. We discuss directions along with further investigations may be pursued, based on the results presented.</description>

      <title>Direct Observation of the Three-Dimensional Anderson Transition with Ultracold Atoms in a Disordered Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Anderson localization of particles -- the complete halt of wave transport through multiple scattering and phase coherence -- is a paradigmatic manifestation of quantum interference in disordered media. In three dimensions, the scaling theory predicts a quantum phase transition at a critical energy, the mobility edge, separating localized from diffusive states and underpinning metal-insulator transitions in electronic systems. Despite decades of experimental efforts, a direct observation of this emblematic transition for matter waves has remained elusive. Previous attempts with ultracold atoms were hindered by strong and uncontrolled energy broadening, resulting in indirect, sometimes inaccurate, and model-dependent estimates of the mobility edge. Here we implement a novel energy-resolved scheme to prepare atomic matter waves with a narrow energy distribution and track their expansion dynamics over long timescales. This allows for a direct observation of the three-dimensional Anderson transition in a laser-speckle disordered potential, and for a precise measurement of the mobility edge that is independent of any underlying theoretical modeling. Our measurements show excellent agreement with state-of-the-art numerical predictions over a wide range of disorder strengths, resolving long-standing discrepancies between prior experiments and theory. Beyond the three-dimensional Anderson transition, our approach opens new avenues for quantitative investigations of quantum critical phenomena in spatially disordered systems, including the roles of dimensionality, symmetry class, and interactions.</description>

      <title>Exact Stationary State of a $d$-dimensional Run-and-Tumble Particle in a Harmonic Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive the exact nonequilibrium steady state of a run-and-tumble particle (RTP) in $d$ dimensions confined in an isotropic harmonic trap $V(\mathbf r)=\mu r^{2}/2$, with $r=\|\mathbf r\|$. Rotational invariance reduces the problem to the stationary single-coordinate marginal $p_X(x)$, from which the radial distribution $p_R(r)$ and the full joint stationary density follow by explicit integral transforms. We first focus on a generalized trapped RTP in one dimension, where post-tumble velocities are drawn from an arbitrary distribution $W(v)$. Using a Kesten-type recursion, we represent its stationary position in terms of a stick-breaking (or Dirichlet) process, yielding closed-form expressions for its distribution and its moments. Specializing $W(v)$ to the projected velocity law of an isotropic RTP, we reconstruct $p_R(r)$ and the full joint distribution of all the coordinates in $d=1,2,3$. In $d=1$ and $d=2$, the radial law simplifies to a beta distribution, while in $d=3$, we derive closed-form expressions for $p_R(r)$ and the stationary joint distribution $P(x,y,z)$, which differ from a beta distribution. In all cases, we characterize a persistence-controlled shape transition at the turning surface $r=v_0/\mu$, where $v_0$ is the self-propulsion speed. We further include thermal noise characterized by a diffusion coefficient $D&gt;0$, showing that the stationary law is a Gaussian convolution of the $D=0$ result, which regularizes turning-point singularities and controls the crossover between persistence- and diffusion-dominated regimes as $D \to 0$ and $D \to \infty$ respectively. All analytical predictions are systematically validated against numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Modeling Protein Evolution via Generative Inference From Monte Carlo Chains to Population Genetics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.08641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative models derived from large protein sequence alignments define complex fitness landscapes, but their utility for accurately modeling non-equilibrium evolutionary dynamics remains unclear. In this work, we perform a rigorous comparative analysis of three simulation schemes, designed to mimic evolution in silico by local sampling of the probability distribution defined by a generative model. We compare standard independent Markov Chain Monte Carlo, Monte Carlo on a phylogenetic tree, and a population genetics dynamics, benchmarking their outputs against deep sequencing data from four distinct in vitro evolution experiments. We find that standard Monte Carlo fails to reproduce the correct phylogenetic structure and generates unrealistic, gradual mutational sweeps. Performing Monte Carlo on a tree inferred from data improves phylogenetic fidelity and historical accuracy. The population genetics scheme successfully captures phylogenetic correlations, mutational abundances, and selective sweeps as emergent properties, without the need to infer additional information from data. However, the latter choice come at the price of not sampling the proper generative model distribution at long times. Our findings highlight the crucial role of phylogenetic correlations and finite-population effects in shaping evolutionary trajectories on fitness landscapes. These models therefore provide powerful tools for predicting complex adaptive paths and for reliably extrapolating evolutionary dynamics beyond current experimental limitations.</description>

      <title>Susceptibility for extremely low external fluctuations and critical behaviour of Greenberg-Hastings neuronal model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22629v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the scaling behaviour of the fluctuation susceptibility associated with the average activation in the Greenberg-Hastings neural network model and its relation to microscopic spontaneous activation. We found that, as the spontaneous activation probability tends to zero, a clear finite size scaling behaviour in the susceptibility emerges, characterized by critical exponents which follow already known scaling laws. This shows that the spontaneous activation probability plays the role of an external field conjugated to the order parameter of the dynamical activation transition. The roles of different kinds of activation mechanisms around the different dynamical phase transitions exhibited by the model are characterized numerically and using a mean field approximation.</description>

      <title>Rare Events and Griffiths Phases in Topological Quantum Error Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03325v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The performance of quantum error correcting (QEC) codes are often studied under the assumption of spatio-temporally uniform error rates. On the other hand, experimental implementations almost always produce heterogeneous error rates, in either space or time, as a result of effects such as imperfect fabrication and/or cosmic rays. It is therefore important to understand if and how their presence can affect the performance of QEC in qualitative ways. In this work, we study effects of non-uniform error rates in the representative examples of the 1D repetition code and the 2D toric code, focusing on when they have extended spatio-temporal correlations; these may arise, for instance, from rare events (such as cosmic rays) that temporarily elevate error rates over the entire code patch. These effects can be described in the corresponding statistical mechanics models for decoding, where long-range correlations in the error rates lead to extended rare regions of weaker coupling. For the 1D repetition code where the rare regions are linear, we find two distinct decodable phases: a conventional ordered phase in which logical failure rates decay exponentially with the code distance, and a rare-region dominated Griffiths phase in which failure rates are parametrically larger and decay as a stretched exponential. In particular, the latter phase is present when the error rates in the rare regions are above the bulk threshold. For the 2D toric code where the rare regions are planar, we find no decodable Griffiths phase: rare events which boost error rates above the bulk threshold lead to an asymptotic loss of threshold and failure to decode. Unpacking the failure mechanism implies that techniques for suppressing extended sequences of repeated rare events (which, without intervention, will be statistically present with high probability) will be crucial for QEC with the toric code.</description>

      <title>Two failure modes of deep transformers and how to avoid them: a unified theory of signal propagation at initialisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24333v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Finding the right initialisation for neural networks is crucial to ensure smooth training and good performance. In transformers, the wrong initialisation can lead to one of two failure modes of self-attention layers: rank collapse, where all tokens collapse into similar representations, and entropy collapse, where highly concentrated attention scores lead to training instability. While previous work has studied different scaling regimes for transformers, an asymptotically exact, down-to-the constant prescription for how to initialise transformers has so far been lacking. Here, we provide an analytical theory of signal propagation through deep transformers with self-attention, layer normalisation, skip connections and MLP. Our theory yields a simple algorithm to compute trainability diagrams that identify the correct choice of initialisation hyper-parameters for a given architecture. We overcome the key challenge, an exact treatment of the self-attention layer, by establishing a formal parallel with the Random Energy Model from statistical physics. We also analyse gradients in the backward path and determine the regime where gradients vanish at initialisation. We demonstrate the versatility of our framework through three case studies. Our theoretical framework gives a unified perspective on the two failure modes of self-attention and gives quantitative predictions on the scale of both weights and residual connections that guarantee smooth training.</description>

      <title>Electron-phonon couplings in polymorphous crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09673v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Positional polymorphism in solids refers to locally disordered unit cells that, on average, reproduce the high-symmetry structures observed in diffraction experiments. Standard theories of electron-phonon interactions fail to describe the temperature-dependent electronic structure of such polymorphous systems. Hybrid halide perovskites are a prime example, where configurational entropy from both polymorphism and molecular disorder plays a central role. Here we generalize the special displacement method to polymorphous crystals, providing an efficient ab initio framework for electron-phonon couplings without resorting to molecular dynamics. We resolve long-standing discrepancies in hybrid halide perovskite physics, including temperature-dependent anharmonic phonons and band gaps. Our approach provides a practical route to link local disorder, configurational entropy, and electron-phonon interactions, with applicability across diverse material classes, from optoelectronics and ferroelectrics to thermoelectrics.</description>

      <title>Short-term plasticity recalls forgotten memories through a trampoline mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22848v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze continuous Hopfield associative memories augmented by additional, rapid short-term associative synaptic plasticity. Through the cavity method, we determine the boundary between the retrieval and forgetting, or spin-glass phase, of the network as a function of the fraction of stored memories and the neuronal gain. We find that short-term synaptic plasticity yields marginal improvements in critical memory capacity. However, through dynamical mean field theory, backed by extensive numerical simulations, we find that short-term synaptic plasticity has a dramatic impact on memory retrieval above the critical capacity. When short-term synaptic plasticity is turned on, the combined neuronal and synaptic dynamics descends a high-dimensional energy landscape over both neurons and synapses. The energy landscape over neurons alone is thus dynamic, and is lowered in the vicinity of recent neuronal patterns visited by the network, just like the surface of a trampoline is lowered in the vicinity of regions recently visited by a heavy ball. This trampoline-like reactivity of the neuronal energy landscape to short-term plasticity in synapses can lead to the recall of stored memories that would otherwise have been forgotten. This occurs because the dynamics without short-term plasticity transiently moves towards a stored memory before departing away from it. Thus short-term plasticity, operating during the transient, lowers the energy in the vicinity of the stored memory, eventually trapping the combined neuronal and synaptic dynamics at a fixed point close to the stored memory. In this manner, short-term plasticity enables the recall of memories that would otherwise be forgotten, by trapping transients that would otherwise escape. We furthermore find an optimal time constant for short-term synaptic plasticity, matched to the transient dynamics, to empower recall of forgotten memories.</description>

      <title>Graph-Theoretic Analysis of Phase Optimization Complexity in Variational Wave Functions for Heisenberg Antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04943v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite extensive study, the phase structure of the wavefunctions in frustrated Heisenberg antiferromagnets (HAF) is not yet systematically characterized. In this work, we represent the Hilbert space of an HAF as a weighted graph, which we term the Hilbert graph (HG), whose vertices are spin configurations and whose edges are generated by off-diagonal spin-flip terms of the Heisenberg Hamiltonian, with weights set by products of wavefunction amplitudes. Holding the amplitudes fixed and restricting phases to $\mathbb{Z}_2$ values, the phase-dependent variational energy can be recast as a classical Ising antiferromagnet on the HG, so that phase reconstruction of the ground state reduces to a weighted Max-Cut instance. This shows that phase reconstruction HAF is worst-case NP-hard and provides a direct link between wavefunction sign structure and combinatorial optimization.</description>

      <title>Deep networks learn to parse uniform-depth context-free languages from local statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06065v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding how the structure of language can be learned from sentences alone is a central question in both cognitive science and machine learning. Studies of the internal representations of Large Language Models (LLMs) support their ability to parse text when predicting the next word, while representing semantic notions independently of surface form. Yet, which data statistics make these feats possible, and how much data is required, remain largely unknown. Probabilistic context-free grammars (PCFGs) provide a tractable testbed for studying these questions. However, prior work has focused either on the post-hoc characterization of the parsing-like algorithms used by trained networks; or on the learnability of PCFGs with fixed syntax, where parsing is unnecessary. Here, we (i) introduce a tunable class of PCFGs in which both the degree of ambiguity and the correlation structure across scales can be controlled; (ii) provide a learning mechanism -- an inference algorithm inspired by the structure of deep convolutional networks -- that links learnability and sample complexity to specific language statistics; and (iii) validate our predictions empirically across deep convolutional and transformer-based architectures. Overall, we propose a unifying framework where correlations at different scales lift local ambiguities, enabling the emergence of hierarchical representations of the data.</description>

      <title>Elastoplastic Modelling of Cyclic Shear Deformation of Amorphous Solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06174v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop an energy-landscape based elasto-plastic model to understand the behaviour of amorphous solids under uniform and cyclic shear. Amorphous solids are modeled as being composed of mesoscopic sub-volumes, each of which may occupy states - termed mesostates -- drawn from a specified distribution. The energies of the mesostates under stress free conditions determine their stability range with respect to applied strain, and their plastic strain, at which they are stress free, forms an important additional property. Under applied global strain, mesostates that reach their stability limits transition to other permissible mesostates. Barring such transitions, which encompass plastic deformations that the solid may undergo, mesostates are treated as exhibiting linear elastic behavior, and the interactions between mesoscopic blocks are treated using the finite element method. The model reproduces known phenomena under uniform and cyclic shear, such as the brittle-to-ductile crossover with annealing and the Bauschinger effect for uniform shear, qualitative features of the yielding diagram under cyclic shear including the change in yielding behaviour with the degree of annealing, across a `threshold level', and dynamic phenomena such as the divergence of failure times on approach to the yield point and the non-monotonic evolution of the local yield rate. In addition to these results, we discuss the dependence of the observed behaviour on model choices, and open questions highlighted by our work.</description>
