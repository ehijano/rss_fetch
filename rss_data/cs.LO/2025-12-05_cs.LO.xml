      <title>A Rocq Formalization of Monomial and Graded Orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Even if binary relations and orders are a common formalization topic, we need to formalize specific orders (namely monomial and graded) in the process of formalizing in Rocq the finite element method. This article is therefore definitions, operators, and proofs of properties about relations and orders, thus providing a comprehensive Rocq library. We especially focus on monomial orders, that are total orders compatible with the monoid operation. More than its definition and proved properties, we define several of them, among them the lexicographic and grevlex orders. For the sake of genericity, we formalize the grading of an order, a high-level operator that transforms a binary relation into another one, and we prove that grading an order preserves many of its properties, such as the monomial order property. This leads us to the definition and properties of four different graded orders, with very factorized proofs. We therefore provide a comprehensive and user-friendly library in Rocq about orders, including monomial and graded orders, that contains more than 700 lemmas.</description>

      <title>Parametric disjunctive timed networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider distributed systems with an arbitrary number of processes, modelled by timed automata that communicate through location guards: a process can take a guarded transition if at least one other process is in a given location. In this work, we introduce parametric disjunctive timed networks, where each timed automaton may contain timing parameters, i.e. unknown constants. We investigate two problems: deciding the emptiness of the set of parameter valuations for which
  1) a given location is reachable for at least one process (local property), and
  2) a global state is reachable where all processes are in a given location (global property).
  Our main positive result is that the first problem is decidable for networks of processes with a single clock and without invariants; this result holds for arbitrarily many timing parameters -- a setting with few known decidability results. However, it becomes undecidable when invariants are allowed, or when considering global properties, even for systems with a single parameter. This highlights the significant expressive power of invariants in these networks. Additionally, we exhibit further decidable subclasses by restraining the syntax of guards and invariants.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present QReach, the first reachability analysis tool for quantum Markov chains based on decision diagrams CFLOBDD (presented at CAV 2023). QReach provides a novel framework for finding reachable subspaces, as well as a series of model-checking subprocedures like image computation. Experiments indicate its practicality in verification of quantum circuits and algorithms. QReach is expected to play a central role in future quantum model checkers.</description>

      <title>Maehara Interpolation in Extensions of R-mingle</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that there are exactly five quasivarieties of Sugihara algebras with the amalgamation property, and that all of these have the relative congruence extension property. As a consequence, we obtain that the amalgamation property and transferable injections property coincide for arbitrary quasivarieties of Sugihara algebras. These results provide a complete description of arbitrary (not merely axiomatic) extensions of the logic R-mingle that have the Maehara interpolation property, and further demonstrates that the Robinson property and Maehara interpolation property coincide for arbitrary extensions of R-mingle. Further, we show that the question of whether a given finitely based extension of R-mingle has the Maehara interpolation property is decidable.</description>

      <title>Logic-Driven Cybersecurity: A Novel Framework for System Log Anomaly Detection using Answer Set Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study explores the application of Answer Set Programming (ASP) for detecting anomalies in system logs, addressing the challenges posed by evolving cyber threats. We propose a novel framework that leverages ASP's declarative nature and logical reasoning capabilities to encode complex security rules as logical predicates. Our ASP-based system was applied to a real-world Linux system log dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in identifying various anomalies such as potential brute-force attacks, privilege escalations, frequent network connections from specific IPs, and various system-level issues. Key findings highlight ASP's strengths in handling structured log data, rule flexibility, and event correlation. The approach shows promise in providing explainable alerts from real-world data. This research contributes to computer forensics by demonstrating a logic-based paradigm for log analysis on a practical dataset, opening avenues for more nuanced and adaptive cyber intelligence systems.</description>

      <title>Coinductive proof search for polarized logic with applications to full intuitionistic propositional logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.16161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2007.16161v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The approach to proof search dubbed "coinductive proof search" (CoIPS), and previously developed by the authors for implicational intuitionistic logic, is in this paper extended to LJP, a focused sequent-calculus presentation of polarized intuitionistic logic, including an array of positive and negative connectives. As before, this includes developing a coinductive description of the search space generated by a sequent, an equivalent inductive syntax describing the same space, and decision procedures for inhabitation problems in the form of predicates defined by recursion on the inductive syntax. Inhabitation is taken in a generalized sense, because we also consider when a sequent has a solution, that is a (possibly infinite) run of bottom-up proof search which never fails to apply another inference rule. We provide a very general scheme whose instances are decision problems concerning solutions in LJP having algorithms through the inductive syntax. Polarized logic and LJP can be used as a platform from which proof search for other logics is understood. We illustrate this for the proof systems LJT and LJQ for intuitionistic logic, both equipped with all the connectives. For that we work out respectively a negative and a positive interpretation into LJP, which map formulas of the source logic into formulas in LJP of the said polarity; and this even at the level of the coinductive versions of the three involved proof systems. The interpretations are proved to be, not only faithful, but actually full embeddings, establishing a bijection between the solutions (resp. proofs) of a sequent and the solutions (resp. proofs) of its polarized interpretation. This allows the inheritance to the source systems of the decidability and other results previously obtained for LJP, thereby vastly generalizing the previous results of CoIPS, which were confined to LJT and implicational intuitionistic logic.</description>

      <title>On the Decidability of Monadic Theories of Arithmetic Predicates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07953v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the decidability of the monadic second-order (MSO) theory of the structure $\langle \mathbb{N};&lt;,P_1, \ldots,P_d \rangle$, for various unary predicates $P_1,\ldots,P_d \subseteq \mathbb{N}$. We focus in particular on 'arithmetic' predicates arising in the study of linear recurrence sequences, such as fixed-base powers $k^{\mathbf{N}} = \{k^n : n \in \mathbb{N}\}$, $k$-th powers $\mathbf{N}^k = \{n^k : n \in \mathbb{N}\}$, and the set of terms of the Fibonacci sequence $\mathsf{Fib} = \{0,1,2,3,5,8,13,\ldots\}$ (and similarly for other linear recurrence sequences having a single, non-repeated, dominant characteristic root). We obtain several new unconditional and conditional decidability results, a select sample of which are the following:
  $\bullet$ The MSO theory of $\langle \mathbb{N};&lt;, 2^{\mathbf{N}}, \mathsf{Fib} \rangle$ is decidable;
  $\bullet$ The MSO theory of $\langle \mathbb{N};&lt;, 2^{\mathbf{N}}, 3^{\mathbf{N}}, 6^{\mathbf{N}} \rangle$ is decidable;
  $\bullet$ The MSO theory of $\langle \mathbb{N};&lt;, 2^{\mathbf{N}}, 3^{\mathbf{N}}, 5^{\mathbf{N}} \rangle$ is decidable assuming Schanuel's conjecture;
  $\bullet$ The MSO theory of $\langle \mathbb{N};&lt;, 4^{\mathbf{N}}, \mathbf{N}^2 \rangle$ is decidable;
  $\bullet$ The MSO theory of $\langle \mathbb{N};&lt;, 2^{\mathbf{N}}, \mathbf{N}^2 \rangle$ is Turing-equivalent to the MSO theory of $\langle \mathbb{N};&lt;,S \rangle$, where $S$ is the predicate corresponding to the binary expansion of $\sqrt{2}$. (As the binary expansion of $\sqrt{2}$ is widely believed to be normal, the corresponding MSO theory is in turn expected to be decidable.)
  These results are obtained by exploiting and combining techniques from dynamical systems, number theory, and automata theory.</description>

      <title>Data-Aware Hybrid Tableaux</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12090v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Labelled tableaux have been a traditional approach to define satisfiability checking procedures for Modal Logics. In many cases, they can also be used to obtain tight complexity bounds and lead to efficient implementations of reasoning tools. More recently, it has been shown that the expressive power provided by the operators characterizing Hybrid Logics (nominals and satisfiability modalities) can be used to internalize labels, leading to well-behaved inference procedures for fairly expressive logics. The resulting procedures are attractive because they do not use external mechanisms outside the language of the logic at hand, and have good logical and computational properties.

Many tableau systems based on Hybrid Logic have been investigated, with more recent efforts concentrating on Modal Logics that support data comparison operators. Here, we introduce an internalized tableau calculus for XPath, arguably one of the most prominent approaches for querying semistructured data. More precisely, we define data-aware tableaux for XPath featuring data comparison operators and enriched with nominals and the satisfiability modalities from Hybrid Logic. We prove that the calculus is sound, complete and terminating. Moreover, we show that tableaux can be explored in polynomial space, therefore establishing that the satisfiability problem for the logic is PSpace-complete. Finally, we explore different extensions of the calculus, in particular how to handle data trees and other frame classes.</description>

      <title>Separating the Wheat from the Chaff: Understanding (In-)Completeness of Proof Mechanisms for Separation Logic with Inductive Definitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20193v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For over two decades Separation Logic has been arguably the most popular framework for reasoning about heap-manipulating programs, as well as reasoning about shared resources and permissions. Separation Logic is often extended to include inductively-defined predicates, interpreted as least fixpoints, forming Separation Logic with Inductive Definitions (SLID). Many theoretical and practical advances have been made in developing automated proof mechanisms for SLID, but these mechanisms are imperfect, and a deeper understanding of their failures is desired. As expressive as Separation Logic is, it is not surprising that it is incomplete, and in fact, it contains several sources of incompleteness that defy automated reasoning.
  In this paper we study these sources of incompleteness and how they relate to failures of proof mechanisms. We place SLID within a larger logic, that we call Weak Separation Logic (WSL). We prove that unlike SLID, WSL is complete for a non-trivial fragment of quantified entailments with background theories and inductive definitions, via a reduction to first-order logic (FOL). Moreover, we show that the ubiquitous fold/unfold proof mechanism is sound and complete for theory-free, quantifier-free WSL entailments with inductive definitions. Through this, we understand proof failures as stemming from nonstandard models present in WSL, but not allowed in SLID. These rogue models are typically infinite, and we use the formalism of symbolic structures to represent and automatically find them.
  We present a prototype tool that implements the FOL encoding of WSL and test it on an existing benchmark, which contains over 700 quantified entailment problems with inductive definitions. Our tool is able to find counter-models to many of the examples, and we provide a partial taxonomy of the rogue models, shedding some light on real-world proof failures.</description>

      <title>Consistency-based Abductive Reasoning over Perceptual Errors of Multiple Pre-trained Models in Novel Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19361v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The deployment of pre-trained perception models in novel environments often leads to performance degradation due to distributional shifts. Although recent artificial intelligence approaches for metacognition use logical rules to characterize and filter model errors, improving precision often comes at the cost of reduced recall. This paper addresses the hypothesis that leveraging multiple pre-trained models can mitigate this recall reduction. We formulate the challenge of identifying and managing conflicting predictions from various models as a consistency-based abduction problem, building on the idea of abductive learning (ABL) but applying it to test-time instead of training. The input predictions and the learned error detection rules derived from each model are encoded in a logic program. We then seek an abductive explanation--a subset of model predictions--that maximizes prediction coverage while ensuring the rate of logical inconsistencies (derived from domain constraints) remains below a specified threshold. We propose two algorithms for this knowledge representation task: an exact method based on Integer Programming (IP) and an efficient Heuristic Search (HS). Through extensive experiments on a simulated aerial imagery dataset featuring controlled, complex distributional shifts, we demonstrate that our abduction-based framework outperforms individual models and standard ensemble baselines, achieving, for instance, average relative improvements of approximately 13.6\% in F1-score and 16.6\% in accuracy across 15 diverse test datasets when compared to the best individual model. Our results validate the use of consistency-based abduction as an effective mechanism to robustly integrate knowledge from multiple imperfect models in challenging, novel scenarios.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Autoformalization Robustness via Semantically Similar Paraphrasing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12784v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently emerged as powerful tools for autoformalization. Despite their impressive performance, these models can still struggle to produce grounded and verifiable formalizations. Recent work in text-to-SQL, has revealed that LLMs can be sensitive to paraphrased natural language (NL) inputs, even when high degrees of semantic fidelity are preserved (Safarzadeh, Oroojlooyjadid, and Roth 2025). In this paper, we investigate this claim in the autoformalization domain. Specifically, we evaluate the robustness of LLMs generating formal proofs with semantically similar paraphrased NL statements by measuring semantic and compilation validity. Using the formal benchmarks MiniF2F (Zheng, Han, and Polu 2021) and Lean 4 version of ProofNet (Xin et al. 2024), and two modern LLMs, we generate paraphrased natural language statements and cross-evaluate these statements across both models. The results of this paper reveal performance variability across paraphrased inputs, demonstrating that minor shifts in NL statements can significantly impact model outputs.</description>
