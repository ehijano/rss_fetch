      <title>Obstacle-tuned transition from chaotic to coherent vortex flows and odd diffusion in chiral active fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interaction of a suspension of rotating colloids with a periodically patterned structure is here investigated by means of continuum theoretical predictions and hydrodynamic simulations. Close to the obstacle surface, rotors circulate opposite to their inherent direction of rotation as a result of unidirectional rotational stresses, which is in agreement with a prediction of the generalised Stokes equation. The resulting stationary background flow significantly affects the system dynamics and coexists with the intrinsic active turbulent behaviour. The relative importance of either of the two contributions can be controlled with the rotor density and the obstacle size, such that the system is either dominated by stationary vortices pinned to the obstacles or vivid active turbulent dynamics. While momentum dissipation into an underlying frictional substrate damps the related flows, small values of the friction can enhance the vortex flow around an obstacle. The colloids' diffusive dynamics are governed by odd diffusive fluxes guiding the colloids around the excluded volume introduced by obstacles, such that enhanced effective diffusive transport is obtained at finite obstruction. Our results pave the way to systematically address how confinement can be employed in order to control or harness the dynamics of colloidal chiral active turbulence and how the interplay of emerging edge currents and active turbulent dynamics at varying densities can be systematically determined.</description>

      <title>Multiple crossover in the decay of metastable volume fraction of a Blume-Capel ferromagnetic needle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transient behaviours of a Blume-Capel ferromagnetic needle have been studied extensively by Monte-Carlo simulation. The needle has an elongated length in one direction compared to its cross-section. In the context of transient behaviour, we have captured the decay of the metastable state and the magnetic relaxation behaviours in our study. The dependence of metastable behaviour with anisotropy (single site) has been studied. \emph{Interestingly, we have observed multiple (different values of $n$ in different time domains) crossover in the decay of metastable volume fraction (obeying Avrami's law $\beta \sim {\rm exp}(-Kt^n)$). We have identified the crossover time, and the values of $n$ are estimated precisely.} The mean (magnetic) reversal time has been studied as a function of anisotropy. It is observed to be almost independent of anisotropy for its negative value; however, it is found to decrease exponentially with positive anisotropy. The exponential relaxation behaviour (in the corresponding paramagnetic phase) is observed. The range of the relaxation time is observed to decrease as the temperature increases.</description>

      <title>Flow Matching at Scale: A Machine Learning Framework for Efficient Large-Size Sampling of Many-Body Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a machine learning framework based on Flow Matching to overcome the scaling limitations of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. We demonstrate its capability in the 2D XY model, where a single network, trained only on configurations from a small ($32\times 32$) lattice at sparse temperature points, generates reliable samples for a significantly larger system ($128\times 128$) across a continuous temperature range without retraining. The generated configurations show strong agreement with key thermodynamic observables and correctly capture the signatures of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition. This dual generalization is enabled by the Flow Matching framework, which allows us to learn a continuous, temperature-conditioned mapping. At the same time, the inductive biases of the underlying CNN architecture ensure that the learned local physical rules are scale-invariant. This "train-small, generate-large" capability establishes a new paradigm for efficiently studying critical phenomena, offering a significant computational advantage for exploring the thermodynamic limit. The method can be directly applied to other classical or quantum many-body systems described by continuous fields on a lattice.</description>

      <title>Analytical Theory of Chiral Active Particle Transport in a Fluctuating Density Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a closed-form analytical theory for the transport of a chiral active Brownian particle (cABP) in three dimensions, moving through a fluctuating local density field that coarse-grains steric and dynamical interactions in a dense active medium. The density field is modeled as an Ornstein--Uhlenbeck process with finite correlation time $\tau$ and fluctuation strength $\sigma_\rho^2$, capturing both spatial variations and temporal memory. Within this framework, we derive exact expressions for the mean-squared displacement (MSD) and time-dependent diffusivity, showing how chirality and density coupling renormalize orientational persistence and generate dynamical crossovers. The theory predicts: (i) anomalously high initial diffusivity in denser regions, arising from a transient drift driven by local swim-pressure gradients; (ii) a finite crossover time $t_c$ for homogenizing density inhomogeneities, with steady-state diffusivity retaining memory of the initial environment; (iii) a non-monotonic $t_c(\Omega)$ with a global minimum at intermediate chirality, and a three-regime suppression of $D_\infty(\Omega)$ consistent with clustered phases in simulations; and (iv) a resonance-like peak in early-time oscillatory transport at an optimal chirality $\Omega^*$. The framework reproduces known scaling of $D_\infty$ with activity and chirality, while uncovering new memory effects and chirality-controlled optimal transport, offering predictive insight for biological circle swimmers and active metamaterials.</description>

      <title>Casimir versus Helmholtz fluctuation induced force in { the Nagle}-Kardar model: Exact results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When used to describe \textit{finite} systems the {conjugate} statistical-mechanical ensembles are \textit{not} equivalent. This has physical implications for the behavior of the fluctuation induced forces pertinent to the different ensembles. Here, {we study the Nagle-Kardar model within the grand-canonical ensemble (GCE) and the canonical ensemble (CE) (with conserved total magnetization) for periodic boundary conditions (PBC)}. {We focus on two fluctuation-induce forces: the Casimir force (CF) in the GCE and the Helmholtz force (HF) in the CE}. In the infinite system limit the model exhibits a critical line, which ends at a tricritical point. Unexpectedly, the critical Casimir force (CCF) is \textit{repulsive} near the critical line and tricritical point, decaying rapidly upon departure from those two regions and becoming \textit{attractive}. This violates the widely-accepted ``boundary condition rule,'' which presumes that the CCF is attractive for equivalent boundary conditions (BC) and repulsive for conflicting BC. For the HF we find that it also changes sign as a function of temperature and the magnetization. We conclude, that CCF and HF have a behavior quite different from each other as a function of the tunable parameters (temperature, magnetic field, or magnetization) of the model. This dependence allows {for the control of the} \textit{sign} of these forces, as well as their magnitude.</description>

      <title>From Near-Integrable to Far-from-Integrable: A Unified Picture of Thermalization and Heat Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Whether and how a system approaches equilibrium is central in nonequilibrium statistical physics, crucial to understanding thermalization and transport. Bogoliubov's three-stage (initial, kinetic, and hydrodynamic) evolution hypothesis offers a qualitative framework, but quantitative progress has focused on near-integrable systems like dilute gases. In this work, we investigate the relaxation dynamics of a one-dimensional diatomic hard-point (DHP) gas, presenting a phase diagram that characterizes relaxation behavior across the full parameter space, from near-integrable to far-from-integrable regimes. We analyze thermalization (local energy relaxation in nonequilibrium states) and identify three universal dynamical regimes: (i) In the near-integrable regime, kinetic processes dominate, local energy relaxation decays exponentially, and the thermalization time $\tau$ scales as $\tau \propto \delta^{-2}$. (ii) In the far-from-integrable regime, hydrodynamic effects dominate, energy relaxation decays power-law, and thermalization time scales linearly with system size $N$. (iii) In the intermediate regime, the Bogoliubov phase emerges, characterized by the transition from kinetic to hydrodynamic relaxation. The phase diagram also shows that hydrodynamic behavior can emerge in small systems when sufficiently far from the integrable regime, challenging the view that such effects occur only in large systems. In the thermodynamic limit, the system's relaxation depends on the order in which the limits ($N \to \infty$ or $\delta \to 0$) are taken. We then analyze heat transport (decay of heat-current fluctuations in equilibrium), demonstrating its consistency with thermalization, leading to a unified theoretical description of thermalization and transport. Our approach provides a pathway for studying relaxation dynamics in many-body systems, including quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Landscape of Non-Equilibrium Memories with Neural Cellular Automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the landscape of many-body memories: families of local non-equilibrium dynamics that retain information about their initial conditions for thermodynamically long time scales, even in the presence of arbitrary perturbations. In two dimensions, the only well-studied memory is Toom's rule. Using a combination of rigorous proofs and machine learning methods, we show that the landscape of 2D memories is in fact quite vast. We discover memories that correct errors in ways qualitatively distinct from Toom's rule, have ordered phases stabilized by fluctuations, and preserve information only in the presence of noise. Taken together, our results show that physical systems can perform robust information storage in many distinct ways, and demonstrate that the physics of many-body memories is richer than previously realized. Interactive visualizations of the dynamics studied in this work are available at https://memorynca.github.io/2D.</description>

      <title>The beginning of the endpoint bootstrap for conformal line defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A challenge in the study of conformal field theory (CFT) is to characterize the possible defects in specific bulk CFTs. Given the success of numerical bootstrap techniques applied to the characterization of bulk CFTs, it is desirable to develop similar tools to study conformal defects. In this work, we successfully demonstrate this possibility for endable conformal line defects. We achieve this by incorporating the endpoints of a conformal line defect into the numerical four-point bootstrap and exploit novel crossing symmetry relations that mix bulk and defect CFT data in a way that further possesses positivity, so that rigorous numerical bootstrap techniques are applicable. We implement this approach for the pinning field line defect of the $3d$ Ising CFT, obtaining estimates of its defect CFT data that agree well with other recent estimates, particularly those obtained via the fuzzy sphere regularization. An interesting consequence of our bounds is nearly rigorous evidence that the $\mathbb Z_2$-symmetric defect exhibiting long range order obtained as a direct sum of two conjugate pinning field defects is unstable to domain wall proliferation.</description>

      <title>Intermediate-temperature specific heat of solids and the rationale behind the Maier-Kelley empirical formula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The heat capacity of solids at intermediate-to-high temperatures is of fundamental importance to several fields ranging from geology to material science. It depends on a variety of factors, with anharmonicity and, ultimately, melting playing a pivotal role. In this work we develop a first-principles model from an analytically tractable semi-harmonic oscillator Hamiltonian. The resulting specific heat expression depends not only on the Einstein temperature of the material but also on other physical parameters. We compare our predictions with experimental data for copper, aluminum, lead, silicon, and germanium with rather satisfactory results, especially considering that there are no fitting parameters in our theory. We finish this work by showing that our results formally justify the otherwise purely empirical formula by Maier and Kelley, also providing its coefficients in terms of elementary physical quantities.</description>

      <title>Quantum Monte Carlo calculations in the nuclear shell model by the complex Langevin method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nuclear shell model is known to describe the properties of various nuclei extremely well. However, the auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo calculations cannot be applied to it with general interactions due to the sign problem. The model has therefore been investigated primarily by variational methods, where the accuracy of the results depends crucially on the ansatz for the wave function. Here we perform the auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo calculations in the case of small systems at finite temperature using the complex Langevin method (CLM), which has been successfully applied to various interesting systems with the sign problem over the decade. In particular, we show the existence of a parameter region in which the validity criterion for the CLM is satisfied and the expectation value of the energy obtained by exact diagonalization is correctly reproduced. Thus the CLM can be a complementary approach to the variational method for large systems.</description>

      <title>Non-Commutative weak measurements: Entanglement, Symmetry Breaking, and the Role of Readout</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The preparation of long-range entangled (LRE) states via quantum measurements is a promising strategy, yet its stability against realistic, non-commuting measurement noise remains a critical open question. Here, we systematically investigate the rich phase structure emerging from a minimal model of competing, non-commuting weak measurements: nearest-neighbor Ising ($Z_iZ_j$) and single-qubit transverse ($X_i$) operators. We analyze three experimentally relevant scenarios based on which measurement outcomes are read out: complete readout, no readout, and partial readout. Using a replica mean-field theory for higher dimensions, complemented by numerical simulations in one dimension, we derive the complete finite-time and stationary phase diagrams. Our analysis reveals a striking dependence on the readout protocol. Complete readout yields a direct transition between a short-range entangled (SRE) phase and a pure LRE phase. No readout (pure decoherence) precludes entanglement but exhibits a strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking (SWSSB) transition into a classically ordered mixed state. Most intriguingly, partial readout interpolates between these limits, featuring a mixed-state phase transition where the system can become trapped in the SWSSB phase or, for weaker non-commutativity, undergo successive symmetry breaking to reach a mixed LRE phase. A novel technical contribution is the use of a channel-fidelity-based partition function that allows us to simultaneously characterize both entanglement and SWSSB order, revealing a deep interplay between them in the replica limit. These results provide a cohesive picture for understanding measurement phase transitions, SWSSB, and mixed-state phase transitions, offering crucial insights for designing robust state preparation protocols on noisy quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Quantum-enhanced parameter estimation in continuously monitored boundary time crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate quantum-enhanced parameter estimation in boundary time crystals (BTCs) via continuous monitoring. By analytically deriving the global quantum Fisher information rate, we show that in the time-crystal phase the ultimate precision exhibits a cubic scaling with the system size, $f_{\mathrm{global}}\sim N^3$, surpassing both the sensitivity at the critical point and the standard quantum limit (SQL). We then numerically demonstrate that this bound can be attained already at finite $N$ using experimentally accessible strategies: continuous photodetection and, in particular, continuous homodyne detection. Moving towards realistic implementations, we derive the fundamental precision limits for inefficient detection ($\eta&lt;1$). While inefficiencies asymptotically restore SQL scaling, a constant-factor quantum advantage remains possible, diverging as $\eta\!\to\!1$. Numerical simulations show that homodyne detection outperforms photodetection in approaching the ultimate bound and consistently provides a collective advantage over independent single-qubit protocols, which grows with $N$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive detailed and intergral fluctuation relations as well as a Thermodynamic Uncertainty Relation constraining the exchange statistics of an arbitrary number of non-commuting conserved quantities among two quantum systems in transport setups arbitrary far from equilibrium. These universal relations, valid without the need of any efficacy parameter, extend the well-known heat exchange fluctuation theorems for energy and particle transport to the case of non-Abelian quantum transport, where the non-commutativity of the charges allows bending standard thermodynamic rules. In particular, we show that this can lead to apparent violations of the second law of thermodynamics, it enhances precision in the current fluctuations, and it allows for the inversion of all currents against their affinity biases.</description>

      <title>Multifractality in high-dimensional graphs induced by correlated radial disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a class of models containing robust and analytically demonstrable multifractality induced by disorder correlations. Specifically, we investigate the statistics of eigenstates of disordered tight-binding models on two classes of rooted, high-dimensional graphs -- trees and hypercubes -- with a form of strong disorder correlations we term `radial disorder'. In this model, site energies on all sites equidistant from a chosen root are identical, while those at different distances are independent random variables (or their analogue for a deterministic but incommensurate potential, a case of which is also considered). Analytical arguments, supplemented by numerical results, are used to establish that this setting hosts robust and unusual multifractal states. The distribution of multifractality, as encoded in the inverse participation ratios (IPRs), is shown to be exceptionally broad. This leads to a qualitative difference in scaling with system size between the mean and typical IPRs, with the latter the appropriate quantity to characterise the multifractality. The existence of this multifractality is shown to be underpinned by an emergent fragmentation of the graphs into effective one-dimensional chains, which themselves exhibit conventional Anderson localisation. The interplay between the exponential localisation of states on these chains, and the exponential growth of the number of sites with distance from the root, is the origin of the observed multifractality.</description>

      <title>The CP2K Program Package Made Simple</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: CP2K is a versatile open-source software package for simulations across a wide range of atomistic systems, from isolated molecules in the gas phase to low-dimensional functional materials and interfaces, as well as highly symmetric crystalline solids, disordered amorphous glasses, and weakly interacting soft-matter systems in the liquid state and in solution. This review highlights CP2K's capabilities for computing both static and dynamical properties using quantum-mechanical and classical simulation methods. In contrast to the accompanying theory and code paper [J. Chem. Phys. 152, 194103 (2020)], the focus here is on the practical usage and applications of CP2K, with underlying theoretical concepts introduced only as needed.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium protein complexes as molecular automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biology stores information and computes at the molecular scale, yet the ways in which it does so are often distinct from human-engineered computers. Mapping biological computation onto architectures familiar to computer science remains an outstanding challenge. Here, inspired by Crick's proposal for molecular memory, we analyse a thermodynamically-consistent model of a protein complex subject to driven, nonequilibrium enzymatic reactions. In the strongly driven limit, we find that the system maps onto a stochastic, asynchronous variant of cellular automata, where each rule corresponds to a different set of enzymes being present. We find a broad class of phenomena in these 'molecular automata' that can be exploited for molecular computation, including error-tolerant memory via multistable attractors, and long transients that can be used as molecular stopwatches. By systematically enumerating all possible dynamical rules, we identify those that allow molecular automata to implement simple computational architectures such as finite-state machines. Overall, our results provide a framework for engineering synthetic molecular automata, and offer a route to building protein-based computation in living cells.</description>

      <title>Irreversibility and symmetry breaking in the creation and annihilation of defects in active living matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active living matter continuously creates and annihilates topological defects in a process that remains poorly understood. Here, we investigate these dynamics in two distinct active living systems, swarming bacteria and human bronchial epithelial cells. Despite their entirely different evolutionary origins, biological functions, and physical scales, both systems exhibit half-integer defects, consistent with the nematic phase. However, in contrast to active nematic theory, we find that defect creation and annihilation undergoes spatial symmetry breaking. We propose that this results from a fundamental dualism between nematic structural organization and generated polar forces, which are intrinsic to living systems. Furthermore, our estimation of entropy production reveals that creation and annihilation are not reversed processes. Our findings challenge conventional nematic models and emphasize the role of defect-mediated dynamics in non-equilibrium biological systems as a major source of entropy production.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop the cluster expansion for the multidimensional multiscaled contours defined by three of us. These contours are suitable for long-range Ising models with interaction $J_{xy}=J(|x-y|)= J/|x-y|^\alpha$, $J&gt;0$, and $\alpha&gt;d$. As an application of the convergence of the cluster expansion at low temperatures, we study the decay of the truncated two-point correlation functions, showing that the decay is algebraic with coefficient $\alpha$.</description>

      <title>Skyrmion Lattice Order Controlled by Confinement Geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic skyrmions forming two-dimensional (2D) lattices provide a versatile platform for investigating phase transitions predicted by Kosterlitz-Thouless-Halperin-Nelson-Young (KTHNY) theory. While 2D melting in skyrmion systems has been demonstrated, achieving controlled ordering in skyrmion lattices remains challenging due to pinning effects from a non-uniform energy landscape, which often results in polycrystalline structures. Skyrmions in thin films, however, offer thermal diffusion with high tunability and can be directly imaged via Kerr microscopy, enabling real-time observation of their dynamics. To regulate lattice order in such flexible systems, we introduce geometric confinements of varying shapes. Combining Kerr microscopy experiments with Thiele model simulations, we demonstrate that confinement geometry critically influences lattice order. Specifically, hexagonal confinements commensurate with the skyrmion lattice stabilize monodomain hexagonal ordering, while incommensurate geometries induce domain formation and reduce overall order. Understanding these boundary-driven effects is essential for advancing the study of 2D phase behavior and for the design of skyrmion-based spintronic applications, ranging from memory devices to unconventional computing architectures.</description>

      <title>Scale locality of information flow in shell models of turbulence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20572v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Turbulent fluctuations exhibit universal scaling laws that are independent of large-scale statistics. It is often explained that such universality is caused by the loss of information about large-scale statistics during the cascade process. In our previous study [T. Tanogami and R. Araki, Phys. Rev. Research 6, 013090 (2024)], we applied information thermodynamics to turbulence and proved that information of large-scale turbulent fluctuations is propagated to small scales. As a first step toward understanding how universality emerges at small scales under the influence of the information flow from large scales, here we investigate the scale locality of the information flow for shell models. First, we analytically show that the information flow can be decomposed into scale-local and scale-nonlocal parts. Then, by assuming the Kolmogorov hypothesis for the Kolmogorov multiplier, we prove that the scale-nonlocal part can be ignored compared to the scale-local part. This result implies that the information transfer from large to small scales occurs mainly through scale-local interactions, which is consistent with the scale locality of the energy cascade.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16002v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fluctuating hydrodynamics provides a framework connecting mesoscopic fluctuations with macroscopic transport behavior. To bridge mesoscopic and macroscopic transport from microscopic dynamics, we introduce a wavenumber-dependent viscosity, defined via the equilibrium correlation of time-averaged Fourier components of the fine-grained shear stress field, as a finite-wavevector extension of the Green--Kubo formula. Two-dimensional molecular dynamics simulations reveal its small-wavenumber divergence characteristic of the renormalized viscosity, while its large-wavenumber behavior determines the bare viscosity, thereby establishing a link between mesoscopic and macroscopic transport based on microscopic dynamics.</description>

      <title>Phase Transitions in Multidimensional Long-Range Random Field Ising Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.14150v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend a recent argument by Ding and Zhuang from nearest-neighbor to long-range interactions and prove the phase transition in a class of ferromagnetic random field Ising models. Our proof combines a generalization of Fr\"ohlich-Spencer contours to the multidimensional setting, proposed by two of us, with the coarse-graining procedure introduced by Fisher, Fr\"ohlich, and Spencer. Our result shows that the Ding-Zhuang strategy is also useful for interactions $J_{xy}=|x-y|^{- \alpha}$ when $\alpha &gt; d$ in dimension $d\geq 3$ if we have a suitable system of contours, yielding an alternative approach that does not use the Renormalization Group Method (RGM), since Bricmont and Kupiainen suggested that the RGM should also work on this generality. We can consider i.i.d. random fields with Gaussian or Bernoulli distributions.</description>

      <title>Constructing the Infrared Conformal Generators on the Fuzzy Sphere</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02998v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the conformal algebra on the fuzzy sphere, and in particular the generators of translations and special conformal transformations which are emergent symmetries in the infinite IR but are broken along the RG flow. We show how to extract these generators using the energy momentum tensor, which is complicated by the fact that one does not have a priori access to the energy momentum tensor of the CFT limit but rather must construct it numerically. We discuss and quantitatively analyze the main sources of corrections to the conformal generators due to the breaking of scale-invariance at finite energy, and develop efficient methods for removing these corrections. The resulting generators have matrix elements that match CFT predictions with accuracy varying from sub-percent level for the lowest-lying states up to several percent accuracy for states with dimension $\sim 5$ with $N=16$ fermions. We show that the generators can be used to accurately identify primary operators vs descendant operators in energy ranges where the spectrum is too dense to do the identification solely based on the approximate integer spacing within conformal multiplets.</description>

      <title>Discontinuous phase transition of feature detection in lateral predictive coding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12139v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The brain may adopt the strategy of lateral predictive coding (LPC) to construct optimal internal representations for salient features in input sensory signals, reducing the energetic cost of information transmission. Here we first consider the task of detecting one non-Gaussian signal by LPC from Gaussian background signals of the same magnitude, which is intractable by principal component decomposition. We study the emergence of feature detection function from the perspective of tradeoff between energetic cost $E$ and information robustness, and implement this tradeoff by a thermodynamic free energy. We define $E$ as the mean $L_1$-norm of the internal state vectors, and quantify the level of information robustness by an entropy measure $S$. There are at least three types of optimal LPC matrices, one type with very weak synaptic weights and $S \approx 0$, and two functional types either with low energy $E$ or with high entropy $S$ in which one single unit selectively responds to the non-Gaussian input feature. Energy--information tradeoff induce two discontinuous phase transitions between these three types of optimal LPC networks. We then extend the discussion to detecting and distinguishing between two non-Gaussian input features and observe similar discontinuous phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Quantum natural gradient with thermal-state initialization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19487v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) are central to variational quantum algorithms (VQAs), yet their performance is hindered by complex loss landscapes that make their trainability challenging. Quantum natural gradient descent, which leverages the geometry of the parameterized space through quantum generalizations of the Fisher information matrix, offers a promising solution but has been largely limited to pure-state scenarios, with only approximate methods available for mixed-state settings. This paper addresses this question, originally posed in [Stokes et al., Quantum 4, 269 (2020)], by providing exact methods to compute three quantum generalizations of the Fisher information matrix-the Fisher-Bures, Wigner-Yanase, and Kubo-Mori information matrices-for PQCs initialized with thermal states. We prove that these matrix elements can be estimated using quantum algorithms combining the Hadamard test, classical random sampling, and Hamiltonian simulation. By broadening the set of quantum generalizations of Fisher information and realizing their unbiased estimation, our results enable the implementation of quantum natural gradient descent algorithms for mixed-state PQCs, thereby enhancing the flexibility of optimization when using VQAs. Another immediate consequence of our findings is to establish fundamental limitations on the ability to estimate the parameters of a state generated by an unknown PQC, when given sample access to such a state.</description>

      <title>A theory of ecological invasions and its implications for eco-evolutionary dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10865v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Predicting the outcomes of species invasions is a central goal of ecology, a task made especially challenging due to ecological feedbacks. To address this, we develop a general theory of ecological invasions applicable to a wide variety of ecological models: including Lotka-Volterra models, consumer resource models, and models with cross feeding. Importantly, our framework remains valid even when invading evolved (non-random) communities and accounts for invasion-driven species extinctions. We derive analytical expressions relating invasion fitness to invader abundance, shifts in the community, and extinction probabilities. These results can be understood through a new quantity we term ``dressed invasion fitness'', which augments the traditional notion of invasion fitness by incorporating ecological feedbacks. We apply our theory to analyze short-term evolutionary dynamics through a series of invasions by mutants whose traits are correlated with an existing parent. We demonstrate that, generically, mutants and parents can coexist, often by driving the extinction of low-abundance species. We validate theoretical predictions against experimental datasets spanning ecosystems from plants to microbial protists. Our work highlights the central role of ecological feedbacks in shaping community responses to invasions and mutations, suggesting that parent-mutant coexistence is widespread in eco-evolutionary dynamics.</description>

      <title>Large $N$ Wess-Zumino model at finite temperature and large chemical potential in $3d$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17999v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the supersymmetric Wess-Zumino model at large $N$ in $(2+1)$ dimension. We introduce a chemical potential($\mu$) at finite temperature($T$). The non-trivial fixed point of this model is described by a pair of coupled gap equations. This fixed point behaves as a thermal CFT for all values of the coupling. We find that at large chemical potential these coupled equations simplify and solutions become analytically tractable. We solve them analytically for all values of the coupling at this limit. The solutions admit a systematic series expansion in $\frac{T}{\mu}$. Thus, using the solutions of the gap equation at large chemical potential we can evaluate the analytic form of the partition function, stress tensor and spin-1 current as a perturbative expansion in orders of $\frac{T}{\mu}$. Applying the OPE inversion formula on the scalar and fermion two point functions of the theory, we compute higher spin currents at large $\mu$.</description>

      <title>Measurement-Based Quantum Diffusion Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08799v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce measurement-based quantum diffusion models that bridge classical and quantum diffusion theory through randomized weak measurements. The measurement-based approach naturally generates stochastic quantum trajectories while preserving purity at the trajectory level and inducing depolarization at the ensemble level. We address two quantum state generation problems: trajectory-level recovery of pure state ensembles and ensemble-average recovery of mixed states. For trajectory-level recovery, we establish that quantum score matching is mathematically equivalent to learning unitary generators for the reverse process. For ensemble-average recovery, we introduce local Petz recovery maps for states with finite correlation length and classical shadow reconstruction for general states, both with rigorous error bounds. Our framework establishes Petz recovery maps as quantum generalizations of reverse Fokker-Planck equations, providing a rigorous bridge between quantum recovery channels and classical stochastic reversals. This work enables new approaches to quantum state generation with potential applications in quantum information science.</description>
